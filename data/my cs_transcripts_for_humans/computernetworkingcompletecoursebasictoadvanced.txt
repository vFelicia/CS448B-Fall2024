00:06 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
00:09 - Pit's session on the introduction to
00:12 - network devices part one today we're
00:16 - going to be talking about layer one
00:18 - devices layer 2 devices and then we're
00:21 - going to conclude with layer three
00:24 - devices there's a fair amount of
00:26 - information to cover so let's go ahead
00:29 - and dive in into this
00:31 - session of course I'm going to begin
00:34 - with layer one
00:36 - devices well before I start talking
00:38 - about the layer one devices we need to
00:41 - talk about the Open System
00:44 - interconnection model The OSI model it
00:47 - was developed as a way to help disparate
00:50 - Computing systems to communicate with
00:53 - each other the OSI reference model has
00:56 - seven layers layer one is the physical
00:59 - layer Layer Two two is data link Layer
01:01 - Three is Network layer four is transport
01:04 - layer five is session layer six is
01:07 - presentation and layer seven is
01:10 - application we're going to be discussing
01:13 - the bottom three layers layers one two
01:16 - and three today now most devices do
01:19 - function at more than one layer of the
01:22 - OSI reference model but when it comes
01:25 - time to determining where they fit into
01:28 - the model you must first determine the
01:30 - highest level at which they operate
01:33 - because that's where they fit into the
01:35 - OSI model to do that you must know what
01:39 - they do and how that relates to the OSI
01:41 - model and with that let's talk about
01:44 - analog modems the word modem is actually
01:48 - derived from contraction of modulator
01:52 - demodulator modems were developed to
01:54 - take a digital signal coming from a
01:57 - digital node and convert it to an analog
02:00 - signal modulating the signal and placing
02:03 - it on a wire in return it would accept
02:07 - an analog signal from The Wire and
02:09 - convert it demodulating the signal back
02:13 - to a digital signal that the node can
02:16 - understand modems were developed to
02:19 - create a connection between Network
02:21 - segments via the public switched
02:24 - telephone network using the plain old
02:27 - telephone system now modem provide for a
02:30 - single connection to a network and
02:33 - they're only concerned about the wire
02:36 - and the wire resides on the physical
02:40 - layer layer one of the OSI model it
02:43 - doesn't care where the signal comes from
02:46 - it just does its job then there's the
02:49 - Hub a hub functions as a concentrator or
02:53 - repeater in that it doesn't care where
02:55 - the signal comes from or where the
02:57 - signal is going kind of like the modem
03:00 - it takes an electrical signal that
03:02 - arrives on a port and replicates that
03:05 - signal out all of its other ports a hub
03:09 - may have just a few ports or it may have
03:11 - many ports and for a variety of reasons
03:15 - The Hub is not very common anymore in
03:18 - the modern Network so now let's move on
03:21 - to Layer Two
03:23 - devices the first layer 2 device that
03:26 - we're going to talk about is the switch
03:28 - a switch you I izes an application
03:31 - specific integrated circuit chip an Asic
03:35 - chip the Asic chip has specific
03:39 - programming that allows the switch to
03:41 - learn when a device is on the network
03:44 - and which ports it is connected to Via
03:47 - that devic's layer 2 Mac address that's
03:52 - what makes a switch a layer 2 device a
03:56 - switch may have just a few ports or it
03:58 - may have Min ports kind of like the Hub
04:02 - and although a switch is smarter than a
04:04 - hub it can still be very simple or it
04:06 - can be highly complex and programmable a
04:10 - switch can only communicate with local
04:13 - network
04:14 - devices another layer 2 device that we
04:17 - need to talk about are wireless access
04:20 - points the WAP a WAP is a specific type
04:25 - of network bridge that connects or
04:27 - Bridges wireless network segments with
04:30 - wired Network segments the most common
04:34 - type of WAP Bridges an
04:36 - 802.11 wireless network segment with an
04:41 - 802.3 Ethernet Network segment just like
04:44 - a switch a wireless access point will
04:47 - only communicate with local network
04:51 - devices now let's move on to layer three
04:55 - devices and first up is the multi-layer
04:58 - switch a multi-layer switch provides
05:02 - normal layer 2 Network switching
05:05 - services but it will also provide layer
05:08 - three or higher OSI model Services the
05:12 - most common multi-layer switch is a
05:15 - layer three switch it not only utilizes
05:19 - an Asic chip for switching but that Asic
05:22 - chip is also programmed to handle
05:25 - routing functions this allows the device
05:28 - to communicate and pass data to nonlocal
05:32 - network devices a multi-layer switch is
05:36 - a highly programmable and complex
05:38 - Network device a multi-layer switch may
05:42 - have just a few ports or it may have a
05:45 - lot of ports they're not very common in
05:48 - the small office home office Network
05:51 - because they're really really expensive
05:55 - you're more likely to find them in an
05:57 - Enterprise local area Network now let's
06:01 - move on to the router a router is the
06:04 - most common Network device for
06:07 - connecting different networks together
06:10 - utilizing the OSI models layer three
06:15 - logical Network information that's what
06:18 - makes a router a layer 3 device the
06:21 - router uses software programming for
06:24 - decision making as compared to the
06:26 - switch's use of an ASAC chip the router
06:30 - uses this programming to keep track of
06:33 - different networks and what it considers
06:36 - to be the best possible route to reach
06:39 - those networks a router can communicate
06:42 - with both local and nonlocal network
06:47 - devices in most cases a router will have
06:51 - fewer ports than a
06:54 - switch now that concludes this session
06:57 - on the introduction to network devices
07:00 - part one we talked about layer one
07:03 - devices we talked about layer 2 devices
07:07 - and we concluded with a couple of layer
07:09 - three devices now on behalf of pace it
07:13 - thank you for watching this session and
07:15 - I'm pretty certain I'll do another
07:20 - one good day I'm Brian Ferell and
07:24 - welcome to Pace's session on
07:27 - introduction to network devices part two
07:30 - today we're going to discuss some
07:32 - security network devices and then we'll
07:35 - move on to some optimization and
07:38 - performance devices and with that let's
07:41 - go ahead and begin this
07:43 - session and we will Begin by talking
07:46 - about security
07:48 - devices first up is the firewall now a
07:52 - firewall can be placed on routers or
07:55 - hosts in that it can be software based
07:58 - or it can be its own device a firewall
08:02 - functions at multiple layers of the OSI
08:05 - model specifically at layers 2 3 4 and 7
08:11 - a firewall can block packets from
08:14 - entering or leaving the network and it
08:17 - does this through one of two methods it
08:19 - can do it through stateless inspection
08:22 - in which the firewall will examine every
08:25 - packet that enters or leaves the
08:28 - networks against a set of rules once the
08:32 - packet matches a rule the rule is
08:34 - enforced and the specified action is
08:37 - taken or it may use State full
08:41 - inspection this is when a firewall will
08:43 - only examine the state of a connection
08:46 - between networks specifically when a
08:49 - connection is made from an internal
08:52 - Network to an external network the
08:55 - firewall will not examine any packets
08:58 - returning from the external connection
09:01 - it only cares about the state of the
09:04 - connection as a general rule external
09:07 - connections are not allowed to be
09:11 - initiated with the internal Network now
09:14 - firewalls are the first line of defense
09:17 - in protecting the internal network from
09:20 - outside threats you can consider the
09:22 - firewall to be the police force of the
09:26 - network then there is the intrusion
09:29 - detection system the IDS an IDs is a
09:33 - passive system designed to identify when
09:36 - a network breach or attack against the
09:39 - network is occurring they're usually
09:42 - designed to inform a network
09:43 - administrator when a breach or attack
09:46 - has occurred and it does this through
09:48 - log files text messages and or through
09:52 - email notifications an IDs cannot
09:56 - prevent or stop a breach or attack on on
09:59 - its own the IDS receives a copy of all
10:03 - traffic and evaluates it against a set
10:05 - of Standards the standards that it used
10:08 - may be signature-based this is when it
10:11 - evaluates Network traffic for known
10:14 - malware or attack signatures or the
10:17 - standard may be anomaly based this is
10:20 - where it evaluates Network traffic for
10:22 - suspicious changes or it may be policy
10:26 - based this is where it evaluates networ
10:29 - traffic against a specific declared
10:32 - security policy an IDs may be deployed
10:36 - at the host level when it's deployed at
10:39 - the host level it's called a host based
10:43 - intrusion detection system or heads more
10:47 - potent than the intrusion detection
10:49 - system is the intrusion prevention
10:52 - system the IPS an IPS is an active
10:57 - system designed to stop a breach or
11:00 - attack from succeeding in damaging the
11:03 - network they're usually designed to
11:05 - perform an action or set of actions to
11:08 - stop the malicious activity they will
11:12 - also inform a network administrator
11:15 - through the use of log files SMS text
11:19 - messaging and or through email
11:21 - notification for an IPS to work all
11:25 - traffic on the network segment needs to
11:27 - flow through the IPS as it enters and
11:31 - leaves the network segment like the IDS
11:35 - all of the traffic is evaluated against
11:38 - a set of standards and they're the same
11:40 - standards that are used on the IDS the
11:43 - best placement on the network segment is
11:46 - between a router with a firewall
11:49 - hopefully and the destination Network
11:52 - segment that way all the traffic flows
11:55 - through the IPS ipss are programed
11:58 - programmed to make an active response to
12:02 - the situation they can block the
12:05 - offending IP address they can close down
12:08 - vulnerable interfaces they can terminate
12:11 - Network sessions they can redirect the
12:14 - attack plus there are more actions that
12:17 - an IPS can take the main thing is is
12:20 - that they are designed to be active to
12:23 - stop the breach or attack from
12:25 - succeeding and damaging your network
12:28 - let's move move on to the virtual
12:30 - private Network concentrator the VPN
12:33 - concentrator now this will allow for
12:36 - many secure VPN connections to a network
12:40 - the concentrator will provide proper
12:42 - tunneling and encryption depending upon
12:45 - the type of VPN connection that is
12:48 - allowed to the network most
12:51 - concentrators can function at multiple
12:53 - layers of the OSI model specifically
12:57 - they can operate at layer 2 layer three
13:00 - and layer 7 now outside of Internet
13:03 - transactions which use an SSL VPN
13:07 - connection at layer 7 most concentrators
13:11 - will function at the network layer or
13:13 - layer three of the OSI model providing
13:17 - IP SEC encryption through a secure
13:21 - tunnel now let's talk about optimization
13:24 - and performance
13:27 - devices we will begin by talking about
13:30 - the load balancer a load balancer may
13:33 - also be called a Content switch or
13:36 - content filter it's a network appliance
13:40 - that is used to load balance between
13:42 - multiple hosts that contain the same
13:45 - data this spreads out the workload for
13:48 - greater efficiency they're commonly used
13:51 - to distribute the requests or workload
13:55 - to a server Farm among the various ser
13:58 - servers in the farm helping to ensure
14:01 - that no single server gets overloaded
14:04 - with work requests then there's the
14:07 - proxy server a proxy server is an
14:11 - appliance that requests resources on
14:14 - behalf of a client machine it's often
14:17 - used to retrieve resources from outside
14:21 - untrusted networks on behalf of the
14:24 - requesting client it hides and protects
14:27 - that requesting client from the outside
14:30 - untrusted Network it can also be
14:33 - utilized to filter allowed content back
14:37 - into the trusted Network it can also
14:40 - increase Network performance by caching
14:43 - or saving commonly requested web pages
14:48 - now that concludes this session on the
14:51 - introduction to network devices part two
14:55 - we talked about some security devices
14:58 - that you may find on your network and we
15:01 - concluded with optimization and
15:03 - performance devices that may also be
15:07 - present now on behalf of pit thank you
15:10 - for watching this session and I'm sure
15:13 - I'll do another one
15:16 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
15:20 - to pait's session on networking services
15:24 - and applications part one today I'm
15:26 - going to be discussing the basics of the
15:28 - virtual private Network and then I'm
15:31 - going to move on to protocols used by
15:34 - virtual private networks now there's a
15:36 - whole lot of stuff to cover so let's go
15:39 - ahead and begin this session of course
15:42 - I'm going to begin by talking about the
15:44 - basics of the virtual private Network a
15:47 - virtual private Network or VPN is used
15:51 - by remote hosts to access a private
15:54 - Network through an encrypted tunnel
15:57 - through a public network once the VPN
16:00 - connection is made the remote host is no
16:02 - longer considered remote it's actually
16:05 - seen by the private Network as being a
16:08 - local host there are many advantages to
16:10 - that but I'm not going to cover them
16:12 - right now even though the network
16:14 - traffic may pass through many different
16:16 - routes or systems it's seen by both ends
16:20 - as being a direct connection the use of
16:23 - the VPN can help to reduce networking
16:26 - costs for organizations and business
16:28 - business the cost reduction is partially
16:31 - achieved because the VPN doesn't require
16:34 - the use of a dedicated least line to
16:38 - create that direct
16:39 - connection there are several different
16:42 - types of vpns there is the sight to
16:45 - sight VPN which allows a remote sites
16:48 - Network to connect to the main sites
16:51 - Network and be seen as a local network
16:54 - segment VPN concentrators on both ends
16:58 - of the the VPN will manage that
17:00 - connection then there's the Remote
17:03 - Access VPN which is also called a host
17:06 - to site VPN it allows select remote
17:10 - users to connect to the local network a
17:13 - VPN concentrator on the local network
17:16 - will manage the connection coming in
17:18 - from the remote users the remote system
17:21 - making the connection uses special
17:24 - software called VPN client software to
17:27 - make that connection
17:29 - the third type of VPN is the host to
17:32 - host VPN which is often called an
17:36 - sslvpn it allows a secure connection
17:40 - between two systems without the use of
17:43 - VPN client software a VPN concentrator
17:47 - on the local network manages the
17:49 - connection the host seeking to connect
17:53 - uses a web browser that supports the
17:55 - correct encryption technology which is
17:58 - either either SSL or more likely TLS to
18:01 - make the connection to the VPN
18:05 - concentrator it's time to discuss some
18:07 - protocols used by the virtual private
18:10 - Network the big protocol for vpns is
18:14 - called Internet Protocol security IP SEC
18:18 - which isn't actually a protocol in
18:20 - itself but a whole set of protocols IPC
18:23 - works at layer three of the OSI model or
18:26 - above it's the most common Suite of
18:29 - protocols used to secure a VPN
18:32 - connection ipet can be used with the
18:35 - authentication header protocol or the ah
18:38 - protocol ah only offers authentication
18:42 - services but no encryption so it
18:45 - authenticates the user but there is no
18:47 - encryption of the session or ipset can
18:51 - be used with encapsulating security
18:53 - payload protocol or the ESP protocol ESP
18:58 - both authenticates and encrypts the
19:01 - packets it is the most popular method of
19:04 - securing a VPN connection both ah and
19:08 - ESP will operate in one of two modes the
19:12 - first mode is transparent mode that is
19:15 - between two devices as in a host to host
19:18 - VPN or they can be used in tunnel mode
19:21 - which is between two endpoints as in a
19:24 - sight tosite VPN IPC implements Internet
19:29 - Security Association and Key Management
19:32 - Isa Camp by default Isa Camp provides a
19:36 - method for transferring security key and
19:39 - authentication data between systems
19:42 - outside of the security key generating
19:45 - process it is a much more secure process
19:50 - then we have generic routing
19:52 - encapsulation gr GRE is a tunneling
19:56 - protocol that is capable of encaps
19:58 - capsulating a wide variety of other
20:01 - network layer protocols it's often used
20:04 - to create a sub tunnel within an IPC
20:08 - connection why is that well IPC will
20:11 - only transmit unicast packets that's
20:15 - onetoone communication in many cases
20:18 - there's a need to transmit multicast
20:21 - which is one to some communication or
20:24 - broadcast which is one to many
20:27 - communication packets across an ipset
20:30 - Connection by using gr we can get that
20:34 - accomplished then there's Point to-point
20:36 - tunneling protocol
20:39 - pptp this is an older VPN technology
20:43 - that supports dialup VPN connections on
20:47 - its own it lacked native security
20:49 - features so it wasn't very secure but
20:53 - Microsoft's implementation included
20:55 - additional security by adding GR e to
20:59 - point-to-point tunneling protocol
21:02 - transport layer security is another
21:05 - common VPN protocol TLS is a
21:09 - cryptographic protocol used to create a
21:12 - secure encrypted connection between two
21:15 - in devices or applications it uses
21:19 - asymmetrical cryptography to
21:21 - authenticate endpoints and then
21:24 - negotiates a symmetrical security key
21:27 - which is to encrypt the session TLS has
21:31 - largely replaced its cousin secure
21:34 - socket layer protocol and TLS works at
21:37 - layer five and above of the OSI model
21:41 - its most common usage is in creating a
21:44 - secure encrypted internet session or
21:48 - sslvpn all modern web browsers support
21:52 - TLS now I just mentioned secure socket
21:56 - layer or SSL SSL is an older
22:00 - cryptographic protocol that is very
22:02 - similar to TLS the most common use is in
22:06 - Internet transactions why because all
22:09 - modern web browsers support SSL but due
22:14 - to issues with earlier versions of the
22:16 - protocol it has largely been replaced by
22:20 - TLS SSL version 3.3 has been developed
22:24 - to address the weaknesses of earlier
22:28 - versions but it may never again catch up
22:31 - to its cousin the TLs protocol now that
22:36 - concludes this session on networking
22:38 - services and applications part one I
22:42 - talked about the basics of the virtual
22:44 - private Network and then I talked about
22:47 - the protocols used by the VPN network on
22:51 - behalf of pace it thank you for watching
22:54 - this session and I look forward to doing
22:56 - another soon
23:03 - good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to
23:06 - pait's session on networking services
23:09 - and applications part two today we're
23:12 - going to be discussing network access
23:14 - services and then we're going to move on
23:17 - to other services and
23:19 - applications as always there's a fair
23:21 - amount of ground to cover so let's go
23:24 - ahead and dive into this session I will
23:27 - be begin with network access
23:30 - Services the first network access
23:33 - service that I'm going to discuss is
23:35 - actually a piece of Hardware the network
23:38 - interface controller or Nick it can also
23:41 - be called the network interface card the
23:44 - Nick is how a device connects to a
23:47 - network the network interface controller
23:50 - works at two layers of the OSI model at
23:53 - Layer Two which is the data link layer
23:56 - it provides the functional means of
23:59 - network communication by determining
24:02 - which networking protocols will be used
24:05 - as in a Nick that will provide ethernet
24:07 - communication or a Nick that will
24:09 - provide point-to-point
24:11 - protocol it also provides the local
24:14 - network node address through its burned
24:17 - in physical media Access Control address
24:22 - at layer one the physical layer the
24:25 - network interface controller determines
24:28 - how the network data traffic will be
24:30 - converted a bit at a time into an
24:33 - electrical signal that can Traverse the
24:35 - network media being used I.E it provides
24:39 - the connection to the network most
24:42 - modern computers come with at least one
24:44 - built-in ethernet Nick routers and other
24:48 - network devices may use separate modules
24:52 - that can be inserted into the device to
24:54 - provide the proper network interface
24:57 - controller
24:58 - for the type of media they're connecting
25:00 - to and the networking protocols that are
25:04 - being used another network access
25:07 - service is radius remote authentication
25:11 - dial-in user service radius is a remote
25:16 - access service that is used to
25:18 - authenticate remote users and Grant them
25:21 - access to authorized network resources
25:24 - it is a popular AAA protocol that's
25:28 - authentication authorization and
25:31 - accounting protocol it's used to help
25:34 - ensure that only authenticated end users
25:37 - are using the network resources they are
25:40 - authorized to use the accounting
25:43 - services of radius are very robust the
25:46 - only drawback to radius is only the
25:50 - requesters the end users password is
25:53 - encrypted everything else gets sent in
25:56 - the clear terminal Access Controller
25:59 - access control system Plus or Taca plus
26:03 - terminal Access
26:07 - Controller hello I'm Brian frell and
26:11 - welcome to pait's session on
26:14 - DHCP in the network today we're going to
26:17 - be talking about static versus Dynamic
26:20 - IP addressing then we're going to move
26:23 - on to how DHCP works and then we will
26:26 - conclude with components and processes
26:30 - of
26:32 - DHCP and with that let's go ahead and
26:35 - begin this session and of course we
26:38 - begin by talking about static versus
26:41 - Dynamic IP addressing so how does a
26:45 - computer know what its IP configuration
26:48 - is well more than likely a computer
26:52 - received its IP configuration from a
26:55 - dynamic host configuration protoc call
26:58 - server not only did the server give the
27:01 - PC an IP address but it also told the PC
27:05 - where the default gateway was and more
27:07 - than likely how to find a DNS server a
27:11 - computer will receive its IP
27:14 - configuration in one of two ways either
27:17 - statically which means manually set or
27:20 - dynamically which means through a
27:23 - service like
27:24 - thcp static IP addresses assignment
27:28 - works fine for very small and stable
27:31 - networks but quickly becomes unwieldly
27:34 - and error prone as the network grows and
27:37 - more nodes come onto the network so
27:40 - let's talk a little bit more about
27:42 - static IP addressing the administrator
27:45 - assigns an IP number in subnet mask to
27:48 - each host in the network whether it be a
27:51 - PC router or some other piece of
27:55 - electronic equipment each networ network
27:57 - interface that is going to be available
27:59 - to connect to the network requires this
28:03 - information the administrator also
28:05 - assigns a default gateway location and
28:09 - DNS server location to each host in the
28:12 - network now these settings are required
28:15 - if access to outside networks is going
28:17 - to be allowed that would be through the
28:19 - default gateway and if humanfriendly
28:22 - naming conventions are going to be
28:24 - allowed and that way you can more easily
28:26 - find network resources and that would be
28:29 - through a DNS server now each time A
28:32 - Change Is made as in a new default
28:34 - gateway is established each IP
28:37 - configuration on each host must be
28:41 - updated that's why it becomes rather
28:43 - cumbersome and complicated as the
28:46 - network grows now with Dynamic IP
28:49 - addressing the administrator configures
28:51 - a DHCP server to handle the assignment
28:55 - process which actually automates the
28:57 - process and eases management the DHCP
29:01 - server listens on a specific port for IP
29:05 - information requests once it receives a
29:08 - request the DHCP server responds with
29:12 - the required information now let's move
29:15 - on to how
29:16 - DHCP works here is the typical DHCP
29:22 - process upon bootup a PC that is
29:24 - configured to request an IP config
29:27 - configuration sends a
29:29 - DHCP Discovery packet now the discovery
29:33 - packet is sent to the broadcast address
29:41 - 255.255.255.0 on UDP Port 67 the DHCP
29:46 - server is listening to that Port it's
29:49 - listening for that Discovery packet when
29:52 - the DHCP server receives the discovery
29:55 - packet it responds with an offer pack
29:57 - packet basically saying hey I'm here to
30:00 - help now the offer packet is sent back
30:03 - to the MAC address of the computer
30:06 - requesting help and it's sent on Port 68
30:11 - once the computer receives that offer
30:14 - packet from the DHCP server if it's
30:16 - going to use that DHCP server it returns
30:20 - a request packet that means it's
30:23 - requesting the proper IP configuration
30:26 - from from that specific DHCP server once
30:31 - the DHCP server receives the request
30:34 - packet it sends back an acknowledgement
30:37 - packet now this acknowledgement packet
30:39 - contains all of the required IP
30:43 - configuration information once the PC
30:47 - receives the acknowledgement packet the
30:49 - PC changes its IP configuration to
30:53 - reflect the information that it received
30:56 - from the DHC P server and that's the
30:59 - typical
31:00 - DHCP process in a nutshell now let's
31:04 - talk about components and the process of
31:08 - DHCP we're going to begin by talking
31:10 - about the ports used now I already
31:13 - mentioned this once but I'm going to
31:14 - mention it again because you need to
31:17 - know this the PC sends its Discovery
31:20 - packet out on the broadcast address
31:27 - . 255 on Port 67 that's UDP Port 67 when
31:34 - the DHCP server responds it responds to
31:37 - the PC's Mac address media Access
31:41 - Control address on UDP Port 68 that's
31:47 - important to remember the PC uses UDP
31:50 - Port 67 the DHCP server responds on UDP
31:56 - Port 6 68 then there's the address scope
32:00 - the address scope is the IP address
32:03 - range that the administrator configures
32:07 - on the DHCP server it is the range of
32:11 - addresses that the DHCP server can hand
32:15 - out to individual nodes there's also
32:18 - what are called address reservations now
32:21 - these are administrator
32:23 - configured reserved IP addresses the
32:27 - administrator reserves specific IP
32:31 - addresses to be handed out to specific
32:35 - Mac addresses now these are used for
32:38 - devices that should always have the same
32:41 - IP address as in servers and routers if
32:45 - you didn't do that there is the
32:47 - possibility that your default gateways
32:50 - IP address might change now the reason
32:53 - we use address reservation is this
32:56 - allows the these addresses to be changed
32:59 - from a central location instead of
33:02 - having to log into each device and
33:05 - change the IP configuration separately
33:09 - now part of the DHCP process are what
33:12 - are called leases the DHCP server hands
33:16 - out that IP configuration information
33:19 - but it sets a time limit for how long
33:22 - that IP configuration is good this is
33:24 - called the lease so the parameters are
33:27 - are only good for a specified amount of
33:30 - time now the administrator can configure
33:33 - how long the leases are there are also
33:37 - options that the administrator can
33:39 - configure the first one that's pretty
33:42 - obvious is the default gateway location
33:45 - there's also the DNS server address and
33:49 - the administrator can configure more
33:52 - than one DNS server location an
33:55 - administrator can also Al configure an
33:58 - option for the PC to synchronize with a
34:02 - Time server so the administrator can
34:04 - configure a Time server address there
34:08 - are many more additional options but
34:11 - those are the big three that you should
34:13 - remember now when a PC boots up it does
34:17 - have a preferred IP address that would
34:20 - be the IP address that it had the last
34:22 - time it booted up now it can request
34:26 - that same i p configuration from the
34:29 - DHCP server now the administrator can
34:32 - configure the DHCP server to either
34:36 - honor that preference or to ignore it
34:39 - now under the right circumstances a DHCP
34:42 - server isn't required to reside on the
34:45 - local network segment now as a general
34:48 - rule broadcast Transmissions Cann not
34:51 - pass through a router but if there is
34:54 - not a DHCP server on the local network
34:58 - segment the router can be configured to
35:01 - be a DHCP relay when a DHCP
35:05 - relay also called an IP helper receives
35:09 - a discovery packet from a node it will
35:11 - forward that packet to the network
35:14 - segment on which the DHCP server resides
35:18 - this allows for there to be fewer
35:21 - configured DHCP servers in any given
35:24 - Network reducing the amount amount of
35:27 - Maintenance that an administrator needs
35:29 - to perform now that concludes this
35:32 - session on DHCP in the network we
35:36 - started with static versus Dynamic IP
35:40 - addressing and then we moved on to how
35:43 - DHCP works and we concluded with
35:46 - components and processes of
35:50 - DHCP now on behalf of pace it thank you
35:53 - for watching this session and I'm sure
35:55 - I'll do another one soon
36:09 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
36:12 - pait session on the introduction to the
36:16 - DNS service today we're going to be
36:18 - talking about DNS servers DNS records
36:22 - and we will conclude with a brief
36:24 - discussion on dynamic
36:27 - DNS and with that let's go ahead and
36:30 - begin this session we're going to begin
36:32 - this session with a talk about DNS
36:36 - servers now DNS is the process that Maps
36:40 - humanfriendly names as in
36:44 - www.google.com to their appropriate IP
36:47 - addresses without DNS we would have to
36:50 - memorize all of the IP addresses that we
36:54 - wished to visit now DNS stands for
36:58 - domain name system and it's very
37:01 - structured in nature if the local DNS
37:05 - server apparatus doesn't contain the
37:07 - needed record it sends the request up
37:11 - the DNS chain until a positive response
37:14 - is received back now this positive
37:17 - response gets passed back down to the
37:21 - original requestor now DNS does require
37:25 - that an fqdn fully qualified domain name
37:29 - is used in order for it to function
37:31 - properly now an
37:33 - fqdn is the
37:37 - www.google.com it's that naming
37:38 - convention right there the www is the
37:42 - specific service that's being requested
37:46 - the Google portion is the local domain
37:49 - that contains the specific service and
37:52 - the com is the top level that contains
37:56 - the the Google that contains the
37:58 - specific service that is an
38:02 - fqdn now that we've got that covered
38:05 - let's talk about the different levels of
38:08 - DNS servers first off there can be a
38:11 - local DNS server this is the server on
38:15 - the local network that contains the
38:17 - hosts file that maps all of the fqdn to
38:22 - their specific IP addresses in the local
38:25 - subdomain
38:27 - it may be present or it may not be
38:29 - present then there are top level domain
38:32 - servers the TLD server now these are the
38:36 - servers that contain the records for the
38:39 - top level domains examples of top level
38:43 - domains
38:44 - are.org
38:46 - net.edu so on and so forth now each of
38:50 - these servers contains all of their
38:52 - information for their respective domains
38:55 - kind of and what do I mean by kind of
38:57 - well the TLD servers do delegate down to
39:01 - second level servers their information
39:04 - they do that to ease the load so that
39:06 - the TLD server is not overloaded but the
39:11 - TLD server is the server that is
39:14 - responsible for maintaining the record
39:17 - then there's the root server this is the
39:19 - server that contains all of the records
39:23 - for the TLD servers so if you're looking
39:26 - for a TLD that is kind of unknown you
39:31 - will actually go to the root server
39:33 - which will then pass you onto the
39:36 - appropriate
39:37 - TLD then there are authoritative servers
39:40 - and non-authoritative servers an
39:43 - authoritative DNS server is one that
39:47 - responds to a request and that authorit
39:50 - server has been specifically configured
39:53 - to contain the requested information
39:57 - an authoritative response comes from a
40:00 - DNS server that actually holds the
40:03 - original record so an authoritative
40:06 - response comes from the name server
40:09 - that's been specifically configured to
40:12 - contain that record then there are
40:14 - non-authoritative DNS servers now a
40:18 - non-authoritative DNS server is one that
40:21 - responds to a to a request with DNS
40:24 - information that it received from
40:26 - another DNS server a non-authoritative
40:30 - response is not a response from the
40:33 - official name server for the domain
40:36 - instead it is a second or thirdhand
40:40 - response that's given back to the
40:42 - requester in most cases when we send a
40:45 - DNS request we get a non-authoritative
40:49 - response back now let's move on to the
40:53 - various DNS record types the first
40:57 - record that we're going to talk about is
40:59 - the a record now the a record Maps host
41:03 - names or
41:05 - fqdns to their respective ipv4 addresses
41:10 - closely associated with the a record is
41:14 - the
41:14 - AAAA record or quadruple a record this
41:19 - Maps the fqdn to its respective IPv6
41:24 - address then there's the C name record
41:28 - now this Maps a canonical name or Alias
41:32 - to a host name what that means is that
41:35 - you can have
41:37 - edcc.edu
41:38 - be the same as EDC dog without having to
41:44 - maintain two sites the
41:53 - edcc.edu this works in part because of
41:57 - the pointer record the PTR record it's a
42:00 - pointer record that points out to DNS
42:04 - that there is a canonical name and
42:07 - finally we have the MS record now this
42:10 - record maps to the email server that is
42:13 - specified for a specific domain it is
42:17 - the record that determines how email
42:20 - travels from sender to recipient and now
42:24 - let's move on to Dynamic
42:27 - DNS now Dynamic DNS or ddns permits
42:31 - lightweight and immediate updates to a
42:34 - local DNS database this is very useful
42:38 - for when the fqdn or host name Remains
42:41 - the Same but the IP address is able to
42:44 - change on a regular basis Dynamic DNS is
42:49 - implemented as an additional service to
42:52 - DNS and it's implemented through DD NS
42:56 - updating now this is a method of
42:59 - updating traditional name servers
43:01 - without the intervention of an
43:04 - administrator so there's no manual
43:06 - editing or inputting of the
43:08 - configuration files required a ddns
43:12 - provider supplies software that will
43:14 - monitor the IP address of the referenced
43:18 - system once the IP address changes the
43:21 - software sends an update to the proper
43:25 - DNS server
43:26 - ddns is useful for when access is needed
43:30 - to a domain whose IP address is being
43:33 - supplied dynamically by an ISP or
43:37 - Internet service provider that way the
43:40 - IP address can change but people can
43:43 - still get to the service that they're
43:45 - looking for now that concludes this
43:49 - session on the introduction to the DNS
43:53 - service we talked about DNS servers we
43:57 - moved on to DNS records and then we
44:00 - concluded with a very brief discussion
44:02 - about Dynamic DNS now on behalf of pace
44:06 - it thank you for watching this session
44:09 - and I'm pretty sure I'll do another one
44:21 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
44:25 - to Pace session introducing Network
44:28 - address
44:29 - translation today we're going to be
44:31 - talking about the purpose of network
44:34 - address translation and then we're going
44:36 - to discuss how Network address
44:39 - translation works and with that let's go
44:42 - ahead and begin this
44:44 - discussion of course we're going to
44:46 - begin by talking about the purpose of
44:50 - network address
44:52 - translation Network address translation
44:55 - or n solves a very serious problem of
44:59 - how to route non routable IP addresses
45:04 - as a partial effort to conserve the ipv4
45:08 - address space the private ipv4
45:11 - addressing spaces were developed these
45:15 - address spaces were removed from the
45:17 - public ipv4 address space and made non
45:21 - routable across public ipv4 network
45:26 - and this led to the problem being non
45:30 - routable prevents that private ipv4
45:33 - address from communicating with remote
45:37 - public networks natat very simply solves
45:41 - this problem a router with Nat enabled
45:45 - will translate a private IP address into
45:49 - a routable public IP address when the
45:53 - response returns to the router it passes
45:55 - passes the response back to the device
45:58 - that requested it so now that we've
46:01 - covered the purpose let's talk about how
46:04 - Network address translation works and
46:07 - first off we get to talk about the fact
46:09 - that there are two categories of net
46:12 - first up is static net with static net
46:16 - each private IP address is assigned to a
46:20 - specific routable public IP address this
46:24 - relationship is kept and maintained by
46:27 - the natat enabled router when a device
46:30 - needs access outside of the local
46:32 - network the router translates the local
46:35 - IP address to the assigned public IP
46:39 - address and when the response comes back
46:42 - the router will translate the public IP
46:44 - address back into a local one static n
46:49 - is not flexible and leads to some
46:52 - scalability issues an individual
46:56 - routable IP address must be kept for
46:59 - every device that requires access
47:01 - outside of the local network so as the
47:04 - network grows you need to increase the
47:07 - amount of public IP addresses that are
47:10 - under your control that gets kind of
47:13 - expensive and kind of
47:15 - complicated they developed Dynamic Gat
47:18 - to resolve some of that issue with
47:21 - Dynamic Gat the natat enabled router
47:24 - dynamically assigns a routable IP
47:27 - address to devices from a pool of
47:31 - available IP addresses when a device
47:34 - needs access outside of the local
47:37 - network the router performs the net
47:39 - function only the public IP address
47:42 - comes from a reusable pool of public IP
47:45 - addresses that private IP address is
47:48 - assigned the public IP address from the
47:51 - pool and once outside access is stopped
47:54 - the routable I IP address goes back into
47:57 - the pool to be reused as initially
48:00 - designed Dynamic Gat was more flexible
48:02 - than static n but it still led to some
48:05 - scalability issues as more Network
48:08 - traffic required access to outside
48:10 - networks the pool of available public IP
48:13 - addresses needs to increase or outside
48:17 - access cannot be achieved but thankfully
48:21 - there is a solution to this and that
48:24 - solution is called port address
48:27 - translation or in Cisco terms that would
48:30 - be natat with Pat Pat is a type of
48:34 - dynamic Gat that was developed to
48:36 - increase the scalability of network
48:39 - address translation when a local network
48:42 - device requires access to a public
48:44 - network the natat enabled router
48:47 - dynamically assigns the public IP
48:50 - address to the device with the addition
48:52 - of dynamically assigning a port number
48:55 - to the the end of the public IP address
48:58 - the router tracks the IP addresses and
49:01 - port numbers to ensure that Network
49:04 - traffic is routed to and from the proper
49:07 - devices Pat still requires a pool of
49:10 - public IP addresses but the pool may
49:13 - only contain one public IP address or it
49:17 - may contain several for a large private
49:20 - Network this is the preferred method of
49:23 - implementing Network address trans
49:25 - translation for two reasons first off
49:28 - there's less public IP addresses that
49:30 - are required and it makes it easier for
49:34 - an administrator to
49:36 - maintain now let's talk about natat
49:39 - terminology specifically about the types
49:42 - of addresses and we begin with the
49:45 - inside local address which is a private
49:48 - IP address on the local network it is
49:52 - the private IP address assigned to a
49:56 - specific device then there's the inside
49:59 - global address a public address
50:02 - referencing an inside device the inside
50:05 - global address is the public IP address
50:08 - assigned to the inside device by the
50:11 - natat enabled router allowing access
50:14 - outside of the network then there's the
50:17 - outside global address which is a public
50:20 - IP address referencing an outside device
50:24 - it is the public public IP address
50:27 - assigned to a device outside of the
50:30 - local network then there's the outside
50:33 - local address which is a private IP
50:36 - address assigned to an outside device
50:39 - this is the private IP address assigned
50:42 - to the outside device by the natat
50:45 - enabled router on the interior of the
50:48 - local network so that the inside device
50:52 - can communicate correctly with the
50:54 - outside device device now that concludes
50:57 - this session on introducing Network
51:00 - address
51:01 - translation we talked about the purpose
51:04 - of network address translation and then
51:07 - we talked about how Network address
51:10 - translation works on behalf of pacit
51:14 - thank you for watching this session and
51:16 - I look forward to doing another
51:24 - one
51:26 - good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to
51:29 - pait's session on Wan Technologies part
51:32 - one today I'm going to be talking about
51:35 - the public switched telephone Network
51:38 - then I'm going to move on to Broadband
51:40 - cable and I'm going to conclude with a
51:44 - brief section on fiber optics and with
51:47 - that let's go ahead and begin this
51:50 - session of course we begin with the
51:53 - public switched telephone Network
51:56 - before I begin with the public switch
51:58 - telephone Network let's talk about what
52:01 - makes a w a w as opposed to a lan well
52:06 - as a general rule if you own and control
52:09 - the line that the data is using to get
52:12 - from one place to another you are not
52:15 - using a wide area network or W
52:18 - technology on the other hand if you are
52:21 - using a form of transmission that you
52:24 - don't own as in you're leasing a line or
52:27 - you're paying for the use of it then you
52:29 - are likely using W technology one of the
52:33 - most common physical infrastructures
52:36 - used in Wan technology is the public
52:40 - switched telephone Network the pstn due
52:43 - to its widespread availability just
52:47 - about everybody has a telephone line
52:49 - being run to their house or to their
52:52 - building an older technology but still
52:55 - somewhat valid today for w technology is
52:59 - dialup now dialup utilizes the pstn to
53:03 - transmit Network traffic as an analog
53:06 - signal dialup does require an analog
53:10 - modem to format the network traffic
53:13 - correctly so it can be transmitted your
53:16 - maximum theoretical speed on dialup is
53:20 - 56 kilobits per second it's not very
53:23 - fast then there's ISDN Integrated
53:27 - Service digital Network ISDN is a
53:30 - digital point-to-point W technology that
53:34 - utilizes the pstn it's a completely
53:38 - digital service it requires the use of a
53:41 - terminal adapter or ta to make the
53:44 - connection to the end nodes this ta is
53:47 - often called a digital modem but it's
53:50 - not it's a terminal adapter ISDN can use
53:54 - a primary rate interface or pry now the
53:58 - pry is composed of
54:00 - 23 64 kilobit pers second B channels and
54:05 - one 64 kilobit pers second D channel
54:09 - that dchannel is used for call setup and
54:12 - Link management a pry can achieve
54:16 - 1.544 megabits per second speed and that
54:20 - is commonly referred to as a T1 least
54:24 - line the most commonly implemented form
54:27 - of an ISDN though is the Bri the basic
54:31 - rate interface it uses only two B
54:35 - channels and One D Channel and the bri
54:38 - can achieve speeds of up to 128 kilobits
54:42 - per second now ISDN is not as capable as
54:47 - a digital subscriber line or DSL but it
54:50 - can often be implemented Where DSL
54:53 - cannot be installed
54:56 - speaking about DSL let's move on to it
54:59 - xdsl is the term for generic DSL DSL is
55:04 - a digital when technology that utilizes
55:08 - the pstn DSL does require the use of a
55:12 - digital modem it uses a dedicated
55:15 - digital line between the endpoint and a
55:19 - class5 central office or Co now in order
55:22 - for the most basic forms of DSL to be
55:25 - installed you have to be within 18,000
55:29 - ft of the co DSL is capable of carrying
55:34 - voice and data when it does carry both
55:37 - filters are put in place in order for
55:40 - the voice signal to come through without
55:43 - any interference now let's move on to
55:46 - the different types of DSL and first up
55:49 - is symmetric DSL or
55:52 - sdsl symmetric DSL is synchronous in
55:56 - nature that means that the upload and
55:58 - download speeds are the same sdsl does
56:02 - not carry voice communication so if you
56:05 - need voice service an additional line is
56:08 - going to be needed sdsl is used by
56:11 - businesses that don't quite need the
56:13 - performance of a T1 least line but they
56:17 - do require the symmetrical upload and
56:19 - download speeds more common than sdsl is
56:24 - ADSL or asymmetric DSL it's asynchronous
56:28 - in nature that means that the upload
56:31 - speed is slower than the download speed
56:34 - ADSL can carry data and voice common
56:38 - upload speeds for ADSL are
56:41 - 768 kilobits per second with download
56:44 - speeds of up to 9 megabits per second it
56:48 - is the most common implementation of DSL
56:52 - in the small office home office
56:55 - environment last up for DSL is vdsl or
56:59 - very high bit rate DSL it's a
57:02 - synchronous in nature as well it's used
57:05 - when high quality video and voice over
57:08 - IP is necessary vdsl is commonly limited
57:13 - to download speeds of 52 megabits per
57:16 - second with an upload speed of 12
57:19 - megabits per second that's a whole lot
57:22 - faster than ADSL but vdsl is only
57:27 - possible when you're located within
57:29 - 4,000 ft of a central office there is an
57:34 - exception to what I just told you though
57:36 - the current standards do allow for up to
57:39 - 100 megabits per second speed over the
57:42 - pstn using vdsl but in order to achieve
57:46 - that you must be within 300 M of the
57:51 - central office now that the pstn is out
57:54 - out of the way let's move on to
57:56 - Broadband cable Broadband cable is
58:00 - co-axial cable networking it's a
58:03 - broadband connection to a location
58:07 - delivered by the cable company Broadband
58:10 - cable can deliver voice data and
58:13 - television all through the same
58:15 - connection and the way it works is the
58:18 - digital signal is delivered to the
58:20 - headend this is where all the cable
58:23 - signals are received the signal is then
58:26 - processed and formatted and then
58:29 - transmitted to the distribution Network
58:32 - the distribution network is a smaller
58:34 - service area served by the cable company
58:37 - the distribution Network architecture
58:40 - can be composed of fiber optic cabling
58:43 - or coaxial cabling and or a hybrid fiber
58:48 - coaxial cabling or hfc unlike DSL the
58:52 - bandwidth of the distribution Network is
58:55 - shared by all of those who connect to it
58:57 - this can lead to increased latency and
59:00 - congestion during busy times the final
59:03 - distribution to the premise is usually
59:06 - through a co-axial cable the other thing
59:09 - that you need to know about Broadband
59:11 - cable is that all cable modems and
59:13 - similar devices must measure up to the
59:17 - isp's required data over cable service
59:21 - interface specification or docis spe
59:25 - specification if it doesn't measure up
59:27 - you're not going to achieve the speeds
59:29 - that you expect now let's conclude with
59:32 - fiber fiber optic networking is using
59:36 - light to transmit data and voice this
59:39 - allows for more bandwidth over greater
59:42 - distances fiber optic networking is more
59:45 - expensive to install but it's also less
59:48 - susceptible to line noise the fiber
59:51 - synchronous data transmission standard
59:53 - in the United States is called the
59:56 - synchronous Optical Network or Sonet
60:00 - standard the international standard is
60:02 - called the synchronous digital hery or
60:06 - sdh both Sonet and sdh Define the base
60:11 - rates of transmission over fiber optic
60:14 - cabling which are known as Optical
60:16 - carrier levels dense wavelength division
60:21 - multiplexing is a method of multiplexing
60:24 - several Optical carrier levels together
60:27 - up to 32 of them into a single fiber
60:30 - optic cable effectively increasing the
60:33 - bandwidth of that single optical fiber
60:37 - instead of dwdm you could use
60:41 - cwdm coar wavelength division
60:44 - multiplexing it's similar to dwdm but it
60:48 - only allows for up to eight channels on
60:51 - a single fiber when fiber optic is
60:54 - delivered Ed to the premise it's usually
60:56 - delivered over a passive Optical Network
60:59 - or Pawn a pawn is a point to multipoint
61:03 - technology that uses a single optical
61:06 - fiber that's used to connect multiple
61:09 - locations to the internet the passive
61:11 - Optical Network uses unpowered Optical
61:16 - Splitters now that concludes this
61:18 - session on Wan Technologies part one I
61:22 - talked about the public switch telephone
61:25 - Network then we moved on to Broadband
61:27 - cable and I briefly ran through fiber
61:31 - optic networking on behalf of pace it
61:35 - thank you for watching this session and
61:37 - I'm looking forward to doing
61:43 - another good day I'm Brian frell and
61:47 - welcome to Pace it session on Wan
61:50 - Technologies part two today we're going
61:53 - to be discussing GSM and CDMA Wan
61:58 - connections then we're going to move on
62:00 - to YX W connections and we're going to
62:04 - conclude with satellite wide area
62:07 - network connections there's a fair
62:10 - amount of information to cover so let's
62:12 - go ahead and begin this session and of
62:15 - course I'm going to begin with the GSM
62:18 - and
62:19 - CDMA wide area network
62:22 - connections all cellular carriers use
62:25 - one of two methods for connecting
62:28 - devices to their networks and those
62:31 - methods are not compatible currently in
62:34 - the United States AT&T and T-Mobile use
62:38 - the global system for mobile or GSM
62:41 - standard to connect their devices to
62:44 - their networks both Sprint and Verizon
62:48 - use code division multiple access also
62:51 - known as
62:52 - CDMA as their me method of connecting to
62:55 - networks and those two standards are not
62:59 - compatible the majority of the rest of
63:01 - the world utilizes GSM as the method for
63:06 - cellular network
63:08 - access let me speak briefly about
63:11 - cellular networking cellular networking
63:14 - involves using the cellular phone system
63:17 - for more than just phone calls cellular
63:20 - networking has been around for a while
63:23 - and it originally wasn't known as this
63:25 - but the first version of it is first G
63:28 - or 1G cellular and it was only capable
63:32 - of voice Transmissions as improvements
63:35 - came along we got 2G that is cellular
63:38 - with simple data transmission
63:40 - capabilities as in text messaging 2G
63:43 - Edge offered some basic cellular
63:46 - networking connectivity and was a stop
63:48 - Gap measure between 2G and third
63:51 - generation cellular 3G cell cellular is
63:55 - the beginning of cellular wi networking
63:59 - it's giving way to 4G cellular which is
64:02 - still an emerging technology 4G
64:05 - currently consists of both LTE and yaax
64:09 - as a special mention we need to talk
64:12 - about evolved high-speed packet access
64:15 - which is
64:16 - HSPA plus it was a stop gap between 3G
64:20 - and 4G networking it's still available
64:23 - today the current standard for HSPA plus
64:27 - allows for up to a maximum data rate of
64:31 - 84 megabits per second now it's not
64:34 - quite as good as LTE which is long-term
64:38 - Evolution LTE uses an all IP based core
64:43 - with high data rates now LTE is
64:46 - compatible with both 3G and yaax the
64:50 - current standard for LTE allows for up
64:53 - to 300 megabits per second in download
64:56 - speeds and up to 75 megabits per second
64:59 - in upload speeds now let me introduce
65:03 - you to ymax WAN
65:06 - connections ymax stands for worldwide
65:10 - interoperability for microwave access
65:13 - that's a mouthful that's why we say ymax
65:17 - ymax was originally developed as a last
65:20 - mile alternative to use when DSL or
65:24 - cable was not available it can provide
65:27 - an alternative broadband connection to a
65:30 - fixed location it uses microwave
65:33 - Transmissions as an over-the-air method
65:36 - to transmit voice and data it does
65:39 - require line of sight between relay
65:42 - stations but ymax can be used to cover
65:45 - significant Geographic distances also
65:49 - many municipalities are exploring the
65:52 - use of ymax as a means of providing
65:55 - reasonably priced Broadband to their
65:58 - citizens without having to wire every
66:01 - household yaax is often considered to be
66:04 - a type of 4G technology because it is
66:08 - compatible with LTE networks but yaax is
66:13 - not compatible with third generation
66:16 - cellular
66:18 - networks it is time for us to conclude
66:21 - with satellite W connections satellite
66:24 - Wan connections are a type of microwave
66:28 - satellite networking it uses microwave
66:31 - Transmissions as an over-the-air method
66:33 - of transmitting voice and data just like
66:36 - yaax it can be an effective means of
66:39 - extending networks into places that are
66:42 - hard to reach it does use microwave
66:45 - radio relay as the method of
66:47 - transmitting data through the atmosphere
66:50 - just like yat it requires line of sight
66:52 - relay stations but it can cover even
66:55 - more distances than yaax why is that
66:59 - that's because it utilizes a satellite
67:01 - Network by the way because of the
67:03 - distances that satellite Transmissions
67:06 - can cover this can lead to latency
67:08 - problems think about it the Signal's got
67:11 - to go from a terrestrial location up to
67:14 - the satellite probably over to another
67:17 - satellite and then down to another
67:19 - terrestrial station that's a significant
67:22 - amount of distance and there's going to
67:24 - be some lag I just talked about the
67:26 - communication satellite that are also
67:28 - known as comsats these do form part of
67:31 - the microwave relay Network comsats can
67:35 - use a variety of orbits including the
67:38 - molia geostationary low polar or polar
67:43 - orbits the low polar and polar orbits
67:46 - are used to boost microwave signals
67:49 - before sending the signal back to Earth
67:53 - now that concludes cludes this session
67:55 - on W Technologies part two I briefly
67:59 - talked about GSM and CDM W connections
68:04 - then I moved on to a yaax Wan
68:07 - connections and then we concluded with
68:10 - satellite Wan connections now on behalf
68:13 - of pace it thank you for watching this
68:15 - session and I'm looking forward to doing
68:17 - some
68:22 - more
68:25 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
68:28 - pait's session on Wan Technologies part
68:31 - three today I'm going to briefly discuss
68:34 - Metro ethernet W connections then I'm
68:37 - going to move on to least line Wan
68:41 - connections and we're going to conclude
68:43 - with some common standards and with that
68:47 - let's go ahead and begin this session of
68:50 - course I'm going to begin by discussing
68:52 - Metro ethernet W
68:54 - connections a Metro ethernet connection
68:57 - is when the service provider connects to
69:00 - the customer's site through an
69:03 - RJ45 connector the customer will view
69:06 - that Wang connection as an ethernet
69:09 - connection while in reality the type of
69:12 - connection will be dependent upon the
69:14 - level of service that has been purchased
69:17 - the service provider may also use a
69:20 - variety of different wide area Network
69:23 - Technology
69:24 - behind the scenes but the customer will
69:27 - always view it as being an ethernet
69:30 - connection Metro ethernet is commonly
69:33 - deployed as a wide area Network
69:36 - Technology by municipalities at the
69:40 - metropolitan area network or Man level
69:44 - as in at the municipal level it's time
69:48 - for us to discuss least line Wan
69:52 - connections a least line is a dedicated
69:56 - circuit or connection between two
69:59 - endpoints used for communication when
70:02 - we're talking about it a least line is
70:06 - usually a digital point-to-point
70:09 - connection a least line can utilize
70:12 - either a plain old telephone service
70:14 - line a pots line on the public switched
70:17 - telephone Network or it can be a fiber
70:21 - optic circuit provided by a telecom
70:23 - Communications company leased lines tend
70:26 - to be more expensive for the customer as
70:29 - the circuit can't be utilized by any
70:31 - other entity so the whole cost is born
70:34 - by the customer because they're the only
70:36 - ones who get to use it most often the
70:39 - speed of a leas line is limited by what
70:43 - the customer is willing to pay there are
70:46 - some multiplexing technologies out there
70:49 - that can be used to increase the amount
70:51 - of channels that are provided on the
70:54 - connection one of the least line
70:57 - technologies that you need to know about
71:00 - is pointto point protocol PPP it is a
71:04 - common data link layer or layer 2
71:08 - protocol that's used with least line
71:10 - networks PPP can simultaneously transmit
71:15 - multiple layer three protocols it can
71:18 - transmit IP and ipx and apple talk all
71:22 - at the same time
71:24 - through the use of control protocols
71:27 - which are actually specific to the layer
71:29 - three protocol that's being transmitted
71:32 - PPP can include a feature called
71:35 - multi-link PPP which allows for multiple
71:39 - physical interfaces to be bonded
71:42 - together and act as a single logical
71:45 - interface this effectively increases the
71:48 - available bandwidth to that system there
71:52 - are different types types of least line
71:55 - connections in the United States Japan
71:57 - and South Korea there are t carrier
72:00 - lines each tline is composed of 24
72:04 - Digital Signal channels these are often
72:07 - called Digital Signal zero channels are
72:10 - DSO channels each channel is capable of
72:14 - carrying 64 kilobits per second the 24
72:18 - dsos make up what is called a DS1
72:22 - channel in in Europe we have e-carrier
72:25 - lines each e-line is composed of 30
72:29 - Digital Signal channels these are also
72:32 - called DSO channels the 30 DSO channels
72:36 - also make up what is called a DS1
72:39 - Channel when we're talking about fiber
72:42 - optic speeds we often talk about Optical
72:45 - carrier lines our OC lines the OC data
72:50 - rates per channel are established by
72:52 - both the Sonic
72:53 - and sdh networking standards Sonet is
72:58 - the United States standard and SD is the
73:01 - international standards interestingly
73:04 - enough the OC rates are the same across
73:07 - the two standards it's possible to
73:11 - Multiplex multiple channels into the
73:13 - same fiber using different methods the
73:16 - first method is dense wavelength
73:19 - division multiplexing dwdm it allows for
73:23 - up to 32 separate channels on a single
73:26 - fiber cable or you could use coar
73:29 - wavelength division multiplexing which
73:33 - allows for up to eight separate channels
73:35 - on a single fiber optic cable let's
73:39 - conclude with common
73:41 - standards the standards I'm going to be
73:43 - talking about are the speeds and we
73:46 - begin with t lines a T1 is composed of
73:50 - 24 DSO channels which are also known as
73:54 - a DS1 and it's capable of achieving
73:58 - speeds of up to
74:00 - 1.544 megabits per second if that's not
74:03 - fast enough for you you can lease a T3
74:07 - line it's composed of 28 T1 lines now a
74:12 - T3 line is also known as a DS3 and it
74:16 - can achieve speeds of up to
74:19 - 44.7 36 megabits per second if if you're
74:23 - in Europe you might lease an E1 line an
74:26 - E1 line which is composed of 30 DSO
74:29 - channels can achieve speeds of up to
74:33 - 2.48 megabits per second just as with
74:36 - the United States if that's not fast
74:38 - enough for you you can lease an E3 line
74:41 - which is composed of 16 E1 lines which
74:46 - gives you up to 34. 368 megabits per
74:50 - second speed while a T1 is slower than
74:53 - an E1 a T3 is faster than an E3 for OC
74:59 - lines we have the oc1 it's capable of
75:03 - 51.84 megabits per second in speed then
75:07 - there is the oc3 which gives you up to
75:12 - 155.52 megabits per second speed it's
75:15 - becoming more common now to see oc1 12s
75:19 - with those you get up to
75:22 - 622.org
75:23 - megabits per second if you want gigabit
75:26 - type speed you might consider leasing an
75:30 - oc48 that gives you up to
75:34 - 2488 gbits per second in bandwidth
75:37 - currently at the top of the line is the
75:39 - OC
75:41 - 192 that gives you up to
75:44 - 9953 gbits per second speed so
75:48 - essentially 10 gbits per second worth a
75:52 - bandwidth now that concludes this
75:54 - session on Wan Technologies part three I
75:58 - briefly discussed Metro ethernet Wan
76:00 - connections and then I went on to a
76:03 - discussion about least line Wan
76:05 - connections and then I briefly mentioned
76:08 - some common standards on behalf of pait
76:12 - thank you for watching this session and
76:14 - I hope to do another one
76:20 - soon hello I'm Brian
76:23 - and welcome to Pace it session on Wan
76:27 - Technologies part 4 today I'm going to
76:30 - be discussing the difference between
76:32 - circuit switched and packet switched
76:35 - networks then I'm going to move on to a
76:37 - discussion comparing frame relay versus
76:41 - asynchronous transfer mode and then
76:43 - we're going to conclude with
76:45 - multi-protocol label switching there's a
76:49 - whole lot of ground to cover not a whole
76:51 - lot of time let's go go ahead and begin
76:54 - this session let's begin this session by
76:57 - talking about circuit switched and
76:59 - packet switched
77:01 - networks circuit switch networks have a
77:04 - dedicated circuit between two endpoints
77:07 - that is used for communication while set
77:10 - up the circuit can only be used for
77:12 - communication between those ends circuit
77:16 - switch networks are most common in
77:18 - networks with least line communication
77:21 - channels they're best used when there
77:23 - needs to be a fair amount of continuous
77:26 - data traffic between the two endpoints
77:29 - and with circuit switched networks there
77:31 - is only one path for the data to take on
77:35 - the other hand in packet switch networks
77:38 - data is broken up into smaller chunks
77:41 - and moved through the network only to be
77:43 - reassembled at the other end the data is
77:46 - routed using the destination address and
77:49 - the data may take different paths
77:52 - through the Network that it's traveling
77:54 - through as a general rule packet switch
77:57 - networks are less expensive to maintain
78:00 - why because the user doesn't have to
78:03 - maintain a dedicated circuit
78:06 - 24/7 they're only paying for what
78:09 - they're using now let's talk about the
78:12 - differences between frame relay and
78:14 - asynchronous transfer mode frame relay
78:18 - is a Wan technology in which variable
78:20 - length packets are switched across the
78:23 - network frame relay is less expensive
78:26 - than least lines but frame relay can be
78:30 - made to look like a least line through
78:33 - virtual circuits or VCS a frame relay
78:36 - network will track a VC using a data
78:40 - link connection identifier to identify
78:43 - the ends of the VC there are two terms
78:46 - associated with frame relay that you
78:48 - should be aware of the first is access
78:51 - rate that is the maximum speed of the
78:54 - frame relay interface the other term is
78:58 - the committed information rate the CI
79:01 - that's the guaranteed bandwidth that a
79:04 - customer receives so that's the minimum
79:07 - speed of that frame relay Network the
79:10 - access rate may be higher but the
79:13 - customers always guaranteed the
79:15 - committed information rate now let's
79:18 - talk about asynchronous transfer mode
79:20 - also known as ATM ATM is a Wan
79:24 - technology in which fixed length cells
79:26 - are switched across the network these
79:29 - cells are always 53 bytes long ATM can
79:34 - handle realtime voice and video because
79:37 - it's very fast but it has poor bandwidth
79:40 - utilization the small cell size reduces
79:44 - the efficiency of the technology but ATM
79:47 - is very fast even if it is inefficient
79:51 - common speeds on an at ATM network are
79:54 - 51.84 megabits per second and
79:59 - 155.52 megabits per second let's
80:03 - conclude with multi-protocol label
80:06 - switching the acronym for multiprotocol
80:09 - label switching is MLS MLS is a topology
80:13 - that's growing in popularity why because
80:16 - it's scalable also it is protocol
80:20 - independent MLS can be used to replace
80:24 - both frame relay switching and ATM
80:26 - switching it can be used to packet
80:29 - switch both frame relay and ATM network
80:33 - traffic this allows MLS to be used with
80:37 - both frame relay and ATM Technologies
80:41 - MLS is often used to improve quality of
80:44 - service and flow of network traffic it
80:48 - uses a label Edge router to add NLS
80:52 - labels to incoming packets if they don't
80:54 - have them the label Edge router then
80:57 - passes those packets onto a label
81:01 - switching router or LSR router the LSR
81:04 - forwards those packets based on their
81:07 - MLS labels to their final
81:10 - destination now that concludes this
81:12 - session on Wan Technologies part four I
81:16 - talked about the differences between a
81:18 - circuit switched and packet switch
81:20 - Network then we moved on to frame relay
81:23 - versus asynchronous transfer mode and we
81:26 - concluded with a brief discussion on
81:29 - multiprotocol label switching on behalf
81:32 - of pace it thank you for watching this
81:35 - session and I look forward to doing some
81:43 - more hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
81:47 - to Pace it session on the network
81:49 - cabling part one today we're going to be
81:52 - talking about twisted pair network
81:54 - cabling then we're going to talk about
81:56 - twisted pair Network connectors and then
81:59 - we will conclude with categories of
82:01 - twisted pair I have a whole lot of
82:04 - information to cover and I need to get
82:05 - through this quickly so let's go ahead
82:08 - and begin this session and we'll Begin
82:11 - by talking about twisted pair network
82:14 - cabling most people are familiar with
82:16 - twisted pair cables because they are the
82:20 - standard in the modern land they are
82:22 - what you see most often when you're
82:24 - looking at Network CA twisted pair
82:27 - cables are composed of four pairs of
82:29 - wires contained within an insulating
82:31 - sheath each pair of wires is Twisted
82:34 - together to reduce electromagnetic
82:37 - interference which is called Emi The
82:40 - Twist rates differ between the pairs to
82:43 - reduce cross talk between the pairs
82:46 - which is a type of Emi the colors of the
82:50 - pairs of wires are always white orange
82:53 - orange white blue blue white green green
82:56 - and white brown
82:58 - brown twisted pair network cabling comes
83:01 - an either unshielded or shielded twisted
83:05 - pair that would be UTP or STP the
83:09 - difference is that STP has an additional
83:12 - Shield that is either wrapped around
83:14 - each pair of wires or around all four
83:17 - pairs of wires that shielding reduces
83:20 - the opportunity for Emi or cross talk
83:23 - but it is more expensive and a little
83:26 - harder to work with because it's not as
83:28 - flexible UTP or unshielded twisted pair
83:33 - is deployed in the network much more
83:35 - often than STP there are also plenum and
83:39 - non-plenum types of twisted pair most
83:43 - twisted pair cabling is non-plenum grade
83:47 - but building codes often call for Plum
83:50 - grade cable to be run in plenum spaces
83:53 - now a plum space is that area that is
83:56 - designed to assist in the air flow of a
83:59 - building for HVAC purposes and most
84:03 - often the plenum is that space between
84:05 - the false ceiling and the actual ceiling
84:09 - plenum cable is jacketed in either a
84:11 - fire retardant cover or in a low smoke
84:14 - PVC jacket Plum cables often have a
84:18 - polymer or nylon strand woven into the
84:20 - cabling or into the jack ET to help take
84:23 - the weight of hanging cables this
84:26 - reduces the chance for the cable to
84:28 - stretch which can cause the pair or
84:30 - pairs of wires inside the jacket to
84:33 - break twisted pair is usually either a
84:36 - straight through cable or a crossover
84:39 - cable but it can also be used to create
84:41 - a rollover or console cable a straight
84:45 - through cable is used to connect
84:47 - different types of devices together as
84:49 - in a computer to a switch or a switch to
84:52 - a router well a crossover cable is used
84:55 - to connect similar devices together as
84:58 - in a PC to a PC or a switch to a switch
85:01 - the straight through and crossover cable
85:04 - use different pinouts to achieve their
85:07 - connections a rollover or console cable
85:10 - is often required to connect to the
85:13 - console port on a switch or a router it
85:16 - is quite common for one end of the
85:18 - rollover cable to use an RJ45 connector
85:22 - while the other end utilizes an
85:25 - rs232 also called a DB9 connector so now
85:30 - that I've mentioned those connectors
85:31 - let's go on to twisted pair Network
85:34 - connectors and we're going to begin with
85:36 - the rj11 you don't see these very much
85:39 - in what we think of as networking but
85:42 - you do see them all the time the rj11
85:45 - uses a six position 4 contact modular
85:49 - connector that's a 6p 4C modular mod
85:52 - connector it can carry data or voice and
85:55 - its common usage is voice communication
85:59 - telephoning all of your telephone Jacks
86:01 - are rj1 111s then there's the RJ45 this
86:05 - is the one that we always think about
86:07 - when we think about networking with
86:09 - twisted pair of cabling it uses an 8
86:12 - position 8 contact or 8p 8C modular
86:17 - connector it can carry data or voice and
86:20 - its common usage is data networking
86:23 - ethernet then there's the
86:26 - rj48c it also uses an 8 position 8
86:29 - contact modular connector 8p8c just like
86:33 - the RJ45 as a matter of fact it's often
86:37 - thought of as being an
86:39 - RJ45 but it's used as the terminating
86:42 - connector at the dmark point for T1
86:45 - lines and as I said just a moment ago
86:47 - it's often confused with the RJ45 but
86:50 - the active pin are different then we
86:54 - have the UTP coupler the unshielded
86:57 - twisted pair coupler it's used to
87:00 - connect UTP cables backto back and still
87:04 - maintain adherence to Industry standards
87:07 - you might still come across the 66 block
87:10 - being used for network connections but
87:12 - probably not it's a punchdown block that
87:15 - was initially developed to terminate and
87:18 - distribute telephone lines in an
87:20 - Enterprise Network so you might still
87:22 - see it for telephony but it's getting a
87:25 - little bit harder to find it it was also
87:27 - used in slower speed networks as it can
87:30 - handle data traffic That's rated for cat
87:33 - 3 cabling much more likely you'll find a
87:35 - 110 block now this is a punchdown block
87:38 - that was developed to terminate and
87:40 - distribute twisted pair network cabling
87:44 - it's capable of handling the signaling
87:46 - requirements of the modern Network I
87:49 - mentioned the DB9 or rs23 2 connector
87:52 - earlier well here we go it is a 9 pin D
87:57 - subminiature connector developed for
88:00 - asynchronous serial communication
88:03 - between nodes it was a common type of
88:06 - connector between a computer and an
88:08 - external modem and as I said earlier it
88:12 - often makes up one end of the rollover
88:15 - cable you might come across the db25
88:19 - also known as an eia 2 32 or
88:24 - rs232 serial connector it is a 25 pin
88:29 - duub miniature connector developed for
88:32 - asynchronous serial communication
88:35 - between nodes just like the DB9 only it
88:38 - was larger it too provided a type of
88:41 - connection between a computer and an
88:44 - external analog modem and it's even less
88:47 - common than the
88:49 - DB9 now let's move on to categories of
88:52 - of twisted pair and we begin with cat 3
88:55 - cat 3 was rated for up to 10 megabits
88:58 - per second speed that's 10 Bas T
89:01 - networking and it had a maximum distance
89:04 - of 100 m by the way unless I specify all
89:09 - twisted pair cabling has a max distance
89:12 - of 100 m that 10 megabits per second
89:15 - wasn't quite fast enough so then we got
89:18 - cap five cap five is rated for up to 100
89:22 - megabits per second speed that's 100 Bas
89:25 - T networking and that still wasn't fast
89:29 - enough so they developed cap 5e cap 5e
89:33 - is rated for up to 1 gigabits per second
89:36 - that's 1,000 base T now we have cat 6
89:42 - cat 6 is rated for up to 10 gbits per
89:45 - second that's 10 GB Ethernet or 10 GBE
89:50 - and with cat 6 you can can only get that
89:52 - 10 gbits per second over a max distance
89:55 - of 55 M for some reason they thought
89:59 - they needed to go more distance than 55
90:01 - M so they developed cat 6A it has the
90:05 - same speed ratings as cat 6 but it has a
90:09 - max distance of 100 m and you can still
90:13 - achieve that 10 gbits per second
90:16 - networking now that concludes this
90:19 - session on network cabling part one I
90:22 - talked about twisted pair cabling then I
90:25 - talked about twisted pair Network
90:27 - connectors and I concluded with the
90:29 - categories of twisted pair cabling now
90:33 - on behalf of pace it thank you for
90:35 - watching this session and I hope you
90:37 - watch another one
90:43 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
90:46 - to pait's session on network cabling
90:50 - part two today we're we're going to be
90:52 - talking about co-axial cabling and fiber
90:56 - optic cabling there's a fair amount of
90:58 - ground to cover so let's go ahead and
91:00 - begin this session and of course we're
91:03 - going to begin by talking about coaxial
91:06 - cabling coaxial or coax cabling is one
91:11 - of the oldest ethernet standards for
91:14 - network cabling it was standardized in
91:18 - 1973 it's been used for baseband carries
91:21 - just a single digital signal and it has
91:24 - been used for Broadband carrying
91:26 - multiple digital signals it is composed
91:29 - of a central conductor that is covered
91:32 - by an insulating layer which is covered
91:34 - by an outer mesh or foil layer which is
91:38 - then finished off with an outer
91:40 - insulating layer that inner metal mesh
91:43 - layer helps to protect against
91:46 - electromagnetic interference Emi there
91:49 - are several different types of coax
91:51 - cable there is
91:53 - RG58 it was used in 10base 2 networking
91:58 - it could span a maximum distance of 185
92:01 - M and had a 50 ohms impedance value it's
92:07 - no longer commonly found in the modern
92:09 - Network then there's
92:11 - rg59 it's commonly used to provide a
92:14 - broadband connection between two devices
92:18 - over a short distance and it has a 75
92:21 - ohms impedance value and it's only used
92:25 - for short distances because it leaks its
92:28 - signal it can't span very far then we
92:31 - have RG6 which is used for cable TV or
92:35 - Broadband now the distance that RG6 can
92:39 - spand varies but it still has a 75 ohms
92:43 - impedance value and it's commonly used
92:45 - to make the connection to a cable modem
92:48 - by the cable company there are are two
92:52 - basic types of coax cable connectors
92:55 - there is the BNC also known as the
92:58 - bayonet Neil councilman connector you
93:02 - can also call it a bayonet connector it
93:05 - is used with coax cabling but is now
93:08 - considered obsolete the connection from
93:10 - the cable to the device was achieved
93:13 - through a spring-loaded Twist lock type
93:15 - of connector a BNC coupler can also be
93:19 - used to connect two coax cables segments
93:22 - back to back much more common is the F
93:25 - connector it's a threaded bayet
93:28 - connector and it's also used with coax
93:31 - cable an F connector coupler can be used
93:34 - to connect two coax cable segments back
93:37 - to back now let's move on to fiber optic
93:41 - cabling so now let me describe fiber
93:44 - optic cabling first off it's relatively
93:47 - expensive and harder to work with than
93:50 - with other types of network cabling it's
93:52 - not as common as other types either coax
93:56 - or twisted pair in the land environment
94:00 - but it can resist all forms of
94:02 - electromagnetic interference and it
94:05 - cannot be easily tapped into that means
94:08 - it's harder for people to ease drop on
94:11 - your network Transmissions it also can
94:14 - cover long distances at high speed fiber
94:18 - optic cabling is designated by fiber
94:22 - type cladding size by the way the
94:24 - cladding is what the light bounces down
94:27 - and it's jacket size that outer jacket
94:29 - that covers the cable the size of the
94:32 - cladding and the size of the jacket are
94:34 - listed in micrometers most applications
94:37 - of fiber optic cabling require that the
94:40 - cables be run in pairs one cable to send
94:44 - Transmissions one cable to receive
94:46 - Transmissions the type of connector used
94:49 - on fiber optic cabling can impact act
94:51 - the performance of the transmission
94:54 - there are two basic categories of
94:56 - connectors there is the UPC the ultra
95:00 - physical contact this connector has a
95:03 - back reflection rating of around a NE 55
95:08 - dbel loss then there's the APC the
95:11 - angled physical connector which has a
95:14 - back reflection rating of around a - 70
95:18 - DB loss making it the better performance
95:21 - form in connector now let's talk about
95:24 - fiber types there's multimode fiber
95:27 - which uses an infrared LED system to
95:30 - transmit light down the fiber it sends
95:34 - multiple rays of lights down the cable
95:37 - at the same time it is used for shorter
95:40 - fiber runs under 2 km it is less
95:44 - expensive than the other type of fiber
95:47 - cabling then we have single mode fiber
95:50 - SMF it us uses a laser diode arrangement
95:53 - to transmit light down the fiber it only
95:57 - sends a single ray of light down the
95:59 - cable even though my diagram depicts it
96:01 - as going straight it still bounces down
96:04 - the cladding but there's only one of
96:06 - them it's used for longer runs that
96:09 - require high speed and it can span more
96:12 - than 40
96:14 - km so now let's talk about fiber optic
96:17 - CA and connectors and first up is the SC
96:22 - that is the subscriber connector or the
96:24 - square connector you can also call it a
96:27 - standard connector an easy way to
96:29 - remember it is stick and click it's a
96:32 - push pull type connector then we have
96:35 - the St the straight tip you can also
96:38 - think of this as stick and twist it is a
96:42 - springloaded Twist lock type of
96:44 - connector there's also the LC which can
96:47 - be called the local connector or
96:49 - loosened connector or little connector
96:52 - it's a type of connector that uses a
96:54 - locking tab to secure the connection
96:57 - similar to the LC is the mtrj the
97:01 - mechanical transfer registered Jack it's
97:04 - a small form factor connector that
97:07 - contains two fibers and that also
97:10 - utilizes a locking tab to secure the
97:13 - connection you might also find a fiber
97:16 - optic coupler guess what it does it's
97:18 - used to connect two fiber optic cables
97:21 - back to back now that concludes this
97:24 - session on network cabling part two I
97:27 - talked about coaxial cabling and I
97:30 - concluded with fiber optic cabling now
97:33 - on behalf of pace it thank you for
97:36 - watching this session and I'm sure I'll
97:38 - do another one
97:46 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
97:50 - welcome to pce it T's session on network
97:53 - cabling part three today I'm going to be
97:56 - talking about media converters and then
97:59 - I'm going to talk about some cabling
98:01 - tools that you should know about and
98:03 - with that let's go ahead and begin
98:05 - today's session I will Begin by
98:08 - discussing media
98:10 - converters it is not uncommon to be in a
98:14 - situation where Network contains more
98:16 - than one type of cabling this can lead
98:19 - to a situation where there's a desire to
98:22 - connect different types of media
98:24 - together in order to make a cohesive or
98:27 - single Network thankfully media
98:29 - converters are readily available the
98:32 - issue of trying to connect these
98:34 - disparate types of transmission together
98:37 - mostly comes into play when you're
98:39 - trying to join a fiber optic
98:41 - transmission to a copper wire
98:45 - infrastructure and that's actually
98:47 - represented in the types of readily
98:49 - available media converters that that are
98:51 - out there the most common media
98:53 - converters will connect single mode
98:56 - fiber to ethernet or multimode Fiber to
98:59 - ethernet or single mode fiber to
99:02 - multimode fiber and finally there is a
99:05 - fiber to coaxial cabling media converter
99:10 - you need to be aware that these devices
99:12 - are out there to help you create a solid
99:17 - Network now let's move on to cabling
99:20 - tools so every technician should put
99:23 - some thought into the tools that are in
99:26 - his or her toolbox it is often said that
99:29 - you get what you pay for and that is
99:31 - very true with tools while a good
99:34 - technician can get away with buying the
99:36 - most inexpensive tools by spending a
99:39 - little more money for a better tool that
99:42 - can often make the task easier and
99:45 - ultimately make the technician more
99:47 - efficient but you also need to be aware
99:50 - that you can spend more money than is
99:53 - necessary and not utilize all of the
99:56 - features in a given tool so you need to
99:59 - find that balance point between spending
100:02 - too much money and not spending enough
100:04 - money to become a really efficient
100:07 - technician now let's move on to the
100:10 - tools themselves and we'll begin with
100:12 - crimpers crimpers are used to place
100:15 - cable ends on cables they can be
100:17 - designed to work with a single type of
100:19 - cable as in twisted pair or with
100:23 - multiple types of cable I've seen some
100:25 - crimpers that have been able to work
100:27 - with rj1 111s
100:29 - rj45s and with a co-axial F connector
100:33 - next up are wire strippers wire
100:36 - strippers are used to remove the
100:38 - insulating covers on wires and cables
100:41 - many are designed to just cut through
100:43 - the insulation without damaging the
100:46 - cable contained within that insulation
100:49 - but some are also designed to cut all
100:51 - the way through the cable so that excess
100:54 - cabling can be trimmed when you're using
100:56 - those to cut insulation you need to be
100:59 - careful that you don't cut the
101:00 - underlying cable then there are
101:02 - punchdown tools these are used to secure
101:05 - cable wires into punchdown blocks a good
101:09 - punchdown tool will trim the ends at the
101:11 - same time as it places the wire in the
101:14 - punch down block then there are cable
101:17 - testers these are used to test cables
101:19 - for common problems as in
101:21 - misconfiguration of the ends or
101:24 - incorrect pinouts cable testers will
101:26 - often test for the cable standard used
101:29 - either the
101:30 - t568a or the
101:32 - t568b or they can tell you whether or
101:35 - not you've created a crossover cable
101:37 - cable testers will test for shorts or
101:40 - breaks in the continuity of the cable
101:43 - some types of testers can also test for
101:46 - cable length and quality these type of
101:49 - testers are called cable certifiers then
101:52 - we have the TDR the time domain
101:55 - reflectometer now this is a cable tester
101:58 - for copper cabling that can determine
102:00 - the length of a segment and the
102:03 - electrical characteristics of the cable
102:06 - also a TDR can tell you where a
102:12 - break hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
102:16 - to Pace it session on network topologies
102:20 - today we're going to discuss what a
102:21 - topology is then we're going to discuss
102:24 - peer-to-peer in client server networking
102:27 - and then we're going to talk about some
102:28 - common Network
102:30 - topologies and with that let's go ahead
102:33 - and begin this
102:34 - session so what is a
102:37 - topology well a topology is basically a
102:41 - map that can be used to describe how a
102:43 - network is laid out or how a network
102:45 - functions a network topology can be
102:48 - described as either being logical or
102:51 - physical a logical topology describes
102:54 - the theoretical signal path while the
102:57 - physical topology describes the physical
102:59 - layout of the network and you should
103:02 - know that a logical and physical
103:05 - topology don't need to match and with
103:08 - that let's move on to peer-to-peer
103:10 - versus the client server networks so are
103:14 - these really topologies no not really
103:17 - they don't describe the signal path or
103:19 - the physical layout of the network but
103:22 - yes they are topologies because they do
103:24 - describe how the network functions so
103:27 - that's why they're here in this
103:29 - discussion now in a peer-to-peer
103:30 - topology the nodes control and Grant
103:33 - access to resources on the
103:35 - network no one node or group of nodes
103:38 - controls access to a single specific
103:41 - type of resource there's no real server
103:44 - present each node is responsible for the
103:47 - resources it's willing to share now a
103:51 - client server topology differs Network
103:54 - resource access is controlled by a
103:57 - central server or servers a server
104:00 - determines what resources get shared who
104:03 - is allowed to use those resources and
104:06 - even when those resources can be used
104:09 - now in the small office home office it's
104:12 - common to find a hybrid topology that's
104:15 - where a combination of peer-to-peer and
104:17 - client server networking is used now
104:20 - let's move on to some common Network
104:23 - topology models the first one we're
104:25 - going to discuss is the bus the original
104:29 - ethernet standard established a bus
104:31 - topology for the network both logically
104:34 - and physically and what I mean by a bus
104:37 - topology is the signal traveled along a
104:40 - predetermined path from end to end it
104:42 - went from one direction to the other
104:44 - direction and then it could come back
104:47 - now as time went on the bus developed
104:49 - some mechanical problems
104:51 - that led to the development of different
104:53 - physical topologies but the logical
104:56 - topology remained the same in order to
104:58 - maintain backward
105:00 - compatibility so when we discuss
105:02 - ethernet networks the logical topology
105:05 - is always a bus topology while the
105:08 - physical topology can be different so
105:11 - let's talk about the bus again the
105:13 - signal traverses from one end of the
105:15 - network to the other now a Breaking the
105:18 - line breaks the network
105:21 - the ends of the bus line needed to be
105:23 - terminated in order to prevent signal
105:25 - bounce and what that means is that if
105:28 - there was a break or the ends of the
105:30 - line were not terminated when the signal
105:32 - got to the end it would bounce back
105:34 - through and create a storm in a bus
105:37 - topology the network cable is the
105:40 - central point now kind of related to the
105:43 - bus is the ring it's a bus line with the
105:46 - end point connected together a break in
105:49 - the ring breaks the ring in a ring
105:52 - topology it's common to use two rings
105:54 - multiple rings that counter rotate this
105:57 - safeguards against a break in one ring
105:59 - Bringing Down the whole network now ring
106:02 - topologies are not very common anymore
106:04 - in the land but they're still used in
106:07 - the wide area network especially when
106:10 - Sonet or SD is used moving on from The
106:14 - Ring we have the star the nodes radiate
106:17 - out from a central point now when a
106:20 - topology is implemented with a hub a
106:23 - break in a segment brings down the whole
106:25 - bus because the Hub retransmits out all
106:28 - ports now when it's implemented with a
106:30 - switch a break in a segment only brings
106:33 - down that segment it is the most common
106:36 - implementation in the modern land then
106:40 - there's the mesh a true mesh topology is
106:43 - when all nodes are connected to all
106:45 - other nodes that's a full mesh now those
106:48 - aren't very common because the they are
106:50 - expensive and difficult to maintain but
106:53 - it's common to find partial meshes
106:56 - that's where there are multiple paths
106:58 - between nodes now everyone knows at
107:01 - least one partial mesh Network and that
107:04 - would be the
107:05 - internet now let's move on to the point
107:08 - to-point topology that's where two nodes
107:10 - or systems are connected directly
107:12 - together now if you're talking about two
107:14 - PCS that's when they use a crossover
107:17 - cable to create a point-to-point
107:19 - topology there there's no Central device
107:21 - to manage the connection now this is
107:24 - still a common topology when implemented
107:27 - across a Wan connection utilizing a T1
107:30 - line we also need to discuss point to
107:33 - multi-point in a point to multi-point
107:36 - topology a central device controls the
107:39 - paths to all other devices this differs
107:42 - from a star in that the central device
107:44 - is
107:45 - intelligent now wireless networks often
107:48 - Implement point to multi-point to IES
107:51 - when the wireless access point sends all
107:54 - devices on the network receive the data
107:57 - but when a device sends its message is
108:00 - only passed along to the
108:02 - destination it's also a common topology
108:05 - when implementing a Wan across a packet
108:08 - switched Network now let's discuss MLS
108:12 - MLS is multiprotocol label switching and
108:15 - it is a topology that's used to replace
108:18 - both frame relay switching and ATM
108:21 - switching it's a topology because it
108:24 - specifies a signal path and layout MLS
108:27 - is used to improve the quality of
108:29 - service and flow of network traffic it
108:32 - uses label Edge routers LS which add MLS
108:37 - labels to incoming packets if they don't
108:39 - already have them now the ls add the
108:42 - labels and pass the packets along to
108:45 - lsrs label switching routers these
108:48 - forward packets based on their MLS
108:51 - labels that's what makes this a
108:55 - topology now that concludes this session
108:57 - on network topologies we discussed what
109:00 - a topology is then we discussed the
109:03 - differences between peer-to-peer and
109:05 - client server networking and then I
109:07 - brought up some common Network topology
109:10 - models that you should know now on
109:12 - behalf of pace it thank you for watching
109:15 - this session and I'm sure I'll do
109:17 - another one
109:19 - soon
109:24 - good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to
109:27 - Pace it session on network
109:30 - infrastructure implementations today I'm
109:32 - going to be talking about design versus
109:35 - function and then I'm going to talk
109:37 - about categories of different networks
109:40 - and with that let's go ahead and begin
109:43 - this session let's begin this session by
109:46 - talking about the difference between
109:48 - design and function
109:50 - when describing a network you have a
109:53 - couple of different options are you
109:55 - describing its design or its function if
109:59 - you are going to describe its design
110:01 - then the first place to start is to
110:03 - describe its topology is it a bus
110:06 - network is it a star Network or a point
110:09 - too but if you're going to describe how
110:12 - the network functions then the first
110:15 - place to start is to describe the
110:17 - category or infrastructure
110:20 - implementation of that Network and with
110:23 - that let's move on to categories of
110:27 - networks first up is the local area
110:30 - network or the landan most lands are
110:34 - encompassed by a single Network address
110:36 - range that address range may be broken
110:39 - up into subgroups through the use of
110:43 - virtual local area networks vlans a land
110:47 - can span anywhere from a small area like
110:50 - a single room to a whole building or a
110:53 - small group of buildings the land tends
110:56 - to be the highest speed Network it is
110:59 - becoming more common to see 10 gbits per
111:02 - second networking on the land the most
111:06 - common types of network on the land are
111:09 - the 802.3 or ethernet Andor the
111:14 - 802.11 or Wireless local area network
111:18 - these are the most common types of
111:20 - network found on the land then there is
111:24 - the metropolitan area network or the man
111:28 - it is larger than a land most often it
111:31 - contains multiple local area networks
111:35 - mans or metropolitan area networks are
111:38 - often owned by
111:40 - municipalities when a man is owned by a
111:43 - private entity it is sometimes called a
111:46 - campus area network then there is the
111:49 - Wan the wide area network now A W spans
111:54 - significant Geographic distances they
111:58 - can be described as a network of
112:00 - networks and the best example of a Wan
112:04 - is the internet so how do you tell when
112:06 - a man becomes a Wan well as a general
112:10 - rule if all of the infrastructure
112:13 - implementation has a single owner then
112:16 - it is not a Wan if it's large it'll be a
112:20 - man and if it's not quite so large it'll
112:23 - be a lan but it's really easy to tell a
112:27 - personal area network a pan why because
112:31 - they are extremely distant and size
112:34 - limited most often a pan is a connection
112:38 - between only two devices common examples
112:41 - include a Bluetooth connection between a
112:44 - keyboard and a computer that's a pan
112:47 - then there are infrared or IR connect C
112:50 - between a smartphone and a printer
112:52 - that's a pan another example of a pan is
112:56 - near field
112:58 - communication which is now becoming seen
113:00 - between a smartphone and a payment
113:03 - terminal the pan tends to have low
113:06 - throughput of data and low power output
113:10 - they don't consume a whole lot of power
113:12 - as the distance between devices increase
113:16 - the throughput on a pan will decrease
113:20 - now a couple of special categories of
113:22 - networks and first is the supervisory
113:26 - control and data acquisition Network the
113:29 - scata network now a scata network is a
113:33 - type of industrial control system or IC
113:37 - that is designed to control large scale
113:40 - deployments of equipment the controlled
113:42 - equipment is usually at more than one
113:45 - site scata is often deployed in energy
113:48 - distribution system systems by utility
113:51 - companies scata uses a distributed
113:55 - control system or DCS to communicate
113:58 - with programmable logic controllers
114:01 - plc's and or remote terminals to control
114:04 - the equipment and processes from a
114:07 - central location so they have a central
114:10 - location to control equipment that's at
114:13 - remote locations scatter networks are
114:16 - often proprietory and often require a
114:19 - additional training to understand them
114:22 - and operate them the last special
114:25 - mention on categories of networks is the
114:28 - Media Net it's a network designed and
114:31 - implemented specifically to handle voice
114:34 - and video they are designed and
114:37 - implemented to remove quality of service
114:40 - issues like latency or Jitter that can
114:43 - occur in other types of infrastructure a
114:46 - video teleconference Network or VTC is
114:50 - an example of a Media Net they are often
114:53 - implemented as its own infrastructure or
114:57 - as a sub infrastructure of a larger
115:00 - Network that concludes this session on
115:04 - network infrastructure
115:06 - implementations I talked about the
115:08 - differences between design and function
115:11 - of networks and I concluded with a
115:14 - discussion on the different categories
115:17 - of networks on behalf of P it thank you
115:20 - for watching this session and I hope you
115:23 - watch another one
115:28 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
115:32 - to pait's session on the introduction to
115:36 - ipv4 part one today we're going to be
115:40 - talking about the purpose of Ip
115:42 - addressing and then we're going to move
115:44 - on to some
115:45 - ipv4 address properties there's a whole
115:49 - lot of ground to cover and we need to do
115:51 - it quickly so let's go ahead and begin
115:54 - this session of course we're going to
115:56 - start with the purpose of Ip
115:59 - addressing when Bob on network a wants
116:03 - to view a web page hosted on a server on
116:06 - network C how does Bob's computer know
116:09 - where to send him well somehow Bob has
116:13 - gotten that server's IP address either
116:16 - an ipv4 format or
116:20 - IPv6 IP addresses are the location of a
116:24 - PC or server or some other network
116:28 - device that identifies it by both its
116:31 - Network location and host location
116:35 - within that
116:36 - Network IP addressing provides a logical
116:40 - addressing scheme for our computers so
116:42 - that they can communicate on networks
116:46 - being logical means that the IP address
116:48 - can be changed ched with minimal fuss at
116:51 - any time unlike the MAC address or the
116:54 - media Access Control address which is
116:57 - physically embedded into the device on
117:00 - the other hand IP addresses are
117:03 - programmed in and are easily changed now
117:07 - that we know the purpose of Ip
117:09 - addressing let's move on to some ipv4
117:13 - address
117:14 - properties ipv4 is made up of a 32bit
117:19 - binary number that means there are two
117:23 - to the 32nd power possible address
117:27 - combinations that gives us 4
117:31 - b294
117:34 - m967
117:37 - 296 possible address combinations with
117:40 - all of these possibilities a process
117:43 - needed to be developed to keep
117:45 - everything neat and tidy and most of all
117:49 - find able the implementation of a subnet
117:52 - mask was the answer and I'll get to that
117:55 - subnet mask in just a moment something
117:58 - that you will find useful is learning
118:01 - how to convert from binary to decimal
118:04 - now decimal is base two that means there
118:07 - are only zeros and ones as opposed to
118:11 - the base 10 that we're all used to
118:13 - dealing with if you would like more
118:15 - information on how to convert from
118:17 - decimal to Binary or binary to decimal
118:21 - you can go to that website that's listed
118:23 - under this heading so now let's talk
118:26 - about the initial properties of ipv4 it
118:29 - is a 32bit binary number as I said
118:32 - before it's divided into four sets of
118:36 - eight called octets These are separated
118:39 - by periods or decimals each octet is 8
118:44 - Bits which equals 1 byte we often
118:48 - represent ipv V4 addresses in a human
118:51 - friendly format that's called dotted
118:54 - decimal now when we look at this address
118:58 - 192.168.1 n that is an IP address but we
119:02 - don't know which portion is the network
119:04 - or which portion is the host to be able
119:08 - to resolve this it requires the use of a
119:10 - mask which determines or defines which
119:13 - portion is which this mask is called the
119:16 - subnet mask and the subnet mask has the
119:20 - same format as the IP address as in its
119:24 - 32 bits and it's represented in dotted
119:27 - decimal format so let's take a look at
119:30 - how an IP address and subnet mask
119:33 - operate together so we're going to begin
119:35 - with 1
119:37 - 192.168.1 n with a subnet mask of
119:43 - 255.255.255.0 now the 1
119:45 - 192.168.1 n is the IP address like I
119:48 - said
119:49 - and the other portion the
119:53 - 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask and
119:56 - it's easiest to show how the subnet
119:59 - masks by converting that dotted decimal
120:02 - back into binary so we can do that by
120:05 - deconstructing the IP address so the
120:08 - first octet would be 1 one followed by 6
120:12 - Z that equals 192 the second octet is
120:18 - 1011 followed by three zeros that equals
120:21 - 168 that third octet is real easy it's
120:25 - seven zeros followed by a one and then
120:28 - we have the fourth octet which is four
120:30 - zeros a one two zeros and a one that
120:33 - equals N9 now if we deconstruct the
120:36 - subnet mask what we have is we have
120:39 - three octets that are full of ones and
120:42 - one octet that's full of zeros that
120:44 - represents that
120:48 - 255.255.255.0
120:49 - now if we put the subnet mask under the
120:53 - representation of the IP address
120:56 - anything that's not covered by a one in
120:59 - the subnet mask is a part of the host
121:03 - address everything that is covered by a
121:05 - one is the network address so what we
121:08 - have for that IP address is that 1
121:12 - 192.168.1 is the network portion of the
121:15 - address and the node portion of the
121:18 - address is the nine and that's how the
121:21 - IP address and subnet mask work together
121:24 - to define the network and the node now
121:28 - that concludes this session on the
121:31 - introduction to
121:32 - ipv4 part one we talked about the
121:35 - purpose of Ip addressing and then we
121:38 - moved on to some ipv4 address properties
121:43 - now on behalf of pace it thank you for
121:45 - watching this session and I'm sure we'll
121:47 - do another one soon
121:56 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
122:00 - Pit's session on the introduction to
122:03 - ipv4 part two today we're going to talk
122:07 - about classes of ipv4 addresses and then
122:11 - we're going to move on to classless ipv4
122:15 - addressing and we will conclude with a
122:17 - brief discussion on subnetting ipv4
122:22 - addresses there's a whole lot of
122:24 - technical information to cover so let's
122:27 - go ahead and begin this session let's
122:30 - begin by talking about classes of ipv4
122:34 - addresses Internet Protocol version 4
122:38 - ipv4 is a binary addressing scheme
122:41 - that's used for networking it was
122:43 - initially finalized as a standard in
122:46 - 1981 ipv4 is a common Network addressing
122:51 - scheme that is still being deployed
122:53 - today there is an issue though with
122:56 - ipv4 because of its structure and the
122:59 - growth and popularity of the internet
123:01 - most of the world has run out of
123:04 - assignable ipv4 addresses but thanks to
123:08 - some forethought it's still a valid
123:11 - scheme today we need to talk about
123:14 - classes of ipv4 addresses and we begin
123:18 - with a class class a network address
123:20 - Class A networks have an address range
123:23 - of 0 to 127 in the first octet that
123:28 - gives us addresses from
123:30 - 0.0.0.0 up to
123:35 - 12725 five.
123:38 - 255.255 the first octed on the left has
123:41 - a binary representation that always
123:43 - begins with a zero this gives us a
123:47 - possible 16 million
123:52 - 777-2144 host addresses and the subnet
123:55 - mask with a Class A network is always
123:59 - 255.0.0.0
124:01 - then there are class B Network addresses
124:06 - they have an address range of 128 to 191
124:11 - in the first octet that means that class
124:14 - B networks can have a range of
124:17 - 128.0 do0 .0 up to
124:21 - 191
124:39 - 255.255.255.0 host and the subnet mask
124:42 - used with a class spe network is always
124:46 - 255.255.0.0
124:49 - then there are class c network addresses
124:51 - and they have an address range in the
124:53 - first octet of 192 up to
124:58 - 223 that means that we have an address
125:00 - range of
125:02 - 1920. z.0 up through
125:06 - 223
125:16 - 255.255.255.0 Class C Network address
125:19 - give us a possible
125:21 - 254 post addresses or node addresses and
125:25 - the subnet mask with a Class C is always
125:32 - 255.255.255.0 the last class of address
125:35 - that you need to concern yourself with
125:37 - is the class D Network address it has an
125:41 - address range of
125:43 - 224 up through 239 in the first octave
125:48 - which means that it can range from
125:51 - 2240 up through
125:54 - 239 255
125:58 - 255.255 and that first octed on the left
126:02 - has a binary representation of 1 1 1 0
126:07 - so the first four bits are always taken
126:09 - and they are always 1 1 1 0 now subnet
126:14 - masks are not defined for class D
126:17 - networking class FD Network addresses
126:20 - are used for multicast communication and
126:24 - finally we have a special class of
126:27 - addresses well kind of a class of
126:29 - addresses and that involves automatic
126:32 - private IP addressing a Pippa in some
126:36 - cases the dynamic host configuration
126:38 - protocol
126:40 - DHCP process May Fail in these cases a
126:44 - node or host will self-configure an aipa
126:48 - address address now with an apipa
126:50 - address the first two octets are always
126:54 - 168
126:55 - 254 and if you see that in your IP
126:58 - configuration you know that you have a
127:01 - DHCP problem so one of the first methods
127:04 - that they used to conserve the ipv4
127:07 - address space was they broke them out
127:10 - into public and private IP addresses
127:13 - public IP addresses are routable and
127:16 - being routable means that each public IP
127:20 - address is unique there can only be one
127:24 - now public IP addresses are not flexible
127:29 - you are assigned to your network space
127:32 - you're not really given a choice what
127:34 - your public IP address is going to be
127:37 - and then there are the private IP
127:39 - addresses these are non routable they do
127:42 - not need to be completely unique
127:45 - throughout the world they only have to
127:47 - be unique on their Network the first one
127:50 - that we're going to discuss is the class
127:52 - A license there is only one class a
127:54 - license you have a possible address
127:57 - range of
127:58 - 10.0.0.0 up through 10.
128:18 - they have an address range of
128:21 - 172.16.0.0
128:22 - up through
128:26 - 17231
128:28 - 255.255 and last but not least is the
128:31 - Class C license there are
128:35 - 256 Class C licenses with a possible
128:38 - address range of
128:42 - 192.168.0.0 up through 192.168.255.255
128:49 - 5255 now private IP addressing is highly
128:53 - flexible you get to assign the network
128:55 - space it's not assigned to you now let's
128:59 - move on to classless ipv4 addressing now
129:03 - the classes of addresses actually
129:06 - limited the flexibility of
129:08 - ipv4 part of the reason for that was
129:11 - that the first routing protocols
129:13 - required the class structure and you
129:16 - would think that with over 4 billion
129:18 - possible IP addresses that we'd still
129:21 - have flexibility but we really didn't
129:23 - classless addressing which is called
129:25 - classless interdomain routing or cider
129:29 - was developed to slow the growth of
129:32 - routing tables it also slowed the
129:35 - exhaustion of ipv4 addresses it also
129:38 - created much more flexibility the subnet
129:41 - mask becomes fluid it's not rigid with
129:44 - cider addressing it does not affect the
129:47 - private address space ranges though even
129:50 - though the subnet mask is now fluid you
129:52 - still only have those range of addresses
129:55 - available and with the introduction of
129:57 - classless addressing subnetting is now
130:01 - possible and it's highly desirable so
130:04 - let's take a look at how cider notation
130:07 - works and we'll begin with
130:10 - 192.168.0 N with a subnet mask of
130:17 - 255.255.0.0 is
130:20 - 192.168.0
130:23 - N24 that
130:25 - sl24 represents all of the ones in the
130:29 - subnet mask and that's those first three
130:31 - octets on the left the
130:44 - 255.255.255.0
130:47 - 255.0.0.0 but it now becomes fluid with
130:49 - cider we can take it and we can make it
130:52 - a
130:53 - 192.168.1
130:55 - 128.0
130:57 - sl23 and what that really represents
130:59 - that sl23 is a subnet mask of
131:04 - 255.255
131:06 - 128.0 and that gives us a network of
131:10 - 192.168.1
131:12 - 128.0 which actually gives us a Host
131:15 - range of 192 .1
131:19 - 1681
131:22 - 1281 through
131:25 - 192.168.1 129. 254 that gives us
131:31 - 512 host addresses as opposed to the
131:35 - possible
131:37 - 254 now the broadcast address for that
131:40 - Network would be
131:43 - 192.168.1 129.
131:46 - 255 so now let's move on on to
131:48 - subnetting ipv4 addresses so what is
131:52 - subnetting well subnetting Cuts address
131:55 - spaces into smaller pieces it takes one
131:58 - range of addresses and splits it this
132:01 - creates flexibility and network design
132:04 - and creates efficiency in address space
132:08 - utilization so let's take a look at an
132:10 - example of subnetting and this will
132:13 - involve a small office Network so
132:17 - originally we have a network address of
132:21 - 22315
132:24 - 1.024 this is a Class C private Network
132:28 - and it gives us a possible
132:31 - 254 hosts available why only
132:35 - 254 well because a host cannot be
132:38 - assigned to the network address which is
132:41 - 22315
132:42 - 1.0 and it can't use the broadcast
132:45 - address which is 22315
132:49 - 15.125 in this example with this network
132:52 - address all the hosts in the network can
132:55 - see all the other nodes now let's say
132:58 - that for security considerations you
133:00 - want to split this into two networks
133:04 - well you can do this using subnetting so
133:07 - what you do is you take that sl24
133:09 - Network and you create
133:12 - two25 networks and those would be
133:15 - 22315 1.0 25 and
133:21 - 22351 do1
133:23 - 12825 in this situation the first
133:26 - Network's host address range would be
133:31 - 22351 up through
133:34 - 22315 do11 126 and why is that well
133:38 - because you can't use the network
133:40 - address which is
133:42 - 22315 1.0 and you can't use the
133:46 - broadcast address which is is
133:49 - 22351
133:51 - 1227 the second address range that would
133:53 - be created through this subnetting
133:56 - process would give us a Host range of
133:59 - 22315 do11 129 up through
134:04 - 22315
134:06 - 1.254 that's because you can't use the
134:09 - network address which is
134:12 - 22351 1228 and you can't use the
134:15 - broadcast address which is to
134:20 - 23151
134:21 - 255 each of those subnets would have
134:26 - 126 possible host addresses so you took
134:30 - your possible
134:31 - 254 hosts available in one network and
134:35 - you broke it down so that that you now
134:37 - have two separate networks each that's
134:40 - capable of having 126 hosts and that's
134:44 - an example of subnetting an ipv4 address
134:48 - now that concludes this session on the
134:50 - introduction to ipv4 part two I talked
134:54 - about classes of ipv4
134:58 - addresses I then moved on to classless
135:01 - ipv4 addressing and we concluded with a
135:05 - brief discussion on subnetting ipv4
135:08 - addresses now on behalf of pace it thank
135:12 - you for watching this session and I look
135:14 - forward to doing another
135:16 - one
135:24 - good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to
135:27 - pait's session on the introduction to
135:30 - IPv6 today we're going to be talking
135:33 - about the IPv6 address structure and
135:36 - then we're going to move on to
135:38 - IPv6 Network
135:41 - transmissions and with that let's go
135:43 - ahead and begin this session of course
135:46 - I'm going to begin by by talking about
135:48 - the IPv6 address structure now IPv6 is
135:53 - the answer to the question of what do we
135:56 - do about running out of ipv4 addresses
135:59 - unlike ipv4 IPv6 will provide enough
136:03 - Internet Protocol IP addresses for the
136:07 - foreseeable future now shortly after the
136:10 - creation of
136:11 - ipv4 and its
136:13 - implementation the the organization
136:17 - that's tasked with assigning routable IP
136:20 - addresses realized the available ipv4
136:24 - address space would not be enough in
136:27 - very short order if nothing was done the
136:29 - an then set about creating the
136:32 - replacement and they initially started
136:34 - by working on
136:36 - ipv5 while they were working on ipv5
136:39 - they found that due to the popularity of
136:42 - the internet which was increasing at
136:44 - that point in time that it wasn't going
136:46 - to be enough so they scrapped ipv5 and
136:49 - began working on
136:51 - IPv6 now the I is confident that IPv6
136:56 - will function as the replacement for
136:59 - ipv4 for many decades to come why are
137:03 - they so confident well we'll get to that
137:05 - here in just a moment now IPv6 works at
137:09 - layer three of the OSI model just like
137:11 - ipv4 does layer three of the OSI model
137:15 - is also known as the network layer
137:18 - and its major focus is logical Network
137:21 - and host addressing ipv 6's job is to
137:25 - provide logical Network and host
137:28 - addressing to devices IPv6 is a
137:32 - 128bit binary addressing scheme as
137:35 - opposed to ipv 4's 32 bits the 128 bits
137:41 - are grouped together in sets with each
137:44 - set being separated by a colon now each
137:47 - of these sets is 2 bytes long and a bite
137:51 - is 8 Bits for human readability kind of
137:54 - the binary IPv6 number is converted to
137:58 - hexadecimal that's base 16 with each
138:01 - hexadecimal number being equal to four
138:04 - bits now those four bits can actually be
138:07 - referred to as a nibble because it's
138:10 - half of a bite and IPv6 address is eight
138:14 - sets of four hexadecimal numbers each
138:17 - being separated by a colon that means
138:20 - that there are over
138:21 - 340 undecillion addresses available to
138:26 - IPv6 that's 2 to the 128 power which is
138:30 - roughly equal to 340 * 10 to the 36th
138:37 - power see that number there I'm not even
138:40 - going to begin to read that one to you
138:43 - so now let's talk about ipv 6's local ad
138:47 - address structure for the local address
138:51 - the first 64 bits on the left represent
138:54 - the local network and the last 64 bits
138:58 - on the right always represent the host
139:01 - the local address structure follows the
139:03 - eui or extended unique identifier format
139:08 - specifically the eui 64 format for those
139:12 - hosts that have a 48-bit MAC address
139:16 - that 48 bits is actually padded with an
139:19 - extra 16 bits to make it 64 bits in
139:22 - length you can always tell a local
139:25 - address which is also called the link
139:27 - local address as it always begins with
139:30 - an fe80 with IPv6 every device gets both
139:35 - a local address and it gets a global
139:38 - address now the global address is unique
139:41 - there is only one and every device gets
139:45 - one the host address is still always the
139:49 - last 64 bits but every device actually
139:53 - gets assigned to a Global Network the
139:56 - network portion is actually composed of
139:59 - a routing prefix and a subnet this
140:02 - portion of the global address structure
140:05 - follows the classless in domain routing
140:08 - or cider convention with the number that
140:11 - follows the slash denoting the routing
140:14 - prefix that's the part of the extremely
140:16 - Global Network that you belong to the
140:19 - subnet is composed of the bits between
140:21 - the prefix and the eui 64 host address
140:26 - Global IPv6 addresses always begin in
140:29 - the range of 2,000 up through
140:34 - 3,999 in that first group of numbers on
140:38 - the left now in most cases the need for
140:41 - dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP
140:45 - has been eliminated when implemented
140:48 - IPv6 will autoconfigure both the local
140:51 - and the global addresses that are
140:53 - required for their networks when a
140:56 - device first comes online it will use
140:59 - the neighbor Discovery protocol NDP to
141:02 - discover what the required Network
141:04 - addresses are both the local and Global
141:09 - addresses this allows devices to
141:11 - configure its own IPv6 address without
141:16 - an administrator's inter intervention so
141:18 - let's talk about IPv6 notation the
141:23 - 128bit nature of IPv6 makes it
141:26 - cumbersome to write out and it can take
141:28 - up unnecessary space because of this
141:31 - some rules were developed to ease the
141:33 - burden and save space when you're
141:35 - looking at a group of IPv6 numbers any
141:39 - leading zeros in a set can be dropped
141:42 - the thing to really remember about IPv6
141:46 - is that only a single set of consecutive
141:48 - zeros may be replaced with the double
141:51 - colon why is that well because if you
141:54 - could do it more than once how would
141:55 - routers and other devices know how many
141:58 - zeros to pad in there even with this
142:00 - ability to shorten it it's still
142:03 - difficult for us to remember IPv6
142:07 - addresses but it is still easier to
142:09 - write out and it still conserves space
142:12 - within systems now let's move on to
142:15 - types of ipv 6 Network
142:19 - transmissions and we begin with the
142:21 - unicast unicast is on toone
142:25 - communication that is where a specific
142:27 - device is sending Network traffic to
142:29 - another specific device unicast can
142:33 - occur on the local network which
142:35 - remember always begins with fe80 or it
142:38 - can occur on the global Network then
142:41 - there's multicast which is one to a few
142:44 - communication with multicast a specific
142:47 - device is sending Network traffic to a
142:50 - specific group of devices that have
142:53 - registered to receive that traffic
142:55 - routers register to receive multicast
142:58 - Transmissions that involve the routing
143:00 - protocols that they are programmed to
143:02 - use with IPv6 multicast addresses always
143:07 - begin with an FF both IPv6 and
143:11 - ipv4 use both unicast and multicast
143:15 - Transmissions a unique type of
143:18 - transmission to IPv6 is anycast anycast
143:23 - is one to the closest communication this
143:27 - is where a specific device is sending
143:29 - Network traffic to a specific IPv6
143:33 - address that has been assigned to
143:36 - multiple devices the router only sends
143:39 - the communication to the closest one at
143:42 - least from its perspective any cast
143:46 - transmission involves implementing DHCP
143:50 - V6 earlier I said we really don't need
143:53 - to worry about DHCP anymore but that's
143:56 - only partially true while IPv6 is
143:58 - capable of autoc configuring its own
144:01 - local and Global addresses in certain
144:03 - situations that's not always desirable
144:07 - DHCP V6 version 6 can be configured to
144:11 - hand out specific IPv6 addresses or
144:15 - duplicate IPv6 addresses when necessary
144:19 - that's useful for when load balancing a
144:21 - network or when Network redundancy has
144:23 - been created or when you have a user
144:26 - that has a tablet a cell phone and a
144:29 - laptop and you want to deliver the
144:31 - transmission to the closest device the
144:34 - device that he's using at that point in
144:36 - time that is where DHCP V6 comes in
144:40 - handy IPv6 and ipv4 are not compatible
144:45 - but we can do what's called a dual stack
144:48 - configuration that's where the network
144:50 - and devices on the network receive both
144:52 - an IPv6 configuration and an ipv4
144:57 - configuration or we can use what's
144:59 - called tunneling there's 6 to4 tunneling
145:02 - which is used to encapsulate an IPv6
145:05 - data packet and an ipv4 datagram
145:09 - allowing that IPv6 packet to travel
145:12 - across or through an all ipv4 Network 6
145:16 - to4 tunneling can also be called too
145:19 - tunneling now that concludes this
145:22 - session on the introduction to
145:24 - IPv6 I talked about the IPv6 address
145:28 - structure and then I talked about IPv6
145:31 - Network Transmissions now on behalf of
145:34 - pace it thank you for watching this
145:36 - session and I'm sure I'll do another one
145:42 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
145:46 - to casit session on special IP
145:50 - networking Concepts today I'm going to
145:52 - be talking about the media Access
145:55 - Control address and then I'm going to
145:57 - talk about the difference between
145:59 - Collision domains and broadcast domains
146:02 - and we're going to conclude with types
146:05 - of network
146:06 - Transmissions there's a whole bunch of
146:08 - technical information to cover so let's
146:11 - go ahead and begin this session let's
146:14 - begin the formal part of this session by
146:16 - discuss assing the media Access Control
146:20 - address all networking interfaces come
146:23 - with their own special address already
146:27 - configured that would be the media
146:29 - Access Control address the MAC address
146:34 - the MAC address is often referred to as
146:37 - the physical address or the burned in
146:40 - address of the interface while Mac
146:43 - addresses may be changed or spoofed
146:47 - most often it's set by the manufacturer
146:51 - and never actually changes now switches
146:54 - and other OSI layer 2 devices rely upon
146:59 - that Mac address in order to get network
147:02 - packets to their correct
147:05 - destinations the MAC address has a
147:08 - specific format actually it has two
147:12 - specific formats one is 48 bits in
147:15 - length and the other is 64 bits in
147:17 - length and both of them are represented
147:21 - by hexadecimal numbers both formats can
147:24 - be broken down into two parts the
147:27 - organizationally unique identifier or
147:30 - UI and the extended unique identifier
147:34 - the eui The Institute of electrical and
147:38 - electronic Engineers the it Triple E
147:41 - assigns all electronic
147:44 - manufacturers their own
147:47 - oui which always makes up the first
147:50 - portion of the MAC address each
147:54 - manufacturer then assigns its own eui to
147:58 - each device that is produced usually it
148:01 - is the serial number of that device
148:04 - theoretically no two interfaces will
148:07 - have the same Mac address I need to
148:11 - mention the eui 64 format IPv6 requires
148:17 - that the node address or the MAC address
148:19 - be in an eui 64 format so that Mac
148:24 - address has to be 64 bits in length if
148:28 - the eui of the interface is only 24 bits
148:31 - in length it is actually split into two
148:34 - parts and 16 bits of padding are added
148:37 - to create the eui 64 format now let's
148:43 - discuss the difference between Collision
148:45 - domains and broadcast
148:48 - domains before I can talk about
148:50 - Collision domains and broadcast domains
148:53 - I need to talk about carrier sense
148:55 - multiple access with Collision detection
148:59 - all ethernet networks use this
149:02 - technology also called csma with CD when
149:07 - transmitting data in an Ethernet Network
149:10 - all ethernet devices have equal access
149:13 - to the network media and are capable of
149:16 - transmitting data at any time this can
149:20 - lead to data collisions with csmac CD a
149:24 - device listens to the carrier signal on
149:27 - the network media if no other device is
149:30 - transmitting the device is free to send
149:33 - data if another device sends data at the
149:36 - same time a collision is possible which
149:39 - can corrupt the data the devices listen
149:42 - for collisions that's the Collision
149:45 - detection part if a collision occurs the
149:48 - devices will stop transmitting and wait
149:51 - a random period of time before
149:53 - attempting to transmit again to do this
149:56 - they use what is called a backoff
149:59 - algorithm with that out of the way now
150:02 - let me explain what Collision domains
150:04 - are Collision domains are an area of the
150:08 - network where packets or network traffic
150:11 - can Collide there are some devices that
150:14 - break up Collision domains they can be
150:16 - broken up by switches Bridges and
150:19 - routers but not by hubs on the other
150:22 - hand a broadcast domain is defined as
150:26 - all the nodes that can be reached by a
150:28 - broadcast transmission all the nodes
150:31 - that can be reached reside in the same
150:34 - network broadcast traffic cannot pass
150:38 - routers so the domain is also defined by
150:41 - the subnet mask and that subnet mask
150:44 - defines the network here's a special
150:47 - note technically IPv6 does not use
150:51 - broadcast Transmissions IPv6 replaces
150:55 - broadcast Transmissions with multicast
151:00 - transmissions and what do you know
151:02 - that's a good segue for us to discuss
151:05 - types of network
151:07 - Transmissions we're going to begin this
151:09 - section by talking about types of
151:12 - ipv4 network transmissions and first up
151:16 - is
151:16 - unicast unicast is a specific Source
151:20 - address transmission going to a specific
151:24 - Source destination address it can be
151:27 - thought of as on toone communication
151:30 - it's only two devices transferring data
151:33 - between each other then there's
151:35 - multicast transmission this is where a
151:38 - specific Source address transmission is
151:41 - going to a set of registered destination
151:45 - addresses this is one to a few
151:49 - communication routers often use
151:51 - multicast
151:53 - Transmissions to track their routes and
151:56 - to make changes to their routing tables
151:59 - and finally there are broadcast
152:02 - Transmissions this is where a specific
152:04 - Source address transmission is going to
152:07 - all addresses on the local network this
152:11 - can be considered as one to all
152:14 - communication because all devices on the
152:17 - local network are going to be able to
152:20 - receive this broadcast transmission so
152:23 - let's move on to types of IPv6 Network
152:27 - transmissions and IPv6 uses unicast just
152:32 - like ipv4 does IPv6 also uses
152:37 - multicast just like
152:40 - ipv4 where IPv6 differs is with any cast
152:44 - transmission any cast is where a
152:47 - specific Source address transmission is
152:50 - going to a specific IPv6 address that
152:54 - has been assigned to multiple devices
152:57 - the router uses an algorithm to
153:00 - determine which Mac address that has
153:03 - that specially configured IPv6 address
153:06 - is closest and only that device receives
153:10 - the anycast transmission anycast can be
153:13 - considered as one to the closest
153:17 - communication that concludes this
153:19 - session on special IP networking
153:22 - Concepts I talked about the MAC address
153:26 - I talked about the differences between a
153:28 - collision domain and a broadcast domain
153:31 - and then I concluded with a discussion
153:34 - on the types of network transmission now
153:37 - on behalf of pace it thank you for
153:39 - watching this session and I look forward
153:42 - to doing another
153:45 - one
153:46 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
153:50 - pait's session on introduction to
153:53 - routing Concepts part one today I'm
153:56 - going to talk about the purpose of
153:58 - routing and then I'm going to move on to
154:00 - some basic routing Concepts there's a
154:03 - fair amount of ground to cover so let's
154:05 - go ahead and begin this
154:07 - session first up is the purpose of
154:11 - routing the basic purpose of routing is
154:14 - to connect different networ NWS together
154:17 - to allow them to communicate and pass
154:19 - data traffic between them most often
154:22 - routing Protocols are how networks
154:25 - determine where to send Network traffic
154:28 - that's the routes that they will take
154:30 - and these routing protocols build Maps
154:33 - actually they build routing tables but
154:35 - we'll get to that later that they use
154:38 - for directing Network traffic routing is
154:41 - what makes this interconnected World
154:43 - function as well as it does
154:46 - networking would be pure chaos without
154:49 - it as we'd have no idea where to send
154:52 - traffic now let's move on to some basic
154:56 - routing
154:57 - Concepts first up is static routing
155:00 - static routing uses administrator
155:03 - defined routes each router in a static
155:06 - routing configuration must contain the
155:09 - route a static route from router a to
155:13 - router B requires that router B has a
155:16 - static route back to router a in order
155:20 - for two-way communication to take place
155:23 - if we had a static route from A to B and
155:26 - B didn't have one back to a a could send
155:29 - traffic to B but B could not send
155:32 - traffic back to a now static routing is
155:35 - easy to set up in small networks but
155:38 - it's not so easy to maintain networks
155:41 - change all the time with static routing
155:44 - when a change occurs in routers the
155:47 - administrator has to go around to each
155:49 - router and Implement that change then
155:52 - there's Dynamic routing this is where
155:55 - routers use protocols in order to
155:58 - determine the best route between two
156:00 - networks the administrator determines
156:03 - which protocols will be used on the
156:05 - routers in order for the routers to
156:08 - communicate they must all be using the
156:10 - same protocols there is an exception to
156:13 - that and that's route redistribution
156:16 - an administrator can configure a router
156:19 - to take one Dynamic protocol and
156:22 - transform it into a different routing
156:25 - protocol to be used from that point on
156:28 - this is the only case when routing
156:30 - protocols can be different across the
156:32 - network routing protocols can be stacked
156:35 - within a router that means that there
156:37 - can be more than one Dynamic routing
156:40 - protocol programmed into a router
156:42 - Dynamic routing is very fluid and
156:46 - Dynamic and it's what makes possible
156:48 - today's interconnected world the next
156:52 - concept is the default route the default
156:55 - route is the direction that a router
156:57 - will send Network traffic when there is
156:59 - no known route in the routing table the
157:03 - default route is assigned by an
157:05 - administrator it is usually a designated
157:08 - interface on the router or it is the
157:11 - next designated next hop interface then
157:15 - then there is the routing table the
157:18 - routing table is a list of known routes
157:21 - to all known networks from the router's
157:25 - perspective it is established by an
157:27 - administrator when static routing is
157:30 - used it is dynamically built by routing
157:33 - protocols when Dynamic routing is
157:36 - employed each routing protocol maintains
157:40 - its own routing table different routing
157:43 - protocols may have different routes to
157:46 - the same network the loop back interface
157:50 - is an administratively configured
157:52 - logical number assigned to a router to
157:55 - ease administrative functions or routing
157:59 - processes often the loop back interface
158:02 - is assigned in an ipv4 address format
158:06 - even when ipv4 isn't used on the router
158:10 - many routing protocols have been
158:12 - designed to take the loop back interface
158:15 - into a
158:16 - when performing administrative functions
158:19 - the loop back interface may be
158:21 - completely logical or a physical
158:24 - interface may be assigned to be the loop
158:26 - back interface let's move on to routing
158:29 - Loops a routing Loop is a possible
158:32 - problem that can be created if
158:34 - interconnected routers have a breakdown
158:37 - in their routing algorithms when a
158:39 - routing Loop occurs Network traffic
158:42 - keeps looping through the routers until
158:44 - some system or mechanism breaks the
158:47 - cycle routing Loops can create network
158:50 - congestion or even bring down a network
158:53 - routing protocols use multiple methods
158:56 - to prevent routing Loops from occurring
158:59 - one of the main methods that they use is
159:01 - What's called the time to live field or
159:04 - the TTL field the TTL field keeps track
159:08 - of how long that packet has been in
159:11 - existence and how far it has traveled
159:13 - and after a specified amount of time or
159:16 - distance it will inform the next router
159:19 - to drop it this helps to prevent routing
159:23 - Loops that concludes this session on the
159:27 - introduction to routing Concepts part
159:30 - one I talked about the purpose of
159:33 - routing and then I moved on to some
159:35 - basic routing Concepts now on behalf of
159:39 - pacit thank you for watching this
159:42 - session and I look forward to doing
159:44 - another one
159:53 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
159:56 - pait's session on introduction to
159:59 - routing Concepts part two today I'm
160:02 - going to be talking about routing
160:04 - metrics routing aggregation and then I'm
160:07 - going to conclude with a brief
160:09 - discussion on high availability we have
160:12 - a fair amount of ground to cover not a
160:15 - whole lot of time so let's go ahead and
160:17 - begin this session of course I'm going
160:20 - to begin by talking about routing
160:23 - metrics it is quite common for there to
160:25 - be more than one route available to a
160:29 - remote Network routing protocols use
160:32 - metrics to determine which route is the
160:36 - best route to reach those remote
160:38 - networks each routing protocol will use
160:41 - its own set of metrics in determining
160:44 - which routes to which networks are
160:47 - placed in its routing table the same
160:49 - basic metric may be used by different
160:52 - routing protocols but when this occurs
160:55 - the metric is usually implemented in a
160:58 - different manner through the use of
161:01 - different
161:02 - algorithms the first metric that we're
161:04 - going to discuss is the hop count the
161:08 - hop count is the number of routers
161:11 - between two end points this is
161:13 - determined from the center router's
161:16 - perspective the maximum transmission
161:19 - unit or MTU is another metric that is
161:22 - used by routing protocols the MTU is the
161:26 - maximum allowed size of a packet
161:29 - measured in bytes that's allowed through
161:32 - an interface the standard MTU for
161:35 - ethernet is 1,500 bytes packets that
161:39 - exceed the MTU must be fragmented into
161:43 - smaller pieces leading leading to more
161:46 - packets leading to a slower connection
161:49 - bandwidth is another common routing
161:52 - metric bandwidth is a measure of the
161:55 - speed of the network connection the
161:58 - speed is commonly measured in either
162:00 - kilobits per second megabits per second
162:04 - or gigabits per second another common
162:07 - metric is latency latency is a measure
162:11 - of time that a packet takes to Traverse
162:14 - a length
162:15 - when latency is implemented by routing
162:18 - protocols the total amount of latency or
162:21 - delay to go in to end between two points
162:25 - is what is used in the metric the
162:29 - administrative distance or add is
162:32 - probably the most important metric
162:34 - that's used on routers the
162:37 - administrative distance is the
162:40 - believability of a routing protocol's
162:43 - advertised routes different routing
162:46 - Protocols are considered to be more
162:49 - believable or trustworthy than others
162:52 - routers use the ad to help determine
162:56 - which routing protocol to use when more
162:58 - than one protocol is installed on the
163:01 - router the lowest ad of an advertised
163:04 - route will determine the protocol that's
163:07 - used there are some common standard
163:10 - administrative distance first up is the
163:14 - directly connected route that's a direct
163:16 - link between two routers that has an ad
163:20 - of zero and it is the most believable or
163:24 - trustworthy of routes next is the
163:27 - statically configured route it has an ad
163:30 - of One external border Gateway protocol
163:34 - has an ad of 20 it's still fairly
163:37 - trustworthy internal
163:39 - eigrp has an ad of 90 it's not as
163:43 - trustworthy as BG GP but it is more
163:47 - trustworthy than ospf open shortest path
163:51 - first which has an ad of 110
163:56 - Isis has an ad of
163:59 - 115 so not quite as believable as ospf
164:03 - but more believable than rip which has
164:06 - an ad of 120 external
164:10 - eigrp has an ad of 170 and internal bgp
164:16 - and I've never seen internal bgp used
164:20 - has an ad of 200 now if you see an
164:23 - administrative distance of
164:25 - 255 that means that that route is not
164:29 - believable at all as a side note the ad
164:33 - can be set by an administrator so if you
164:36 - are running both ospf and Isis on a
164:40 - router but you want Isis to be used you
164:44 - could actually set
164:46 - osf's ad to a higher number than Isis
164:51 - and then Isis would always be used
164:54 - before
164:56 - ospf now let's move on to Route
164:59 - aggregation without some mechanism put
165:02 - in place routing tables would soon
165:04 - become very large and highly inefficient
165:07 - through careful Planning Network
165:09 - administrators use a process called
165:12 - route aggregation to condense the sign
165:15 - of routing tables they do so through the
165:18 - use of classless interdomain routing CER
165:22 - to summarize routes to different
165:24 - networks route aggregation is common in
165:29 - networking let's take a look at an
165:31 - example of Route
165:33 - aggregation suppose we have a router
165:36 - that has the following networks on its
165:39 - serial
165:40 - 0/1 interface it has
165:44 - 10.1.1
165:45 - 024 known on that interface 10.1.1 17.0
165:51 - sl24
165:54 - 101320 sl24 and
165:58 - 10.1.1
166:00 - 128.0
166:01 - sl24 all of those networks are known to
166:05 - that interface that
166:08 - S01 interface these routes are what are
166:11 - known as contiguous routes they're all
166:14 - in a line
166:15 - they can be summarized or aggregated by
166:18 - a common cider entry in the routing
166:21 - table they could all be summarized by
166:24 - the following entry
166:27 - 10.1.0
166:29 - sl16 now there is a warning about route
166:32 - aggregation route aggregation takes
166:35 - careful planning during the network
166:37 - design phase that above example would
166:40 - not work if the serial interface 1/1 on
166:45 - on that same router was connected to
166:47 - network
166:50 - 10.1.2
166:52 - sl24 because that new network makes
166:55 - those networks on on the 01 interface
167:00 - noncontiguous
167:01 - networks All the known networks are no
167:04 - longer all in a road this leads to the
167:07 - fact that the routes could no longer be
167:09 - aggregated or
167:11 - summarized let's conclude with a
167:13 - discussion on high
167:15 - availability part of a network
167:17 - administrator's job is to ensure that
167:20 - networks remain up and active for the
167:23 - maximum amount of time in an effort to
167:25 - ensure that networks don't go down
167:28 - administrators often remove single
167:31 - points of failure a single point of
167:33 - failure in a network is the point where
167:36 - a single failure will cause the network
167:39 - to cease functioning Network
167:41 - administrators often use high
167:43 - availability techniques in order to
167:46 - remove those single points of failure an
167:49 - example of a high availability technique
167:52 - is the use of redundant links to outside
167:55 - networks hot standby router protocol
167:59 - hsrp is a specific example of a high
168:04 - availability technique hsrp is a
168:07 - proprietary Cisco method of creating a
168:10 - fault tolerant link using two or more
168:14 - routers with connections outside of the
168:16 - local subnet the two routers are
168:19 - connected together as well as having
168:22 - connections outside of the local network
168:25 - a virtual IP address is created and
168:28 - shared between the two routers devices
168:31 - on the network are configured to use
168:33 - that virtual IP address as their default
168:37 - gateway for packets leaving the network
168:40 - if a single router goes down the link
168:43 - outside of the network is still
168:45 - available another high availability
168:47 - technique is Virtual Router redundancy
168:50 - protocol
168:52 - vrp it is an ietf internet engineering
168:56 - task force standard that is similar in
168:59 - operation to
169:02 - hsrp that concludes this session on the
169:06 - introduction to routing Concepts part
169:08 - two I discussed some routing metrics
169:12 - then I moved on to Route aggregation
169:15 - and I concluded with a brief discussion
169:17 - on high
169:19 - availability on behalf of pace it thank
169:22 - you for watching this session and I look
169:24 - forward to doing some
169:35 - more hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
169:39 - to pait's session on the introduction to
169:42 - routing protocols today we're going to
169:44 - be talking talking about some of the
169:45 - differences between interior and
169:48 - exterior Gateway routing protocols we
169:51 - will introduce some more routing
169:53 - Concepts and then we will end with
169:56 - routing protocols in themselves there's
169:59 - a whole lot of stuff to cover so let's
170:01 - go ahead and jump into this session
170:05 - let's begin with a comparison between
170:08 - interior and exterior Gateway
170:11 - protocols interior Gateway protocols or
170:15 - igps are a category of protocols used
170:19 - within autonomous networks autonomous
170:21 - networks are networks that you control
170:24 - or that are under the control of a
170:26 - single organization the most popular igp
170:30 - Protocols are OSF open shortest path
170:34 - first and rip version two that's routing
170:39 - information protocol version two now
170:43 - there is a special mention here and
170:45 - that's
170:46 - Isis which is intermediate system to
170:49 - intermediate system Isis is popular with
170:53 - extremely large autonomous networks like
170:57 - an isps or internet service providers
171:01 - Network exterior Gateway protocols on
171:04 - the other hand are a category of
171:06 - protocols used between nonautonomous
171:10 - networks so egps are used between
171:13 - Networks that are controlled by
171:16 - different organizations or entities the
171:19 - most popular EGP protocol is border
171:22 - Gateway protocol now it's not uncommon
171:26 - for organizations to have more than one
171:29 - network that they are routing traffic
171:31 - between these are called autonomous
171:34 - networks some igp routing protocols use
171:37 - an administrator defined autonomous
171:41 - system number or as number as one means
171:45 - of identifying which networks can
171:47 - directly communicate with each other the
171:50 - autonomous system number is not a metric
171:53 - but a means of identifying a network
171:55 - that might possibly accept another
171:58 - Network's traffic something to remember
172:00 - is that the as is only significant
172:04 - within autonomous networks and has no
172:07 - relevance outside of them now let's move
172:10 - on to more routing Concepts routing
172:14 - protocols can be classified by how they
172:17 - perform their routing interior Gateway
172:20 - and EGP routing protocols can be broken
172:24 - out into three other categories of
172:27 - protocols which is designated by their
172:29 - main method of determining routes
172:32 - between networks the first class of
172:35 - routing Protocols are distance Vector
172:38 - routing protocols with distant Vector
172:41 - routing protocols the the routes are
172:43 - determined by by how many routers exist
172:46 - between the source and the destination
172:49 - the efficiency of the links in the
172:52 - selected route is not taken into
172:54 - consideration with distance Vector
172:56 - protocols periodically the whole routing
172:59 - table is broadcast out onto the network
173:03 - then there are link state routing
173:05 - protocols metrics are used to determine
173:08 - the best possible route between
173:10 - destinations doesn't really matter how
173:12 - many hops there are
173:14 - once the route has been established
173:16 - these protocols then only monitor the
173:20 - state of directly connected links and
173:22 - only make changes to their routing
173:24 - tables when changes to the links occur
173:28 - with link state routing protocols only
173:30 - changes in link status are broadcasted
173:34 - and finally there are hybrid routing
173:37 - protocols these use aspects of both the
173:40 - distance vector and Link state routing
173:43 - protocol
173:45 - let's talk about the next hop the next
173:49 - hop is the next router in the path
173:52 - between two points the next hop is often
173:56 - designated by an interface address of
173:59 - the device that is receiving the data or
174:02 - by that router's name or by that
174:05 - router's location the routing table is
174:08 - the database table that is used by a
174:11 - router to determine the best possible
174:14 - route between two points different
174:16 - routing protocols use different
174:19 - algorithms to place routes in the
174:21 - routing table the next concept is
174:25 - Convergence convergence can be thought
174:27 - of as steady state convergence is
174:30 - measured in the amount of time that it
174:33 - takes all of the routers in an
174:35 - autonomous system to learn all of the
174:38 - possible routes within that system
174:41 - faster convergence
174:43 - times
174:46 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
174:49 - Pace it session on basic elements of
174:53 - unified Communications today I'm going
174:55 - to be talking about unified
174:57 - Communications and then I'm going to
174:59 - move on to some unified communication
175:01 - Concepts and then I'm going to end with
175:04 - voice over IP and with that let's go
175:07 - ahead and begin this session of course I
175:11 - will begin this session by talking about
175:13 - Unified
175:14 - communication now unified Communications
175:18 - is not encompassed by a single product
175:20 - or device it's a growing category in the
175:25 - Enterprise Network unified communication
175:27 - or UC is the set of products and
175:30 - services that attempts to provide a
175:33 - consistent single user interface and
175:36 - experience across different media types
175:39 - and different devices UC allows a user
175:42 - to send a message from one type of media
175:45 - as an email and have that media received
175:49 - as a different type of media that email
175:52 - could become a text message or a
175:56 - voicemail so now let's talk about some
175:59 - unified communication devices first up
176:02 - is the UC server these are specialized
176:06 - servers which quite often are virtual in
176:09 - nature that are designed to implement
176:12 - unified communication solution Solutions
176:14 - in the workplace the UC servers work in
176:18 - conjunction with UC gateways a UC
176:21 - Gateway is a network device that is
176:24 - designed to translate between different
176:26 - signaling methods as in a voice over IP
176:30 - Gateway which will translate an analog
176:33 - public switched telephone Network voice
176:36 - signal into a signal that can be
176:38 - understood on the VoIP Network there are
176:42 - some other UC devices
176:44 - any device that can be used in the
176:47 - implementation of a unified
176:49 - communication solution is considered a
176:52 - UC device they may include but are not
176:55 - limited to VoIP phones email systems
176:59 - video conferencing systems and instant
177:02 - messaging
177:04 - networks now let's move on to some
177:07 - unified Communications Concepts the
177:11 - first concept that we're going to
177:12 - discuss is presence
177:14 - now presence is an indicator that is
177:17 - used to communicate the willingness or
177:19 - ability of a user to accept
177:22 - communication common presence statuses
177:25 - include available online offline busy
177:29 - and do not disturb present services are
177:32 - an important service provided in UC
177:35 - Solutions as they will track the
177:38 - individual users across multiple devices
177:42 - and networks in real time through the
177:44 - use of multicast Transmissions once a
177:48 - communication session has been
177:50 - established multicast communication is
177:53 - dropped and unicast network
177:55 - Transmissions are used another UC
177:59 - concept that you need to grasp is
178:01 - quality of service quality of service
178:04 - techniques are implemented to improve
178:06 - unified communication by managing
178:09 - Network traffic the most common
178:12 - implementation of quality of service is
178:15 - class of service cosos cosos is a
178:20 - quality of service technique that's used
178:22 - to manage Network traffic by grouping
178:25 - similar types of traffic and assigning a
178:28 - network priority to that traffic as in
178:32 - unified communication traffic is given a
178:34 - higher priority than email a six-bit
178:38 - differentiated service code point dscp
178:41 - is used in the IP header to establish
178:45 - the cosos or class of
178:48 - service now let's move on to voice over
178:52 - IP VoIP is one of the most common
178:54 - implementations in a unified
178:57 - Communications solution through the use
178:59 - of a present service calls can be routed
179:03 - to the correct location for where the
179:06 - user is at two important protocols used
179:09 - in voice over IP are session initiation
179:13 - protocol Sip and realtime transport
179:17 - protocol
179:19 - RTP sip has two purposes first it is
179:23 - used to establish a communication
179:25 - session between two endpoints the other
179:28 - purpose is that once the session is
179:31 - completed sip tears down that connection
179:35 - between the two end points during the
179:38 - communication session RTP is used as the
179:42 - transport call helping to provide that
179:45 - quality of service through
179:48 - cosos to the
179:50 - endpoints now that concludes this
179:53 - session on the basic elements of unified
179:56 - communication I talked about unified
179:59 - Communications then I moved on to some
180:01 - unified communication Concepts and I
180:04 - concluded with a brief discussion on
180:08 - voice over IP now on behalf of pace it
180:12 - thank you for watching this session and
180:14 - I hope you watch another one
180:21 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
180:24 - welcome to Pace it session on
180:27 - virtualization Technologies today I'm
180:30 - going to be discussing the difference
180:31 - between a hypervisor and virtual machine
180:34 - manager then I'm going to move on to
180:37 - components of virtualization and then
180:39 - I'm going to have a brief discussion on
180:42 - softwar defined networking I have a
180:45 - whole lot of information to impart not a
180:48 - whole lot of time so let's go ahead and
180:50 - begin this session of course I'm going
180:53 - to begin with hypervisors and virtual
180:56 - machine
180:57 - managers so what is the difference
181:00 - between a hypervisor and a virtual
181:02 - machine manager the difference could be
181:05 - nothing or the difference could be
181:07 - everything some people use the term
181:10 - hypervisor very broadly they use it to
181:13 - refer to any of the software that is
181:15 - used to manage virtual machines others
181:19 - will differentiate between the two terms
181:21 - in this way a hypervisor does not need a
181:25 - host operating system while a virtual
181:28 - machine manager or vmm requires a host
181:32 - operating system such as Microsoft
181:35 - Windows Apple OS X or a Linux operating
181:40 - system well the hypervisor can operate
181:43 - as its own operating system with that
181:46 - covered let's talk about some of the
181:48 - components of
181:51 - virtualization first up is the virtual
181:53 - desktop a virtual desktop is a virtual
181:56 - machine or VM that functions as a
182:00 - desktop now any modern operating system
182:03 - can be run inside of a VM desktop
182:07 - multiple virtual desktops may be hosted
182:10 - on or from a single host system
182:14 - then there are virtual servers which
182:16 - surprisingly is a virtual machine that
182:19 - functions as a server any modern server
182:23 - operating system can be used in a
182:25 - virtual server environment multiple
182:29 - virtual servers may be hosted on or from
182:32 - a single host guess what there are then
182:35 - virtual switches firewalls and routers
182:38 - these are virtual machines that fulfill
182:40 - the functions of the switch firewall and
182:43 - router router virtual firewalls and
182:45 - routers are particularly effective when
182:48 - they're combined with virtual network
182:50 - interface controllers or virtual Nicks
182:54 - and virtual switches to create virtual
182:57 - networks speaking of virtual networks an
183:00 - important consideration for when
183:02 - designing a virtual network is how that
183:05 - virtual network is going to pass traffic
183:08 - to remote networks or networks outside
183:11 - of the host system virtual ization by
183:14 - its nature leads to either an open and
183:17 - highly scalable Network or a closed
183:20 - self-contained system it is possible to
183:23 - create a completely self-contained
183:25 - network with all of the virtual
183:27 - components and never have Network
183:31 - traffic leave the host machine but if
183:34 - there is a desire or need for that
183:36 - Network traffic to pass beyond the host
183:39 - system then that function needs to be
183:42 - specifically granted a connection must
183:44 - be created between the host systems
183:47 - physical Nick and the virtual networking
183:50 - equipment to allow Network traffic to
183:53 - pass through the physical host
183:56 - system next up softwar defined
184:00 - networking softwar defined networking or
184:03 - sdn is the process of allowing the
184:06 - administration and configuration of a
184:09 - network to be done dynamically with s
184:13 - the end the administrator uses a
184:15 - front-end program to make adjustments to
184:18 - the network this program sends the
184:21 - instructions to the networking equipment
184:24 - which is then reconfigured to perform as
184:27 - the administrator desires sdn can allow
184:31 - Network administrators to dynamically
184:33 - adjust Network performance without the
184:36 - need to log into each individual device
184:40 - that needs to be adjusted to achieve the
184:42 - desired performance sdn is considered to
184:46 - still be an emerging technology but sdn
184:50 - also works well for virtual networks and
184:53 - cloud computing now that concludes this
184:57 - session on virtualization
185:00 - technology I talked about hypervisors
185:03 - and virtual machine managers then I
185:05 - moved on to a brief discussion on some
185:08 - components of virtualization and I
185:11 - concluded with another brief discussion
185:14 - on softwar defined networking on behalf
185:17 - of pace it thank you for watching this
185:20 - session and I hope to do another one
185:28 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
185:32 - to pait's session on storage area
185:35 - networks today I'm going to discuss the
185:39 - justification for storage area networks
185:42 - and then I'm going to talk about storage
185:44 - area Network
185:46 - Technology and with that let's go ahead
185:49 - and begin this session of course I'm
185:52 - going to begin with justifications for
185:55 - storage area networks there have been
185:58 - several factors that have led to the
186:01 - increased demand for data storage one of
186:04 - them has been the dramatic decrease in
186:07 - the actual cost of data storage it
186:11 - actually costs us less now for storage
186:13 - on a per gigabyte basis than it has in
186:16 - the past what has happened is that as
186:19 - the cost of storage has decreased the
186:22 - demand for storage has increased
186:25 - dramatically businesses are now
186:27 - generating an analyzing huge amounts of
186:31 - data in an effort to create a
186:33 - competitive Advantage think big data I'm
186:36 - sure you've heard about Big Data
186:38 - recently or this increase in data
186:41 - collection has led to an increased
186:44 - demand for storage capacity another
186:47 - factor is that as the demand for data
186:49 - has increased it has needed to be more
186:52 - available which means that there has
186:55 - been a need to be able to access that
186:57 - data from anywhere and the accessibility
187:00 - is needed to be increased as well
187:02 - including from nonstandard devices a
187:06 - storage area network or san can be a
187:09 - solution to the need for both storage
187:12 - capacity and high
187:15 - availability there are several
187:17 - advantages to the storage area network
187:20 - first off is
187:22 - scalability the amount of data that is
187:24 - being generated today is huge this has
187:27 - led to a need to store that data the
187:31 - sand is more scalable than other options
187:34 - as your storage needs increase the
187:36 - capacity of the sand can be easily
187:39 - increased to meet that storage need then
187:42 - there's dat data availability the demand
187:45 - has also increased for that data to be
187:47 - available at any time from anywhere and
187:51 - a sand can play a vital role in creating
187:54 - that accessibility one of the most
187:56 - popular implementations of a sand is to
187:59 - deploy it as part of a cloud computing
188:03 - solution this increases the availability
188:07 - of that data that's being stored on the
188:09 - sand and finally there's optimization as
188:13 - the requirements to store data are
188:15 - removed from application servers those
188:18 - servers can then be optimized to run
188:21 - those applications much more efficiently
188:25 - at the same time data storage is also
188:28 - optimized it's time now to discuss some
188:31 - San
188:33 - technology the storage area network or
188:36 - san and the network attached storage or
188:39 - NZ often get confused with one another
188:43 - but they are different the sand is an
188:46 - actual network of devices that have the
188:49 - sole purpose of storing data efficiently
188:52 - on the other hand the NZ is a
188:55 - specifically designed Network appliance
188:58 - that has been configured to store data
189:00 - more efficiently than standard storage
189:03 - methods the difference is that a NZ is a
189:07 - data storage appliance that is placed on
189:09 - a network while a San is a network data
189:13 - storage devices it is not uncommon for a
189:16 - San to contain multiple NZ devices with
189:22 - all of that data storage capabilities
189:24 - several technologies have been developed
189:26 - to ease the transmission of that data
189:30 - the first one that we're going to
189:31 - discuss is fiber channel or FC fiber
189:35 - channel is a highe network technology
189:39 - that was originally developed to operate
189:41 - over fiber optic cables only since its
189:45 - introduction the standards have been
189:47 - modified to allow the use of copper
189:49 - cabling in conjunction with fiber optic
189:52 - cabling fiber channel is commonly used
189:56 - to connect to Sands when fiber channel
189:59 - is implemented it uses the fiber channel
190:03 - protocol or FCP as its transport
190:07 - protocol to transmit scuzzy commands so
190:10 - it transmits small computer system
190:13 - interface commands to storage devices as
190:16 - in the nas appliances so a San
190:20 - implements FCP as opposed to TCP as its
190:25 - transport protocol when fiber channel is
190:28 - used another technology that was
190:31 - developed was internet scuzzy or I
190:34 - scuzzy I scuzzy is an IP based
190:37 - networking standard that is used to
190:39 - connect data storage facilities and
190:41 - Sands I scuzzy allows for scuzzy
190:45 - commands and processes to take place
190:48 - over longer distances than the original
190:51 - scuzzy
190:53 - implementation jumbo frames are also
190:55 - allowed within the San environment jumbo
190:59 - frames allow for greater throughput of
191:01 - data by allowing up to 9,000 bytes of
191:04 - data to be in a single frame this can
191:08 - greatly increase the efficiency of a
191:10 - sand as a comparison the standard frame
191:13 - on an Ethernet Network can only be a
191:17 - maximum of 1,500
191:19 - bytes now that concludes this session on
191:23 - storage area networks I talked about the
191:26 - justification for storage area networks
191:29 - and then I concluded with a brief
191:31 - discussion on some San technology on
191:35 - behalf of pit thank you for watching
191:38 - this session and I hope you watch
191:40 - another one
191:41 - soon
191:48 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
191:51 - Pace it session on basic Cloud Concepts
191:55 - today we're going to be talking about
191:57 - Cloud
191:58 - classifications and then we will
192:00 - conclude with different types of cloud
192:03 - computing there's a fair amount of
192:05 - information to cover so let's go ahead
192:08 - and Dive Right In I will begin our
192:11 - session with a discussion about Cloud
192:15 - classifications cloud computing is where
192:18 - the resources on the network are not
192:21 - actually physical in nature they are
192:24 - provided to the enduser virtually cloud
192:28 - computing can lead to a very fluid and
192:31 - dynamic environment as the required
192:33 - resources are normally only provisioned
192:36 - or supplied as needed and are
192:39 - decommissioned or shut down once their
192:42 - use is is done most often these virtual
192:45 - resources are not owned by the company
192:48 - or user that uses them but are provided
192:51 - by a service provider while cloud
192:54 - computing is highly configurable and
192:56 - changeable it does have some basic
192:59 - structures that are used in the
193:02 - classification of the type of cloud that
193:04 - is in use the first classification of
193:08 - cloud computing that we're going to talk
193:10 - about is the public cloud this is where
193:13 - systems can interact with services and
193:17 - devices within the public cloud and on
193:20 - public networks like over the internet
193:23 - and possibly with other public clouds
193:26 - the public cloud is where the services
193:29 - that are provided are not just provided
193:32 - to a specific user but are open for the
193:35 - public to purchase and use then there
193:38 - are private clouds this is where systems
193:41 - only communicate with with services and
193:44 - devices within a specific private Cloud
193:48 - a private cloud is essentially just that
193:51 - private the only users who have access
193:54 - to it are ones who are authorized to use
193:57 - it the cloud classification can be
194:00 - hybrid it can combine aspects of both
194:02 - the public and private clouds and last
194:05 - up there are Community clouds this is
194:08 - where cloud services are used by private
194:11 - individuals organizations or groups that
194:15 - have a common
194:17 - interest now let's move on to different
194:19 - types of cloud
194:21 - computing because of the nature of cloud
194:24 - computing it is very configurable to the
194:26 - needs and desires of the purchaser of
194:29 - the cloud services purchasers have many
194:33 - options beyond the type of cloud
194:35 - services that they want to provision
194:37 - they must also determine what type of
194:40 - service they are going to require from
194:42 - the most basic of services to the most
194:45 - highly complex of services the purchaser
194:48 - needs to have a plan going into cloud
194:51 - computing in order for it to be
194:53 - efficient and effective for them so now
194:56 - let's move on to some of those services
194:59 - that cloud computing can offer first up
195:02 - is software as a service the enduser
195:05 - purchases the rights to use an
195:08 - application or software without the need
195:11 - to configure the virtual servers that
195:14 - will deliver the application to them it
195:16 - is usually delivered as a web app or web
195:19 - application opened and used from within
195:22 - a web browser but not always if you have
195:25 - a subscription to Microsoft Office
195:30 - 365 you are utilizing software as a
195:33 - service then there is platform as a
195:36 - service or
195:38 - paas the user is provided with a
195:41 - development platform platform for the
195:43 - creation of software packages without
195:46 - the need to configure the virtual
195:48 - servers and the infrastructure that
195:50 - delivers it you are essentially renting
195:53 - server or computing power in order to
195:56 - develop your software packages paas is
196:00 - more complex than software as a service
196:04 - and finally we have infrastructure as a
196:07 - service this is where the enduser is
196:10 - provided with access to Virtual servers
196:13 - configurable by the customer and other
196:16 - virtual network resources their
196:19 - infrastructure is actually virtually
196:22 - provided to them this creates a highly
196:24 - configurable environment in which
196:26 - customers can create the resources and
196:29 - the performance that they require the
196:32 - enduser supplies the software that's
196:34 - going to be used on the IAS Network or
196:39 - they purchase it as an additional
196:42 - software as a service service as you
196:46 - could have guessed from that last
196:47 - statement it's not uncommon for the type
196:50 - of cloud computing being utilized by an
196:53 - organization to be a mix some
196:55 - departments May rely upon and use
196:58 - infrastructure as a service while the
197:00 - development team will only utilize a
197:03 - platform as a service service part of
197:06 - the advantage of cloud computing is that
197:09 - the purchaser only needs to initialize
197:11 - and pay for resources as they are needed
197:16 - in a private Cloud situation it is
197:18 - possible for an organization that is
197:20 - using it to actually own the cloud
197:23 - resources if they do own the cloud
197:26 - resources they may have it on site or
197:29 - they may pay to have those resources
197:32 - hosted off site that way they can
197:35 - offload the maintenance cost of
197:37 - maintaining those
197:39 - resources now that concludes this
197:42 - session on basic Cloud Concepts I talked
197:46 - about different Cloud
197:48 - classifications and then I concluded
197:51 - with a brief discussion on types of
197:53 - cloud computing now on behalf of pace it
197:56 - thank you for watching this session and
197:59 - I look forward to doing another
198:05 - one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome
198:08 - to pait's session on implementing a
198:12 - basic Network today we're going to
198:14 - discuss plan the network and then
198:17 - configure the network there's a fair
198:20 - amount of ground to cover so let's go
198:22 - ahead and dive into this session of
198:26 - course I'm going to begin with plan the
198:29 - network so you need a simple small
198:32 - office home office Network create just
198:34 - plug two PCS into a single Hub and you
198:38 - have a very basic network but doesn't it
198:42 - achieve what you want how do you know if
198:45 - you don't have a plan a network plan is
198:48 - vital when implementing any network more
198:52 - complicated than the most very basic of
198:55 - networks that plan should cover what you
198:58 - are hoping to achieve and how you are
199:01 - going to get there in addition to your
199:03 - expertise you are also going to need
199:06 - input from your end users nothing is
199:10 - quite so frustrating as to delivering
199:12 - the network that you've planned and
199:14 - built and having the customer tell you
199:17 - that it is not what they wanted or
199:20 - needed let's talk about that Network
199:23 - plan in a little bit more detail the
199:26 - first thing that you should do is create
199:28 - a list of requirements now in order to
199:31 - make that list you need to Define why
199:33 - the network is needed that will help you
199:36 - to Define what network features are
199:39 - required then you need to Define the
199:42 - scope or size of the network once you
199:44 - have those they will help to establish a
199:48 - budget to implement that Network once
199:51 - you know why the network is needed and
199:54 - what features are required then you can
199:56 - work on network design in network design
199:59 - you need to determine what equipment is
200:02 - needed to implement that Network part of
200:05 - the design is also how the network will
200:08 - be organized and how shared resources
200:11 - will be placed on the network when
200:14 - you're planning the network something
200:15 - that you should also consider are
200:17 - compatibility issues you need to know
200:20 - what standards are in use now and what
200:23 - standards will there be in the future
200:26 - included in those compatibility issues
200:29 - are does any current equipment that is
200:32 - required need specific cabling or
200:35 - connectors in order to be installed that
200:38 - is something that often gets overlooked
200:41 - your Network plan also needs to deal
200:44 - with network cabling runs your internal
200:47 - connections how many node connections
200:49 - will be required and where how will you
200:52 - plan for future expansion that future
200:55 - expansion is more than likely going to
200:57 - require more internal connections you
201:00 - should build in some tolerance for
201:02 - future expansion then you need to
201:04 - consider external connections how will
201:07 - the network connect to the outside where
201:10 - will that Wan connection come into your
201:13 - building and where will your equipment
201:15 - be placed so that it can reach those Wan
201:18 - connections that is also part of the
201:20 - network equipment placement plan part of
201:23 - that plan also needs to consider if
201:25 - there is a wiring or equipment closet
201:28 - and where it's going to be located if
201:30 - you do have a wiring or equipment closet
201:33 - are there environmental considerations
201:36 - about placing the equipment in there is
201:38 - it too hot is it too cold is it too hum
201:41 - humid or is it too dry you need to think
201:44 - about those things when you're placing
201:46 - your network equipment your plan should
201:48 - also cover how Network Security will be
201:51 - implemented Are there specific types of
201:54 - firewall and placement considerations
201:56 - for those firewalls will virtual local
201:59 - area networks be required and if so how
202:02 - many also how will your switch Port
202:06 - security be implemented all of these go
202:09 - into a successful Network plan now let's
202:14 - talk about configuring the network here
202:17 - are some network configuration
202:19 - considerations for you first up how will
202:23 - your clients receive their Internet
202:26 - Protocol addresses their IP addresses
202:30 - using static IP address configuration
202:33 - creates a higher level of security but
202:36 - it's harder to manage you could use
202:39 - Dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP
202:43 - to automatically assign IP addresses
202:46 - from a preconfigured pool but your
202:49 - security may be a little bit lower if
202:51 - you do so if you do use DHCP you might
202:56 - want to consider using Mac filtering Mac
202:59 - filtering will only allow specified Mac
203:02 - addresses that physical burned in
203:04 - address onto the network it is an
203:07 - effective security measure but kind of
203:09 - like static IP addressing it can be
203:12 - difficult to control and manage
203:14 - especially as the network grows
203:16 - something else to consider is that if a
203:19 - server will be hosted on the network
203:21 - that needs to be accessed from outside
203:24 - of that Network as in you're hosting a
203:26 - web server then you're going to need a
203:29 - demilitarized zone a DMZ the DMZ is an
203:33 - area of the network in which outside
203:35 - connections are allowed while the
203:38 - internal Network remains protected from
203:41 - that outside traffic a DMZ will require
203:44 - a custom configuration of the firewall
203:47 - in most implementations two firewalls
203:50 - are used but it's not necessary to use
203:53 - two firewalls talking about firewalls
203:57 - firewall placement and configuration
203:59 - considerations are next most small
204:02 - office home office Wan connection
204:05 - devices as in their cable modems are DSL
204:09 - modems include firewall service
204:12 - that are sufficient in most cases for
204:15 - those small simple networks but if a DMZ
204:18 - needs to be deployed the best method is
204:20 - to introduce an additional router in
204:23 - firewall into the network with the DMC
204:26 - residing between the WAN equipment and
204:29 - the new router firewall combination
204:32 - another aspect of deploying a DMZ is
204:35 - that port forwarding should also be used
204:38 - at the router firewall level port
204:41 - forwarding is used to direct requests
204:44 - for specific resources like a request
204:47 - for a web page to the computer that has
204:51 - the resource let's move on to wireless
204:55 - network configuration considerations the
204:59 - first thing to consider in a wireless
205:00 - network is the name of the wireless
205:03 - network that's the service set
205:05 - identifier the
205:07 - SSID now the SSID can be set to
205:10 - broadcast in the clear alternatively the
205:14 - SSID can be set for the broadcast to be
205:17 - hidden some people consider hiding the
205:19 - SSID broadcast as a security measure but
205:23 - it really doesn't work that way it
205:25 - doesn't stop the broadcast it only hides
205:28 - the broadcast a packet sniffer can
205:31 - easily see those broadcasts and those
205:34 - broadcast packets can be easily
205:37 - interpreted so hiding the SSID is not an
205:41 - effective security measure but it does
205:43 - make things a little bit more difficult
205:45 - the next aspect of wireless network
205:48 - configuration that you need to consider
205:50 - is encryption first off I will say you
205:53 - need to have encryption on your wireless
205:56 - network not only that but you need to
205:59 - turn it on by default wireless routers
206:02 - and wireless access points waps do not
206:05 - have encryption enabled and at the
206:08 - minimum your encryption type should
206:11 - could be
206:13 - WPA2 personal that's at the minimum some
206:17 - wireless network equipment comes with a
206:19 - service that is called Wii protected
206:22 - setup
206:23 - WPS and if it does it's enabled by
206:27 - default this should be turned off and
206:29 - not used as it creates a weakness in the
206:32 - wireless network why is that well
206:35 - because WPS can be easily exploited by
206:39 - an attacker the network that you
206:41 - implement may not be exactly what you
206:44 - planned so document any changes to the
206:48 - plan undoubtedly during the process of
206:51 - implementing that plan some changes will
206:53 - be introduced some by you and some By
206:56 - Request of the end user always document
206:59 - those changes to the plan and have the
207:02 - end user sign off on them then be sure
207:06 - to incorporate those changes into the
207:09 - final Network documentation
207:12 - now that concludes this session on
207:14 - implementing a basic Network I talked
207:18 - about plan the network and then I talked
207:20 - about configure the network on behalf of
207:23 - pace it thank you for watching this
207:26 - session and I'm sure I'll do another one
207:36 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
207:40 - welcome to Pace it T's session on
207:43 - analyzing monitoring reports today I'm
207:46 - going to talk about Baseline reports and
207:48 - then I'm going to move on to just
207:50 - reports in general I have a fair amount
207:53 - of ground to cover not a whole lot of
207:55 - time so let's go ahead and jump into
207:57 - this session and of course I'm going to
208:00 - begin by talking about
208:02 - baselines how do you know what
208:05 - constitutes good Network performance and
208:07 - what indicates that an issue is about to
208:10 - happen this is where Baseline
208:13 - documentation comes into play Baseline
208:16 - documentation provides a snapshot of the
208:19 - network when it is running efficiently
208:22 - at least hopefully when it's running
208:23 - efficiently baselines are usually kept
208:26 - as a log file at the minimum baselines
208:30 - should be established on CPU utilization
208:34 - and network bandwidth utilization you
208:37 - may also basemark other functions as you
208:40 - deem them to be relevant Network
208:43 - administrators should perform periodic
208:45 - tests against the Baseline to check to
208:49 - see if the Baseline is changed they will
208:52 - change over time and in order for
208:54 - Network administrators to know what
208:56 - constitutes good performance on their
208:58 - Network their baselines need to be
209:01 - current you can use Window performance
209:03 - monitor to help establish the baselines
209:07 - for your network let's talk about some
209:10 - of the items that should be considered
209:12 - for Baseline reports first up is Network
209:16 - device CPU
209:18 - utilization knowing the CPU utilization
209:21 - on a piece of equipment can help to
209:23 - determine when a network device is going
209:25 - to fail if your CPU utilization is
209:29 - constantly at 100% you know there's a
209:32 - problem that problem may be that it's
209:35 - going to fail or it may be that you need
209:37 - to install more network devices to take
209:40 - care of a growing network but you won't
209:42 - really know that if you're not
209:44 - baselining the CPU
209:46 - utilization Network device memory
209:49 - utilization should also be baselined it
209:52 - can help to determine when it is time to
209:55 - expand the memory of a network device a
209:58 - good item for baselining is bandwidth
210:01 - utilization this can help to determine
210:04 - the overall health of a network it can
210:07 - help to determine when Network
210:08 - segmentation should occur it can also
210:11 - help to determine if a network device is
210:14 - about to fail particularly if it's
210:17 - creating a storm of data Baseline
210:20 - utilization reports can help identifying
210:23 - when a security breach has occurred you
210:26 - might want to consider baselining your
210:29 - storage device utilization this can help
210:31 - to determine when storage utilization
210:34 - has become a bottleneck on the network
210:37 - where your storage device is actually
210:39 - causing the network to slow down because
210:41 - there's too much data being pushed into
210:43 - it which means that baselining your
210:45 - storage utilization can help determine
210:48 - when to increase the storage capacity of
210:51 - that Network you might also want to
210:54 - Baseline your wireless Channel
210:56 - utilization this can help to determine
210:59 - how saturated the wireless channels have
211:01 - become once it's been determined that
211:04 - your wireless channels are saturated a
211:06 - new wireless access point can be
211:09 - installed to alleviate the pressure
211:11 - and then you need to create a new
211:13 - Baseline for wireless Channel
211:15 - utilization this Baseline can also help
211:18 - to determine if there is unauthorized
211:21 - wireless access occurring on your
211:23 - wireless network especially if there is
211:26 - utilization on a channel that is not
211:28 - supposed to have any
211:30 - utilization now let's move on to
211:33 - analyzing
211:34 - reports before we talk about analyzing
211:37 - reports let's talk about log file
211:40 - management log files can accumulate data
211:43 - quickly and unfortunately some
211:45 - administrators only review log files
211:48 - after a major problem has occurred in
211:51 - most situations this is a case of too
211:54 - much information at the wrong time good
211:57 - administrators will set the proper
211:59 - reporting levels with their logging
212:02 - software they won't be logging all that
212:05 - debug information that level seven
212:08 - information unless of course they're
212:10 - actively debugging a system or
212:13 - application good administrators will
212:15 - review log files and compare them
212:18 - against their Baseline documentation
212:20 - they do this to find issues while the
212:23 - issues are still minor and before they
212:25 - become major log files should also be
212:29 - kept and archived in case there is a
212:31 - need for historical data when you do
212:34 - archive your log files you should follow
212:37 - the organization's data storage policy
212:40 - so something to consider is that you may
212:42 - want to create running graphs of
212:45 - important metrics that are captured by
212:47 - log files graphing the data gives a
212:50 - quick visual reference making it easier
212:52 - to spot issues and Trends many logging
212:56 - applications give the administrator the
212:58 - option of creating those graphs easily
213:01 - and quickly but then again they don't do
213:03 - you any good if you don't review them on
213:06 - a regular basis if you're having an
213:10 - issue with a router or link one of the
213:12 - first things that you want to do is you
213:14 - want to run an interface report
213:25 - now hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
213:29 - pait's session on network monitoring
213:33 - part one today we're going to be talking
213:35 - about the why of monitoring and then
213:38 - we're going to talk about tools to
213:40 - monitor the network there's a fair
213:42 - amount of ground to cover so let's go
213:44 - ahead and jump into this session I'm
213:48 - going to begin with the why of network
213:52 - monitoring how do you know what is going
213:54 - on in your network is it healthy or is
213:57 - it about to crash Network administrators
214:01 - really hate to be surprised by failures
214:04 - in their networks especially ones that
214:07 - could have been foreseen and therefore
214:10 - kept from happening how do they keep
214:13 - from being surprised well they enact a
214:16 - plethora of procedures and tools to
214:19 - monitor their networks and to keep track
214:22 - of how those networks are behaving they
214:25 - do this to reduce the surprise element
214:29 - now that we've covered the why of
214:31 - network monitoring let's talk about
214:33 - tools that you can use to monitor the
214:36 - network one of the main tools that
214:39 - Network administrators use to monitor
214:42 - their networks are log files all
214:45 - operating systems offer a means of
214:47 - viewing events that occur to that
214:50 - specific machine that also includes
214:53 - networking equipment there have been
214:55 - some applications that have been
214:57 - developed to monitor systems and
214:59 - networks that also generate log files
215:03 - among other actions that they can take
215:05 - log files can be used to help pinpoint
215:08 - when a problem occurred and to help
215:10 - narrow down the possible causes of that
215:14 - problem log files can also be used to
215:16 - help create a baseline of network
215:19 - Behavior so that you know what to expect
215:22 - from your network log files can usually
215:24 - be classified as being systems logs
215:27 - General logs or history logs as a
215:31 - general rule log files are an after Thea
215:34 - means of monitoring the network and
215:36 - they're not very good at realtime
215:38 - analysis that's partially due due to the
215:41 - sheer amount of information that log
215:44 - files can generate it's just too
215:47 - difficult to keep track of that in real
215:49 - time now let's talk about some specific
215:53 - logging tools that you can use the first
215:56 - one that I'm going to talk about is
215:58 - Event Viewer it's not really a log file
216:00 - in itself it comes with Windows server
216:04 - in most other Windows operating systems
216:07 - and this tool can be used to review
216:11 - Windows log files the most important log
216:14 - files that you can view from Event
216:16 - Viewer are application security and
216:20 - systems logs application logs contain
216:23 - events that are triggered by the actions
216:26 - of an application for example if you
216:28 - have live update enabled it will create
216:31 - log entries based on actions taken by
216:35 - live update then there are security logs
216:38 - these contain events that are triggered
216:41 - by security events for example some logs
216:44 - are created for successful and
216:46 - unsuccessful log on attempts then there
216:50 - are systems logs these contain events
216:52 - triggered by Windows systems components
216:56 - for example it will create an entry for
216:58 - when a driver starts or fails to start
217:02 - in either situation a log entry will be
217:06 - created now let's talk about a non
217:09 - Microsoft log and that would be CIS log
217:13 - CIS log was developed in the 1980s and
217:16 - it provides devices that normally would
217:19 - not be able to communicate with a means
217:21 - of delivering performance and problem
217:24 - information to systems
217:26 - administrators this permits there to be
217:28 - separation between the software that
217:31 - generates the message the storage of
217:33 - that message and the software that
217:36 - analyzes the generated message this
217:39 - separation of function allows CIS log to
217:42 - be highly configurable and has allowed
217:44 - it to continue to be a vital tool for
217:47 - monitoring networks even today as a
217:50 - matter of fact the internet engineering
217:53 - task force the ietf lik CIS log so much
217:57 - that they standardized it in 2009 CIS
218:01 - log can generate log messages based on
218:04 - the types of services that are running
218:07 - and it includes a severity level that
218:10 - rang is from zero the most severe up
218:13 - through seven the least severe CIS log
218:17 - can generate a lot of log messages most
218:20 - Network administrators configure it so
218:22 - that they only get alerted when a
218:25 - minimum severity level has been reached
218:28 - as a matter of fact you almost never
218:30 - want to capture debug log events unless
218:33 - you are actively debugging an
218:36 - application or service just because it
218:39 - generates so much information CIS log
218:42 - can be configured so that Network
218:44 - administrators receive their alerts via
218:47 - text message or SMS message or by email
218:51 - or they may even receive a voicemail
218:54 - message well CIS log is a cool tool it's
218:57 - not the only one that's out there
218:59 - there's also simple Network management
219:01 - protocol
219:03 - SNMP SNMP is an application layer
219:07 - protocol used to Monitor and manage a
219:10 - Network Health Network or systems
219:12 - administrators configure monitors these
219:15 - are often called traps on devices that
219:19 - view the operation of a specific item as
219:22 - in is that router's interface up or is
219:25 - that router's interface down the
219:28 - monitors periodically communicate with a
219:30 - network management station or nms
219:34 - through git messages that's G messages
219:38 - that the nms send out the response from
219:42 - the monitors is stored in a management
219:44 - information base or Mi which is a type
219:48 - of log file the administrator can custom
219:51 - configure the monitors with set messages
219:54 - sent from the network management station
219:59 - when an event occurs as in the interface
220:02 - goes down the Trap is tripped and the
220:04 - event is logged SNMP just like CIS log
220:08 - can be configured to just log the event
220:11 - or it can be configured to contact the
220:13 - network administrator SNMP gives Network
220:17 - and systems administrators the ability
220:20 - to provide more realtime monitoring of a
220:24 - Network's performance and health then
220:27 - there's security information and event
220:29 - management cm it's a term for software
220:33 - products and services that combine
220:36 - security information management or Sim
220:39 - and security event management Sam S may
220:44 - be provided by a software package a
220:47 - network Appliance or as a thirdparty
220:50 - cloud service it is used as a means of
220:53 - monitoring and providing real-time
220:55 - analysis of security alerts that is an
220:58 - example of the security event management
221:01 - function the Sim function it can also be
221:04 - used as a tool to analyze long-term data
221:07 - in log files that's an example of the
221:10 - Sim function or the security information
221:14 - management function s can be highly
221:17 - configured to the needs of the
221:19 - individual Network now that concludes
221:22 - this session on network monitoring part
221:25 - one I talked about the why of network
221:28 - monitoring and then I briefly touched on
221:31 - some tools for monitoring the network on
221:34 - behalf of pace it thank you for watching
221:37 - this session and I'm sure I'll do
221:38 - another one soon
221:47 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
221:50 - Pace's session on network monitoring
221:53 - part two today we're going to be talking
221:55 - about Active network monitoring tools
221:58 - then I'm going to move on to wireless
222:00 - monitoring tools and we're going to
222:03 - conclude with environmental monitoring
222:06 - we have a fair amount of ground to cover
222:08 - not a whole lot of time so let's go
222:10 - ahead and begin this session of course
222:13 - I'm going to begin by talking about
222:15 - Active network monitoring tools Port
222:19 - scanners are used to scan a network for
222:21 - open ports and protocols the information
222:24 - that a port scanner gathers is Vital
222:26 - Information if you want to harden the
222:29 - network Port scanners are a great method
222:32 - of finding vulnerabilities in the
222:34 - network infrastructure allowing the
222:36 - network administrator to plug those
222:38 - vulnerabilities before before they
222:40 - become a security breach I do have to
222:43 - issue a word of caution you should only
222:46 - use a port scanner on a network or
222:48 - system that you are authorized to scan
222:52 - Port scanning is a possible sign of
222:54 - someone trying to breach a system and
222:57 - can lead to problems if you're not
222:59 - authorized to scan that system you don't
223:02 - want to have to try and explain to an
223:03 - information security specialist while
223:06 - you were scanning their network if
223:08 - you're not authorized to scan it a
223:11 - little bit different than a port scanner
223:13 - are applications that use interface
223:16 - monitoring or packet flow monitoring
223:19 - these are usually deployed as an active
223:21 - software tool to Monitor and analyze
223:24 - Network traffic within a network segment
223:28 - they're commonly called packet sniffers
223:30 - or protocol analyzers they allow for an
223:33 - in-depth look at what traffic is on the
223:36 - network and may reveal security issues
223:39 - that the network administrator can then
223:41 - mitigate they help to identify top
223:44 - talkers on a network segment top talkers
223:47 - are those nodes or applications that
223:50 - generate the most amount of traffic
223:53 - packet sniffers can help to identify top
223:55 - listeners on a network segment a top
223:58 - listener is that interface or the
224:01 - interfaces that are receiving the most
224:03 - Network traffic or put another way those
224:06 - interfaces that are utilizing the most
224:08 - bandwidth for receiving packets this can
224:12 - help an administrator when they have
224:14 - determined that load balancing might be
224:16 - needed on the network Microsoft message
224:20 - analyzer and Wireshark are examples of
224:23 - free packet flow monitoring tools now
224:27 - let's move on to wireless monitoring
224:29 - tools and we're going to begin with the
224:32 - Wifi Analyzer a Wi-Fi analyzer is a
224:36 - similar tool to a protocol analyzer but
224:39 - only for wireless networks it sniffs out
224:42 - packets on wireless networks and gives
224:44 - you statistics on those packets that it
224:47 - sees it can check for bandwidth usage
224:51 - Channel usage top talkers top listeners
224:54 - Etc just like a packet sniffer can Wi-Fi
224:57 - analyzers can also identify networks by
225:01 - passively scanning the radio frequencies
225:04 - to determine where traffic is coming
225:07 - from given enough time a Wi-Fi analyzer
225:10 - can also identify hidden networks are
225:13 - those that you don't know about a Wi-Fi
225:16 - analyzer can also infer non- beaconing
225:19 - networks Based on data traffic over the
225:23 - radio frequencies they may not be able
225:25 - to discover the SSID but they can tell
225:29 - the network administrator that something
225:31 - is passing traffic there another type of
225:34 - Wireless monitoring tool Are Wireless
225:37 - survey tools they're most commonly used
225:40 - as a design tool for setting up
225:42 - highquality wireless networks when used
225:45 - in conjunction with mapping tools the
225:47 - survey tools can help to establish the
225:50 - required amount of access points to get
225:53 - the proper amount of coverage the ideal
225:56 - antenna placement and the optimum amount
225:59 - of Channel overlap Wireless survey tools
226:02 - can also help to identify possible
226:05 - sources of radio frequency interference
226:08 - or RF I Wireless survey tools are often
226:12 - used to eliminate wireless network
226:15 - performance and security issues before
226:17 - they ever have a chance to occur let's
226:20 - move on to environmental monitoring a
226:24 - Network's Health can be affected by more
226:26 - than just a network interface failing or
226:28 - a possible security breach Network and
226:31 - systems administrators also need to be
226:34 - concerned about environmental factors
226:37 - some of those factors include the
226:39 - quality
226:40 - and quantity of electrical power being
226:42 - supplied to their equipment and the
226:44 - amount of heat in the rooms that
226:46 - equipment is kept and also with that the
226:49 - humidity level power monitoring tools
226:53 - are systems and tools that can be used
226:55 - to evaluate the amount of and the
226:58 - quality of the electrical power being
227:00 - delivered to the system they're often
227:02 - deployed with or alongside an
227:05 - uninterruptible power supply or UPS the
227:09 - monitor will issue an alert when an
227:11 - issue with electrical power has been
227:14 - identified giving the network or system
227:17 - administrator a chance to rectify the
227:19 - problem before any equipment has been
227:22 - damaged all electrical components are
227:25 - designed to operate within a specific
227:28 - heat range not only are they designed to
227:30 - operate within that heat range but all
227:33 - electrical equipment will generate some
227:36 - heat while they're in operation and the
227:39 - the harder that Equipment Works the more
227:41 - heat they will generate this is where
227:44 - heat monitors come into play the Heat
227:46 - monitor allows an administrator to
227:48 - control the temperature levels before
227:51 - they become an issue humidity is another
227:54 - item that Network administrators need to
227:57 - keep in mind too little humidity
228:00 - increases the risk of electrostatic
228:02 - discharge or ESD but too much humidity
228:06 - increases the risk of condensation on
228:08 - equipment and your electrical components
228:11 - do not like that condensation humidity
228:14 - monitors allow administrators the
228:17 - ability to control the humidity level
228:19 - through the proper means before it
228:22 - becomes an issue now that concludes this
228:25 - session on network monitoring part two I
228:29 - talked about Active network monitoring
228:31 - tools then I moved on to some Wireless
228:34 - monitoring tools and I concluded with a
228:37 - brief discussion on Environmental
228:39 - monitoring on behalf of pace it thank
228:42 - you for watching this session and I look
228:44 - forward to doing another
228:51 - one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome
228:55 - to Pace it session on supporting
228:57 - configuration management part one today
229:00 - I'm going to be talking about what
229:02 - configuration management is and then I'm
229:05 - going to discuss some
229:07 - documentation with that let's go ahead
229:09 - and jump into this session first up is
229:13 - configuration
229:14 - management why do we need configuration
229:17 - management because even fairly small
229:20 - modern networks can get very complex
229:23 - very fast configuration management or cm
229:27 - is a discipline that is used to evaluate
229:30 - coordinate approve deny or Implement
229:33 - change in or to an IT system
229:37 - configuration management plays a vital
229:39 - role in any network beyond the most
229:42 - simplistic of small office home office
229:45 - networks it helps to ensure that the
229:47 - network runs efficiently and smoothly
229:50 - Network administrators and support staff
229:53 - will play a vital role in developing and
229:55 - implementing any CM system or process
230:00 - now that you know what configuration
230:02 - management is let's talk about
230:05 - documentation documentation plays a key
230:08 - role in any configuration management
230:10 - system that gets developed in the CM
230:13 - process documentation is used to help
230:16 - evaluate and plan proposed changes
230:19 - documentation is also used to help in
230:22 - Asset Management network maintenance and
230:25 - vendor evaluations the documentation
230:28 - that is created will depend upon the
230:31 - complexity of the systems under
230:33 - consideration however even if your
230:35 - organization doesn't Implement a true CM
230:38 - sty
230:39 - some documentation should still be kept
230:42 - to reduce the burden on network
230:44 - personnel and to ease administrative
230:47 - management of the network some of the
230:50 - documentation that should be kept
230:52 - include policies and procedures policies
230:55 - are a set of guidelines that establish
230:57 - how the network is to be configured and
231:00 - operated they also set the expected
231:03 - behavior of the people within the
231:06 - organization as a general rule policies
231:08 - are put into effect at the mid to upper
231:11 - management level procedures on the other
231:14 - hand are a set of documents that detail
231:16 - how the policies are to be implemented
231:19 - as a general rule procedures are set by
231:22 - the management of the level that's
231:24 - affected by the policy and they get down
231:27 - to the stepbystep process of how to do
231:30 - things Asset Management documentation
231:33 - should also be maintained this covers a
231:36 - broad category of documentation that's
231:39 - often used to help in the change
231:41 - management process Asset Management
231:44 - documentation contains detailed
231:46 - information on what assets are present
231:49 - it also includes the maintenance history
231:52 - for those assets this documentation is
231:55 - often used to help track update and
231:58 - upgrade Cycles physical Network diagrams
232:02 - should also be kept these are a map or
232:05 - diagram of all network devices and how
232:08 - they connect a physical Network diagram
232:11 - specifies the cabling connectors and
232:14 - physical cabling runs it will also
232:17 - include Cable Management documentation
232:20 - which is considered a subcategory of the
232:23 - physical Network diagram the cabling
232:26 - management documentation will contain a
232:28 - wiring scheme which establishes the type
232:31 - of cabling and the connectors used it
232:34 - also defines the allowed standards for
232:37 - wiring those cables your documentation
232:40 - should also include a logical Network
232:43 - diagram it's similar to a physical
232:45 - Network diagram but more detailed it
232:48 - provides details on the IP address
232:50 - scheme active ports protocols that are
232:53 - allowed on the network etc etc your
232:56 - logical Network diagram also details
233:00 - connected networks so what local area
233:02 - networks are present or which virtual
233:05 - local area networks are present so on
233:07 - and so forth part of your logical
233:10 - Network diagram also details IP address
233:13 - utilization IP address utilization can
233:16 - greatly affect the efficiency and
233:18 - performance of the network by allowing
233:21 - you to know which lands or VLS have
233:25 - space on which nodes can be added your
233:28 - physical and logical Network diagrams
233:30 - may be combined into a single document
233:34 - vendor documentation also plays a role
233:38 - in supporting configuration management
233:40 - it covers a broad category of
233:42 - documentation that can include the
233:44 - approved vendor list the vendor approval
233:48 - process and purchase order documentation
233:52 - there are some common vendor documents
233:54 - that you should know first up is the
233:56 - memorandum of understanding or mou this
234:00 - is an agreement between two or more
234:03 - organizations that detail how those
234:05 - organizations are to take some common
234:08 - course of action it is also often
234:11 - referred to as a letter of intent it is
234:14 - not legally binding but it does often
234:17 - lead towards a binding agreement then
234:19 - there is the statement of work or the S
234:21 - so the S it's a detailed document that
234:25 - specifies what work is to be performed
234:28 - the expected outcome or deliverables and
234:31 - the timelines to perform the work the
234:34 - statement of work is often a key
234:37 - document in Project man management
234:39 - included in some vendor documentation is
234:42 - a master license agreement or
234:45 - MLA this is a legal agreement between
234:48 - two entities in which one agrees to pay
234:51 - the other for the use of a specific
234:53 - piece of software or software package
234:56 - for a specific period of time often
235:00 - instead of being called a master license
235:02 - agreement it is referred to as just a
235:04 - licens agreement last up is the service
235:08 - level agreement or SLA it details the
235:11 - allowable amount of response time the
235:13 - vendor has to resolve an issue or
235:16 - problem most commonly it is associated
235:19 - with a service contract that concludes
235:23 - this session on supporting configuration
235:25 - management part one I talked about
235:28 - configuration management and then I
235:30 - moved on to documentation on behalf of
235:33 - pace it thank you for watching this
235:36 - session and I look forward to doing
235:37 - another one
235:48 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
235:51 - pacit session on supporting
235:54 - configuration management part two today
235:56 - I'm going to be talking about backups
235:58 - and then we will conclude with a brief
236:01 - discussion on bring your own device and
236:04 - with that let's go ahead and begin this
236:07 - session I will be Begin by talking about
236:10 - backups backups are an essential part of
236:14 - any configuration management system
236:17 - that's because small changes in a
236:19 - network devic's configuration can
236:21 - introduce unexpected consequences into
236:25 - that Network in addition there is always
236:28 - the possibility of a failure of a key
236:30 - component which can lead to the loss of
236:33 - data or functionality backups play a key
236:36 - role in recovering from unexpected
236:38 - consequences or from the failure of a
236:41 - key component backup schedules must be
236:44 - implemented and periodic tests should be
236:46 - conducted to ensure that the backup
236:49 - process is working there's nothing worse
236:51 - than installing a backup and finding out
236:54 - that you really backed up nothing there
236:57 - are three basic types of backups there
237:01 - is the full backup all data on the
237:04 - targeted system is backed up this is the
237:07 - slowest backup method method with the
237:09 - highest storage requirements but it does
237:12 - lead to the fastest recovery method when
237:15 - recovering using a full backup it only
237:18 - requires the last full backup file then
237:21 - there's the incremental backup with this
237:24 - type only new or modified files are
237:27 - backed up this is the fastest backup
237:30 - method with the lowest storage
237:33 - requirements but it also leads to the
237:35 - slowest recovery method the recovery
237:38 - process with incremental backups
237:40 - requires the last full backup file in
237:42 - all of the incremental backup files the
237:45 - middle ground is the differential backup
237:48 - only data that is changed since the last
237:51 - full backup is saved the time to back up
237:54 - is moderate and it requires a moderate
237:57 - amount of storage but it also is the
237:59 - middle ground on the length of time for
238:01 - Recovery the recovery process requires
238:04 - the last full backup file and the last
238:07 - differential backup file something else
238:11 - that needs to be backed up are your
238:13 - configuration files of network devices
238:16 - once a network device has been
238:18 - configured and it's operating as
238:20 - expected a backup of the configuration
238:22 - files and operating system should be
238:25 - done this helps to speed up the recovery
238:28 - time in cases of equipment failure or
238:31 - when a change to the configuration has
238:34 - introduced unexpected consequences
238:37 - having the configuration file backups on
238:39 - hand means that you don't need to
238:41 - manually input it to recover in these
238:44 - situations now let's move on to bring
238:47 - your own
238:48 - device BYOD policies or bring your own
238:52 - device policies allow employees to use
238:55 - their own personal devices on an
238:57 - organization's Network while the
239:00 - employees are happy that they get to use
239:02 - their favorite it devices on the
239:04 - corporate Network it departments aren't
239:07 - quite as happy about it why it
239:10 - departments are tasked with keeping a
239:12 - network safe yet they have very little
239:14 - control over the devices that employees
239:17 - bring in in some cases bring your own
239:21 - device policies have led to the
239:23 - introduction of malware into an
239:25 - organization's Network environment this
239:28 - makes them very unhappy they can
239:31 - Implement Network admission control
239:33 - measures or Knack measures in an effort
239:36 - to reduce the risk associated ated with
239:39 - BYOD policies and to introduce
239:42 - configuration management to those
239:45 - devices Network admission control is a
239:48 - Cisco process Microsoft uses a similar
239:52 - process but it's called network access
239:54 - protection or nap while their names may
239:57 - be different they still function in the
240:00 - same way Knack includes more than just
240:03 - authenticating users and devices on the
240:06 - network all of the devices that are
240:08 - requesting access to network resources
240:11 - are screened for the type of device that
240:14 - it is the operating system that's used
240:17 - including any updates that are present
240:20 - neack will also check for security
240:23 - software making sure that it's up to
240:25 - date Knack can also check for the
240:28 - presence of malware or other security
240:31 - vulnerabilities in an advanced setup if
240:34 - the device requesting the connection has
240:37 - been rejected
240:38 - the device is then redirected to a
240:40 - remediation server which attempts to
240:43 - resolve the known issues so if the
240:46 - security software is out of date the
240:48 - remediation server may try and bring it
240:51 - up to date and then allow that device to
240:53 - connect to the corporate Network that
240:56 - concludes this session on supporting
240:59 - configuration management part two I
241:01 - talked about backups and we concluded
241:04 - with a brief discussion on bring your
241:06 - own device on behalf of pace it thank
241:10 - you for watching this session and I hope
241:12 - to do another one
241:21 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
241:24 - welcome to pait's session on the
241:27 - importance of network segmentation today
241:30 - we're going to discuss the OSI model and
241:33 - segmentation and then we're going to
241:34 - conclude with reasons for segmentation
241:39 - and with that let's go ahead and begin
241:41 - this session we will Begin by talking
241:44 - about the OSI model and
241:47 - segmentation so what is segmentation
241:50 - well it's taking a single Network or
241:53 - system and breaking it into smaller
241:56 - discrete units this can be achieved
241:58 - physically or logically there are many
242:02 - reasons why you might want to segment a
242:04 - network some of them could include to
242:07 - ease a administrative tasks to achieve
242:10 - performance gains to increase security
242:13 - or to comply with regulations as I
242:16 - mentioned earlier segmenting a network
242:19 - can be achieved physically or logically
242:22 - and either way it involves different
242:23 - levels of the OSI reference model it can
242:27 - be achieved at layer one the physical
242:29 - layer this is taking a single Network
242:31 - and making it into more than one network
242:34 - through the use of cable runs and
242:36 - Equipment this is the most extreme
242:38 - example of network segmentation not only
242:42 - is this the most extreme example of
242:45 - segmentation but it's also an example of
242:47 - physically segmenting a network you can
242:50 - also segment a network logically at the
242:53 - data link layer which is Layer Two or at
242:56 - the network layer which is layer three
242:59 - of the OSI model this is taking a single
243:02 - Network and making it into more than one
243:04 - by logically dividing the network The
243:07 - Logical segmentation of a network takes
243:10 - the least amount of physical resources
243:13 - to achieve it now let's move on to
243:15 - reasons for
243:17 - segmentation first up is compliance some
243:21 - rules and regulations require that
243:23 - certain data be kept separate and secure
243:26 - as in the payment card industry data
243:29 - security standard or PCI DSS this
243:33 - requires that you keep customer
243:35 - information separate and secure from
243:38 - normal business information segmentation
243:41 - allows for the regulated data to flow
243:44 - across its own network keeping it more
243:47 - secure another reason for segmentation
243:50 - would be for Network performance
243:52 - optimization as a network increases in
243:55 - size the amount of data that flows
243:57 - through them usually increases this can
244:00 - slow down the performance of the network
244:03 - segmentation breaks the larger Network
244:06 - into smaller units which can lead to an
244:08 - increase in performance on those
244:11 - segments related to network performance
244:14 - optimization is the creating of high
244:17 - performance networks some applications
244:20 - require more bandwidth in order to
244:22 - perform at the desired higher level
244:25 - Voiceover IP video teleconferencing and
244:28 - media Nets which are all examples of
244:31 - streaming services all perform better
244:34 - when they are on their own network
244:36 - segments a a major reason for Network
244:39 - segmentation is to separate private from
244:42 - public networks organizations often
244:45 - allow the public to access the internet
244:48 - from their locations these are places
244:50 - that offer free Wi-Fi segmentation
244:53 - allows this traffic to be kept separate
244:56 - from the private corporate traffic then
244:59 - there are Legacy systems some
245:01 - organizations use systems that are
245:04 - considered critical to their operation
245:07 - but are not capable of residing on
245:09 - Modern networks segmentation allows the
245:12 - Legacy system to reside on its own
245:15 - subnet and network without compromising
245:18 - its performance or the performance of
245:21 - the rest of the network then there are
245:23 - testing Labs the lab can be used to test
245:26 - new applications operating systems
245:28 - update patches so on and so forth if
245:32 - these tests occur on the main Network it
245:34 - is possible that this testing could
245:36 - inject a problem into the main system
245:39 - segmentation allows for the testing to
245:42 - occur in a secure easily controllable
245:45 - environment and finally their security
245:49 - one of the main reasons for performing
245:51 - Network segmentation is for security
245:54 - purposes segmentation allows Network and
245:57 - systems administrators to more easily
246:00 - control the flow of data between systems
246:03 - segmentation also allows Network and
246:05 - systems administrators to more easily
246:08 - control access to network resources
246:12 - therefore creating more security an
246:15 - example of segmentation for security
246:17 - would be honey Nets these are network
246:20 - segments that are created with the sole
246:22 - purpose of attracting any network
246:24 - attacks through the use of multiple
246:27 - honey pots honey pots are systems that
246:30 - are configured to be attractive to
246:32 - network attackers helping to draw
246:35 - attackers away from the main Network
246:38 - systems and into the honey net the
246:41 - network segment of honeypots allows the
246:43 - main Network to remain secure and gives
246:46 - Network administrators an opportunity to
246:49 - study and attack including the methods
246:51 - of Entry so that counter measures can be
246:54 - developed to prevent future breaches A
246:58 - system that should be segmented are
247:00 - scata systems or supervisory control and
247:04 - data acquisition systems these are the
247:07 - most widespread of industrial control
247:10 - systems or IC the industrial control
247:14 - system uses coded signals over
247:17 - communication channels to provide
247:19 - control of remote equipment they're
247:22 - commonly used in industrial applications
247:24 - to Monitor and control systems utilities
247:27 - often use scata systems to control their
247:30 - operations through the use of DCs
247:33 - networks that is a distributed control
247:36 - system Network the the DCS allows for
247:39 - the control of multiple scata systems
247:42 - from a single location the stut net
247:45 - virus was originally designed to attack
247:47 - scata systems and can spread through the
247:50 - DCS leading to more damage from the
247:53 - virus segmentation of the distributed
247:56 - control system can limit the amount of
247:59 - damage caused by such a virus attack on
248:02 - Industrial processes now that concludes
248:05 - this session on the importance of
248:07 - network segmentation we talked about the
248:10 - OSI model and segmentation and then I
248:14 - concluded with reasons for Network
248:17 - segmentation now on behalf of pace it
248:20 - thank you for watching this session and
248:22 - I hope you watch another one
248:28 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
248:31 - welcome to pait's session on applying
248:34 - patches and updates today we're going to
248:37 - discuss patches and updates and then
248:39 - we're going to conclude by talking about
248:42 - upgrading versus downgrading there's a
248:46 - fair amount of ground to cover so let's
248:48 - go ahead and begin this session and of
248:51 - course we're going to begin by talking
248:53 - about patches and updates today's modern
248:56 - operating systems are very complex and
248:59 - are composed of tens of millions of
249:01 - lines of code even your network devices
249:04 - and appliances are very complex and have
249:08 - complex software packages and
249:11 - configurations this complexity of the
249:13 - modern operating system has led to the
249:16 - necessity for updates patches and hot
249:19 - fixes these are used to add features fix
249:23 - bugs and repair security holes as they
249:26 - become known One goal of Administrators
249:29 - is to keep systems as up toate as
249:32 - possible through the use of these
249:34 - updates patches and hot fixes reducing
249:38 - the system's vulnerability and
249:40 - increasing its functionality while
249:42 - reducing maintenance costs a patch is a
249:46 - small section of code that is used to
249:49 - either increase functionality or fix a
249:51 - problem within a software package a
249:54 - patch will change the version of the
249:56 - software package in a minor manner as in
249:59 - version
250:00 - 1.0.0 will become version
250:04 - 1.0.1 an update is a larg section of
250:08 - code that is used to either increase
250:10 - functionality or fix problems within a
250:13 - software package that become known after
250:17 - production an update will change the
250:19 - version of the software in a more major
250:21 - manner as in version
250:24 - 1.0.0 will become version
250:28 - 2.0.0 or using a Microsoft example
250:32 - Windows 8.0 became Windows
250:35 - 8.1 a hot fix which can also be called a
250:39 - vulnerability patch is similar to a
250:42 - patch but it is actually smaller than a
250:45 - patch they are designed to be deployed
250:47 - to fix a very specific issue within an
250:50 - operating system or other software
250:53 - package hot fixes are usually issued to
250:57 - fix security problems that become
251:00 - discovered after the software package
251:02 - has been produced a service pack is a
251:05 - cumulative Windows update pack package
251:08 - that contains all patches updates and
251:10 - hot fixes between two points of time
251:14 - Microsoft releases service packs as a
251:16 - method of easing the installation of an
251:19 - operating system helping to keep it
251:22 - current you install the operating system
251:25 - and then you install the service pack
251:27 - that way you don't have to download and
251:29 - install every patch update and hot fix
251:33 - in most cases it is possible to automate
251:35 - the patch and update process process
251:37 - through registering the product with the
251:40 - vendor who created it Microsoft's
251:43 - operating systems can be set to
251:45 - automatically check for updates and it
251:48 - will download and install them if you
251:50 - configure it that way most Hardware
251:52 - vendors offer the same type of service
251:55 - for firmware and drivers in most cases
251:58 - these Services can also be set to just
252:01 - inform the system of the availability of
252:04 - patches and updates allowing
252:06 - administrator to manually download and
252:09 - install them in a production setting all
252:12 - patches and updates should be installed
252:14 - and tested in isolation as in on a test
252:18 - system in a Testing Lab before they are
252:21 - installed on vital production equipment
252:24 - this reduces the chances that a patch or
252:27 - update will bring down a system that is
252:31 - functioning all right but is in need of
252:33 - the patch or update now let's discuss
252:36 - upgrading versus
252:38 - downgrading quite often it is highly
252:41 - desirable to install the latest patches
252:43 - and updates in order to keep systems
252:46 - running efficiently however sometimes
252:48 - issues arise with the installation of a
252:51 - patch or update leading to problems that
252:54 - were not caught during the testing phase
252:57 - this is where backups and downgrading
252:59 - come into play backup copies of all
253:02 - systems and configuration files should
253:04 - be maintained in order to downgrade or
253:07 - roll back to the previous version for
253:10 - when a problem occurs during the
253:11 - deployment of a patch or upgrade being
253:14 - able to roll back to a prior version is
253:17 - often easier and more efficient than
253:20 - trying to resolve a problem that was
253:22 - introduced with an update administrators
253:25 - should keep backup copies that include
253:27 - the base package of the operating system
253:29 - or software package a backup of the
253:32 - system before the patch was installed
253:34 - and a backup of the system after the
253:38 - Patch was installed all of these backups
253:41 - should be kept and maintained as per
253:44 - your organization's policy now that
253:47 - concludes this session on applying
253:49 - patches and updates we started by
253:52 - discussing patches and updates and then
253:54 - concluded with a brief discussion on
253:57 - upgrading versus downgrading on behalf
254:00 - of pace it thank you for watching this
254:03 - session and I'm looking forward to doing
254:05 - another one
254:12 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
254:15 - Pit's session on configuring switches
254:18 - part one today we're going to talk about
254:20 - unmanaged versus managed switches and
254:23 - then we're going to talk about spanning
254:25 - tree protocol there is a whole lot of
254:28 - information to cover not a lot of time
254:31 - so let's jump into this session I'm
254:35 - going to begin by talking about
254:37 - unmanaged switches and managed
254:40 - switches before we begin discussing the
254:42 - differences between unmanaged and
254:44 - managed switches let's talk switch
254:47 - Basics most switches operate at layer 2
254:51 - the data link layer of the OSI reference
254:54 - model what makes a switch a switch is an
254:58 - application specific integrated circuit
255:00 - chip or an ASAC chip it is used to make
255:03 - switching decisions in place of software
255:07 - this allows switches to break up
255:09 - Collision domains this allows switches
255:12 - to run in full duplex mode and this
255:15 - allows switches to make faster decisions
255:18 - than either Bridges or routers when a
255:21 - switch receives a frame on a port it
255:24 - makes some simple decisions based on its
255:27 - media Access Control table or its Mac
255:31 - table it will make one of three
255:33 - decisions it may decide to forward the
255:36 - frame that is where the frame is
255:38 - directed out the port on which the
255:40 - destination Mac address resides it may
255:44 - decide to filter the packet that is
255:46 - where the frame is not directed out of
255:49 - ports which are not associated with the
255:52 - destination Mac address the final
255:54 - decision that it may make is to flood
255:57 - the frame the frame is flooded or sent
256:00 - out all of the ports on the switch
256:02 - except for the port on which it came in
256:06 - on an unmanaged switch is a simple
256:09 - switch plug it in and it works there is
256:12 - no method provided for configuration the
256:15 - unmanaged switch is designed with ease
256:17 - of installation as its main attribute
256:20 - managed switches on the other hand can
256:23 - be configured through either the command
256:26 - line or a browser based interface
256:29 - managed switches provide for a high
256:31 - degree of network customization and
256:34 - control a managed switch can can also be
256:37 - set up so that an administrator can
256:40 - monitor its performance remotely and use
256:42 - protocols such as SNMP to make some
256:46 - modifications to its
256:49 - configuration now let's move on to
256:51 - spanning tree
256:53 - protocol spanning tree protocol is a
256:56 - loop avoidance technology a switching
256:59 - Loop can occur on networks where there
257:01 - are multiple paths to reach destination
257:04 - Mac addresses digital equip Corporation
257:07 - created the spanning tree protocol or
257:10 - STP to reduce the possibility of
257:13 - switching Loops the switches elect a
257:15 - root bridge to control the switched
257:18 - Network the switches will shut down
257:20 - ports that are not the best path to the
257:24 - root Bridge thus reducing the risk of
257:27 - Loops no network traffic can flow until
257:30 - after the STP process has taken place
257:33 - and a stable state has been achieved
257:36 - this stable state state is called
257:37 - convergence and it can take a
257:39 - significant amount of time with STP up
257:42 - to 50 seconds after convergence the STP
257:46 - selected switch ports send out Bridge
257:49 - protocol data unit packets or bpdu
257:52 - packets to help maintain the stable
257:55 - State all switch ports in an STP enabled
257:59 - Network can be in one of five states
258:03 - first off there is the disabled state
258:05 - that is where the port is
258:06 - administratively shut down it's not
258:09 - receiving packets it's not sending
258:11 - packets it's just completely disabled
258:14 - then there's the blocking state in this
258:16 - state the port will not forward packets
258:19 - but it's still receiving bpdu packets
258:22 - and will drop all other frames then
258:25 - there's the listening state in this
258:27 - state the port will not forward packets
258:29 - but listens to bpdu packets to make sure
258:33 - that no Loops can occur in preparation
258:35 - for the next state then there's the
258:37 - learning state in this state the port
258:39 - will not forward packets but it is
258:42 - learning all of the paths in the network
258:45 - it is populating its Mac address table
258:48 - in preparation for the next state the
258:51 - last state in spanning tree protocol is
258:54 - the forwarding state in this state the
258:57 - port will forward and receive all
259:00 - packets that are flowing across the
259:02 - network that are directed to that Port
259:05 - the i e liked STP so much that it
259:08 - created the
259:10 - 802.1d standard this is their version of
259:14 - STP all modern layer 2 switches run the
259:19 - 802.1d standard by
259:22 - default the slow convergence time of the
259:26 - 802.1d standard led to the creation of
259:29 - Rapid spanning tree protocol or
259:32 - rstp which is also known as the i e 80
259:38 - 21w standard rstp has a much faster
259:42 - convergence time than
259:45 - 802.1d with rstp enabled on all switches
259:49 - a network can achieve its stable state
259:51 - in approximately 5 Seconds that's a
259:54 - whole lot faster than the up to 50
259:57 - seconds with the
259:58 - 802.1d standard but rstp is not turned
260:03 - on by default on layer 2 switches it
260:06 - must be enabled by an administrator
260:08 - instead of five possible Port States
260:12 - rstp defines three possible Port States
260:16 - the first of these states is discarding
260:19 - in this state the port may be
260:21 - administratively disabled or it may be
260:24 - in a blocking mode or listening mode the
260:27 - next state is learning in this state the
260:30 - port is populating its Mac address table
260:33 - in preparation for forwarding packets
260:36 - and the final state is forwarding in
260:39 - this state the port is actively
260:41 - forwarding
260:43 - packets now that concludes this session
260:46 - on configuring switches part one I
260:49 - talked about unmanaged versus managed
260:52 - switches and then I had a brief
260:54 - discussion on spanning tree protocol on
260:57 - behalf of pace it thank you for watching
260:59 - this session and I look forward to doing
261:05 - another
261:09 - good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to
261:13 - Pace it session on configuring switches
261:16 - part two today we're going to discuss
261:18 - installation considerations and then
261:20 - we're going to move on to configuring
261:23 - the switch Port there's a fair amount of
261:26 - ground to cover so let's go ahead and
261:28 - dive into today's session of course I'm
261:31 - going to begin with installation
261:34 - considerations the first install ation
261:36 - consideration is whether or not you need
261:39 - a managed or unmanaged switch the
261:42 - business or Enterprise Network is more
261:45 - complex than the small office home
261:47 - office Network a Soho Network may be
261:50 - able to get by with using one or more
261:52 - unmanaged switches and still operate
261:55 - adequately but once beyond the level of
261:57 - a Soho more thought and planning is
262:00 - required as unmanaged switches are no
262:03 - longer up to the job you are going to
262:06 - need managed switches there are multiple
262:10 - issues to consider when installing a
262:12 - managed switch and it is wise to plan
262:14 - for those in advance to save both time
262:17 - and frustration in setting up a network
262:21 - one of the first things to consider is
262:23 - if there will be vlans virtual local
262:25 - area networks while switches may break
262:28 - up Collision domains they do not break
262:31 - up broadcast domains but vlans will a
262:35 - virtual local area Network takes a
262:37 - single Network environment and creates
262:39 - smaller Network segments by subnetting
262:42 - the network address range effectively
262:45 - breaking up the broadcast domains of
262:47 - that Network vlans are used in a
262:50 - switched Network environment for a
262:52 - variety of reasons to break up broadcast
262:54 - domains into smaller segments just like
262:57 - I just said another reason to use vlans
263:00 - is they increase security by limiting
263:03 - access to network resources the administ
263:06 - configures the vlans and then assigns
263:09 - users nodes or ports to a specific
263:13 - virtual local area network all managed
263:16 - switches do come with a native VLAN
263:19 - which is determined by the manufacturer
263:22 - this native VLAN is used to help manage
263:25 - the switch VLAN traffic is allowed to
263:28 - cross switch ports as long as the VLAN
263:31 - information matches so VLAN 2 can send
263:34 - traffic to VLAN 2 but VLAN 2 cannot send
263:38 - traffic to VLAN 3 VLAN traffic is
263:42 - allowed to cross switch ports as long as
263:45 - the VLAN information matches it does
263:48 - this through the use of trunk ports that
263:51 - means that VLAN 2 can send traffic
263:54 - across the trunk port to VLAN 2 but it
263:57 - cannot send traffic from VLAN 2 across
264:01 - the trunk port to VLAN 3 vtp or virtual
264:05 - trunk port Port protocol is a Cisco
264:08 - proprietary method of creating a virtual
264:11 - trunk Port which allows VLAN traffic to
264:14 - pass between switches and to
264:16 - automatically manage the VLAN
264:18 - environment in order for different vlans
264:21 - to communicate with each other a router
264:24 - or some other layer 3 device must be
264:27 - installed on the network the next
264:29 - consideration is how is the switch going
264:32 - to be managed switches may be managed
264:35 - out of band that means that no network
264:38 - connection is required this is achieved
264:41 - through the use of the console port on
264:44 - the switch the console Port is a
264:46 - specific port on managed switches used
264:49 - to connect to and configure or manage a
264:52 - switch a rollover cable may be required
264:55 - to make the connection to the console
264:57 - Port security should also be set on
265:00 - Console ports to prevent unauthorized
265:03 - access through that console port your
265:06 - other option for switch management may
265:08 - be to use inband management with inband
265:12 - management a network connection is used
265:15 - to manage the switch one of the most
265:17 - common methods of allowed inband
265:19 - management is through the use of virtual
265:22 - terminals or vty connections the most
265:26 - common vty connections are telnet or
265:29 - secure shell sessions SSH sessions
265:34 - security should also be set if telnet is
265:36 - allowed on vty type connections by
265:39 - default SSH is a secured connection if
265:44 - you determine that you're going to use
265:45 - inband management the next thing that
265:47 - you need to do is to establish a default
265:50 - gateway address that default gateway
265:53 - address must be placed on an interface
265:55 - that belongs to the native VLAN or the
265:58 - default virtual local area network the
266:02 - default gateway on a switch is different
266:04 - than the default gateway on on a router
266:07 - on a switch it is only used to manage
266:10 - the switch and not to pass other network
266:13 - traffic as part of the setup and
266:15 - management of the switch an
266:16 - administrator should configure which
266:19 - users and passwords are allowed to
266:21 - connect to the switch and what their
266:23 - level of access to the configuration is
266:26 - going to be inband and outof band
266:28 - management security settings may be
266:31 - different some users may be allowed
266:33 - inband management access while other
266:36 - others are not and vice versa if
266:38 - authentication authorization and
266:40 - accounting Protocols are used in the
266:42 - network the switch must be configured to
266:45 - use them as well with that done let's
266:49 - move on to configuring the switch Port
266:52 - I'm not going to actually show you the
266:54 - commands for how to configure the switch
266:56 - Port but I'm going to give you the
266:58 - information that you need to consider
267:01 - when configuring the switch Port first
267:03 - up is speed and duplexing most modern
267:06 - switch ports can auto-negotiate both the
267:09 - speed of the link and the duplexing mode
267:12 - used but in some cases an administrator
267:15 - may be required to manually set both the
267:17 - speed and the duplex in order for a
267:20 - connection to occur speed and duplexing
267:23 - errors are the most common cause for a
267:26 - link not being established between a
267:28 - switch and a router or between switches
267:32 - next up is VLAN assignment all switch
267:34 - ports will beong to a VLAN and that VLAN
267:38 - will either be an administrator
267:39 - configured one or it will be the native
267:42 - virtual local area network as a side
267:45 - note the native VLAN can be
267:47 - administratively changed which should be
267:49 - done to increase the security level on
267:52 - the switch then there's trunking trunk
267:54 - ports are switch ports that are designed
267:57 - to carry VLAN traffic between switches
268:00 - the standard protocol used is
268:03 - 802.1q 802.1q strips off the VLAN tag
268:08 - actually it changes that tag to match
268:11 - the native VLAN which allows the traffic
268:14 - to cross over the port and then once on
268:16 - the other side then the 802.1 Q port on
268:20 - the other side reinserts the original
268:23 - VLAN tag and that is trunking in a
268:27 - nutshell you might want to consider Port
268:29 - bonding using
268:31 - lacp that's link aggregation control
268:34 - protocol it is is a protocol that is
268:36 - used to create a single logical channel
268:40 - from redundant connections between
268:42 - switches so it bonds those ports
268:44 - together this will increase the
268:46 - bandwidth between the switches now we're
268:49 - going to talk about po not Edgar alen po
268:52 - but power over ethernet some switches
268:56 - coming with power over ethernet ports or
268:59 - Poe ports these ports can use one of two
269:03 - methods to provide current over the
269:05 - network cable as well as carrying data
269:08 - allowing these ports to power small
269:11 - network devices while at the same time
269:13 - communicating with them the port itself
269:16 - May provide the current or the port may
269:19 - allow the use of a power injector to
269:21 - provide the power instead of the port
269:24 - itself there are multiple Poe standards
269:27 - in place the two most common are
269:29 - actually the poe standard the
269:32 - 802.3 AF which can provide up to 15.4
269:37 - watts of current or the poe plus which
269:41 - is
269:43 - 802.3at which can provide up to 30 watts
269:46 - of Current Port mirroring may also be
269:49 - enabled on a switch Port this allows the
269:52 - configured port to receive all Network
269:55 - traffic going to and from a specific
269:58 - Port by using Port mirroring an
270:00 - administrator can examine and analyze
270:03 - the traffic going into and coming from
270:05 - from a specific host or Port Port
270:08 - mirroring is most often used in
270:11 - conjunction with a packet analyzer also
270:14 - known as a packet sniffer or network
270:17 - sniffer administrators often use port
270:19 - mirroring to examine the flow of traffic
270:22 - to determine what method of network
270:25 - optimization to use or for when they're
270:27 - determining which security measures to
270:30 - put in place Port mirroring can create a
270:33 - significant amount of network overhead
270:35 - so it should be used sparingly on an
270:38 - active Network and you may want to shut
270:41 - it down once your research has concluded
270:44 - that concludes this session on
270:46 - configuring switches part two I talked
270:49 - about installation considerations and
270:52 - then I talked about configuring the
270:54 - switch Port itself on behalf of pace it
270:57 - thank you for watching this session and
270:59 - I look forward to doing another
271:04 - one
271:07 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
271:10 - pait's session on wireless land
271:13 - infrastructure part one today I'm going
271:16 - to give an introduction to wireless
271:18 - network standards then I'm going to move
271:20 - on to inant technology and we will
271:24 - conclude with wireless access points
271:27 - there is a whole plethora of information
271:29 - to impart not a lot of time so let's go
271:32 - ahead and begin this session I'm going
271:36 - to begin by giving an introduction to
271:38 - wireless network
271:40 - standards to talk about the standards I
271:42 - need to introduce you to the i e
271:46 - 802.11 specifications these are a set of
271:49 - specifications that deal with the data
271:52 - link layer and the physical layer of the
271:55 - OSI reference model these establish how
271:58 - wireless network communication can occur
272:02 - the 802.11 standard specifies the use of
272:05 - unlicensed radio frequency bands as the
272:09 - carrier for Network traffic it also
272:12 - specifies that network communication
272:15 - will be half duplex in nature and that
272:18 - it will be implemented using carrier
272:20 - sense multiple access with collision
272:23 - avoidance or
272:24 - csma CA carrier sense multiple access
272:29 - with collision avoidance technology
272:31 - requires that devices only transmit data
272:35 - when no other data transmission signal
272:37 - is present on the carrier wave now the
272:40 - 802.11 standards have been amended over
272:44 - time to become our common standards that
272:47 - we see today these standards include the
272:51 - 802.11b wireless standard it was
272:54 - commercially released in 1997 and
272:57 - operates within the 2.4 gigahertz
273:00 - industrial scientific and medical or ISM
273:04 - radio frequency band now within the 2.4
273:08 - GHz RF band it uses multiple channels
273:11 - that are 22 MHz wide there are 11
273:16 - separate channels of which only three do
273:19 - not overlap
273:21 - 802.11b has a theoretical throughput of
273:23 - 11 megabits per second and it is
273:26 - compatible with the
273:28 - 802.11g and N standards then there's
273:33 - 802.11a it was also commercial
273:35 - commercially released in 1997 and
273:38 - operates within the 5 GHz unlicensed
273:41 - National information infrastructure or
273:44 - u- nii radio frequency band it offers up
273:49 - to 23 separate channels that offer a
273:52 - bandwidth of 20 mahz each none of the
273:56 - channels overlap
273:58 - 802.11a has a theoretical throughput of
274:01 - 54 megabits per second it is not
274:05 - compatible with any other standard EO
274:08 - 211g was commercially released in 2003
274:12 - and operates within the 2.4 GHz radio
274:16 - frequency band just like
274:19 - 802.11b it also offers a bandwidth of 20
274:22 - mahz on 11 separate channels it has a
274:26 - theoretical throughput of 54 megabits
274:29 - per second and it's also compatible with
274:33 - 802.11b it's also comp compatible with
274:37 - 802.11n and
274:39 - 802.11
274:41 - AC and that brings us to
274:44 - 802.11n it was commercially released in
274:47 - 2009 and can operate on both the 2.4 GHz
274:52 - and 5 GHz radio frequency bands at the
274:56 - same time it uses a 20 MHz wide Channel
275:00 - within the 2.4 GHz band and a 40 mahz
275:04 - wide Channel with within the 5 GHz band
275:07 - it has a theoretical throughput of 600
275:10 - megabits per second through the
275:12 - introduction of multiple input and
275:15 - multiple output mimo technology and beam
275:18 - forming and it is compatible with1
275:22 - b1g And1 a and that brings us to
275:29 - 802.11ac it was commercially released in
275:32 - 2013 and operates on the 5 G gz radio
275:36 - frequency band The Available bandwidth
275:39 - varies by administrative settings and
275:41 - can be dynamically Changed by the
275:43 - wireless access point based on how much
275:46 - radio frequency interference or RFI is
275:50 - present and how many users are on the
275:53 - wireless network 802.11 AC has a
275:57 - theoretical throughput of over 1 gabit
276:00 - per second through the introduction of
276:02 - multi-user multiple input and multiple
276:05 - output technology or mu mimo technology
276:09 - and beam forming 802.11 AC is only
276:13 - compatible with
276:15 - 802.11g and N so why broadcast a wide
276:20 - signal to a specific device when it's
276:23 - possible to Target that device
276:26 - specifically this is the question that
276:28 - beamforming answered once a device makes
276:31 - a connection to an access point once a
276:34 - device makes a connection to an access
276:36 - point that is capable of beam forming
276:39 - the AP will autotune its antenna and
276:42 - transmitter to more specifically Target
276:45 - the device when communication occurs
276:47 - this can reduce RFI and increase
276:50 - throughput on the wireless local area
276:53 - network while
276:54 - 802.11n allowed for beam forming it was
276:57 - not a standardized option until the
277:00 - implementation of
277:03 - 802.11 AC
277:05 - since we've covered the standards let's
277:07 - move on to antenna
277:10 - technology first up the basics antennas
277:13 - are used to broadcast and receive radio
277:16 - frequency signals and they fall into two
277:19 - basic categories there are
277:21 - omnidirectional antennas which are
277:23 - designed to broadcast and receive
277:25 - signals in all directions then there are
277:28 - uni directional antennas which are
277:30 - designed to broadcast and receive
277:32 - signals in a specific Direction antenna
277:36 - placement and type of antenna will have
277:39 - an impact on wireless local area network
277:43 - performance both mimo and mimo are
277:46 - technologies that allow for more than
277:48 - one spatial stream to be transmitted and
277:51 - received by a single device through the
277:54 - use of multiple antennas mimo allows for
277:57 - up to four spatial channels while mimo
278:00 - allows for up to eight spatial channels
278:03 - mimo also allows for a single signal to
278:06 - be spread across multiple transmitters
278:10 - this accounts for the multiple user part
278:12 - of the name let's conclude with a
278:16 - discussion on wireless access points the
278:19 - wireless access point is a foundational
278:22 - piece of the wireless local area network
278:26 - the wireless access point or WAP can
278:29 - also be known as an access point or AP
278:32 - and it creates a point of entry for
278:35 - wireless to enter the more traditional
278:37 - wired networking environment the AP can
278:41 - also be used to join other types of
278:43 - networks wireless access points in most
278:46 - cases use unlicensed radio frequency
278:50 - bands in order to communicate with
278:52 - devices one or more antennas are used in
278:55 - order to radiate and receive radio
278:58 - frequency signals in a half duplex
279:00 - manner wireless routers are common in
279:03 - the small office home office environment
279:06 - they are wireless access points that
279:08 - have routers
279:10 - built good day I'm Brian frell and
279:14 - welcome to pait's session on wireless
279:17 - land infrastructure part two today I'm
279:20 - going to be talking about basic Wireless
279:23 - landan topologies and then we're going
279:25 - to conclude with wireless landan
279:28 - Concepts and terms there's a fair amount
279:30 - of ground to cover so let's go ahead and
279:32 - jump into this session
279:35 - of course I'm going to begin by talking
279:37 - about Wireless local area network
279:41 - topologies and the first topology is the
279:44 - ad hoc topology it's a very basic
279:47 - Wireless local area network that does
279:50 - not require the use of a wireless access
279:53 - point which can also be called a WAP and
279:56 - it can also be called an access point
279:59 - the devices negotiate the wireless
280:01 - connection between themselves an example
280:04 - of this are when laptops connect
280:06 - wirelessly without the use of a wireless
280:09 - access point then there's the
280:11 - infrastructure topology it's a more
280:14 - common type of Wireless local area
280:16 - network that uses a WAP or multiple waps
280:20 - to create a connection point for
280:22 - wireless devices most often it's used to
280:25 - connect a wireless network to a more
280:27 - traditional wired network but that wired
280:30 - network is not absolutely required then
280:34 - there's the mesh topology this is a type
280:37 - of infrastructure topology that employs
280:39 - the use of multiple access points to
280:42 - create larger seamless network coverage
280:44 - areas they're commonly deployed with
280:47 - wireless controllers and wireless access
280:51 - points something to remember is that the
280:53 - higher the wireless device density the
280:56 - more wireless access points that will be
280:58 - required to handle the load like any
281:01 - other network device access points only
281:04 - have a certain amount of capacity as the
281:07 - workload increases the amount of
281:09 - throughput will decrease as each device
281:12 - contends for access to that wireless
281:15 - access point adding more waps Andor
281:18 - adding more access points and wireless
281:21 - controllers can greatly ease the load
281:23 - and increase the efficiency of the
281:27 - network now let's move on to wireless
281:29 - land Concepts and terms first up is the
281:33 - ibss or independent basic service set an
281:38 - ibss is created when an ad hoc network
281:41 - topology is created the devices use the
281:44 - ibss in order to control the
281:47 - communication that occurs between the
281:49 - connected devices then there's the BSS
281:52 - or basic service set when a single
281:55 - wireless access point is in
281:57 - infrastructure mode it will create a BSS
282:01 - this means that it can control the flow
282:03 - of communication
282:05 - between every device that connects to
282:07 - the SS IDs under its control then
282:11 - there's the ESS or extended service set
282:15 - an ESS is created when two or more
282:17 - access points share a common SSID and
282:21 - have overlapping coverage through the
282:24 - extended service set the waps will
282:26 - negotiate how to hand off a wireless
282:29 - device between them as it roams the
282:32 - network so I mentioned the service set
282:34 - identifier just a moment ago or the SSID
282:38 - it plays a key role in the wireless
282:41 - local area network environment all
282:44 - active wireless access points will use a
282:47 - Beacon transmission to advertise the
282:49 - networks that they belong to what they
282:52 - advertise is their SSID which can also
282:56 - be thought of as their network name
282:58 - those beacons are how devices know which
283:01 - networks they can connect to even when
283:04 - an access point is set to hide the
283:06 - beacon the broadcasts are still
283:09 - occurring so although hiding the SS ID
283:13 - broadcast may make it more difficult to
283:15 - join a wireless network it's not a true
283:18 - security measure because the broadcast
283:21 - is still occurring now let's talk about
283:24 - 802.11
283:26 - a-t and
283:28 - 802.11g
283:30 - DHT both of these terms relate to the 80
283:35 - 211n standard they denote the type of
283:38 - connection a high throughput connection
283:41 - and the radio frequency which will
283:43 - either be the 2.4 GHz radio frequency
283:47 - band or it may be a 5 GHz connection
283:51 - then there's goodput goodput is the
283:54 - actual amount of application data passed
283:57 - through a connection with the overhead
283:59 - removed it's measured in bytes per
284:02 - second it is different than through
284:04 - throughput measures the total amount of
284:07 - data capable of being passed through a
284:09 - connection so it includes Network
284:12 - overhead then we have signal strength
284:14 - it's a measure of the strength of the
284:17 - radio frequency signal that comes from
284:19 - an access point which can help to
284:22 - determine the amount of area that can be
284:24 - covered by that access point as a
284:27 - general rule the closer a device is to
284:29 - the wireless access point the stronger
284:32 - the signal that is received this
284:34 - strength of signal can be affected by
284:37 - wireless access point or antenna
284:39 - placement the type of antenna used and
284:42 - interference sources that may be present
284:46 - a wireless sight survey with heat
284:48 - mapping tools can help in the setup of a
284:50 - high quality Wireless local area network
284:54 - or it can help you to pinpoint problem
284:57 - areas within your network the heat
284:59 - mapping software builds a visual map by
285:02 - measuring the received signal strength
285:04 - indicator or
285:06 - RSSI and the signal to noise Ratio or
285:11 - SNR which can be directly correlated to
285:14 - data throughput using these tools allows
285:17 - the administrator to find gaps and
285:19 - coverage as well as areas where the
285:22 - coverage extends beyond the desired
285:24 - boundaries helping to create a more
285:26 - efficient and secure network now that
285:30 - concludes this session on wireless land
285:33 - infrastructure structure part two I
285:36 - talked about basic wireless land
285:38 - topologies and we concluded with some
285:41 - wireless land Concepts and terms on
285:45 - behalf of pace it thank you for watching
285:47 - this session and I hope to do another
285:49 - one
285:58 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
286:01 - welcome to pait's session on risk RK and
286:04 - security related Concepts today I'm
286:07 - going to be talking about the big
286:09 - picture of recovery and then we're going
286:11 - to move on to some Concepts and terms
286:14 - that you should know there's a fair
286:17 - amount of ground to cover not a whole
286:18 - lot of time so let's go ahead and jump
286:21 - into this session we begin with the big
286:25 - picture of
286:26 - recovery standards and policies are used
286:29 - to help ensure that everyone is on the
286:31 - same page at the same time all
286:34 - organizations should review their
286:36 - operations and create standards and
286:39 - policies that suit their needs once they
286:41 - are created the standards and policies
286:44 - should be adhered to this includes all
286:47 - of the information technology systems by
286:50 - stressing the importance of standards
286:52 - and policies risks to an organization
286:55 - can be reduced and security can be
286:58 - strengthened all policies and standards
287:01 - should be reviewed on a periodic basis
287:04 - to help ensure that they remain relevant
287:06 - and be updated as
287:08 - necessary one of the standards or
287:10 - policies that should be created is the
287:13 - disaster recovery plan a disaster is any
287:17 - event or emergency that goes beyond the
287:19 - normal response resources as in an
287:23 - earthquake or a flood or a major fire
287:25 - the longer a business is not able to
287:27 - function the more damage is done the
287:31 - damage recovery plan or DRP detail the
287:35 - steps to recover from a disaster
287:37 - situation as in when the offsite backups
287:40 - need to be used or if a fall back site
287:42 - needs to be brought into operation they
287:45 - also have sections dealing with how to
287:47 - help ensure employee safety a subelement
287:51 - of the DRP is the business continuity
287:54 - plan or BCP a BCP includes an impact
287:59 - analysis of the business effects of down
288:02 - systems the impact analysis helps to
288:05 - identify single points of failure in the
288:08 - business system a BCP helps to
288:11 - prioritize what systems or processes
288:14 - need to be brought back first to get an
288:16 - organization operational again it
288:19 - identifies Mission critical systems
288:22 - processes and data the business
288:25 - continuity plan helps to guide the
288:28 - creation of the disaster recovery plan
288:32 - now let's talk about some concept ceps
288:34 - in terms that you should know first up
288:37 - is single point of failure a single
288:40 - point of failure is a system or
288:42 - component that if it goes down has a
288:45 - major impact on operations an example of
288:48 - a single point of failure is if a key
288:51 - router goes down and it prevents
288:53 - customers from ordering products that's
288:55 - a single point of failure once
288:57 - identified these failure points can be
289:00 - mitigated through several different
289:01 - methods such as redundant systems as in
289:05 - adding a backup router to the previous
289:07 - example or maybe a redundant power
289:10 - supply single points of failure can also
289:13 - be mitigated through system redesign as
289:16 - in removing that point of failure
289:19 - through a redesign of the system you
289:21 - should also be familiar with
289:24 - uninterruptable power supplies or the
289:27 - UPS a UPS will mitigate power issues
289:31 - that can have a negative impact on
289:33 - sensitive networking components it
289:36 - conditions the incoming power to remove
289:38 - spikes and sags in the current helping
289:41 - to ensure that the flow of current is
289:43 - even and consistent which is very
289:46 - beneficial to your electronic and
289:48 - networking components they also help to
289:50 - ensure the continued operation at least
289:53 - for a given period of time in the case
289:56 - of complete electrical power supply loss
290:00 - as in an outage depending upon your UPS
290:03 - you may be able to run for minutes hours
290:06 - or possibly days if you have a generator
290:09 - First Responders are the first people to
290:13 - discover or respond to a security issue
290:16 - ideally it will be someone who has been
290:18 - properly trained in how to deal with the
290:21 - situation within the network security
290:23 - realm First Responders can play a key
290:26 - role in mitigating damage and collecting
290:29 - evidence then there's the concept of a
290:31 - data breach which is any unon authorize
290:34 - access to data particularly to sensitive
290:37 - data breaches may be unintentional or
290:40 - intentional they may also occur from
290:43 - inside the network so internally or they
290:46 - may originate from an external source so
290:49 - they may come from outside of your
290:50 - network the severity of the breach is
290:53 - greatly determined by the sensitivity
290:56 - and the quantity of the data that's been
290:59 - accessed data breaches can be very
291:01 - expensive to organizations they can
291:04 - result in a loss of reputation which can
291:06 - lead to a loss of Revenue when it became
291:09 - known that Target lost sensitive
291:11 - customer information you know credit
291:13 - card information people became unwilling
291:16 - or uncomfortable with shopping at Target
291:19 - even though they quickly fixed the
291:21 - breach the results lingered on a data
291:24 - breach may result in a loss of business
291:27 - Secrets which may cost that organization
291:30 - a competitive advantage and finally data
291:33 - breach may result in fines or penalties
291:36 - levied by governments or other
291:39 - organizations user awareness and
291:41 - training can greatly reduce your
291:44 - security risks quite often the weakest
291:46 - link in the security chain is the end
291:49 - user the risks can be reduced by making
291:52 - the users properly aware of security and
291:55 - security threats through awareness
291:57 - training and just security training in
292:00 - general this training should be
292:02 - conducted on an ongoing basis it's never
292:05 - a oneandone thing penetration testing is
292:09 - the finding of weak spots and the
292:11 - hardening of systems it is actively and
292:14 - aggressively testing the whole it system
292:17 - in an effort to find weak spots this can
292:20 - include using social engineering methods
292:22 - on your end users to find out if they
292:25 - are your weak link the data generated is
292:29 - used to harden the it system in an
292:32 - effort to mitigate future
292:34 - risks similar to penetration testing is
292:37 - vulnerability scanning this is the
292:39 - finding of network holes and then
292:41 - plugging them it's mostly done through
292:44 - the use of automated software networks
292:47 - are probed for vulnerabilities as in
292:49 - open ports or unnecessary protocols once
292:53 - these ports or protocols have been
292:55 - identified these holes into the network
292:58 - can then be plugged but remember you
293:01 - need to have authorization to perform
293:03 - vulnerability scanning or you may be
293:06 - having an uncomfortable discussion with
293:09 - your security Personnel now that
293:12 - concludes this session on risk and
293:14 - security related Concepts I talked about
293:17 - the big picture of recovery and then I
293:20 - covered some Concepts and terms that you
293:22 - should know on behalf of pace it thank
293:25 - you for watching this session and I hope
293:28 - to do another one
293:32 - soon
293:36 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
293:39 - pait's session on common Network
293:43 - vulnerabilities today we're going to be
293:45 - discussing vulnerabilities associated
293:47 - with unsecure protocols and we're going
293:50 - to conclude with vulnerable Network
293:54 - practices there's a fair amount of
293:56 - ground to cover so let's jump into this
293:59 - session I will Begin by discussing
294:02 - vulnerabilities associated with unsecure
294:06 - protocols network security is never a
294:09 - completely done deal it often seems as
294:12 - if as soon as one hole is plugged
294:14 - another one opens up vulnerabilities are
294:17 - discovered all the time making it
294:20 - difficult for Network administrators to
294:22 - keep up while this is true there are
294:25 - still some steps that administrators
294:27 - should take to reduce the
294:29 - vulnerabilities that exist in the
294:31 - systems under their control
294:34 - by reducing known vulnerabilities
294:36 - administrators can then spend their time
294:39 - preparing for in reducing exposure to
294:42 - upand cominging threats thus increasing
294:45 - their
294:46 - productivity the first vulnerable
294:49 - protocol that we're going to discuss is
294:51 - telnet telnet is a protocol that is used
294:54 - to create a virtual terminal connection
294:57 - that is commonly used for
294:59 - troubleshooting tnet is very insecure
295:02 - because all communication occurs in
295:04 - clear text tnut does not support
295:08 - encryption whenever possible secure
295:11 - shell or SSH should be used to create
295:15 - those virtual terminal Connections in
295:18 - place of tnet then there is SNMP simple
295:22 - Network management protocol versions one
295:26 - and two SNMP is a protocol that is used
295:29 - to remotely manage and configure network
295:32 - devices due to their lack of encryption
295:35 - support versions one and two are
295:37 - unsecure and susceptible to packet
295:39 - sniffers this can allow an attacker to
295:42 - grab those packets and actually gain
295:44 - control of the configuration and
295:46 - management of your network devices if
295:49 - you're going to use
295:51 - SNMP version 3 should always be used as
295:55 - it supports more security including
295:58 - encryption FTP or file transfer protocol
296:02 - is a prot call that is used to transfer
296:05 - files across a network connection while
296:08 - a username and password are required in
296:10 - most cases to use FTP it doesn't support
296:14 - encryption which creates a vulnerability
296:17 - in the process because of this lack of
296:20 - encryption support everything is done in
296:22 - the clear making it susceptible to being
296:25 - captured and you could lose sensitive
296:28 - information secure FTP or SFTP should be
296:32 - used to in place of FTP as it creates an
296:36 - SSH
296:38 - FTP session tftp or trivial file
296:42 - transfer protocol is a simple stripped
296:45 - down version of FTP that doesn't support
296:49 - authentication like standard FTP so it's
296:53 - even more unsecure it is commonly used
296:56 - to download and upload configuration
296:59 - files for networking equipment tftp
297:02 - should only be used when a connection to
297:04 - networking equipment is made through the
297:07 - console Port thus eliminating the
297:09 - possibility of EAS dropping and that
297:12 - console Port should have its own
297:14 - security measures in place everyone's
297:17 - fairly familiar with HTTP or hypertex
297:20 - transfer protocol it's the protocol that
297:23 - is used to send and receive data over
297:26 - the Internet it is unsecure in its basic
297:29 - format and susceptible to being
297:31 - intercepted due to a lack of encryption
297:35 - https or HTTP secure should be used when
297:40 - conducting sensitive business over the
297:42 - internet as it will provide encryption
297:45 - and other Security Services hopefully
297:47 - your network still doesn't use serial
297:50 - line IP or slip it is an early protocol
297:54 - that was developed for communicating
297:56 - over serial ports and modem connections
297:59 - that required a static IP address it is
298:02 - very outdated and very unsecure slip
298:06 - does not support encryption hopefully
298:09 - you will be using pointto Point protocol
298:12 - in its place PPP does support encryption
298:16 - and is much more secure now it's time to
298:19 - talk about vulnerable Network
298:22 - practices first up are unpatched or
298:25 - Legacy systems unpatch systems are by
298:28 - their very nature unsecure keeping all
298:31 - operating systems in applications up to
298:34 - date will reduce vulnerabilities in the
298:37 - network and it helps to harden that
298:40 - Network against attack in some
298:42 - situations it is necessary to keep
298:45 - Legacy systems alive this can create
298:48 - vulnerabilities in the system as
298:50 - weaknesses in these Legacy systems tend
298:53 - to be well known special security
298:56 - measures should be taken with Legacy
298:59 - systems in order to reduce the
299:01 - opportunity for exploitation
299:04 - one of the best security steps that you
299:06 - can take is placing these Legacy
299:09 - applications or systems on their own
299:12 - network or on their own virtual local
299:15 - area networks then there are open ports
299:18 - and an open port can either be physical
299:21 - or it can be an application Port these
299:24 - open ports create a hole in the security
299:27 - of the network and may be exploited
299:30 - while not all open ports can or should
299:32 - be closed
299:33 - security should be placed on these ports
299:36 - that need to remain open to reduce the
299:39 - vulnerability of the network a good
299:41 - practice is to use a port scanner
299:44 - periodically to verify that only
299:47 - absolutely required application ports
299:49 - are open another thing to remember is
299:52 - that you should only use a port scanner
299:55 - if you are authorized to scan that
299:58 - Network or you may end up in a rather
300:00 - lengthy discussion with your security
300:03 - Personnel unnecessary running services
300:07 - are another vulnerable Network practice
300:10 - operating system services are used to
300:12 - perform some functions within the system
300:15 - but it is possible for them to be
300:17 - exploited a periodic review of all
300:20 - running Services should be conducted on
300:23 - all equipment that is attached to the
300:25 - network all unnecessary running Services
300:28 - should be disabled to harden your
300:31 - network clear text credal credentials
300:33 - are another vulnerability that's rather
300:36 - common many applications and devices
300:39 - require the use of credentials in order
300:41 - to be used in some cases these
300:44 - credentials are sent in clear text
300:46 - format which makes them easier to read
300:49 - when captured a good practice is to
300:52 - periodically review all applications and
300:54 - systems to determine which ones use
300:57 - Clear text credentials then you need to
301:00 - either limit their use or figure out how
301:03 - to encrypt the Transmissions to secure
301:06 - your systems unencrypted communication
301:10 - channels are another problem any method
301:13 - of communication on the network that is
301:15 - not encrypted is an unencrypted channel
301:18 - that is subject to being breached while
301:21 - not all communication channels need to
301:23 - be encrypted a good practice is to
301:25 - review all channels and make a decision
301:28 - about which ones need to be encrypted
301:31 - and which ones do not all wireless
301:34 - network channels should be encrypted
301:36 - there are no exceptions do not create an
301:40 - unencrypted wireless network that's just
301:43 - asking for problems a vulnerability that
301:46 - few Network administrators think about
301:49 - our RF or radio frequency emanations one
301:54 - method of intercepting communication is
301:56 - to analyze signal leakage that's the RF
302:00 - emanation many forms of communication
302:02 - are subject to these signal emanations
302:06 - but there are steps that can be taken to
302:08 - reduce them Tempest is a set of
302:11 - Standards established by the NSA and
302:14 - NATO that outline steps that can be used
302:17 - to reduce the opportunity for the
302:19 - interception and Analysis of
302:22 - communication that concludes this
302:24 - session on common Network
302:27 - vulnerabilities I began with
302:29 - vulnerabilities associated with unsecure
302:32 - protocol calls I then concluded with
302:35 - vulnerable Network practices on behalf
302:38 - of pait thank you for watching this
302:41 - session and I look forward to doing
302:43 - another
302:51 - one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome
302:55 - to pait's session on common Network
302:58 - threats part one today we're going to be
303:01 - discussing Inside Job or threats and
303:04 - we're going to conclude with some
303:06 - outside threats to your
303:08 - network with that let's go ahead and
303:11 - begin this session of course I'm going
303:13 - to begin by talking about inside jobs or
303:17 - threats first up is malicious employees
303:21 - we may not know the reason why they're
303:23 - malicious but they are difficult to
303:26 - defend against as they are already
303:28 - inside the defenses of the network and
303:31 - because their employees resources have
303:33 - been granted to them in order for them
303:36 - to be able to do their job one of the
303:39 - best defenses against malicious
303:41 - employees is using the principle of
303:44 - least privilege only granting the least
303:47 - amount of authorization that is required
303:50 - for a person to get their work done
303:52 - that's the best defense against a
303:54 - malicious employee compromised systems
303:58 - are another threat once a PC or network
304:01 - device has been compromised it is
304:03 - vitally important to isolate it from the
304:06 - system as a whole a compromised PC could
304:09 - lead to a completely compromised Network
304:12 - as malware may be able to spread across
304:15 - its connections once malware has gained
304:18 - access to network resources it can be
304:21 - extremely difficult to root out and
304:23 - remove malware may also degrade the
304:27 - Network's performance causing other
304:29 - issues then there is social engineering
304:33 - this is the process of using social
304:35 - pressure to cause somebody to compromise
304:38 - a system from inside the defenses of the
304:41 - network social engineering pressure can
304:44 - be applied in multiple forms an employee
304:47 - can receive a phone call from somebody
304:49 - claiming to be from the IT department
304:52 - asking for their credentials it may
304:54 - occur in person the social engineering
304:57 - can occur through email or through a
304:59 - rogue website there are many Avenues in
305:03 - which social engineering can occur the
305:06 - best defense is through enduser
305:09 - education training your end users to
305:12 - resist social engineering is a good idea
305:16 - ARP cach poisoning is another threat
305:19 - that can occur on your network in ARP
305:22 - cach poisoning the ARP cach which maps
305:25 - IP addresses to Mac addresses is
305:28 - corrupted by an attacker with the end
305:30 - result being that the attack hacker has
305:33 - control of which IP addresses are
305:36 - associated with Mac addresses it's
305:39 - commonly used in man in the- Middle
305:42 - attacks which I will cover in just a bit
305:45 - then there are protocol or packet abuse
305:48 - threats this is the process of taking a
305:51 - specific protocol and repurposing it to
305:54 - perform a different function protocol
305:57 - abuse is commonly used to bypass a
305:59 - router's Access Control list from inside
306:02 - of a network an example of this is
306:05 - encapsulating a not allowed protocol
306:09 - within a DNS packet which is almost
306:13 - always an allowed protocol in order to
306:16 - get that unallowed protocol out of the
306:19 - network the man in the middle attack is
306:22 - another threat that you should be aware
306:24 - of the attacker is not necessarily
306:27 - inside the network per se but is in
306:30 - between two endpoints that are Comm
306:32 - communicating on a network in most cases
306:35 - the manin the-middle attack involves
306:38 - disrupting the ARP process between the
306:40 - two endpoints the attack allows a
306:43 - malicious user to be able to view all
306:45 - Network packets that are flowing between
306:48 - the communicating hosts often a man- in
306:51 - the-middle attack is used in an attempt
306:54 - to gain sensitive information like
306:56 - Network credentials then there's VLAN
306:59 - hopping this is circumventing the
307:01 - security that is inherent when virtual
307:04 - local area networks are created normally
307:07 - traffic that is tagged for one VLAN is
307:10 - not allowed onto another VLAN without
307:13 - the intervention of a router VLAN
307:16 - hopping occurs when the attacker adds an
307:18 - additional fake VLAN tag to the network
307:22 - packets once the packets get to the
307:24 - switch the switch strips one of the VLAN
307:27 - tags off the packet and then passes it
307:30 - through once through the switch packet
307:33 - is considered as belonging to the new
307:35 - VLAN thus bypassing the security that's
307:39 - inherent in
307:41 - vlans now let's move to outside threats
307:44 - one of the largest threats that face
307:46 - network security Personnel is the
307:49 - unknown vulnerability Network and
307:51 - systems administrators expend vast
307:54 - amounts of time protecting the assets
307:56 - under their control and they can do a
307:59 - pretty good job of hardening their
308:01 - systems but it's not a perfect job the
308:04 - problem lies with zero day attacks zero
308:08 - day attacks take advantage of either new
308:10 - or recently discovered
308:12 - vulnerabilities which means that the
308:14 - networks and systems probably haven't
308:17 - been hardened against them yet the
308:19 - unfortunate reality is that attacks keep
308:22 - changing and Security Experts must be
308:24 - willing to adapt in order to keep Pace
308:28 - if they can't adapt they will fall
308:30 - behind and their networks become become
308:33 - vulnerable let's talk about the Brute
308:35 - Force attack this is using computing
308:38 - power in time to compromise passwords
308:41 - the attacker uses a program that
308:43 - continually tries different password
308:46 - combinations often in the form of a
308:48 - special dictionary application in an
308:51 - effort to crack a password the best
308:54 - defense against this is to limit the
308:57 - number of times that a user can attempt
309:00 - to log on before they're locked down out
309:03 - then they're spoofing this is a category
309:05 - of threats where either the MAC address
309:07 - or the IP address of the attacker has
309:10 - been modified to look like a friendly
309:12 - address in order to bypass network
309:15 - security a common use in the past was
309:18 - for an attacker to spoof their IP
309:20 - address so that the outside attacker was
309:24 - actually viewed as an inside host a
309:27 - common defense against this type of
309:29 - spoofing is an ACL rule that does
309:32 - doesn't allow an inside IP address to
309:35 - come from outside of your network then
309:38 - there's session hijacking an attacker
309:41 - attempts to take over a communication
309:43 - session after a user has been
309:46 - authenticated the hijacking can occur
309:48 - through various methods as in using a
309:51 - packet sniffer to steal a session cookie
309:54 - or installing malware on a user's
309:57 - computer that is activated after the
309:59 - user is
310:01 - authenticated that concludes this
310:03 - session on common Network threats part
310:06 - one I talked about inside jobs or
310:09 - threats and then I concluded with a
310:11 - brief discussion on some outside threats
310:14 - now on behalf of pace it thank you for
310:16 - watching this session and I hope you
310:18 - watch another one
310:28 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
310:32 - to Pace it session on common Network
310:35 - threats part two today I'm going to be
310:37 - talking about more outside threats and
310:40 - then I'm going to be talking about some
310:42 - wireless network threats I have a fair
310:44 - amount of ground to cover so let's go
310:47 - ahead and begin this session of course
310:50 - I'm going to begin by talking about
310:51 - outside threats because of how they are
310:55 - implemented it is often difficult to put
310:57 - network security threats into a single
311:00 - category many attempts to breach a
311:02 - network combine different aspects of
311:05 - different threats for example a man in
311:08 - the- Middle attack is often combined
311:10 - with some type of spoofing that is used
311:12 - to help it succeed that means that in
311:15 - most cases security requires more than
311:18 - just a single line of defense good
311:20 - administrators recognize this and
311:22 - Implement multiple layers of security in
311:26 - order to harden and protect their
311:29 - systems the first major threat that
311:31 - we're going to talk about is the denial
311:33 - of service threat or the Dos threat this
311:37 - covers a very broad category of threats
311:40 - to networks and systems that's because
311:43 - dos covers any threat that can
311:46 - potentially keep users or customers from
311:49 - using network resources as designed a
311:52 - traditional dos attack attempts to flood
311:55 - a network with enough traffic to bring
311:58 - it down it's commonly used with a flood
312:01 - of M well formed icmp requests the host
312:05 - that receives the flood can be so busy
312:07 - dealing with the delus of data that it
312:10 - cannot respond to legitimate requests
312:13 - then there's the permanent dos attack
312:16 - it's an attempt to permanently deny a
312:19 - network resource for others it can be
312:21 - achieved by physically destroying or
312:24 - removing the resource or it can also be
312:26 - achieved through the use of malware that
312:29 - corrupts or damages the underlying
312:31 - digital system to the point where it
312:34 - cannot be repaired and must be replaced
312:38 - there are also friendly or unintentional
312:41 - denial of service attacks an unintended
312:44 - dos attack can occur when poorly written
312:47 - applications consume more network
312:49 - resources than are available another
312:53 - unintentional dos attack can occur when
312:56 - a network interface controller or Nick
312:58 - begins to fail it's quite common when a
313:01 - Nick is about to fail for it to go
313:03 - offline and come back online repeatedly
313:07 - and rapidly this consumes network
313:10 - resources which can cause an
313:12 - unintentional dos more destructive than
313:16 - the standard denial of service attack is
313:19 - the distributed denial of service attack
313:21 - or the DDOS attack it's a denial of
313:25 - service attack in which more than a
313:27 - single system is involved in sending the
313:29 - attack a DDOS attack has a higher chance
313:33 - of succeeding due to the increased
313:35 - number of participants the machines used
313:38 - to send the attack may be voluntary
313:41 - participants this is called a
313:43 - coordinated attack or they may be part
313:45 - of a botn net with the botn net malware
313:48 - has been installed on the machines and
313:51 - they are no longer under the complete
313:53 - control of their owners many distributed
313:56 - denial of service attacks involve bot
313:58 - Nets where the attacker has actually
314:00 - rented the bot net for the sole purpose
314:03 - of Performing the
314:05 - DDOS the goal of the DDOS is to create a
314:09 - large enough enough spike in traffic
314:11 - that the target becomes unreachable in
314:13 - some cases the target system may need to
314:16 - be rebooted in order for it to come back
314:20 - online there's the reflective denial of
314:23 - service attack it's also known as an
314:26 - amplified dos the attacker uses some
314:29 - method usually some form of spoofing to
314:32 - hide the source of the attack in a
314:35 - reflective DNS attack the attacker
314:38 - usually spoofs the intended Target's IP
314:41 - address and sends multiple requests to
314:44 - an open DNS server the DNS server
314:48 - responds by sending traffic back to the
314:50 - targeted system and the attacker's hope
314:53 - is that the response from the DNS server
314:56 - will overwhelm the targeted system a
314:59 - cousin to the reflective DNS attack is
315:02 - the reflective ntp attack or the
315:05 - reflective Network time protocol attack
315:09 - it works in the same way however instead
315:11 - of using DNS it relies upon open ntp
315:14 - servers not very common anymore but you
315:17 - still need to know about it are the
315:19 - Smurf attacks also known as smurfing
315:23 - it's a type of reflective denial of
315:25 - service attack that also involves
315:28 - spoofing the intended Target's IP
315:30 - address another network is flooded with
315:33 - icmp requests in which the source
315:35 - address for the requests appear to be
315:38 - that of the intended target as the
315:41 - replies returned the network becomes
315:43 - slowed down by the traffic the goal is
315:46 - to overwhelm the target system and bring
315:48 - it down it's time to move on to wireless
315:52 - network threats our first topic is an
315:56 - unintended threat a common feature on
315:59 - Modern wireless access points is Wi-Fi
316:02 - protected setup or WPS the goal of WPS
316:06 - is to create an easy and secure method
316:09 - for consumers and small businesses to
316:12 - set up a secure wireless network
316:15 - unfortunately the outcome has fallen
316:17 - short of the goal while WPS does ease
316:21 - the setup burden it is also easily
316:23 - exploited by an attacker and should
316:26 - actually be disabled on all equipment
316:29 - this exploit has been known for a couple
316:31 - of years years and you would think that
316:33 - equipment manufacturers would quit
316:35 - enabling WPS by default on their
316:38 - equipment but that's not the case so
316:41 - when you set it up
316:45 - you good day I'm Brian Ferell and
316:48 - welcome to Pace's session on network
316:51 - hardening techniques part one today I'm
316:54 - going to discuss using secure protocols
316:57 - using antimalware software and I'm going
317:00 - to conclude with implementing switch and
317:02 - router security there's a whole lot of
317:05 - information to impart not a whole lot of
317:08 - time so let's go ahead and begin this
317:10 - session of course I'm going to begin by
317:13 - talking about using secure
317:16 - protocols network security is always an
317:19 - ongoing process because the threats to
317:21 - it keep changing although security
317:24 - threats are continually evolving
317:26 - administrators can use some techniques
317:28 - to harden the base Network structure to
317:31 - help ease the ever shifting security
317:33 - landscape these hardening techniques
317:36 - establish a good security Foundation
317:38 - that can be further built upon making
317:40 - the network that much harder to crack
317:43 - one of these hardening techniques is to
317:45 - use secure protocols whenever possible
317:49 - so let's discuss some of those protocols
317:52 - first up is secure shell or SSH it's a
317:57 - protocol that is used to create an
317:59 - encrypted Communications session between
318:02 - devices it's commonly used to create a
318:05 - secure virtual terminal session it
318:08 - should be used in place of telnet
318:10 - whenever possible then there's SNMP
318:14 - version 3 that's simple Network
318:16 - management protocol version 3 it's a
318:20 - protocol that's used to manage and
318:22 - configure devices remotely on the
318:24 - network it's more secure than the prior
318:27 - two versions because it supports
318:30 - encryption secure file transfer protocol
318:33 - or SFTP should always be used in place
318:37 - of FTP it's a protocol that's used to
318:41 - transfer data and manage file structures
318:44 - in a secure manner through the use of an
318:47 - SS session as I said just a moment ago
318:50 - it is a better option than FTP which
318:54 - requires user authentication but does
318:57 - not encrypt the communication SFTP en
319:01 - CPS the whole process then there's TLS
319:05 - or transport layer security it's a
319:08 - cryptographic protocol that's used to
319:10 - encrypt online Communications it uses
319:14 - certificates and asymmetrical
319:16 - cryptography to authenticate hosts and
319:19 - exchange security Keys it is a better
319:22 - option than SSL or secure socket layer
319:27 - which functions in a similar manner when
319:29 - performing sensitive online online
319:31 - business you should use
319:34 - https hyper text transfer protocol
319:37 - secure it's a protocol that is used to
319:40 - secure the communications Channel
319:43 - between a web browser and a web server
319:46 - https uses either TLS or SSL technology
319:52 - IPC or IPC is a network layer IP
319:56 - security protocol Suite that can use
319:59 - multiple methods to mutually
320:01 - authenticate both ends of the
320:02 - communication Channel it also will
320:05 - encrypt all data Transmissions unlike
320:08 - most other protocols it can provide
320:10 - endtoend security for any
320:14 - application let's move to using anti-
320:17 - maware software anti-malware
320:20 - applications help to protect networks
320:24 - and network resources against malware
320:26 - intrusions as in spyware viruses and
320:30 - worms there are are three main options
320:32 - for using anti-malware
320:34 - applications there's host-based
320:37 - antimalware the application is installed
320:40 - on the individual machines and only
320:42 - protects those nodes on which it resides
320:45 - it's easily tuned to the needs of the
320:48 - individual host but requires that the
320:50 - user keep it up to dat then there's
320:53 - network-based
320:54 - antimalware the application is installed
320:57 - within the local network and served to
320:59 - the individual client that require it it
321:02 - is easily administered but harder to
321:05 - tune for the individual hosts but the
321:08 - network administrator can ensure that it
321:11 - remains up to dat finally there's
321:13 - cloud-based antimalware the application
321:17 - resides in the cloud so it is outside of
321:19 - the local network and it is served to
321:22 - the clients inside the local network as
321:25 - needed this service has a very small
321:28 - footprint on the local machine and tends
321:30 - to be be kept more current than the
321:32 - other options but it is an added cost
321:35 - that must be
321:36 - evaluated let's conclude with talking
321:39 - about implementing switch in router
321:42 - security when is using a password not
321:45 - secure well the answer is when the
321:47 - password is kept in clear text one
321:50 - solution to this is to save passwords
321:52 - and other sensitive information as
321:55 - hashes hashing is a cryptographic
321:58 - process that uses an algorithm to derive
322:01 - a set value also known as the hashed
322:04 - value from the sensitive data the hash
322:07 - can be used to verify that data is
322:10 - coming from where it is supposed to and
322:12 - that it has not been intercepted or
322:15 - changed in transit the most popular
322:17 - hashing algorithms are md5 and Sh or
322:22 - Shaw of the two Shaw is the more secure
322:27 - and the wise network administrator makes
322:29 - sure that all password and usernames are
322:32 - kept as hashed values under implementing
322:36 - switch security measures switch Port
322:39 - security measures are vital first off
322:42 - switch Port security should be enabled
322:45 - all Enterprise switches are capable of
322:48 - having security measures enabled at the
322:51 - Port level and that should happen also
322:54 - the native VLAN should be changed from
322:57 - its default value all active ports
323:00 - should be assigned Ed to nonnative vlans
323:03 - all nonactive switch ports should be
323:06 - assigned to an unused non-native VLAN
323:10 - also vlans should be created to clearly
323:14 - segment the network into logical secure
323:18 - areas a switchport security measure that
323:21 - should be considered is MAC address
323:23 - filtering this will only allow specific
323:27 - Mac addresses to connect to specific
323:30 - ports
323:31 - DHCP snooping should be enabled this
323:34 - will only allow DHCP responses from an
323:39 - administrator defined switch Port this
323:42 - means that all
323:43 - DHCP responses will come from the same
323:47 - port in addition to DHCP snooping
323:50 - Dynamic ARP inspection or Dai should
323:54 - also be enabled this process is combined
323:57 - with DHCP snooping to restrict the
324:00 - opportunity for ARP cache poisoning to
324:03 - occur all address resolution protocol
324:07 - requests are compared against the ARP
324:10 - table contained in the administratively
324:13 - defined DHCP server implementing these
324:17 - measures will greatly increase the
324:20 - security of your switches let's move on
324:23 - to router security measures each
324:26 - interface on a router should have an
324:29 - access control list or ACL in place to
324:32 - control and filter traffic each
324:35 - interface can actually have two ACLS one
324:38 - ACL on the inbound side of the interface
324:41 - and one ACL on the outbound side of the
324:44 - interface an ACL is a set of rules that
324:48 - is used to govern and filter the flow of
324:50 - network traffic into and out of a
324:53 - network the ACL examines packets against
324:56 - its established rules beginning from the
324:59 - first rule at the top of the list and
325:02 - continuing down through all the rules
325:04 - the rules either allow or deny the
325:07 - packet from continuing once the packet
325:10 - matches a rule the rule is enforced and
325:13 - the ACL process is exited ACL rules can
325:17 - be based on protocols and ports IP
325:20 - addresses Source addresses destination
325:23 - addresses Etc all ACLS end with an
325:28 - implicit deny statement meaning that if
325:31 - it isn't specifically allowed then the
325:33 - packet is discarded the ACL can be time
325:37 - based as in day of the week or time of
325:40 - day and it can fulfill a specific
325:43 - function based on the reason that it is
325:45 - created as in an ACL can be used to
325:48 - filter out websites or web content that
325:53 - concludes this session on network
325:55 - hardening techniques part one I talked
325:58 - about using secure protocol then we
326:01 - moved on to using antimalware software
326:04 - and we concluded with a brief discussion
326:06 - on implementing switch and router
326:09 - Security on behalf of pace it thank you
326:12 - for watching this session and I hope to
326:14 - do another one
326:21 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
326:25 - welcome to pait's session on network
326:28 - hardening techniques part two today
326:31 - we're going to talk about encryption
326:33 - Basics and then we're going to talk
326:35 - about wireless network hardening and
326:37 - then I'm going to conclude with a brief
326:39 - discussion on security policies with
326:42 - that let's go ahead and begin this
326:45 - session I'm going to begin by talking
326:47 - about encryption
326:49 - Basics encryption is the process of
326:52 - taking a message and scrambling the data
326:55 - so that it can't be read if it gets
326:57 - intercepted encryption relies upon the
327:00 - fact that the receiver of The Scrambled
327:02 - data has the proper key that allows it
327:05 - to unscramble the data and put the
327:07 - message back together the strength of
327:10 - the encryption is usually determined by
327:12 - the strength of the key the strength of
327:15 - the key is measured in the number of
327:17 - bits that it takes to generate the key
327:20 - the more bits that it takes the stronger
327:23 - the
327:29 - key
328:09 - the private key in this Arrangement the
328:12 - private key cannot decrypt what it
328:15 - encrypted and the public key cannot
328:18 - decrypt what it encrypted so it only
328:21 - works if there are two separate keys so
328:24 - let's talk about those asymmetrical
328:26 - encryption keys there are two main types
328:30 - tyes of asymmetrical encryption keys
328:33 - there is the EAP TLS type key that's
328:37 - extensible authenication protocol
328:40 - transport layer security type of key it
328:43 - requires the use of a certificate
328:45 - Authority or CA that is trusted by both
328:49 - parties the ca provides the certificates
328:52 - to both parties that allow for the
328:55 - generation of both the public and
328:57 - private security Keys it's very secure
329:01 - but it is also difficult to manage and
329:04 - maintain then there's ttls tunneling
329:07 - transport layer security it's as secure
329:11 - as the EAP TLs but only the
329:14 - authentication server receives a
329:17 - certificate for the key generation
329:19 - process and it's easier to manage and
329:22 - maintain than EAP
329:25 - TLS with that covered let's move on to
329:28 - wireless network hardening
329:31 - wireless networks can represent a
329:33 - special challenge in the network
329:35 - hardening process the goal of most
329:37 - hardening techniques is to keep
329:39 - nefarious elements from ever seeeing the
329:42 - network traffic but with wireless
329:44 - networks that is all but imposs as
329:47 - traffic is broadcast over known radio
329:50 - frequency channels this traffic is
329:53 - subject to capture and the Transmissions
329:55 - inform any who care that an active
329:58 - wireless network is present there are
330:01 - steps that can be taken as in encrypting
330:03 - the traffic to make sure that even if
330:06 - the network traffic is captured it
330:08 - cannot be read this helps to keep the
330:11 - network traffic safe and the network
330:13 - from being breached one of the first
330:16 - techniques that you can use to harden a
330:18 - wireless network is MAC address
330:21 - filtering MAC address filtering can be
330:24 - used to limit which devices can connect
330:27 - to the wireless network if an unknown
330:30 - Mac address attempts to connect to the
330:32 - network it is ignored by the wireless
330:34 - access point so when it requests to join
330:38 - the WAP checks its Mac filter and if
330:41 - that Mac isn't in the filter it just
330:43 - drops that requester while Mac filtering
330:46 - can be effective it can also be
330:49 - difficult to manage and it is also
330:51 - possible to spoof Mac
330:54 - addresses which brings us to basic
330:57 - authentication and encryption for
330:59 - wireless networ works first up is web or
331:02 - wired equivalent privacy it's an
331:05 - encryption standard that uses either a
331:07 - 40 bit or
331:09 - 128bit encryption key in the rc4
331:13 - algorithm to authenticate devices and
331:16 - encrypt Transmissions it uses a
331:19 - pre-shared key as a password or
331:22 - passphrase to authenticate users web is
331:26 - easily cracked and should not be used as
331:28 - a matter of fact web can be cracked in
331:31 - minutes better than weap is
331:34 - WPA WiFi protected access it's an
331:37 - authentication and encryption standard
331:40 - that improved upon web but still uses
331:43 - psk and the rc4 algorithm but to
331:47 - increase security it also introduced
331:49 - temporal key Integrity protocol or tkip
331:53 - tkip generates a new security key for
331:56 - every packet and that new security key
332:00 - has a strength of 128 bits or greater
332:04 - now it's not as easily cracked as web
332:07 - but it can still be cracked and should
332:09 - not be used unless absolutely necessary
332:13 - and hopefully that's not the case in
332:15 - your wiress network better than WPA is
332:20 - WPA2 personal Wi-Fi protected access to
332:24 - personal it's an authentication and
332:27 - encryption standard that improved upon
332:30 - WPA it does not rely upon the weak rc4
332:35 - encryption algorithm but it does use AES
332:39 - as its algorithm that's Advanced
332:42 - encryption standard it can also use the
332:45 - psk method but this is not required as
332:48 - WPA2 personal can also dynamically
332:52 - assign security keys while it's
332:54 - theoretically possible to crack WPA2
332:58 - personal it would be extreme extremely
333:00 - difficult to do so so this should be the
333:03 - minimum level of security on any
333:06 - wireless network better yet if possible
333:10 - deploy
333:11 - WPA2 Enterprise now this forms a portion
333:15 - of the
333:17 - 802.1x standard it is used to
333:20 - authenticate users on a wireless network
333:22 - and uses one of the forms of the
333:25 - extensible Authentication Protocol in
333:28 - setting up the encryption a central
333:30 - authentication server is required for
333:34 - 802.1x or WPA2 Enterprise which does
333:39 - allow for greater control over the
333:41 - authentication process as a side note
333:44 - EAP is actually a set of definitions for
333:47 - how security keys will be exchanged in
333:50 - order for encryption to take place it's
333:53 - time to conclude with a brief discussion
333:56 - on security policies while security
333:59 - policies are only written documents they
334:02 - can actually do quite a bit to harden a
334:04 - network against a breach security
334:07 - policies document or outline what is
334:09 - allowed or not allowed to occur on the
334:12 - network from a security point of view
334:15 - they're usually crafted at the upper
334:17 - layer of management with the help of
334:19 - knowledgeable IT personnel they
334:22 - establish the expected Behavior which
334:25 - can go a long ways towards hardening
334:28 - your network security policies give
334:30 - administrators the authority to put into
334:33 - place measures to protect the security
334:35 - of the network in many cases they also
334:38 - give administrators the authority to
334:41 - enforce the policies that lead to a
334:43 - hardened Network well that concludes
334:46 - this session on network hardening
334:48 - techniques part two I began by talking
334:52 - about encryption Basics then we moved on
334:54 - to wireless network hardening and we
334:56 - concluded with a brief discussion on
334:59 - security policies on behalf of pace it
335:02 - thank you for watching this session and
335:05 - I hope to do another one
335:12 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
335:16 - welcome to pait's session on network
335:19 - hardening techniques part three today
335:21 - I'm going to discuss user authentication
335:24 - and then I'm going to talk about some
335:26 - authentication and authorization methods
335:29 - there's a fair amount of ground to cover
335:31 - so let's go ahead and dive into this
335:34 - session of course I'm going to start by
335:37 - talking about user
335:39 - authentication hardening the network
335:41 - will not do you any good if there is
335:44 - poor authentication of the users and
335:46 - devices that are allowed on the network
335:49 - the process of proving that you are who
335:51 - you say you are if you are a person or
335:54 - that you are what you say you are if
335:57 - it's a device is called authentic ation
336:00 - authentication is different than
336:03 - authorization authorization is what you
336:05 - are allowed to do after you have been
336:09 - authenticated there are several
336:10 - different ways in which users can be
336:13 - authenticated and there are several
336:15 - different methods in which
336:16 - authentication can be implemented let's
336:20 - talk about basic authentication of the
336:22 - user there are three basic factors for
336:27 - authenticating users there's by by what
336:30 - you know this is the user and password
336:32 - method by what you are this is commonly
336:36 - implemented through biometric and
336:38 - finally there is by what you have this
336:41 - is commonly implemented through the use
336:44 - of security tokens these are the three
336:47 - basic factors for authenticating users
336:51 - now you can combine these in a process
336:53 - that's called multiactor
336:56 - authentication that's requiring the use
336:58 - of more than one of the factors of
337:01 - authentication as in requiring a
337:03 - password and a fingerprint scan or the
337:07 - code from a security token and a
337:09 - password those are multiactor
337:12 - authentication now multiactor
337:14 - authentication is used to increase the
337:17 - security of the authentication process
337:20 - you might also Implement a single sign
337:22 - on process it's a process in which the
337:25 - user only has to provide authentication
337:28 - once via a single smart device rather
337:32 - than having to authenticate for each and
337:34 - every Network resource that they request
337:38 - so let's talk about authentication and
337:41 - authorization methods the first method
337:44 - we're going to talk about is Pap
337:46 - password Authentication Protocol when
337:49 - logging into a network resource the user
337:52 - or device is required to supply a
337:54 - username and password the username and
337:57 - password are sent in clear text format
338:00 - so this method is considered unsecure
338:04 - and should only be used as a last resort
338:07 - more secure than Pap is Chap challenge
338:11 - handshake Authentication Protocol it is
338:14 - similar to Pap in that when logging into
338:16 - a network resource the user or device is
338:19 - challenged to supply a username and
338:22 - secret password and it authenticates
338:25 - through a three-way handshake process
338:28 - the way it works the resource issues a
338:31 - challenge it wants to know the hashed
338:34 - value of the username and secret
338:36 - password the user's device sends the
338:40 - hashed value to the resource device the
338:43 - resource evaluates the hashed value and
338:46 - either accepts or rejects The Connection
338:50 - by using chap the username and password
338:53 - are never sent in clear text it's much
338:57 - more secure than pap
339:00 - there's also Ms chap it's functionally
339:03 - the same as challenge handshake
339:05 - Authentication Protocol but it is
339:08 - Microsoft's proprietary implementation
339:11 - of it you might also Implement one of
339:14 - the forms of extensible Authentication
339:17 - Protocol or EAP it's not a single
339:21 - protocol on its own but a set of
339:23 - additional authentication methods used
339:26 - by remote access clients currently there
339:29 - are are more than 100 different methods
339:32 - defined by the EAP specifications one of
339:35 - the more popular is
339:37 - Kerberos so let's talk about Kerberos
339:41 - it's an Authentication Protocol which
339:43 - uses TCP or UDP Port 88 by default it's
339:48 - a system of authentication and
339:51 - authorization that works well in
339:53 - environments that have a lot of clients
339:56 - the main component of Kerberos is the
339:58 - key Distribution Center or the KDC the
340:02 - KDC has two parts the authentication
340:05 - server or as and the ticket granting
340:09 - service or TGs here's how it works when
340:13 - a user logs in a hashed value of his or
340:17 - her username and password is sent to the
340:20 - authentication server if the as likes
340:23 - the hash it responds with a ticket
340:26 - granting ticket and a timestamp so it
340:30 - will respond with a
340:32 - TGT that also has a timestamp the client
340:36 - then sends the TGT with the timestamp to
340:40 - the ticket granting service the TGs the
340:43 - TGs then responds with a service ticket
340:47 - which can also be called an access token
340:49 - or just a token the service ticket
340:52 - authorizes the user to access specific
340:56 - resources on that Network as long as the
341:00 - TGT is still valid the TGs will grant
341:04 - additional authorization by issuing a
341:07 - new service ticket as required for as
341:10 - long as the TGT and its Tim stamp are
341:14 - still valid now that concludes this
341:17 - session on network hardening techniques
341:20 - part three I talked about user
341:23 - authentication and then we concluded by
341:25 - talking about authentication and
341:27 - authorization methods on behalf of pace
341:30 - it thank you for watching this session
341:33 - and I trust I'll new another one
341:38 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
341:42 - to pait's session on physical network
341:46 - security control today we're going to be
341:48 - discussing the why of physical network
341:50 - security and then we're going to move on
341:53 - to some physical network security
341:56 - practices there's a fair amount of
341:58 - information to in part so let's go ahead
342:01 - and begin this session of course I'm
342:03 - going to begin by discussing the why of
342:06 - physical network security your network
342:09 - security actually begins at the door the
342:13 - boundaries of your building should be
342:15 - your first line of defense if an
342:17 - attacker has physical access to the
342:20 - network resources then there is a high
342:23 - probability that those network resources
342:26 - can be breached the level of security
342:29 - that that gets deployed should be driven
342:31 - by the amount of security that is needed
342:34 - as the need for overall security
342:36 - increases so should the level of
342:39 - physical
342:40 - security there are dangers that are
342:42 - associated with unauthorized physical
342:46 - access there is theft of those network
342:48 - resources and they are expensive to
342:51 - replace unintentional damage can occur
342:54 - when there is unauthorized physical
342:57 - access it only takes a simple spilled
342:59 - drink to destroy a server or a router or
343:03 - a switch or some other expensive
343:06 - component it's also possible that if an
343:09 - attacker has physical access they can
343:12 - reconfigure those network resources this
343:15 - can result in a breached Network one
343:18 - type of reconfiguration that's possible
343:21 - are devices that have credential
343:24 - workarounds some networking equipment
343:27 - comes with known workaround rounds for
343:29 - when administrator credentials need to
343:32 - be recovered as in when an administrator
343:35 - leaves an organization without
343:37 - disclosing his or her log on credentials
343:40 - or when an administrator forgets those
343:43 - credentials Cisco even publishes the
343:46 - steps of its workaround on its website
343:49 - and those steps are available for
343:52 - anybody to review if you're curious
343:55 - about those steps you can check out that
343:56 - web link that I've posted here this
343:59 - well-known vulnerability is an easy
344:02 - exploit for anybody that has physical
344:05 - access to Cisco equipment with the why
344:09 - of physical network security out of the
344:11 - way let's move on to physical network
344:15 - security
344:16 - practices basic physical security should
344:19 - include knowing who's in the building
344:21 - and who has access to equipment you can
344:24 - do that through employee badges security
344:27 - check-in should be implemented for all
344:29 - visitors all vulnerable network
344:32 - resources as in servers and networking
344:35 - equipment should be kept in a secure
344:38 - area then there's intermediate physical
344:41 - security this is where access to all
344:44 - vulnerable network resources is
344:46 - controlled and logged one way to
344:49 - implement this is to use RFID badges to
344:52 - gain access to network resources or you
344:55 - could Implement Cipher locks that people
344:58 - have to punch a code in order to unlock
345:00 - the door another step in intermediate
345:03 - physical security is the separation of
345:06 - resources switches and routers are
345:09 - secured separately from servers with
345:12 - different access levels for the servers
345:15 - and the networking equipment in
345:17 - environments where high security is
345:19 - needed advanced physical security needs
345:21 - to be implemented a zoned approach is an
345:24 - advanced physical security practice it's
345:27 - a layering of Security in which multiple
345:30 - barriers or security tests must be
345:34 - passed before physical access is granted
345:38 - the methods of physical security that
345:40 - are used can be thought of as those
345:42 - security tests you can use security
345:45 - guards requiring all authorized
345:48 - Personnel to have some form of ID so
345:51 - that the security guards can identify if
345:53 - that person is in an area in which
345:56 - they're allowed then there are door
345:58 - locks you could use Simple key locks the
346:01 - analog approach a slightly more advanced
346:04 - method would be Cipher locks with the
346:07 - deployment of different codes for
346:09 - different areas or different groups of
346:11 - people this allows for the logging of
346:14 - who has unlocked a door you might also
346:17 - Implement RFID magnetic locks which also
346:21 - allow for the logging of of who has
346:23 - unlocked the lock one of the most
346:26 - advanced types of door locks would be be
346:29 - a biometric lock they're locks that make
346:32 - the person gaining access prove who they
346:35 - are through either a fingerprint scan or
346:37 - a retinal scan or possibly even a voice
346:40 - print video monitoring can also be
346:43 - deployed as a form of physical security
346:46 - allowing you to record who has had
346:49 - access to those resources you need to
346:51 - remember to store the recordings
346:53 - separately from the resources being
346:55 - monitored so if the resource gets stolen
346:58 - they don't steal the recording as well
347:01 - you may Implement a separation of
347:04 - resources networking equipment is kept
347:06 - separate from servers and the methods of
347:09 - access for the two resources are
347:11 - different and finally in highly secure
347:15 - environments a man trap may be
347:17 - implemented a man trap usually involves
347:20 - at least two doors access is granted
347:23 - through one door but the next door
347:26 - cannot be opened until further
347:28 - verification a has been achieved and the
347:31 - person that's between the doors cannot
347:33 - go back out the other door that means
347:35 - that ideally the person between the
347:38 - doors is trapped until some action or
347:41 - verification takes place that concludes
347:44 - this session on physical network
347:47 - security control we talked about the why
347:50 - of physical network security and then we
347:53 - concluded with a brief discussion on
347:55 - physical network security practices on
347:58 - behalf of pace it thank you for watching
348:01 - this session and I hope to do another
348:03 - one
348:12 - soon good day I'm Brian Ferrell and
348:15 - welcome to pait's session on firewall
348:18 - Basics today I'm going to discuss types
348:21 - of firewalls and then we're going to
348:23 - move on to firewall settings and
348:26 - techniques I have a whole whole plethora
348:29 - of information to impart not a whole lot
348:32 - of time so let's go ahead and jump into
348:35 - today's session of course I'm going to
348:38 - start with types of
348:40 - firewalls first up are host-based
348:43 - firewalls these are installed at the
348:45 - node which is usually a desktop computer
348:49 - they're often used in conjunction with
348:51 - network based firewalls now host-based
348:55 - firewalls are always software applic
348:58 - ations then there are network-based
349:01 - firewalls usually these are implemented
349:04 - on the perimeter of the network segment
349:06 - that needs the protection they're used
349:09 - to protect private networks from public
349:12 - or outside networks network-based
349:15 - firewalls can be a network appliance
349:17 - which means that it was specially
349:19 - designed and deployed to provide only
349:22 - firewall services or it can be a
349:25 - software application either as part of
349:27 - the router's operating system or as a
349:30 - specialty application on a server that
349:33 - is providing some routing function it's
349:36 - time to move on to small office home
349:39 - office firewalls in most cases the
349:42 - network firewall is provided by a wide
349:46 - area network connection device so most
349:49 - often the main firewall is provided by
349:52 - the DSL modem or the cable modem in
349:55 - conjunction with this a host-based
349:57 - firewall is often used with the
350:00 - network-based firewall this provides a
350:03 - little bit more protection and it allows
350:05 - for more granular configuration of the
350:08 - firewall protection part of network
350:11 - security there are stateless inspection
350:14 - firewalls these examine all the packets
350:17 - either entering or leaving the network
350:19 - it examines these packets against a set
350:22 - of rules the set of rules is called an
350:25 - access control list or ACL the AC CL
350:28 - rules are defined as static values by an
350:32 - administrator as I stated all of the
350:35 - packets are examined against the rules
350:37 - in the ACL starting with the first rule
350:41 - if a packet matches a rule that rule is
350:44 - enforced and then the ACL is exited
350:47 - stateless inspection firewalls do not
350:50 - care about the state of the connection
350:53 - they only care about the packets and all
350:55 - packets are examined then there are
350:57 - State f inspection firewalls a stateful
351:00 - inspection firewall doesn't really care
351:03 - about the packets it only cares about
351:05 - the state of a connection between two
351:08 - endpoints as a general rule connections
351:11 - are not allowed to be made from outside
351:13 - of the local network segment to the
351:16 - local network segment being protected
351:18 - only the initial packets going from
351:20 - inside the network to a destination
351:23 - outside of the network are inspected
351:25 - against an ACL if the ACL allow allows
351:28 - those packets to leave the network and a
351:31 - connection is made or once the
351:33 - connection has been established the
351:35 - firewall only monitors the state of that
351:38 - connection it allows the free flow of
351:41 - packets between the inside note and the
351:44 - outside destination as long as the state
351:47 - of the connection remains valid there
351:50 - are application aware firewalls these
351:53 - are firewalls that not only examine the
351:56 - packets but also the app apption
351:58 - protocol that is being used so it knows
352:01 - if it's FTP or HTTP that's being used
352:06 - application aware firewalls make allow
352:08 - or deny decisions based on the
352:11 - application later protocol as well as
352:14 - other ACL rules they are slower but more
352:18 - thorough in protecting the private
352:20 - Network than firewalls that are not
352:22 - application aware there are also context
352:26 - aware firewalls these are firewalls that
352:29 - can identify not only applications but
352:31 - also users Andor devices this is the
352:35 - context of the traffic so context aware
352:39 - firewalls can be used to restrict or
352:41 - allow traffic based on the context as
352:44 - well as other ACL rules then there are
352:47 - unified threat management devices or UTM
352:51 - devices these are network appliances
352:54 - that include not only a firewall service
352:56 - but other services as as well usually
353:00 - intrusion detection services or
353:02 - intrusion Prevention Services one
353:05 - concern with a UTM device is that it can
353:08 - create a single point of failure in the
353:10 - network what happens to the network if
353:13 - that UTM device fails is your security
353:16 - gone or does the network go down that is
353:19 - a concern about using a
353:22 - UTM most often firewalls are implemented
353:25 - on a router's interface or at the host
353:28 - level when implemented on the router
353:30 - interface the firewall takes part in the
353:33 - routing process when implemented at the
353:36 - host level the firewall protects the
353:38 - host on which it resides there is an
353:41 - exception to these scenarios and it's
353:44 - the implementation of a virtual wire
353:47 - firewall this type of firewall is a
353:49 - network-based firewall that resides
353:52 - between two devices and provides neither
353:55 - routing nor switching functions if it
353:58 - contains two interfaces and as traffic
354:00 - passes between those interfaces the
354:03 - packets are compared to an ACL but it's
354:06 - usually not used to protect a specific
354:09 - host and it does not take part in the
354:11 - routing function it's time to proceed
354:14 - with firewall settings and
354:17 - techniques first up is the ACL each
354:20 - firewall interface may have two ACLS
354:24 - associated with it an inbound ACL and an
354:27 - out outbound ACL the inbound ACL
354:31 - examines all packets inbound on that
354:34 - interface an outbound ACL examines all
354:37 - packets outbound on that interface the
354:40 - ACL contains a set of administrator
354:43 - defined rules that either allow or deny
354:47 - packet traffic rules can be based on
354:50 - such criteria as Source or destination
354:53 - IP address Mac address protocol and time
354:57 - of day when an ACL examined packets
355:01 - those packets are examined against the
355:03 - set of rules from top to bottom once a
355:07 - rule is matched as in deny FTP packets
355:11 - from leaving the network that rule is
355:13 - enforced and the ACL is exited the last
355:16 - rule of any ACL is an implicit deny that
355:21 - means if the packet being evaluated does
355:24 - not match any of the explicit rules of
355:26 - the ACL the implicit deny is enacted and
355:30 - the packet is blocked care and caution
355:33 - should be used whenever creating an ACL
355:37 - if nothing else because that implicit
355:39 - deny statement ends every ACL list you
355:43 - may end up blocking traffic that you did
355:46 - not intend to block it's time to discuss
355:49 - firewall placement and we're going to
355:52 - begin with perimeter placement this
355:54 - requires that the firewall be placed at
355:56 - the outside edge Edge usually at the
355:59 - wide area network connection of the
356:02 - local segment or the land segment
356:05 - stateful inspection firewalls work well
356:08 - on the perimeter they are usually slower
356:10 - to make the initial connection but once
356:13 - that connection is achieved they offer
356:16 - better performance you could have
356:18 - internal placement of your firewall this
356:21 - requires that the firewall be placed in
356:23 - a logical central location it's usually
356:27 - used to route between different internal
356:30 - private networks stateless inspection
356:33 - firewalls work well for internal
356:35 - placement they are faster to make
356:37 - connections and require less memory a
356:41 - DMZ or demilitarize Zone requires a
356:45 - special configuration or placement
356:47 - considerations for your firewalls the
356:50 - DMZ is a specific area that is created
356:54 - usually between two firewalls that
356:56 - allows outside access to network
356:59 - resources while the internal network is
357:02 - still protected from outside traffic you
357:04 - should consider using a DMZ if you're
357:07 - going to have a web server on your
357:09 - network outside users will need to
357:12 - access your web server which is on your
357:15 - network but your internal network still
357:17 - needs to be protected from malicious
357:19 - traffic the external facing router
357:22 - allows specific outside traffic into the
357:26 - DMZ while the internal router prevents
357:29 - that same outside traffic from entering
357:32 - the internal Network that concludes this
357:35 - session on firewall Basics I talked
357:38 - about types of firewalls and then we
357:41 - ended with firewall settings and
357:43 - techniques on behalf of pace it thank
357:46 - you for watching this session and I hope
357:48 - to do another one
357:56 - soon
357:58 - good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to
358:02 - Pit's session on network access control
358:06 - today we're going to be talking about
358:07 - Edge versus access control and then
358:10 - we're going to talk about some Access
358:12 - Control concepts with that let's go
358:15 - ahead and begin this session of course
358:18 - I'm going to begin by talking about Edge
358:21 - versus Access Control when access to
358:24 - network resources is granted or denied
358:27 - by a firewall it is considered to be at
358:30 - the edge of the network so that is edge
358:33 - control while this may work well in
358:36 - smaller and simpler networks it can
358:39 - become very complicated and cumbersome
358:42 - as the network grows through
358:44 - implementing other Access Control
358:46 - measures these complications can be
358:49 - reduced while at the same time the
358:51 - security of the network may be increased
358:54 - this idea is called network access
358:57 - control control or Knack these Access
359:00 - Control measures do not replace the need
359:02 - for firewalls they do however allow the
359:05 - firewalls to concentrate on controlling
359:09 - Network traffic into and out of the
359:11 - network that is what they do best and
359:14 - that is what they should be concerned
359:15 - about not who or what type of device can
359:19 - connect to the network firewalls are not
359:22 - very efficient at that aspect of edge
359:25 - Access Control let's move on to some
359:29 - Access Control Concepts first up is
359:33 - authentication via
359:36 - 802.1x
359:38 - 802.1x is a popular method of
359:41 - authenticating client devices and users
359:44 - on either Ethernet or wireless networks
359:48 - when a client device which is called the
359:51 - supplicant attempts to join a network an
359:54 - authenticator which is usually a switch
359:57 - or wireless access point requests the
360:01 - supplicant credentials the authenticator
360:04 - then forwards the client's credentials
360:07 - to an authentication server or as which
360:11 - is typically running software such as
360:13 - remote authentication dial in user
360:16 - service or radius the authentication
360:19 - server evaluates the credentials and
360:22 - either informs the authenticator to
360:24 - allow or deny the supplicant device
360:27 - access to the protected network if the
360:31 - credentials are validated the
360:33 - authenticator that remember that's that
360:35 - switch or wireless access point grants
360:38 - the supplicant access to the protected
360:41 - network
360:43 - 802.1x is very popular in Enterprise
360:46 - type
360:47 - networks Access Control can also be
360:50 - achieved through posture assessment this
360:53 - is the process of evaluating more than
360:56 - just the client's credentials commonly
360:59 - posture assessment is used to evaluate
361:01 - the type of device that is requesting a
361:04 - connection is it a tablet or is it a PC
361:07 - or is it a mobile phone so on and so
361:10 - forth posture assessment can be used to
361:13 - evaluate the type of anti-malware
361:15 - software that's on the device and how
361:18 - updated that software is during this
361:21 - process a check is also performed to
361:23 - determine if malware is present on the
361:26 - device posture assessment is commonly
361:29 - used to evaluate the operating system as
361:31 - well as in how updated that operating
361:34 - system is and what the registry settings
361:38 - are at the time that access is being
361:40 - requested if the client passes the
361:43 - assessment it is allowed onto the
361:46 - protected network if the client does not
361:48 - pass the assessment usually one of two
361:51 - actions are taken the first action could
361:55 - be that the client is notified of the
361:57 - rejection and what has to occur before
362:00 - it can pass the posture assessment does
362:03 - it need an operating system update does
362:05 - it need antimalware installed so on and
362:08 - so forth the other action that is
362:10 - commonly taken when a device has failed
362:12 - the posture assessment is that it is
362:15 - passed on to a remediation server which
362:18 - will then attempt to resolve the cause
362:21 - of the failed posture assessment it will
362:24 - do this with no user interaction
362:27 - required once it has remediated the
362:30 - device and it can pass the assessment it
362:32 - then goes through the process again and
362:35 - is allowed onto the network if it passes
362:38 - it's time to move on to the posture
362:41 - assessment process one of two types of
362:44 - Agents think software code is used on
362:48 - client devices during the assessment
362:51 - process it could be a persistent agent
362:54 - which is permanently loaded on the
362:56 - device and starts when the operating
362:59 - system loads this type of agent can
363:02 - provide more functionality than the
363:04 - other version a persistent agent is more
363:07 - likely to be used if that device
363:10 - regularly connects to the network the
363:12 - other type of agent is a non-persistent
363:15 - agent when the client device attempts to
363:18 - access the network the agent is loaded
363:21 - onto the device to help in the
363:23 - assessment process once the assessment
363:26 - process is complet completed pass or
363:28 - fail the agent is removed from the
363:31 - device a non-persistent agent would work
363:34 - best for a guest device when devices
363:38 - attempt to connect to the protected
363:40 - Network they are placed on a guest
363:43 - network with very limited access they
363:46 - are left on the guest Network until the
363:49 - assessment process is completed in some
363:52 - cases particularly when the client fails
363:55 - the anti-malware check the client device
363:58 - may be placed into a quarantine Network
364:02 - which will only have access to a
364:04 - remediation server and it cannot move
364:07 - beyond that quarantine Network until it
364:10 - can successfully pass the posture
364:13 - assessment now that concludes this
364:15 - session on network access control I
364:18 - talked about Edge versus access control
364:21 - and then we concluded with some Access
364:24 - Control Concepts on behalf of pit
364:27 - thank you for watching this session and
364:30 - I trust you'll watch another one
364:37 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
364:41 - welcome to Pace it session on basic
364:44 - forensic Concepts today I'm going to be
364:47 - discussing collecting the evidence and
364:50 - then we're going to have a discussion on
364:52 - what to do after the evidence has been
364:54 - collected I have a fair amount of ground
364:56 - to ever so let's go ahead and begin this
365:00 - session we will begin this session by
365:02 - talking about actually collecting the
365:06 - evidence the first step in basic
365:08 - forensics is the recognition that
365:11 - forensic measures need to take place as
365:14 - in that a security incident has occurred
365:18 - most of us at least hopefully will not
365:20 - need to deal with a murder mystery at
365:23 - least not in the workplace with that
365:25 - said it's almost certain that we will
365:27 - have to deal with some type of security
365:30 - or legal issue when supporting an
365:33 - organization's Network the response to
365:35 - security and legal issues needs to be
365:38 - done in a manner such that evidence is
365:40 - recorded and preserved the first step is
365:43 - recognizing that something has occurred
365:47 - which needs to be documented and that
365:49 - the evidence needs to be collected and
365:52 - preserved that's the first step in
365:54 - forensics at least as far as forensics
365:57 - pertains to network
366:00 - Administration Network administrators
366:02 - and technicians are quite often the
366:05 - First Responders to a security breach on
366:09 - it systems as such they have some
366:13 - responsibilities first off they need to
366:15 - secure the area and limit who has access
366:18 - as much as possible also do not power
366:21 - down computer systems the restricting of
366:24 - access and not powering down the system
366:27 - systems is done to protect possible
366:29 - evidence from being contaminated
366:32 - document everyone who has accessed the
366:35 - area after it has been secured this
366:37 - protects your chain of custody if
366:40 - necessary to stop an ongoing computer
366:42 - attack it is permissible to unplug the
366:45 - network cable from the computer but
366:48 - that's it once the area is secure if
366:51 - necessary now is the time to escalate
366:54 - the response depending upon the
366:56 - situation you may need to bring in
366:58 - Specialists or even the police no matter
367:01 - what it's important that the scene get
367:03 - documented thoroughly including what is
367:06 - on any computer monitors taking
367:08 - photographs is a great way to document
367:11 - the scene if photographs are taken they
367:14 - should be done with a polaroid type
367:16 - camera in film not with digital pictures
367:19 - it's harder to manipulate a Polaroid and
367:22 - therefore it's more believable than a
367:24 - digital image it may also be necessary
367:27 - to diagram to draw out the area also
367:30 - interview any witnesses as soon as
367:33 - possible before their memory starts to
367:36 - degrade or before they begin to
367:38 - collaborate on what story to tell also
367:41 - the electronic evidence collection
367:43 - process needs to begin as soon as
367:46 - possible and it needs to be collected by
367:48 - order of
367:50 - volatility so let's talk about the
367:53 - evidence and data collection process
367:55 - electronic evidence is volatile and
367:58 - easily corruptible just because of what
368:00 - it is it's magnetic data so the order of
368:03 - collection is important the first thing
368:06 - that should be collected are the
368:07 - contents of memory or Ram this is the
368:11 - most volatile of all types of data next
368:14 - are swap files they're not as volatile
368:17 - as random access memory but are still
368:19 - very temporary in nature then all
368:22 - Network processes need to be documented
368:25 - at least all of those that are active on
368:27 - the affected system or systems after
368:30 - documenting Network processes next up
368:33 - are the system processes and that is all
368:36 - system processes that are active on the
368:38 - affected system after that move on to
368:41 - file system information including the
368:44 - attributes of the files you need to do
368:46 - this before you do anything else so that
368:49 - you have completely documented the
368:51 - attributes of the files once all of that
368:53 - is done it's time to make a copy of all
368:56 - of the contents on all of the disk
368:58 - drives of the affected systems and that
369:01 - would be by raw disk blocks so let's
369:04 - talk about that a little bit more after
369:07 - isolating the affected system or systems
369:10 - from the network you need to create a
369:12 - bit level image of the system or systems
369:15 - that means an exact duplicate of the
369:18 - disk drives and actually you need to
369:20 - create two copies two images and with
369:24 - those two images you also need to create
369:26 - a message Mage digest of the image
369:29 - drives to be able to later prove that
369:31 - they have not been tampered with you can
369:33 - use md5 or sha as the hash algorithm to
369:38 - make that message digest one image
369:41 - should be securely stored to be used as
369:44 - evidence and with that should go the
369:46 - hashed image that way you can prove in
369:49 - court that it hasn't been tampered with
369:52 - the other image can be examined and
369:54 - modified in order to determine what
369:56 - exactly happened now let's move on to a
369:59 - discussion about what happens after the
370:02 - evidence has been collected and the
370:04 - first item is the chain of custody now
370:07 - this actually starts during the
370:08 - collection period and survives The
370:11 - Collection period on into the future the
370:14 - chain of custody is a document that
370:16 - identifies who collected the evidence
370:19 - when it was collected and who has had
370:21 - access to it since it has been collected
370:25 - proper chain of custody doc document can
370:27 - prove that the evidence has been
370:29 - accurately preserved and the chain of
370:31 - custody document can also be considered
370:34 - part of the evidence a chain of custody
370:36 - document will help to ensure that all
370:39 - the evidence that is collected is
370:41 - admissible in court a broken chain of
370:44 - custody will negate the collected
370:46 - evidence and by that if your chain of
370:49 - custody gets broken your evidence is no
370:52 - longer considered evidence so now let's
370:55 - talk about the Eis y process or the
370:58 - electronic Discovery process in legal
371:01 - situations the discovery process
371:03 - involves the exchange of evidence
371:06 - between both sides of a litigation or
371:09 - prosecution situation eisc Discovery
371:12 - refers to the Discovery process as it
371:15 - pertains to electronic data as in email
371:19 - database files or chat records any data
371:22 - that's kept in electronic format once
371:25 - identified in the Eis Discovery process
371:27 - a legal hold is placed on the data that
371:31 - has been identified a legal hold occurs
371:34 - when data has been deemed to be possibly
371:37 - relevant in either a prosecution or
371:40 - litigation situation if a legal hold
371:43 - occurs all normal processing of that
371:46 - data needs to cease that data needs to
371:49 - remain in the state that it was in
371:52 - during the ecovery process so a legal
371:55 - hold requires that back tapes not be
371:57 - recycled and that the normal archival
372:00 - process for that data be suspended until
372:03 - the legal hold is removed there are some
372:06 - items to consider when electronic data
372:09 - needs to be transported and it's
372:12 - considered evidence if it's physical
372:14 - evidence as in a hard drive a chain of
372:17 - custody document must be created for the
372:20 - transportation process and it needs to
372:23 - include an exact description of the
372:25 - evidence the means of Transport who
372:29 - received the evidence to transport it
372:31 - and who had access to the evidence
372:34 - during the transport process if you're
372:37 - using electronic means of transport a
372:40 - message digest should also be included
372:43 - to prove that the exact evidence sent is
372:46 - the evidence that is received once the
372:50 - forensic process has concluded or once
372:53 - the investigation has been completed a
372:55 - forensic report needs to be created
372:58 - based on the findings of the
373:00 - investigation during the evidence
373:02 - collection and investigation process the
373:05 - characteristics of the evidence should
373:07 - have been documented so you know what
373:10 - timestamps were present or any
373:12 - identifying properties that are
373:14 - associated with that evidence all of
373:17 - this information needs to be recorded
373:19 - and analyzed using scientific methods
373:22 - once completed the forensic report
373:24 - should be able to completely reconstruct
373:27 - and document the evidence a forensic
373:30 - report may be used in the litigation or
373:33 - prosecution process in addition a good
373:36 - forensic report may help in the creation
373:39 - of a better response plan for use in the
373:43 - future now that concludes this session
373:46 - on basic forensic Concepts I talked
373:49 - about collecting the evidence and then
373:51 - we concluded about what happens after
373:54 - the evidence has been collected
373:56 - on behalf of pace it thank you for
373:59 - watching this session and I hope to do
374:01 - another one
374:08 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
374:11 - welcome to Pit's session on network
374:14 - troubleshooting methodology today I'm
374:17 - going to be talking about the importance
374:19 - of a methodology and then I'm going to
374:21 - cover the seven step troubleshooting
374:24 - methodology recommended by by comp Tia
374:27 - there's a fair amount of ground to cover
374:29 - not a whole lot of time so let's go
374:31 - ahead and begin this session we are
374:34 - going to begin by discussing the
374:36 - importance of a methodology first up is
374:40 - one of my favorite quotes concerning
374:43 - methodologies and it is my methodology
374:46 - is not knowing what I'm doing and making
374:48 - that work for me that's from Stone
374:50 - Gossard of Pearl Jam and
374:53 - unfortunately we don't quite have that
374:56 - kind of Liberty when it comes to
374:58 - troubleshooting networks all networks
375:01 - will require troubleshooting if you
375:03 - don't know where to start or haven't
375:05 - developed a methodology you will waste
375:08 - time and resources the complexity of
375:11 - modern networks means that there is a
375:14 - lot that can go wrong without a
375:16 - troubleshooting methodology your
375:18 - frustration levels and the frustration
375:21 - levels of those you support is going to
375:24 - rise a systematic trouble shooting
375:26 - methodology can significantly reduce the
375:29 - time required to resolve a problem and
375:32 - close a network trouble ticket saving
375:35 - both time and other
375:37 - resources it's time to move on to comp
375:40 - Tia's seven-step troubleshooting
375:44 - methodology of course we're going to
375:45 - begin with step one which is identify
375:48 - the problem gather information what is
375:51 - actually occurring or not occurring is
375:54 - the problem extremely local as in
375:57 - relegated to your network or is the
375:59 - problem occurring in an area that is out
376:02 - of your control identify the systems
376:05 - remember the symptoms are not the
376:07 - problem they just point toward the
376:09 - underlying issue most often when the
376:12 - trouble ticket comes in it will have
376:14 - some of the symptoms but it will not
376:16 - have identified the actual problem
376:19 - approach multiple problems individually
376:22 - handle them one at a time question the
376:25 - users
376:26 - this needs to be done both politely and
376:28 - firmly many problems that are reported
376:31 - within a network are the result of the
376:33 - enduser needing to be educated or
376:36 - re-educated in proper procedures at the
376:39 - same time you also need to remember that
376:43 - most end users don't have your level of
376:45 - technical of technical knowledge so be
376:49 - patient but don't patronize and finally
376:52 - when identifying the problem determine
376:54 - if anything has changed
376:56 - this also requires a systematic approach
377:00 - so be very thorough step two is to
377:03 - establish a theory of probable cause
377:07 - make a list of all of the possible
377:09 - causes of the problem to develop this
377:12 - list of possible causes you should
377:14 - consider multiple approaches to the
377:17 - problem from bottom to top and then from
377:19 - top to bottom of the OSI model that is a
377:22 - great way to approach the problem from
377:25 - multiple Direction directions divide
377:27 - your list of possible causes into three
377:30 - ranked sections they should be not
377:33 - likely likely and most likely this will
377:37 - provide a great place to start when
377:40 - establishing your theory of probable
377:42 - cause remember to question the obvious
377:46 - if the network printer doesn't work
377:48 - check to be sure that it is turned on
377:50 - the third step is to test the theory of
377:53 - probable cause if the theory is
377:56 - confirmed move on to the next step if
377:59 - the theory is proven to be incorrect
378:01 - then reestablish a new theory of
378:04 - probable cause if you run out of
378:07 - probable causes or the situation worsens
378:10 - it may be time to escalate the issue up
378:13 - the troubleshooting chain once you've
378:15 - confirmed your theory of probable cause
378:18 - it's on to step four establish a plan of
378:21 - action and identify potential effects
378:25 - simple problem s may require a simple
378:27 - plan as in if the network printer
378:29 - doesn't work and the probable cause is
378:32 - that it's not turned on turn on the
378:34 - network printer more complex problems
378:37 - will require more complex plans in some
378:40 - cases it is a good idea to write the
378:42 - plan out step by step in order to
378:45 - determine the best course of action and
378:48 - to identify any possible repercussions
378:51 - that the resolution to the problem May
378:54 - introduce into the network
378:56 - step five is to implement the plan or to
378:59 - escalate the problem if you have the
379:01 - authority put your plan in action if you
379:05 - don't have the authority escalate the
379:07 - problem up the troubleshooting chain
379:09 - including all facts and determinations
379:12 - when you're escalating the problem don't
379:15 - make that next level above you have to
379:17 - recreate everything that you've done
379:20 - once you've implemented your plan it's
379:22 - on to step six verify full system
379:26 - functionality don't just verify that the
379:29 - original problem has gone away because
379:32 - sometimes a fix will introduce a new
379:34 - issue into the system if a new issue has
379:38 - occurred it's time to go back to Step
379:40 - One or to escalate the problem if you
379:43 - have verified full system functionality
379:45 - this is where you implement preventative
379:48 - measures to keep this problem from
379:51 - reoccurring and finally step seven
379:54 - document findings Act and outcomes
379:57 - document everything this will save time
380:00 - if and when the problem reoccurs your
380:03 - documentation may lead to new best
380:06 - practices for your organization it's
380:09 - important to document your missteps as
380:11 - well it will keep the next technician
380:14 - from making those same missteps that you
380:17 - have made and this will help to improve
380:20 - your chances of becoming the network
380:23 - support technician Rockstar in in your
380:27 - organization that concludes this session
380:29 - on network troubleshooting methodology I
380:32 - talked about the importance of a
380:34 - methodology and then I covered comp
380:37 - Tia's seven-step troubleshooting
380:39 - methodology on behalf of pace it thank
380:42 - you for watching this session and I hope
380:44 - to do another one
380:49 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
380:53 - to Pit's session on TR shooting
380:56 - connectivity with utilities today I'm
380:59 - going to talk about connectivity
381:01 - utilities defined then I'm going to move
381:03 - on to connectivity utilities explained
381:06 - and we will conclude with some
381:08 - additional software for troubleshooting
381:11 - connectivity there's a fair amount of
381:13 - ground to cover let's go ahead and begin
381:16 - this session of course I'm going to
381:18 - begin with connectivity utilities
381:22 - defined before we can Define the
381:24 - utilities we need to Define Define
381:26 - connectivity connectivity is a program
381:28 - or devic's ability to connect or link to
381:32 - other programs or devices a connectivity
381:36 - utility is a utility or application that
381:39 - is used to establish connectivity and or
381:42 - to diagnose or fix a connectivity issue
381:46 - with that out of the way let's move on
381:48 - to connectivity utilities
381:51 - explained all modern operating systems
381:54 - come with prepackaged connectivity
381:56 - utilities designed to diagnose and or to
381:59 - repair connectivity issues in some cases
382:03 - you can use these utilities or programs
382:06 - from a graphical user interface or guei
382:09 - however in all cases you can use the
382:12 - following applications from the command
382:15 - prompt first up is Ping it is a simple
382:19 - utility that is used to determine if
382:22 - there's connectivity between two nodes
382:24 - or two endpoints it uses icmp Echo
382:29 - requests there are two basic formats to
382:32 - the Ping utility you can ping an IP
382:35 - address or you can ping the host name or
382:39 - the fully qualified domain name you can
382:42 - use ping 6 or ping minus 6 and you will
382:46 - ping only IPv6 hosts then there is
382:50 - Tracer or trace route it is a utility
382:54 - that is used to determine the path used
382:57 - between two nodes Tracer TR R A CER T is
383:02 - the windows version and trace route t r
383:05 - a c r o u t is the Linux Unix or OSX
383:10 - version of the command it also uses icmp
383:15 - Echo requests but it uses it with an
383:18 - incrementing time to live field to form
383:21 - queries and get responses each time the
383:24 - icmp echo request is sent out the TTL
383:28 - field is incremented by one and Tracer
383:31 - is used to determine how many routers
383:33 - are between two points it can be of
383:36 - limited value though as many routers
383:38 - have icmp disabled it uses the same
383:42 - basic format as ping then there is
383:46 - pathping it is a network connectivity
383:49 - utility that has been supplied in
383:51 - Microsoft operating systems since the
383:53 - introduction of NT
383:55 - path ping built upon the functionality
383:58 - of ping by combining it with Tracer when
384:02 - the application is used it will in
384:04 - effect perform a tracer command defining
384:07 - the path to the end node and then it
384:09 - will perform a ping test on each hop one
384:13 - disadvantage to path ping is that it
384:15 - requires 25 seconds per hop to show the
384:19 - Ping results and it uses the same
384:22 - command format as ping and Trace
384:26 - one of my favorite utilities is IP
384:29 - config or if config IP config is the
384:33 - windows version and if config is the
384:36 - Linux Unix OSX version it's used to
384:40 - determine the IP configuration of a
384:43 - given node it can also be used to change
384:46 - that IP configuration if used correctly
384:50 - when using to diagnose connectivity look
384:53 - for incorrect IP address es incorrect
384:56 - subnet masks incorrect DNS addresses and
385:00 - or an incorrect default gateway then
385:03 - there's ARP which stands for address
385:05 - resolution protocol ARP is used to
385:08 - correlate IP addresses to MAC address
385:12 - this utility can help to determine when
385:14 - there is an issue with an address
385:16 - resolution protocol table on a given
385:19 - node then we have NS lookup that stands
385:23 - for name server lookup it's supported by
385:26 - all major operating systems and it's
385:28 - used to diagnose domain naming system
385:31 - issues or DNS issues it can be very
385:34 - helpful in determining if a DNS server
385:37 - is having a problem dig is similar to NS
385:40 - lookup but it is specific to Unix Linux
385:44 - and OSX it does use different switch
385:47 - modifiers and returns slightly different
385:50 - results there is the route utility this
385:53 - is a Windows specific spefic command
385:57 - it's used to view and modify the routing
385:59 - tables on a Windows operating system
386:02 - node next up is NBT stat which stands
386:06 - for net bios over TCP statistics Windows
386:11 - implements the NBT protocol for
386:13 - backwards compatibility as a result the
386:16 - NBT stat utility is used if a net bios
386:20 - issue is suspected then there's net stat
386:23 - which stands for Network to statistics
386:26 - it's a utility that is used to display
386:28 - protocol statistics and current TCP IP
386:32 - network connections it's useful for
386:34 - determining if a connection has been
386:36 - made and the status of that connection
386:39 - it's time to move on to some additional
386:43 - software first up our throughput testers
386:47 - they're used to determine the data flow
386:49 - or bandwidth of a network they can be
386:51 - used internally to test the flow or
386:54 - bandwidth within a local area network or
386:57 - they can be used externally to test the
387:00 - flow of a Wan connection they are often
387:03 - used to create a baseline of network
387:06 - performance and last up we have protocol
387:08 - analyzers these are often called packet
387:11 - sniffers they examine Network behavior
387:14 - on a very basic level at the packet
387:17 - level they can examine all the packets
387:19 - coming into and out of an interface
387:22 - protocol analyzers are useful to see
387:26 - what is consuming network resources as
387:29 - in they can tell if a broadcast storm is
387:31 - occurring or if an interface is going
387:34 - bad wi shark is a common protocol
387:37 - analyzer that is often used and it's
387:40 - free that concludes this session on
387:43 - troubleshooting connectivities with
387:45 - utilities the first topic was
387:48 - connectivity utilities defined then we
387:50 - moved on to connectivity utilities
387:53 - explained and we concluded Ed with a
387:55 - brief discussion on some additional
387:58 - software on behalf of pace it thank you
388:01 - for watching this session and I hope you
388:03 - watch another one
388:06 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
388:09 - to pait's session on troubleshooting
388:12 - connectivity with Hardware today I'm
388:15 - going to discuss what makes a cable bad
388:19 - uh cable testing tools and I'm going to
388:21 - conclude with some additional tools I
388:24 - have a fair amount of ground to cover so
388:26 - let's go ahead and begin this session we
388:29 - will begin with what makes a cable bad
388:34 - network cables can go bad or be bad
388:37 - without any visible indication
388:39 - alternatively a cable may be
388:42 - inappropriate for a particular
388:44 - application it can be difficult to
388:47 - visually tell if cables are wired
388:49 - correctly and or a break in The Wire may
388:51 - not be visible both of these will cause
388:54 - problem problems additionally anything
388:57 - that makes the cable fall out of
388:59 - specification will make it a bad cable
389:02 - how long is the cable is it over the
389:05 - maximum length is the cable rated for
389:07 - the amount of data being run over the
389:09 - wire all of these are questions that can
389:12 - be answered using the proper tools it's
389:16 - time to discuss cable testing tools
389:20 - first up is the multimeter it can be
389:22 - used to test for brakes and copper
389:25 - wiring good network cables have a very
389:28 - low resistance value from one end of the
389:31 - cable to the other by the way your
389:33 - resistance is measured in ohms a high or
389:37 - infinite ohms value indicates a break in
389:40 - the cable so you can use multimeters to
389:44 - test for continuity to make sure that
389:47 - traffic can flow from one end to the
389:49 - other crimpers are not a testing tool
389:52 - per se but they are used for attaching
389:55 - cable ends onto cables which if you
389:58 - suspect you have a bad cable in or a
390:00 - miswired connector you're going to need
390:03 - a set of crimpers it can either be
390:05 - specific to a particular type of cable
390:07 - end or it may work for more than one
390:11 - type of cable and by the way it's not
390:13 - uncommon to need to replace the ends of
390:16 - twisted pair wiring cables every network
390:20 - technician should have a cable tester or
390:23 - cable certifier these can be either
390:26 - fairly simple or very complex cable
390:29 - testers will test for continuity in the
390:32 - wire as in is there a break cable
390:35 - testers will also test for proper
390:37 - pinouts are all the wires in the right
390:40 - places some will test for the wiring
390:43 - standard is it wired for the
390:45 - t568a standard or the
390:48 - t568b standard or have you created a
390:51 - crossover cable cable certifiers are a
390:54 - little bit more complex but they will
390:57 - also test for more Network related items
391:00 - they can test the speed of the wire they
391:03 - can test for duplex settings between two
391:05 - endpoints cable certifiers are used to
391:09 - certify a given Network segment toner
391:12 - probes are another handy tool they're
391:15 - usually a two-piece set they have an
391:18 - injector which places a signal onto the
391:21 - wire in a probe which detects the signal
391:23 - and emits a tone when it detects that
391:26 - signal these are also sometimes called a
391:30 - Fox and Hound they're used to find and
391:33 - Trace wires they're useful when having
391:35 - to replace a single wire in a bundle of
391:38 - wires you can place the injector on one
391:41 - end to figure out which wire it is at
391:44 - the other end then there is the time
391:47 - domain reflectometer this is a cable
391:50 - tester or certifier that can also
391:52 - determine the length of a M they can
391:55 - also tell where a break is in a segment
391:59 - which can then allow you to put in a
392:01 - splice they are more expensive than a
392:04 - standard cable tester or certifier
392:07 - related to the TDR is the optical time
392:10 - domain reflectometer are the otdr they
392:14 - perform the same function as a TDR but
392:16 - it is used for fiber optic cabling it is
392:20 - often called a light meter as it can
392:22 - measure the quantity and quality of the
392:25 - light going through a fiber optic cable
392:28 - some other thoughts on cable testing
392:30 - tools unless your job entails mostly
392:34 - installing cabling the most important
392:36 - tools are the cable tester crimper and
392:40 - toner probes personally I have never
392:42 - been able to justify the cost of a TDR I
392:46 - have used them but I've rented them
392:49 - instead of purchased them most of the
392:51 - time you can make do with inexpensive
392:53 - tools however spending more on certain
392:56 - tools will usually save time and money
392:59 - in the long run an exception to the
393:01 - inexpensive tool rule are toner probes
393:05 - inexpensive toner probes can be
393:08 - difficult to work with or they just
393:10 - don't work at all I would recommend
393:12 - stepping up and spending a little bit
393:14 - more for your toner probe try to strike
393:18 - a balance between cost and Effectiveness
393:21 - you can spend thousands of dollars on
393:23 - some of these tools especially tdrs and
393:26 - otdrs and never utilize them to their
393:29 - fullest potential the next topic is
393:32 - additional tools and we will begin with
393:36 - the wireless analyzer it is a similar
393:39 - tool to the protocol analyzer but it is
393:42 - used for wireless networks it sniffs out
393:45 - packets on wireless networks this
393:47 - information can be used to help solve
393:50 - Wireless connectivity issues a wireless
393:53 - analyzer can also perform other
393:55 - functions it can check for bandwidth
393:58 - usage Channel usage top talkers and top
394:02 - listeners it can identify networks by
394:05 - passively scanning the radio frequency
394:08 - channels it can identify hidden networks
394:10 - if given enough time and a wireless
394:13 - analyzer can also infer non beaconing
394:16 - networks Based on data traffic so it can
394:19 - help you to find those Rogue access
394:22 - points then there are looking glass
394:25 - sites or LG sites these are publicly
394:28 - available sites that can be used to view
394:30 - routing information remotely as viewed
394:34 - from the LG serers point of view they
394:37 - create a readonly portal on which
394:39 - routing statistics can be generated and
394:42 - viewed LG sites can be helpful in
394:45 - determining if the connectivity issue is
394:48 - occurring because of problems on the
394:50 - local network or if the remote
394:52 - connection is the issue
394:55 - that concludes this session on
394:57 - troubleshooting connectivity with
394:59 - Hardware I talked about what makes a
395:02 - cable bad I talked about cable testing
395:05 - tools and I concluded with some
395:07 - additional tools on behalf of pace it
395:11 - thank you for watching this session and
395:13 - I hope to do another one
395:17 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
395:21 - welcome to pait's session on
395:23 - troubleshooting wire less networks part
395:25 - one today I'm going to be talking about
395:28 - configuration issues and then we will
395:30 - conclude with some other issues there's
395:32 - a fair amount of information to go over
395:35 - so let's go ahead and begin this session
395:39 - I will Begin by talking about some
395:41 - common configuration issues while
395:44 - wireless networks are a huge convenience
395:47 - to users they do introduce a new set of
395:50 - troubleshooting issues into the network
395:53 - not only do the stand standard issues
395:55 - that crop up in a wired Network need to
395:57 - be considered the added layer of
395:59 - complexity that adding a wireless access
396:02 - point brings to the table will also need
396:05 - to be considered when Wireless
396:07 - networking is brought into the mix a
396:09 - very solid troubleshooting methodology
396:12 - becomes just that much more critical now
396:16 - on to the actual configuration issues
396:19 - first up is the service set identifier
396:22 - configuration or the SS ID configuration
396:26 - when this is an issue the major symptom
396:28 - is that the user is unable to connect to
396:31 - the wireless network and the probable
396:33 - cause is an SSID mismatch the corrective
396:37 - measure is to check that the ssids match
396:41 - exactly remember they are case sensitive
396:45 - then there is encryption configurations
396:48 - it has the same symptom as the SSID
396:52 - misconfiguration the user is unable to
396:54 - connect to the wireless network probable
396:57 - cause is an encryption type mismatch or
397:00 - incorrect security key the possible
397:03 - corrective measure is to check the
397:05 - encryption settings on the wireless
397:07 - access point and on the device to make
397:10 - sure they are the same another
397:13 - configuration issue that can cause
397:15 - problems is an incorrect Channel or
397:18 - overlapping Wireless channels the
397:21 - symptom is that the user is unable to
397:24 - connect or the wireless network has very
397:27 - poor performance the probable cause is
397:30 - either incorrect channels or the
397:32 - overlapping channels is causing the
397:34 - signal to noise ratio to be reduced
397:37 - that's the SNR the possible corrective
397:40 - measure include adjusting the WAP
397:43 - settings and device settings so that
397:45 - they're using the same channel hence
397:47 - there are only three available
397:50 - nonoverlapping channels on the 2.4 GHz
397:54 - radio frequency then there are
397:57 - incompatibilities and the symptom is
398:00 - again the user is not able to connect to
398:02 - the wireless network the probable cause
398:05 - is you have an
398:07 - 802.11a device being used in an
398:10 - environment in which it won't work as in
398:13 - you're using
398:15 - 802.11g or n or there's a frequency
398:19 - mismatch between the wireless access
398:22 - point and the devices the the possible
398:24 - corrective measure is to make sure
398:26 - you're using equipment with compatible
398:29 - wireless standards untested updates can
398:32 - also cause a configuration issue the
398:35 - symptom again is the user is unable to
398:38 - connect or there is poor performance the
398:41 - probable cause is a conflict between the
398:43 - update and other configuration settings
398:46 - or the wireless network settings the
398:49 - possible corrective measure is to roll
398:51 - back the system to the prior conf
398:54 - configuration here's another Hint it is
398:56 - a best practice to make a backup copy of
398:59 - a system before installing any
399:03 - updates let's move on to other wireless
399:07 - issues troubleshooting networks requires
399:10 - a combination of Art and Science some of
399:12 - the best tools in Your Arsenal will be
399:15 - patience and strategic thinking network
399:19 - issues can express themselves in a
399:21 - multitude of ways one of the best things
399:23 - that you as a technician can do is to
399:27 - see if you can recreate the problem an
399:31 - issue that can be recreated can usually
399:34 - be resolved easily also remember that
399:37 - the users you are dealing with are the
399:40 - reason that you have a paycheck treat
399:43 - them as you would like to be treated
399:45 - even if it is the 10th time that you've
399:47 - reminded Bob that his username and
399:50 - password are case sensitive interference
399:54 - is a common issue on wireless networks
399:57 - the symptoms include slow performance
400:00 - Andor intermittent drops the probable
400:03 - causes can include overlapping channels
400:06 - walls or other equipment that operates
400:09 - in the same frequencies some possible
400:12 - corrective measures include changing the
400:14 - RF Channel or frequency or adjusting the
400:18 - wireless access point placement then
400:20 - there's poor signal strength the
400:23 - symptoms include slow performance and or
400:25 - intermittent drops especially towards
400:28 - the end of your wireless network
400:30 - coverage area probable causes include
400:33 - low RF power settings antenna type Andor
400:37 - the placement of the access point
400:40 - possible corrective measures include
400:42 - changing the RF power setting as in
400:44 - increasing it or adjusting the antenna
400:47 - and or WAP placement there is a caution
400:50 - here increasing your radio frequency
400:53 - power or adjusting the equipment
400:55 - placement may cause the signal to go
400:58 - where it was not intended to go so if
401:00 - you do either of those you need to check
401:02 - and make sure that you're not putting
401:05 - your signal where you don't want it to
401:07 - be bandwidth or device saturation can
401:10 - also become an issue the symptoms
401:13 - include slow performance Andor
401:15 - intermittent drops the probable cause is
401:19 - that there are too many users or
401:21 - applications for the available bandwidth
401:24 - possible corrective measures include
401:26 - increasing the number of wireless access
401:28 - points and or changing to a wireless
401:31 - standard with more throughput the wrong
401:34 - antenna type may also become an issue
401:37 - the symptoms include low or no signal in
401:40 - an area or signal in an area where it is
401:43 - not supposed to be the probable cause is
401:46 - the wrong antenna type for the coverage
401:49 - the corrective measure would be to
401:51 - change to an antenna type to suit the
401:54 - required coverage then there is signal
401:56 - bounce the symptom is poor performance
401:59 - in unexpected locations or an unexpected
402:03 - wireless network signal in an area that
402:06 - was not intended to be covered the
402:08 - probable cause is the RF signal bouncing
402:11 - off of a hard object the possible
402:14 - corrective measure would be to adjust
402:16 - the wireless access point placement that
402:19 - concludes this session on
402:21 - troubleshooting wireless networks part
402:24 - one I talked about configuration issues
402:27 - and then I moved on to some other
402:29 - wireless network issues on behalf of
402:32 - pace it thank you for watching this
402:34 - session and I hope you watch another one
402:43 - soon good day I'm Brian Ferell and
402:46 - welcome to Pace's session on
402:49 - troubleshooting wireless networks part
402:51 - two today I'm going to be discussing
402:54 - Wireless environmental factors and then
402:56 - we're going to conclude with wireless
402:59 - standard related factors there's a whole
403:01 - lot of ground to cover so let's go ahead
403:04 - and begin this session of course I'm
403:07 - going to begin by talking about Wireless
403:09 - environmental factors when planning and
403:13 - setting up a wireless network quite
403:15 - often environmental factors that may
403:17 - impact the wireless network are
403:20 - disregarded it is easy to get distracted
403:23 - by all the moving pieces of the wireless
403:26 - network as in the SSID configuration
403:29 - encryption and which standards to use
403:32 - dealing with these often leads to
403:34 - overlooking factors in the environment
403:37 - that may impact the quality of the
403:39 - planned Network to get the most out of a
403:42 - wireless network these factors need to
403:45 - be taken into consideration as they can
403:47 - have a major impact on the overall
403:50 - quality and performance of the in
403:53 - installed Network we don't think about
403:56 - it very often but building materials can
403:58 - influence wireless networks a wireless
404:02 - network works by sending and receiving
404:04 - radio frequency waves across a given
404:07 - area anything that can interrupt the
404:09 - signal or change the path of the waves
404:12 - can create a problem in the network this
404:15 - is called signal bounce the signal May
404:18 - return to the wireless access point out
404:20 - of phase leading to poor performance or
404:23 - dropped packets alternatively the signal
404:27 - may end up being bounced into areas
404:29 - where coverage was not planned leading
404:32 - to a security issue or an interference
404:35 - issue with other wireless networks some
404:38 - building materials of concern include
404:40 - concrete walls metal studs and Window
404:44 - Films particularly window tinting with
404:47 - the metallic content when evaluating
404:51 - environmental factors it is important to
404:53 - consider consider more than just the
404:54 - building materials all hard surfaces
404:57 - have the potential to create an out of
405:00 - phase or bounced signal including office
405:03 - furnishings and file cabinets using a
405:06 - wireless analyzer and wireless survey
405:08 - tools during the planning stage of a
405:11 - wireless network will lead to better
405:13 - placement of the wireless equipment
405:16 - which ultimately leads to a better
405:18 - performing Network let's move on to some
405:22 - wireless standard related factors first
405:25 - up is wireless standard
405:28 - compatibility not all of the
405:30 - 802.11 standards are compatible with
405:34 - each other this is partially due to the
405:36 - RF frequencies that are used and with
405:39 - the most common frequencies being the
405:41 - 2.4 GHz or the 5 GHz radio frequency
405:45 - band the problem with compatability can
405:48 - also be because of the type of
405:50 - modulation that is employed modulation
405:53 - is the encoding of information to be
405:56 - placed on a carrier wave and it's
405:58 - employed to put the signal on the
406:00 - network the most common forms of
406:03 - modulation are orthogonal frequency
406:06 - Division multiplexing ofdm and direct
406:10 - sequence spread Spectrum or
406:13 - dsss so let's look at a compatibility
406:17 - list for
406:18 - 802.11
406:20 - 802.11a is not compatible with most
406:22 - other standards
406:25 - 802.11b is compatible with
406:28 - 802.11g and N
406:31 - 802.11g is compatible with 11b and 11n
406:38 - 802.11n is compatible with
406:42 - 802.11b G and AC 802.11 AC is compatible
406:48 - with
406:50 - 802.11n so let's talk about the wireless
406:53 - standards
406:55 - 802.11b uses the 2.4 GHz RF band and
407:01 - dsss as its form of modulation it offers
407:05 - up to 11 megabits per second networking
407:08 - with a maximum indoor range of 115 ft
407:11 - and a Maximum Outdoor range of 460 ft
407:16 - 802.11a uses the 5 GHz RF band and ofdm
407:22 - as its method of of modulation 11a
407:25 - offers up to 54 megabits per second
407:29 - networking with a maximum indoor range
407:31 - of 115 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range of
407:35 - 390 ft then there's
407:39 - 802.11g it uses the 2.4 GHz RF band and
407:44 - it can use both ofdm and
407:48 - dsss as its methods of modulation 11g
407:52 - offers a to 54 megabits per second
407:55 - networking with a maximum indoor range
407:58 - of 125 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range of
408:01 - 460 ft then we have
408:05 - 802.11n it can use both the 2.4 and the
408:09 - 5 GHz radio frequency bands with ofdm as
408:13 - its method of modulation 802.11n can
408:17 - offer up to 600 megabits per second
408:20 - networking with a maximum indoor range
408:23 - of of 230 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range
408:26 - of 820 ft finally we have
408:31 - 802.11ac it uses the 5 GHz radio
408:34 - frequency band with ofdm as its method
408:38 - of modulation it's expected to offer up
408:41 - to 1 gbits per second networking with a
408:44 - maximum indoor range of 115 ft at this
408:48 - point in time we do not have a Maximum
408:51 - Outdoor range as there still working on
408:54 - establishing that that concludes this
408:57 - session on troubleshooting wireless
408:59 - networks part two we talked about some
409:01 - Wireless environmental factors and then
409:04 - we concluded with a brief discussion on
409:07 - wireless standard related factors on
409:10 - behalf of pait thank you for watching
409:13 - this session and I hope to do another
409:14 - one
409:19 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
409:22 - to to pait's session on troubleshooting
409:26 - fiber cable networks today we're going
409:28 - to be talking about using the specific
409:31 - tool for the job and then we will
409:33 - conclude with some common fiber cable
409:36 - problems there's a fair amount of ground
409:38 - to cover so let's go ahead and begin
409:40 - this session of course I'm going to
409:43 - begin by talking about using the
409:45 - specific tool for the job the nature of
409:48 - fiber optic networks makes
409:51 - troubleshooting them a little more
409:53 - expensive than other types of networks
409:55 - the reason for this is that the best and
409:58 - sometimes only tool that can be used for
410:01 - troubleshooting fiber optic cable
410:03 - problems is the optical time domain
410:07 - reflectometer or the
410:09 - otdr using the specific tool for the job
410:12 - at hand will ease the burden of
410:14 - diagnosing and resolving any network
410:16 - issues while an otdr costs thousands of
410:20 - dollars or in some cases tens of
410:23 - thousands of dollars in many cases it
410:26 - can quickly diagnose the problem a quick
410:29 - diagnosis can lead to a quick solution
410:33 - often saving significantly more than the
410:35 - cost of the tool by preventing lost
410:38 - productivity Andor Revenue that is why
410:42 - we spend money on
410:44 - otdrs so let's talk about some common
410:47 - fiber cable problems we're going to
410:51 - begin by talking about attenuation or
410:53 - deciel loss all Network Transmissions
410:56 - degrade over distance this is called
410:59 - attenuation or deciel loss this loss of
411:03 - signal strength can lead to slower
411:05 - speeds loss or Corruption of network
411:07 - traffic or the loss of the network
411:09 - communication link the otdr can not only
411:13 - diagnose attenuation but it can also
411:16 - help in the placement of a repeater
411:18 - station then there's broken Fiber Optic
411:21 - Cables as with all types of cable media
411:24 - fiber optic cables are subject to
411:27 - breakage as a matter of fact in some
411:29 - cases they are more delicate than other
411:31 - types of media certain types of fiber
411:34 - cable can span many kilometers making it
411:37 - difficult to determine where a break has
411:39 - occurred the otdr can be used to
411:42 - determine where a break in the fiber
411:44 - optic cable has occurred allowing the
411:46 - technician to insert a splice at that
411:49 - point a common cause of brakes and fiber
411:52 - optic CA is exceeding the bend radius
411:54 - limitations of the cable due to the
411:57 - construction of fiber optic cables it is
412:00 - subject to breakage if it is bent Beyond
412:02 - a certain point it is possible for small
412:05 - form factor plugable transceivers or for
412:09 - gigabit interface converter transceivers
412:11 - to go bad the SPF and gck transceivers
412:15 - are hot swappable replaceable modules
412:18 - that are used to add gigabit
412:20 - capabilities to switches routers and
412:23 - other networking equipment a bad
412:26 - transceiver will prevent communication
412:28 - from occurring and otdr can be used to
412:32 - help diagnose a bad SPF or gbck module
412:36 - it is possible to have a fiber type
412:39 - mismatch single mode fiber and multi
412:42 - mode fiber use different methods for
412:45 - placing the signal on the optic fiber if
412:48 - a mismatch occurs the most common
412:50 - problem is that it will be imp possible
412:53 - to make a network connection this is
412:55 - also referred to as a wavelength
412:58 - mismatch as the wavelength or color of
413:01 - the light being used is different
413:03 - between the modes of fiber transceivers
413:05 - the otdr can be used to determine the
413:08 - types of transceivers that are being
413:10 - used there are some other fiber optic
413:14 - cable issues that can arise anything
413:17 - that can interrupt the flow of light
413:18 - from transceiver to transceiver will
413:21 - create a problem dirt or smudges on the
413:24 - connectors may cause an issue with fiber
413:27 - optic cable Transmissions when this is
413:29 - suspected using a soft polishing cloth
413:33 - to clean the ends of the cable will
413:35 - solve the problem there is a caution
413:38 - never look directly into the ends of
413:40 - connected fiber optic cable if you do so
413:44 - you run the risk of damaging your eyes
413:46 - connectors are also specific to the mode
413:49 - of transmission as in SMF or MMF
413:53 - connecting the wrong type of connector
413:55 - to a cable will prevent proper
413:57 - communication from occurring also check
414:00 - to make sure that the proper connectors
414:02 - are being used with the proper type of
414:05 - fiber optic cables worn or broken
414:07 - connectors will create an air gap which
414:11 - will create a network transmission
414:13 - problem always inspect the connectors
414:15 - for their condition before use an otdr
414:19 - can be used to determine where the loss
414:21 - of signal is occurring even if it is at
414:24 - the connector that concludes this
414:27 - session on troubleshooting fiber cable
414:30 - networks we talked about using the
414:32 - specific tool for the job and then we
414:35 - concluded with common fiber cable
414:38 - problems on behalf of pace it thank you
414:41 - for watching this session and I hope you
414:43 - do watch another one
414:51 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
414:54 - welcome to Pace's session on
414:57 - troubleshooting common network issues
415:00 - today we're going to talk about problems
415:02 - that should be escalated and then we
415:04 - will conclude with problems that you
415:06 - should resolve there's a fair amount of
415:09 - ground to cover so let's go ahead and
415:11 - begin this session we're going to begin
415:14 - by talking about problems that an
415:16 - entrylevel network technician should
415:20 - escalate the complexity of mod modern
415:22 - networking is made using a solid
415:24 - troubleshooting methodology a necessity
415:28 - not an option networks can express
415:30 - problems and issues in many ways this
415:33 - can lead to much frustration on the part
415:36 - of the network users and the technicians
415:39 - responsible for fixing problems if such
415:42 - problems are not resolved quickly they
415:44 - can lead to loss of Revenue and
415:46 - productivity for an organization there
415:49 - are a number of problems that should be
415:51 - escalated up the troubleshooting chain
415:54 - as soon as they're discovered in order
415:56 - for them to be resolved in the most
415:58 - expedient manner the first of those
416:01 - problems is the switching Loop users
416:04 - complain that the network works fine for
416:06 - a while and then goes down and then
416:09 - works fine for a while and then goes
416:11 - down this indicates a spanning tree
416:14 - protocol convergence issue or a
416:17 - switching Loop in either case this is
416:20 - beyond the entry level technicians cap
416:22 - capabilities and should be escalated as
416:25 - soon as possible then there's the
416:27 - broadcast storm a failing Nick or
416:30 - application may cause a situation in
416:32 - which a broadcast storm is created the
416:35 - Nick goes down then comes back up then
416:37 - goes back down and it does this
416:39 - repeatedly this is often referred to as
416:42 - a flapping Nick each time it comes up it
416:45 - sends out a broadcast advertising its
416:48 - status which creates traffic congestion
416:51 - an application can do the same thing in
416:54 - either case escalate this up your
416:56 - support chain as soon as it's discovered
416:59 - similar to the switching Loop is the
417:02 - routing Loop but it involves the routing
417:05 - process this is more likely to occur
417:07 - when older routing Protocols are used
417:10 - but may also occur due to a
417:12 - misconfiguration of routers as in there
417:15 - are multiple static routes to the same
417:18 - location often switching to a newer
417:21 - routing protocol like OSF will resolve
417:25 - or banish routing Loops but this needs
417:28 - to occur farther up the support chain
417:32 - there are other routing problems that
417:34 - once discovered should be moved up the
417:37 - chain routing problems can manifest
417:40 - themselves in many different ways
417:42 - including missing IP routes failure to
417:45 - discover neighboring devices or failure
417:48 - to connect to neighboring devices once
417:50 - they're discovered when routing problems
417:52 - are suspected it is necessary to
417:55 - escalate the issue to the proper
417:57 - technical team one problem that can be
418:00 - difficult to diagnose is the mismatched
418:04 - maximum transmission unit or MTU this is
418:07 - often called an MTU black hole different
418:12 - types of Wan connections have different
418:14 - MTU settings that is the largest
418:17 - allowable size of a packet that can
418:20 - Traverse a link or be accepted by the
418:23 - link the MTU for ethernet by the way is
418:27 - 1,500 bytes routers will negotiate the
418:30 - MTU between links using icmp that's
418:35 - internet control message protocol if
418:38 - icmp has been disabled on the router
418:41 - which is a common practice when a router
418:44 - receives a packet that exceeds the MTU
418:47 - it will not respond and it will drop the
418:50 - packet the sending router continues to
418:53 - send the oversight packets into the MTU
418:57 - black hole never getting a response back
419:00 - that the packets are too big so the data
419:03 - is Flowing but it's not going anywhere
419:06 - when suspected this to should be moved
419:09 - up the support chain to the correct
419:11 - technical team Nick teaming can also
419:15 - create a problem this is the process of
419:18 - bonding multiple network interface
419:20 - controllers on a single system for the
419:23 - purpose of increasing bandwidth or for
419:26 - fail over purposes a misconfiguration
419:29 - may actually cause a loss of performance
419:32 - or in a worst case scenario the total
419:35 - loss of functionality if you're dealing
419:38 - with teamed Nicks move it up the support
419:41 - chain then there are power failure or
419:44 - power anomalies power failures are easy
419:47 - to diagnose but may be difficult to
419:49 - recover from while battery backup and
419:52 - generators May mitigate the issue they
419:55 - will not resolve the problem if the
419:57 - problem occurs within the building
419:59 - contact the appropriate group
420:02 - responsible for building maintenance if
420:04 - the problem occurs outside the building
420:07 - contact the appropriate utility
420:10 - electronic devices are sensitive to
420:12 - power issues anomalies in the quality of
420:15 - the electricity delivered to the device
420:18 - may cause problems using battery backups
420:21 - or uninterruptible power supplies with
420:24 - power conditioners will help to mitigate
420:27 - power
420:28 - anomalies with problems to escalate
420:31 - covered let's move on to problems that
420:34 - you can resolve we will begin with
420:38 - incorrect IP
420:40 - configurations under incorrect IP
420:43 - configurations we will begin with the
420:45 - default gateway the default gateway is
420:48 - the local network or computer's access
420:51 - to outside networks an incorrect Gateway
420:54 - will keep traffic from reaching its
420:56 - destination if it's suspected verify
420:59 - what the correct Gateway settings should
421:01 - be and correct it then there are
421:04 - duplicate IP addresses when duplicate IP
421:07 - addresses have been configured the first
421:10 - device booted up will get the address
421:13 - and the second one that gets booted up
421:16 - will get an address supplied by a Pippa
421:18 - this can occur when DHCP address
421:21 - reservation
421:22 - have not been configured correctly this
421:25 - is easy to verify and correct and should
421:27 - be done when an aipa address is received
421:31 - by a device there are other DHCP
421:34 - misconfigurations that can occur the
421:36 - problem is expressed in a similar manner
421:39 - as the duplicate IP address problem as
421:41 - in an a pipa address is supplied and is
421:45 - configured by a and is caused by a
421:47 - misconfigured DHCP server again verify
421:50 - your DHCP settings and correct then
421:54 - there are DNS
421:56 - misconfigurations users complain that
421:58 - they cannot get to resources or
422:00 - destinations on the network when using
422:03 - the host name DNS is used to resolve
422:06 - host names to IP addresses so a
422:10 - misconfiguration will prevent the
422:12 - function of the DNS process verify the
422:15 - correct DNS settings and correct as
422:18 - needed it's also possible to have
422:21 - incorrect VLAN assignments or incorrect
422:24 - virtual local area network assignments
422:27 - users will complain that they cannot get
422:30 - to necessary network resources this
422:33 - tends to be a single host issue or to
422:35 - involve a small group of hosts verify
422:39 - the VLAN settings and again correct as
422:42 - necessary incorrect interface
422:44 - configurations will also create network
422:47 - issues users May complain of poor
422:49 - Network performance or not being being
422:52 - able to connect to resources at all this
422:55 - issue tends to affect a whole network
422:58 - segment configuration issues could
423:00 - include mismatched Port speeds and or
423:03 - duplex settings on the interfaces verify
423:06 - the correct interface configurations and
423:09 - correct the
423:10 - settings simultaneous Wireless and wired
423:13 - connections will also create some
423:16 - networking issues many laptops come with
423:19 - wireless and wired Network capabilities
423:21 - built built into them it is possible for
423:24 - a laptop to attempt to use both at the
423:27 - same time this may cause the device to
423:30 - quit communicating on the network as a
423:32 - whole reminding users to turn off
423:35 - wireless capabilities before joining the
423:37 - wired network will resolve this problem
423:41 - not having good endtoend connectivity is
423:44 - another common problem the complexity of
423:47 - networks will just about guarantee that
423:49 - endtoend connectivity the ability to
423:52 - reach remote hosts will be lost at some
423:55 - point the Ping and Tracer utilities can
423:59 - be used to find where the breaking
424:01 - communication occurs this information
424:04 - can then be used to determine the next
424:06 - course of action last up is Hardware
424:10 - failure networking equipment and devices
424:13 - will fail when this happens it is
424:16 - usually denoted by the sudden loss or
424:19 - intermittent loss of networking fun
424:21 - functions or access the key to resolving
424:25 - this issue is in determining what has
424:27 - failed and replacing it that concludes
424:31 - this session on troubleshooting common
424:33 - network issues I began by talking about
424:37 - problems that should be escalated and
424:39 - then I concluded with problems that
424:42 - should be resolved on behalf of pace it
424:46 - thank you for watching this session and
424:48 - I look forward to doing another
424:50 - one
424:55 - good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to
424:58 - pait's session on common network
425:01 - security issues today I'm going to be
425:03 - discussing security issues caused by
425:06 - misconfiguration and then I will
425:08 - conclude on other network security
425:11 - issues with that let's go ahead and
425:14 - begin this session of course I'm going
425:17 - to begin by talking about security
425:19 - issues caused by misconfiguration
425:22 - it's easy to assume that a network is
425:25 - secured from threats while in reality it
425:28 - may be very vulnerable a network may
425:31 - actually be vulnerable because of a
425:33 - misconfigured security setting or
425:36 - because of a common practice within an
425:39 - organization a network may not be as
425:42 - secure as you think due to the
425:44 - everchanging threat landscape nefarious
425:47 - hackers are continually seeking new
425:50 - exploits that they can use to breach
425:53 - network security including possible
425:56 - misconfigurations in network security
425:58 - settings the security settings may have
426:01 - been correct at the time that they were
426:03 - set up but due to the changing landscape
426:05 - they may be considered a
426:07 - misconfiguration now a misconfigured
426:11 - firewall Andor Access Control list may
426:14 - cause a security issue these can result
426:17 - in three different categories of
426:19 - security issues traffic that should be
426:22 - blocked isn't allowing threats in
426:25 - traffic that shouldn't be blocked is
426:28 - this can prevent the receiving of vital
426:30 - updates or all traffic is blocked this
426:34 - isn't necessarily a security issue per
426:36 - se but it is still a
426:39 - misconfiguration and it is possible for
426:41 - a junior network administrator to just
426:44 - remove the access control list or
426:46 - firewall to allow the traffic to start
426:48 - flowing again which is a security issue
426:52 - to protect against a misconfigured
426:54 - firewall or ACL thoroughly test them
426:57 - before putting them into action a
427:00 - misconfigured application may become a
427:03 - security threat a web application that
427:06 - does not perform proper validation of
427:08 - input may lead to a buffer overflow
427:11 - attack this may lead to a successful
427:14 - attack on the web server on which it is
427:17 - hosted thoroughly testing applications
427:20 - before placing them into service will
427:22 - mitigate the threat unpatched operating
427:26 - system or firmware will become a major
427:29 - security issue quickly the manufacturer
427:33 - of operating systems and Hardware
427:35 - firmware will often produce security
427:38 - patches or fixes for vulnerabilities as
427:41 - they become known an unpatched OS or
427:44 - firmware becomes very vulnerable in
427:47 - short order and may become a threat to
427:50 - the network most software makers have an
427:53 - updating service subscribing to that
427:56 - service will help to mitigate the threat
428:00 - open TCP IP ports are a security issue
428:04 - open ports on networks are listening for
428:07 - requests for or by Services applications
428:11 - or protocols all open ports are a
428:15 - security vulnerability and there are
428:19 - 65,535 possible ports that may be open a
428:23 - best practice for Network Security is to
428:26 - specifically close all unnecessary ports
428:30 - to harden a network the tacx plus and
428:33 - radius services are often used to
428:36 - authenticate devices and users on
428:39 - networks a misconfiguration on either
428:42 - may lead to a security issue that allows
428:44 - malicious users to be authenticated to
428:47 - use network resources thoroughly
428:50 - reviewing the configuration of
428:52 - authentication services will help to
428:54 - mitigate the problem in addition all
428:57 - default local accounts should be
429:00 - disabled these default local accounts
429:03 - may present a slight opening for a
429:05 - malicious user to exploit authentication
429:08 - Services active default usernames and
429:11 - passwords are an issue almost all
429:14 - devices and applications come with
429:17 - default usernames and passwords to ease
429:20 - the setup process if left active these
429:23 - defaults create a security issue as they
429:26 - tend to be well known or are easy to
429:28 - find through simple research a best
429:31 - practice is to disable all default
429:33 - usernames and passwords after setting up
429:36 - the device or
429:38 - application it's time to move on to
429:41 - other network security issues first up
429:45 - are malicious users malicious users may
429:48 - be the single biggest security issue
429:51 - facing any network and they will fall
429:53 - into one of two categories there is the
429:57 - untrusted malicious user this is an
430:00 - outside entity that has exploited a
430:03 - security weakness to gain access to
430:05 - network resources as in a hacker who has
430:08 - breached a databases security features
430:11 - to gain access to valuable information
430:14 - even worse than the untrusted malicious
430:17 - user is a trusted malicious user this
430:21 - this is a person or entity that has been
430:24 - explicitly granted access to network
430:27 - resources that then exploits this
430:29 - trusted position for malicious purposes
430:33 - and they are harder to guard against
430:35 - because you've already granted them
430:37 - access inside of your defenses a best
430:40 - practice is to review log files on a
430:43 - regular basis to see what resources are
430:46 - being accessed and by whom to help
430:49 - maintain security packet sniffers are
430:52 - also a security issue packet sniffers
430:55 - examine Network traffic at a very basic
430:58 - level and can be used to help in the
431:01 - administration of a network but packet
431:03 - sniffers may also be used by malicious
431:06 - users to see what protocols and
431:09 - activities are allowed on the network
431:12 - this may help them in further attacking
431:15 - the network then there is malware it is
431:18 - usually defined as malicious software
431:21 - that has the intent of causing harm as a
431:24 - category malware covers any code-based
431:28 - threat to a network or system examples
431:30 - of malware include viruses Trojans and
431:34 - spyware to protect against malware
431:37 - antimalware applications should be
431:39 - running on every device to be proactive
431:42 - enduser education should also be in
431:45 - place to teach them to recognize the
431:48 - dangers that malware presents the
431:50 - internet control messaging protocol
431:53 - itself may become a security issue icmp
431:57 - can be a valuable tool for diagnosing
432:00 - issues on networks but it can also
432:02 - become a security vulnerability icmp can
432:06 - be exploited in a denial of service type
432:09 - of attack icmp can also be used to
432:13 - redirect legitimate users to a new
432:16 - malicious default gateway possibly
432:19 - resulting in loss of data or or
432:21 - sensitive information it is now a best
432:24 - practice to deny icmp requests on a
432:28 - router's outward-facing
432:30 - interface denial of service or
432:33 - distributed denial of service attacks
432:35 - are becoming more common in an attempt
432:38 - to bring down a network or website
432:40 - malicious users will often send
432:43 - thousands or hundreds of thousands of
432:46 - requests for service the attacker's goal
432:49 - is to make that resource unreachable by
432:52 - legitimate users many modern firewalls
432:55 - and other network appliances have been
432:58 - configured to recognize the signature of
433:00 - such an attack and can take steps to
433:03 - mitigate the results when creating
433:06 - applications developers often create
433:08 - back doors into the programs back doors
433:11 - are a method of accessing an application
433:14 - or service while bypassing the normal
433:17 - authentication process unfortunately
433:20 - these back door doors are sometimes left
433:22 - open after the development process has
433:25 - been completed once these become known
433:28 - they can be exploited in most cases the
433:31 - application is listening on a specific
433:34 - port for a request for access the best
433:38 - mitigation technique is to close all
433:40 - unnecessary ports on a network kind of
433:44 - sounds familiar doesn't it then there's
433:47 - jamming all wireless networks use radio
433:51 - frequency channels to transmit data on
433:53 - the network it is possible to create
433:56 - enough interference on the RF channel
433:59 - that it is no longer usable on the
434:01 - network an attacker will often use
434:04 - jamming when performing a denial of
434:06 - service type attack however it can also
434:09 - be used to perform an evil twin type
434:12 - attack by jamming the legitimate channel
434:15 - the attacker is hoping that users will
434:18 - switch to the channel That the Rogue
434:21 - access point is transmitting on many of
434:23 - the modern networking standards and
434:26 - devices employ techniques to mitigate
434:28 - the threat of jamming as in both
434:32 - 802.11n and 802.11 AC are difficult to
434:36 - jam standards then there is Banner
434:39 - grabbing many network devices display
434:42 - banners when users are signing into are
434:45 - requesting services from network devices
434:48 - these banners can impart information
434:51 - about the type of device or the type of
434:53 - service that is being requested this
434:55 - information may be used by a hacker to
434:58 - research possible exploits the best
435:01 - practice is to disable all unnecessary
435:04 - services and Banners on network devices
435:09 - that concludes this session on common
435:11 - network security issues I began by
435:14 - talking about security issues caused by
435:17 - misconfiguration and then I concluded
435:19 - with other networks security issues on
435:22 - behalf of pace it thank you for watching
435:25 - this session and I hope I get to do
435:27 - another one
435:34 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
435:37 - welcome to pait's session on common W
435:40 - components and issues today I'm going to
435:43 - be talking about common wide area
435:45 - network components and then we're going
435:47 - to move on to Common Wan issu isues
435:51 - there's a fair amount of ground to cover
435:54 - not a whole lot of time so let's go
435:56 - ahead and begin this session of course
435:59 - I'm going to begin by talking about
436:01 - common Wan
436:03 - components first up our copper line
436:05 - drivers or repeaters these are used to
436:08 - allow Network traffic to go farther
436:11 - distances over copper wire type networks
436:14 - they take an incoming signal and
436:16 - regenerate it boosting the strength of
436:19 - that signal and then they send send it
436:21 - back out thus reducing attenuation
436:24 - common to all WS is the Demar Demar
436:28 - stands for the demarcation point this is
436:31 - the physical point where the
436:33 - telecommunication company's
436:34 - responsibility ends and the customers
436:37 - Begins the tel code takes care of the
436:40 - Upstream end of the network and the
436:42 - customer takes care of the downstream
436:45 - end of the network the dmark may be
436:48 - simple or it may be very complex
436:50 - depending upon the size of the
436:53 - organization and the required Services
436:56 - then there is the network interface unit
436:58 - or the NIU in the Soho environment the
437:02 - NIU is usually the DeMark also in the
437:06 - Soho environment the NIU is usually
437:09 - provided by the internet service
437:11 - provider or ISP and NIU can be a cable
437:15 - modem a DSL modem or another piece of
437:19 - Hardware that connects the customer to
437:22 - the
437:22 - ISP one type of NIU is the smartjack
437:27 - it's an NIU that can provide feedback on
437:30 - conditions to the ISP smart jacks help
437:34 - the ISP determine if a problem exists on
437:37 - its end of the dmark through the use of
437:39 - remote loop back capabilities Min smart
437:42 - Jacks can also provide translation
437:45 - between protocols as in translating a
437:48 - Serial PPP communic ation stream into
437:52 - ethernet more than likely on larger
437:54 - networks you will find CSU dsus that's
437:58 - Channel Service Unit digital service
438:00 - units this is the interface point that
438:03 - provides the connection between a
438:05 - point-to-point line and the device that
438:08 - is directing Network traffic which is
438:10 - usually a router the CSU DSU may be an
438:14 - external device or it may be a removable
438:17 - module inside of a router only two c CSU
438:21 - dsus may exist on a single point
438:23 - to-point line one at either end of the
438:27 - connection with the common components
438:29 - covered let's move on to common wide
438:32 - area network
438:34 - issues first up is a loss of internet
438:37 - connectivity many factors can lead to a
438:40 - loss of connectivity on both sides of
438:43 - the DeMark before contacting the WAN
438:46 - provider check the local area network
438:49 - equipment for it operation if the issue
438:52 - is not to be found on the land side then
438:56 - contact the wide area network provider
438:59 - one of the tests that the WAN provider
439:01 - will conduct is a loop back test to
439:04 - check its line for interference DNS
439:07 - issues are also common in a Wan
439:10 - environment they may look like a loss of
439:12 - internet connectivity but it isn't the
439:15 - users May complain that they cannot
439:17 - connect to an outside Source like ww
439:20 - ww.google.com but it may not actually be
439:24 - a connectivity issue but a DNS issue if
439:27 - using a local DNS server verify the
439:30 - settings and make Corrections
439:32 - accordingly if the network is using the
439:35 - WAN providers DNS settings attempt to
439:38 - Ping the IP address if that works there
439:42 - is a Wan connection and if you then use
439:45 - the Ping utility with the fully
439:47 - qualified domain name and this fails
439:50 - then contact the Lan provider to resolve
439:54 - their DNS issue interface issues are
439:58 - also common errors on a router's w
440:01 - interface can indicate several different
440:04 - issues monitoring an interfaces status
440:07 - in reading the error reports May provide
440:10 - a clue as to the issue the most common
440:13 - issue that prevents a good connection is
440:15 - a speed or duplex mismatch a speed
440:19 - mismatch between interfaces will prevent
440:22 - a link from being established a duplex
440:25 - mismatch between the interfaces will
440:27 - create errors as in output and input
440:31 - errors if you're experiencing discards
440:34 - and drop packets there's a couple of
440:36 - things to consider if the device is
440:38 - discarding incoming packets then more
440:41 - than likely the device's CPU is being
440:45 - over utilized it may be time to upgrade
440:48 - if the device is dropping outgoing
440:50 - packets then there is a bandwidth
440:52 - congestion issue which may be caused by
440:55 - interference on the line so either you
440:58 - may be trying to move too much Network
441:00 - traffic or there may be an issue on the
441:03 - wide area network providers side of the
441:06 - line router configurations are a common
441:10 - problem when establishing a new W
441:13 - connection a misconfiguration of the WAN
441:16 - interface of a router will lead to guess
441:19 - what a w connection issue if this is
441:22 - suspected verify the proper
441:24 - configuration settings with the WAN
441:27 - provider unfortunately company policy
441:30 - and practices sometimes get reported as
441:33 - a wide area network issue some
441:36 - applications may be throttled or have
441:39 - their available bandwidth reduced for
441:41 - quality of service reasons leading to
441:44 - slow service which is a perceived wide
441:47 - area network issue also acceptable use
441:51 - policies May restrict or block access to
441:55 - certain sites or types of sites which
441:58 - may appear to the end user as a when
442:01 - issue there's not much that you as the
442:03 - technician can do to resolve this but it
442:06 - is up to you to explain it to the end
442:09 - user a satellite wide area network
442:12 - connection may also become an issue if a
442:15 - satellite Wan connection is used latency
442:18 - will increase due to the distance
442:20 - distances covered by the Transmissions
442:22 - latency is the measure of time between
442:25 - the sending of data and the receiving of
442:27 - the data careful application of quality
442:30 - of service techniques May mitigate the
442:33 - effects of latency on some applications
442:36 - but you're still going to have more
442:38 - latency with a satellite connection than
442:40 - other types of connections split Horizon
442:43 - is another issue split Horizon is a
442:47 - technique used in routing to help
442:49 - prevent routing loops with split Horizon
442:52 - a router will not advertise a route to
442:55 - another Network out of the interface
442:58 - that it learned the route on with a
443:01 - point to multi-point wide area network
443:04 - connection the router may have
443:06 - difficulty with split Horizon it will
443:09 - learn all of the routes available to it
443:11 - on the same interface but it can't
443:14 - advertise those routes back out of that
443:18 - interface creating logical iCal sub
443:20 - interfaces on the wide area network
443:23 - interface will usually resolve this
443:25 - problem The Logical sub interfaces
443:28 - appear to the router as individual
443:30 - interfaces allowing the router to
443:33 - advertise the routes back out of the WAN
443:37 - interface that concludes this session on
443:40 - common Wan components and issues I
443:44 - talked about common W components and
443:46 - then I concluded with some common wide
443:49 - area networ NW work issues on behalf of
443:52 - pace it thank you for watching this
443:54 - session and I hope to do another one
444:06 - soon hello I am Brian frell and welcome
444:10 - to pait's session on the OSI networking
444:14 - reference model today I'm going to begin
444:16 - by talking about a brief history of the
444:19 - reference models
444:20 - and then I'm going to talk about the
444:22 - network reference models themselves and
444:24 - then I'm going to conclude with a
444:26 - comparison between OSI and TCP IP
444:32 - there's a fair amount of ground to cover
444:34 - so let's go ahead and begin this session
444:37 - so let's begin with a brief history the
444:41 - open system interconnection reference
444:43 - model is a conceptual model with two
444:46 - major components the first main
444:48 - component of the OS I networking
444:50 - reference model is an abstract model of
444:54 - networking it's a seven layer model the
444:57 - second major component is a set of
445:00 - specific protocols which allow differing
445:03 - Computing systems to communicate with
445:05 - one another despite their different
445:08 - architecture so why was a networking
445:11 - model required well early networks
445:14 - communicated using proprietory languages
445:18 - because of those proprietory Lang
445:19 - languages early networks could only
445:22 - communicate with like systems so an IBM
445:26 - Network could only communicate with
445:28 - another IBM Network in addition to that
445:31 - the US government desired a robust
445:34 - computer communication system that could
445:37 - survive disaster the first networking
445:39 - reference model that was developed was
445:41 - the TCP IP reference model the
445:45 - transmission control protocol Internet
445:48 - Protocol reference model was published
445:51 - as the United States Department of
445:53 - Defense standard in
445:55 - 1982 all of the major systems
445:59 - manufacturers adopted the TCP IP
446:02 - reference model beginning in
446:04 - 1984 AT&T moved the Unix implementation
446:09 - of
446:10 - tcpip to open source in
446:13 - 1989 further cementing TCP IP's place in
446:18 - networking the OSI reference model came
446:21 - later than the TCP IP reference model
446:25 - The OSI model was published in
446:28 - 1983 and it defines the relationships
446:31 - between differing protocols and Hardware
446:35 - it's time to move on to a discussion
446:37 - about the networking reference models in
446:40 - more detail we're going to begin with
446:43 - the OSI reference model it is a seven
446:46 - layer reference model layer one is also
446:50 - called the physical layer it
446:52 - standardizes the electrical signals that
446:55 - networks use it also defines cable
446:58 - standards and how the bits of data are
447:01 - placed on the physical media network
447:04 - cables and hubs are part of layer one of
447:08 - the OSI model then there's Layer Two
447:11 - which is also called the data link layer
447:14 - it's responsible for identifying the
447:16 - individual nodes both the sending node
447:19 - and and the receiving node it also
447:22 - introduces an error correction method
447:25 - known as the frame check sequence or FCS
447:29 - Layer Two is composed of two Su layers
447:33 - the first of those is The Logical link
447:35 - control layer it is mainly responsible
447:38 - for flow control and error correction
447:42 - then there is the media Access Control
447:44 - layer it is mainly responsible for node
447:48 - addressing switches and bridges are
447:51 - layer 2 devices then there's layer three
447:54 - the network layer it's responsible for
447:56 - routing functions between networks it
447:59 - also identifies networks and nodes on
448:03 - the network routers are layer three
448:07 - devices then there's layer four the
448:09 - transport layer it's responsible for
448:12 - breaking the data into smaller pieces
448:14 - for the lower layers and for the actual
448:18 - data transport protocol calls two of
448:20 - which are TCP and UDP the transport
448:24 - layer may be required to confirm the
448:27 - actual delivery of the data stream and
448:30 - it may be required to offer error
448:32 - correction and it does this through the
448:35 - use of TCP or transmission control
448:38 - protocol then there's layer five the
448:40 - session layer this is the layer that is
448:43 - responsible for establishing the initial
448:46 - parameters between two systems it sets
448:49 - up up and tears down the communication
448:52 - Channel layer six or the presentation
448:55 - layer is responsible for taking data and
448:58 - converting it from a machine dependent
449:00 - language to a machine independent
449:04 - language this is also the layer that has
449:07 - the main responsibility for encryption
449:10 - between networks and finally we have
449:13 - layer s the application layer this is
449:16 - the layer that is responsible for the
449:19 - protocol OLS that request services or
449:22 - functions from other systems these
449:24 - protocols may not be the actual
449:27 - application for instance Internet
449:30 - Explorer is an application that uses
449:34 - HTTP at layer 7 to request web pages now
449:39 - let's talk about the TCP IP reference
449:42 - model this is a four layer reference
449:46 - model the lowest layer is the network
449:49 - interface face layer which can also be
449:51 - known as the link layer it handles
449:53 - electrical signaling flow control error
449:57 - detection and node addressing then
450:00 - there's the internet layer this layer
450:03 - handles routing functions and identifies
450:06 - Network systems and nodes on those
450:08 - networks then there is the transport
450:11 - layer which handles breaking the data
450:13 - into more manageable pieces for the
450:16 - lower layers it is also the layer that
450:19 - is is responsible for the delivery
450:21 - method which can be either reliable or
450:24 - unreliable and error correction for when
450:27 - reliable delivery is used and finally
450:31 - there is the application layer this
450:33 - layer handles requests for services from
450:36 - applications it also handles translation
450:39 - to machine independent languages and
450:42 - encryption it also sets up and tears
450:45 - down communication sessions between
450:48 - system so now let's do a comparison
450:51 - between the OSI and TCP IP reference
450:56 - models while tcpip is the dominant model
451:00 - most technicians communicate issues
451:03 - using the OSI model because it is more
451:07 - specific when a problem occurs and
451:10 - believe me they will it is easier to
451:13 - resolve them with the more highly
451:15 - defined set of specifications of the OSI
451:18 - model versus the specifications of the
451:22 - TCP IP model it's easier to revolve an
451:26 - issue at the session layer of the OSI
451:29 - model than it is to track down what went
451:32 - wrong in the application layer of the
451:34 - TCP IP model both the OSI and TCP IP
451:40 - models are reference models only it is
451:43 - not mandatory that they be followed each
451:46 - developer and manufacturer determines if
451:49 - its own method of implementing the
451:51 - reference models while in theory there
451:53 - will never be a problem in communicating
451:56 - between devices and systems remember it
451:59 - is only a theory now that concludes this
452:03 - session on the OSI networking reference
452:06 - model I began with a brief history then
452:10 - I moved on to the networking reference
452:12 - models themselves and then I did a very
452:15 - brief OSI and TCP IP comparison on
452:20 - behalf of pace it thank you for watching
452:23 - this session and I hope to do another
452:25 - one
452:32 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
452:35 - welcome to Pace it session on the
452:38 - transport layer plus icmp today I'm
452:42 - going to discuss TCP and UDP and then
452:45 - I'm going to conclude with a brief
452:47 - discussion on I
452:49 - CM there's a fair amount of ground to
452:52 - cover but not a whole lot of time so
452:55 - let's go ahead and begin this session of
452:58 - course I'm going to begin by talking
453:00 - about TCP and
453:02 - UDP before I can talk about TCP and UDP
453:06 - we need to talk about the transport
453:09 - layer most networking models follow the
453:12 - open Systems interconnection reference
453:15 - model or the OSI model it is composed of
453:18 - seven different layers which include the
453:21 - application presentation session
453:24 - transport network data link and physical
453:27 - layers the layers work together to
453:30 - create a system of communication that
453:33 - allows for different types of computing
453:35 - systems or networks to communicate with
453:38 - each other layer four also known as the
453:41 - transport layer receives data from the
453:44 - session layer which is layer five and
453:47 - determines what method or type of
453:50 - delivery is required for the data the
453:53 - transport layer then hands that data
453:56 - with the instructions for the method of
453:57 - delivery to layer three which is also
454:00 - known as the network layer which is then
454:03 - responsible for determining where the
454:06 - data is actually going there are two
454:09 - main transport layer protocols they are
454:13 - TCP and
454:15 - UDP TCP or the transmission control
454:19 - control protocol is a protocol that
454:21 - determines the type of delivery method
454:24 - that will be used in network
454:26 - communications TCP uses a reliable
454:29 - method to deliver Network packets TCP
454:33 - helps to set up the connection session
454:35 - it helps to establish error control
454:38 - during the communication session and it
454:41 - helps to tear down the communication
454:43 - session when it's done now TCP does use
454:48 - a reliable delivery method one of the
454:50 - main ways that it does this is through
454:53 - the use of a three-way handshake the
454:56 - first step of this handshake is the
454:58 - request for the connection the second
455:01 - step is the reception of the response
455:04 - from the other end the third part of the
455:06 - three-way handshake is when the
455:08 - requestor sends an acknowledgement back
455:11 - that sets the sequence numbers that will
455:13 - be used with every packet that is
455:16 - delivered every packet that gets sent
455:18 - must must be acknowledged by the
455:20 - receiver if the sender doesn't receive
455:23 - the acknowledgement of a packet the
455:25 - sender will then resend that packet all
455:29 - packets are sent and received in order
455:33 - they're never out of order are they
455:35 - should never be out of order so now
455:37 - let's talk about UDP or user datagram
455:41 - protocol it's a protocol that determines
455:44 - the type of delivery method that will be
455:46 - used in network communication
455:49 - just like TCP unlike TCP UDP uses an
455:55 - unreliable method to deliver Network
455:58 - packets it does not help to set up the
456:00 - connection session it does not establish
456:03 - error control and it does not help to
456:06 - tear down the communication session it
456:10 - uses an unreliable delivery method this
456:13 - could better be described as a best
456:15 - effort delivery method it sends the data
456:18 - dat stream to the destination trusting
456:21 - that the destination is a listening for
456:25 - the data stream and B willing to accept
456:28 - that data stream the data stream flows
456:31 - with no acknowledgment of it being
456:34 - received that's how UDP works not all
456:38 - communication can be treated the same
456:41 - that is why there are both reliable and
456:44 - unreliable delivery methods with TCP the
456:47 - sender can be a assured that the other
456:49 - end of the line has received all of the
456:52 - packets that were sent and that the
456:54 - packets were received in the proper
456:56 - order this works well for communication
456:59 - that is not sensitive to latency issues
457:02 - that are associated with the overhead of
457:05 - reliable deliveries UDP strips off the
457:09 - overhead but sacrifices reliability it
457:12 - is well suited for network communication
457:15 - in which speed is more important than
457:17 - reliability when using voice over IP it
457:21 - is more important for the flow of
457:23 - packets to be continuous than for
457:26 - communication to be held up while
457:28 - waiting for packets to arrive in the
457:30 - right order Voiceover IP communication
457:33 - can survive the occasional drop packet
457:37 - but it gets very miserable when it has
457:39 - to wait for those packets to arrive now
457:43 - let's move on to
457:45 - ICM the internet control message
457:48 - protocol works at layer three which is
457:51 - also known as the network layer of the
457:54 - OSI reference model and it is used by IP
457:58 - or the Internet Protocol to perform
458:01 - several Services as a messaging service
458:04 - for IP icmp packets are carried as
458:08 - encapsulated IP datagrams it provides
458:12 - information about network issues the
458:15 - Ping utility uses icmp test for endtoend
458:20 - connectivity between two devices using
458:23 - icmp Echo request packets the trace
458:27 - route utility uses a combination of icmp
458:31 - echo requests and destination
458:34 - unreachable packets to map the actual
458:37 - route between two endpoints also if a
458:40 - router's memory buffers are full it will
458:43 - continue to send out icmp buffer full
458:46 - messages until the congestion has been
458:49 - reduced this allows the other routers to
458:52 - slow down their Transmissions to avoid
458:55 - packet loss that concludes this session
458:59 - on the transport layer plus icmp I began
459:03 - with a brief discussion on TCP and UDP
459:07 - and I concluded with another brief
459:10 - discussion on
459:12 - icmp on behalf of pit thank you for
459:15 - watching this session and I hope you
459:17 - watch another one
459:27 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
459:30 - welcome to pait's session on basic
459:34 - Network Concepts part one today we're
459:36 - going to be talking about
459:38 - encapsulation and
459:40 - modulation there's a fair amount of
459:42 - ground to cover so let's go ahead and
459:45 - begin this session we're going to begin
459:48 - by talking about
459:50 - encapsulation the open Systems
459:52 - interconnection reference model or the
459:54 - OSI model uses a layered approach to
459:58 - enable disparate devices to be able to
460:00 - communicate effectively during the
460:03 - communication between two devices or
460:05 - nodes each layer is only responsible for
460:09 - being understood by the corresponding
460:11 - layer on the other device as data flows
460:15 - down from the application layer through
460:17 - to the physical layer it is encapsulated
460:20 - at each layer with information to help
460:22 - the corresponding layer at the other end
460:25 - of the communication line understand
460:27 - what is happening as the data is
460:29 - received at the other end it is De
460:31 - encapsulated or unwrapped as it moves up
460:35 - the OSI stack by the corresponding layer
460:39 - let's talk about how encapsulation works
460:42 - the application layer begins the process
460:44 - by sending data that is encapsulated or
460:47 - wrapped with application layer control
460:50 - information to the presentation layer
460:53 - the encapsulated data is called a pdu or
460:56 - protocol data unit the application layer
461:00 - pdus are segmented by the presentation
461:03 - layer with each segment being
461:05 - encapsulated by presentation layer
461:07 - control information they are now
461:10 - presentation layer pdus the process of
461:13 - segmenting and encapsulating continues
461:15 - down through the OSI stack until it is
461:18 - transmitted as bits by the physical
461:21 - layer the receiving physical layer
461:23 - passes the bits to the receiving data
461:26 - link layer which reads the data link
461:28 - layer pdu information and then de
461:31 - encapsulates and Des segments it sending
461:34 - the new packets to the network layer as
461:37 - Network layer pdus the process of De
461:41 - encapsulating in D segmenting continues
461:43 - up the OSI stack until it is received by
461:46 - the application layer where it is
461:49 - finally fully de encapsulated and fully
461:52 - reassembled this encapsulation and de
461:55 - encapsulation allows differing systems
461:57 - to be able to communicate together
462:00 - effectively with that covered let's move
462:02 - on to
462:04 - modulation the physical layer of the OSI
462:07 - stack is responsible for transmitting
462:09 - bits of data across some form of media
462:12 - so it literally is responsible for
462:15 - transmitting zeros and ones across the
462:18 - media like a cable the question arises
462:21 - how does the physical layer transmit the
462:23 - data across the media the bits of data
462:26 - are modulated or encoded by the physical
462:29 - layer and placed on the carrier signal
462:32 - of the media which carries the modulated
462:34 - data onto its next destination the
462:37 - carrier signal can also be referred to
462:40 - as the carrier Channel Once the bits are
462:43 - received they are demodulated or
462:45 - unencoded by the receiving physical
462:48 - layer a carrier signal is a standard
462:51 - wave form usually in the form of a sine
462:54 - wave that is used as the base carrier of
462:57 - another input signal a sine wave is a
463:00 - mathematical curve that is represented
463:02 - by a smooth repeating oscillation now
463:06 - let's Define modulation modulation is
463:09 - the process of varying one or more
463:12 - properties of a carrier signal with an
463:14 - input signal usually for the purposes of
463:18 - conveying information modulation can be
463:21 - used to encode digital Network traffic
463:23 - onto media that uses a digital carrier
463:26 - signal as in using an ISDN connection
463:30 - between two networks modulation can also
463:33 - be used to encode a digital signal onto
463:36 - a media that uses an analog carrier
463:39 - signal as in digital Network traffic
463:41 - traveling over the public switched
463:44 - telephone Network or pstn multiplexing
463:47 - is often ten used with modulation
463:50 - multiplexing can be used to increase the
463:53 - number of modulated signals that can be
463:55 - placed onto a carrier signal so let's
463:59 - talk about multiplexing and I don't mean
464:02 - your local movie theater the type of
464:04 - carrier signal will determine if
464:06 - multiplexing can occur a baseband
464:09 - carrier signal cannot have multiplexing
464:12 - occur as the modulated signal will
464:14 - consume all of the available frequency
464:17 - or Channel weight with multiplexing can
464:20 - be utilized on a Broadband carrier
464:22 - Channel as each modulated input is
464:25 - assigned a portion of the Channel width
464:27 - of the carrier channel multiplexing can
464:30 - use one of two methods to weave streams
464:33 - of modulated signal into the carrier
464:35 - signal there's frequency division
464:38 - multiplexing this is the process of
464:40 - mathematically dividing the carrier
464:42 - channel frequency into multiple segments
464:45 - and assigning the results to modulated
464:47 - input signals then there is time
464:49 - division multiplexing this is the
464:52 - process of mathematically dividing the
464:54 - carrier Channel width into multiple time
464:57 - segments and assigning the time slots to
465:00 - different modulated signal input streams
465:03 - it's time to talk about the difference
465:05 - between a baseband and Broadband carrier
465:08 - Channel and we're going to begin with
465:11 - baseband a simple definition of baseband
465:14 - is a stream of data that is sent over a
465:16 - carrier Channel as is a digital
465:18 - modulated signal the digital signal will
465:21 - take all of the carrier signals
465:23 - available frequency or time while the
465:26 - modulated input does take all of the
465:29 - carrier channels available frequency the
465:31 - communication is bidirectional it can
465:34 - flow back and forth a simple definition
465:37 - of a Broadband carrier channel is a
465:40 - stream of data that is sent over a
465:42 - carrier Channel as an analog modulated
465:46 - signal the analog signal will be
465:48 - assigned a portion of either the carrier
465:51 - channels available frequency or time
465:54 - while the modulated input doesn't take
465:56 - all of the carrier channels available
465:58 - frequency the communication is not
466:01 - bidirectional for two-way communication
466:04 - to take place Multiplex channels must be
466:08 - created that is a channel for each
466:10 - Direction now that concludes this
466:13 - session on basic Network Concepts part
466:16 - one I began with with encapsulation and
466:19 - I concluded with modulation on behalf of
466:23 - pit thank you for watching this session
466:26 - and I hope you watch another one
466:35 - soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome
466:39 - to pait's session on basic Network
466:42 - Concepts part two today we're going to
466:44 - be talking about Network transmission
466:47 - Concepts and then we're going to
466:49 - conclude with CSM CD and CS ma CA
466:55 - there's a fair amount of ground to cover
466:57 - so let's go ahead and begin this session
467:01 - of course I'm going to begin with the
467:02 - network transmission
467:05 - Concepts the first concept is wavelength
467:09 - wavelength is a measurement of the
467:11 - distance between peaks in a wave pattern
467:14 - emitted by electromagnetic radiation as
467:17 - in in light waves radio waves or
467:20 - microwaves each type of electromagnetic
467:23 - radiation falls into a specific range of
467:27 - wavelengths by modifying a wavelength
467:30 - data can be encoded into the wavelength
467:32 - and transmitted to a receiving device
467:35 - which then decodes the transmission then
467:38 - there's B rate and bit rate the B rate
467:41 - was originally used to measure the speed
467:44 - of a telegraph transmission it is a
467:47 - measure of the number of State changes
467:49 - in a given period of time the usual
467:53 - state change that was measured was
467:55 - electricity as in the number of times
467:58 - the state changed from .5 volts to 1.5
468:02 - volts the bit rate is a measure of the
468:05 - number of zeros and ones that can be
468:07 - transmitted across the medium in a given
468:10 - period of time so it is a measure of the
468:13 - actual bits that can be transmitted it
468:16 - is usually measured in bits per second
468:19 - or BPS the bit rate is a more accurate
468:22 - measure of transmission throughput than
468:25 - the B rate then there's sampling size
468:29 - when converting from an analog audio
468:31 - signal to a digital signal a computer or
468:34 - other device captures the analog audio
468:37 - waveform and mathematically converts the
468:40 - captured sample into different
468:42 - wavelengths which is how we get the
468:44 - discrete sounds this occurs over a
468:47 - specific period of time which is called
468:50 - the size of the sample or the sampling
468:53 - size and finally there's carrier detect
468:57 - and carrier sense carrier detect is when
469:00 - a device can only tell when a carrier
469:02 - signal or channel is present by the
469:05 - reception of a control signal the
469:08 - presence of the control signal signifies
469:11 - that Transmissions can occur the control
469:14 - signal controls the order of
469:16 - Transmissions so data collisions are not
469:19 - possible the control signal can also be
469:22 - used to establish the maximum speed of
469:25 - the transmission that can be used
469:28 - carrier sense is when a device uses
469:30 - feedback from a receiver to determine if
469:33 - a carrier channel is present if a
469:36 - carrier signal is detected the device
469:38 - can send Transmissions data transmission
469:41 - collisions are possible with carrier
469:44 - sense and that logically leads us into
469:48 - csmac CD and csmac CA the carrier detect
469:54 - method of network transmission works
469:56 - well when there are just a few nodes
469:58 - that need to be connected together
470:01 - however as the number of nodes that need
470:03 - to transmit increase the efficiency of
470:06 - carrier detect begins to decrease to the
470:08 - point where it can become unmanageable
470:11 - although the carrier sense method of
470:13 - network transmission is not as efficient
470:16 - when the scale of the network is small
470:18 - as the number of nodes increases it
470:21 - becomes more efficient than the carrier
470:24 - detect method so let's talk about csmac
470:28 - CD or Carrier sense multiple access with
470:32 - Collision detection csmac CD of course
470:36 - uses the carrier sense method of network
470:39 - transmission every device on the network
470:42 - uses feedback from a receiver to
470:44 - determine if a carrier channel is
470:46 - present every device connected to the
470:49 - network has an equal opportunity to
470:51 - place a transmission on the carrier
470:53 - Channel That's the multiple access part
470:56 - of the name before placing a
470:59 - transmission on the carrier Channel a
471:01 - device will listen to the channel to
471:04 - determine if another node is
471:06 - transmitting if it detects a signal on
471:08 - the carrier channel the node will wait
471:11 - before attempting to transmit if no
471:13 - signal is detected the node is free to
471:16 - send if two devices send a transmission
471:19 - at the same time a collision between the
471:22 - Transmissions is possible sending
471:25 - devices will listen for transmission
471:27 - collisions if a collision is detected a
471:30 - jamming signal is sent informing all
471:33 - nodes that a collision has taken place
471:36 - all devices that receive the jamming
471:38 - signal will wait for a random amount of
471:40 - time before attempting to
471:43 - transmit now let's talk about CSM CA or
471:47 - Carrier sense multiple access with
471:50 - collision avoidance CS maaca operates in
471:54 - the same manner as csmac CD with one
471:58 - exception it uses a collision avoidance
472:01 - scheme through the use of a controlling
472:04 - device before attempting to send data a
472:07 - device will place a specific signal on
472:10 - the network called a request to send
472:13 - packet or RTS packet if no other device
472:17 - is utilizing the network the controlling
472:19 - device will respond with another
472:22 - specific signal called a clear to send
472:24 - packet or CTS packet once the sending
472:28 - device receives the CTS it knows it can
472:31 - send a transmission without a collision
472:34 - occurring csmac CD is better suited for
472:38 - high-speed High throughput networks and
472:41 - is the specified Network transmission
472:43 - standard for the
472:45 - 802.3 ethernet networking standard as it
472:49 - has a low amount of network overhead
472:52 - CSA is better suited for lower speed
472:56 - lower throughput types of networks where
472:59 - the possibility of data Collision is
473:01 - higher it is the specified standard for
473:05 - 802.3 wireless networks or Wi-Fi
473:08 - networks now that concludes this session
473:11 - on basic Network Concepts part two I
473:15 - began with network transmission Concepts
473:18 - and I concluded with a brief discussion
473:21 - on csmac CD and Cs
473:25 - maaca on behalf of pace it thank you for
473:28 - watching this session and I hope to do
473:30 - another one
473:36 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
473:40 - welcome to paace it session on basic
473:43 - Network Concepts part three today we're
473:46 - going to be talking about numbering
473:47 - systems and we will conclude with a very
473:51 - brief discussion on conversion tables
473:54 - with that let's go ahead and begin
473:57 - today's session of course I'm going to
474:00 - begin by talking about numbering systems
474:03 - while computer code and communication
474:05 - can get very complex it can also be
474:08 - broken down to a basic bit level a bit
474:12 - has one of two values it either has a
474:15 - value of zero or it has a value of one
474:20 - these values can be thought of as being
474:22 - either off which is a zero or on a one
474:27 - these bit values are actually the only
474:29 - information that Computing devices know
474:32 - by combining and adding different bits
474:35 - together computers can communicate with
474:37 - each other and programs can be created
474:40 - because of this technicians need to know
474:42 - how to work with binary or the base 2
474:45 - numbering system
474:47 - binary is a base 2 numbering system
474:50 - where each position has one of two basic
474:53 - values it is either a zero or a one it
474:57 - is written from right to left with the
475:00 - potential value of digits being doubled
475:02 - with each additional digit that's added
475:06 - if a zero is the placeholder it has a
475:08 - null value or no absolute value and if a
475:12 - one is present the actual value is
475:15 - double the potential value of of the
475:17 - digit to the right to derive the final
475:20 - value of a binary number add all of the
475:23 - potential values together and that will
475:25 - give you the decimal value of the binary
475:28 - number the binary numbering system is
475:31 - very important when dealing with
475:33 - computers and networking you should
475:35 - become comfortable with converting from
475:37 - decimal or base 10 values to Binary and
475:41 - from binary back to the decimal format
475:45 - if you need help with that there are
475:46 - multiple websites that can help one
475:49 - website that I recommend is
475:51 - mathisfun.com you can look on their
475:54 - website for their binary numbering
475:57 - lessons now let's talk about bit bite
476:00 - and nibble a bit is a single zero or one
476:04 - a bite is8 bits and it can also be
476:07 - referred to as an octet a nibble is half
476:11 - of a bite or four bits and these terms
476:15 - are used quite frequently when dealing
476:18 - with binary now let's talk about heximal
476:22 - heximal is a base 16 numbering system
476:26 - that uses the numbers 0 through 9 and
476:30 - then it uses the letters a through F to
476:33 - represent the values 10 through 15 it
476:36 - functions in the same manner as binary
476:39 - but with base 16 each hexadecimal digit
476:43 - has a potential binary value of 1 1 1 1
476:47 - or 15 and it can be referred to as a
476:51 - nibble as it's half of a bite a heximal
476:55 - number can often be recognized by the
476:57 - notation prefix of zero lowercase x
477:01 - which directly precedes the heximal
477:04 - number heximal is widely used in
477:08 - programming and networking along with
477:10 - binary some examples of binary and
477:13 - heximal use include ipv4 addresses which
477:18 - can be represented by a 32-bit binary
477:21 - number that is divided into four 8bit
477:24 - sets each 8bit set is equal to one BTE
477:28 - and is often called an octad an IPv6
477:32 - address which is a
477:34 - 128bit binary number is usually
477:37 - represented by hexadecimal and it is
477:40 - divided into eight two byte sets each
477:44 - set being separated by colons and I
477:47 - recommend that you watch my
477:49 - presentations on ipv4 and IPv6 to get a
477:53 - better understanding of how binary and
477:57 - hexadecimal are used in
477:59 - networking and now let's move on to
478:01 - conversion tables when working with
478:04 - binary and hexadecimal numbers I
478:07 - recommend creating a conversion table
478:10 - before doing the math I find it to be
478:13 - very useful when I need to convert from
478:16 - decimal to Binary or from heximal to
478:19 - binary to
478:30 - decimal now that concludes this session
478:33 - on basic Network Concepts part three I
478:36 - began by talking about numbering systems
478:39 - and I concluded with a very brief
478:42 - discussion on conversion tables on
478:45 - behalf of pace it thank you for watching
478:47 - this session and I hope to do another
478:49 - one
479:00 - soon hello I'm Brian Ferell and welcome
479:04 - to Pace it session on the introduction
479:06 - to wireless standards today I'm going to
479:09 - talk about CS MAA and then I'm going to
479:13 - conclude with a discussion on wireless
479:16 - standards there's a fair amount of
479:18 - ground to cover so let's go ahead and
479:20 - begin this session of course I'm going
479:23 - to begin by talking about CSM CA all
479:27 - Wireless ethernet standards employ an
479:30 - algorithm called carrier sense multiple
479:33 - access with collision avoidance that's
479:37 - csma CA a csma CA Network involves a
479:42 - method of transmission that avoids
479:44 - packet collisions once a wants to send a
479:47 - packet it listens to the carrier wave if
479:51 - no other node is transmitting it will
479:53 - then transmit if another node is
479:56 - transmitting it will wait a random
479:59 - amount of time and then listen to the
480:01 - carrier wave again to see if it's free
480:04 - to send this differs from a csmac CD
480:09 - which stands for Collision detection
480:11 - type of network which is all about how
480:13 - to transmit after a collision has
480:16 - occurred
480:17 - now let's talk about frequency
480:19 - modulation frequency modulation is the
480:22 - process used to encode data into a
480:25 - carrier wave 802.11 uses two main
480:29 - frequency modulation methods the first
480:31 - one is orthogonal frequency division
480:35 - multiplexing or
480:37 - ofdm ofdm is a frequency division
480:40 - multiplexing scheme that uses multiple
480:44 - subcarrier channels to carry data it is
480:47 - used to mitigate against attenuation
480:50 - which is loss of signal strength over
480:52 - distance and multi-path issues that
480:55 - exist in networking the other frequency
480:58 - modulation method is direct sequence
481:01 - spread Spectrum or
481:04 - dsss dsss is a modulation technique that
481:08 - uses spread Spectrum technology to
481:11 - affect data transfer it is used to
481:13 - mitigate the problem of multiple users
481:16 - on a channel and for Effective timing
481:20 - between the transmitter and the receiver
481:23 - now let's move on to the wireless
481:26 - standards Wireless networking standards
481:28 - are established by the
481:31 - 802.11 committee of The Institute of
481:34 - electrical and electronics Engineers or
481:37 - the i e quite often the term Wi-Fi is
481:41 - used to describe an 802.11 Network which
481:44 - is technically incorrect WiFi is
481:47 - actually a reference to the wifi
481:50 - Alliance which is responsible for
481:53 - certifying that wireless networking
481:55 - equipment actually meets the
481:57 - 802.11 standards Wi-Fi has become
482:01 - synonymous with the wireless local area
482:04 - network in the English language so don't
482:07 - be surprised if you find yourself using
482:09 - the term Wii when you really mean
482:14 - 802.11 now let's talk about the
482:16 - standards and first up is
482:20 - 802.11a it has a maximum speed of 54
482:23 - megabits per second and it operates on
482:26 - the 5 GHz frequency band it uses ofdm as
482:31 - its form of modulation and has a maximum
482:34 - distance of 150 ft 80211 a is compatible
482:39 - with 802.11 AC then there's
482:45 - 802.11b it has has a maximum speed of 11
482:48 - megabits per second and it operates on
482:51 - the 2.4 GHz frequency band 11b uses
482:56 - dsss as its technique for modulation it
483:00 - has a maximum distance of 300 ft and it
483:04 - is compatible with
483:06 - 802.11g and
483:09 - 802.11n now let's move on to
483:13 - 802.11g it has a maximum speed of 5 4
483:16 - megabits per second and it also operates
483:19 - on the 2.4 GHz frequency band 11g can
483:24 - use ofdm and dsss for its modulation
483:29 - techniques it has a maximum distance of
483:32 - 300 ft
483:34 - 802.11g is compatible with
483:37 - 802.11b and
483:41 - 802.11n now talking about
483:44 - 802.11n it has a max maximum speed of up
483:47 - to 600 megabits per second and it can
483:50 - operate on both the 2.4 and the 5 GHz
483:54 - frequency band it does use ofdm as its
483:58 - form of modulation it offers a maximum
484:01 - distance of 300 ft
484:04 - 802.11n is compatible with 11b 11g and
484:09 - 11 a with the introduction of
484:13 - 802.11n We Now find Mimo multiple input
484:17 - multiple output it's a technology that
484:20 - allows for the increase in speed for the
484:23 - wireless network with 11 in there can be
484:26 - up to four antennas which allow for up
484:29 - to four separate spatial streams and
484:32 - finally we have
484:34 - 802.11 AC now 802.11 AC offers speed
484:40 - anywhere from up to 433 megabits per
484:42 - second up to multiples of gigabits per
484:45 - second and it operates on the 5 GHz
484:49 - frequency band it uses ofdm as its
484:53 - method of modulation but its
484:55 - implementation is an advanced form of
484:59 - ofdm 11 AC offers a theoretical maximum
485:03 - distance of 300 ft 11ac can be
485:08 - compatible with 11a G or n when 802.11
485:13 - AC was introduced the improved the mimo
485:17 - technology which now allows for up to
485:19 - eight antennas which means that there
485:21 - can be up to eight separate spatial
485:24 - streams of data now that concludes this
485:27 - session on the introduction to wireless
485:30 - standards I began this discussion by
485:33 - talking about CSM CA and then I
485:36 - concluded with a brief discussion on the
485:38 - wireless standards on behalf of pace it
485:42 - thank you for watching this session and
485:44 - I hope you watch another one soon
485:49 - hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to
485:52 - pait's session on introduction to wired
485:55 - Network standards today I'm going to be
485:58 - discussing the Tia eia
486:01 - 568a and tia eia 568b standards then I'm
486:06 - going to move on to ethernet standards
486:09 - and I'm going to conclude with some
486:11 - other standards I have a whole lot of
486:14 - information to cover but not not a whole
486:16 - lot of time so let's dive into today's
486:20 - session of course I'm going to begin
486:22 - with the Tia eia
486:25 - 568a and
486:27 - 568b wired standards the Tia eia 568a
486:33 - and 568b standards deal with twisted
486:37 - pair wires these are the two cable
486:42 - pinout standards that are regulated by
486:44 - the Tia eia that the Telecommunications
486:47 - industry Association electronic
486:50 - Industries Alliance the pinout standard
486:53 - specify The Ordering of the wires to
486:56 - ensure that proper networking
486:57 - communication can take place the t568a
487:01 - standard is white green green white
487:04 - orange blue white blue orange white
487:07 - brown brown on the other hand the
487:10 - t568b standard is white orange orange
487:14 - white green blue white blue green white
487:17 - brown brown all modern ethernet networks
487:21 - that utilize unshielded twisted pair UTP
487:25 - or shielded twisted pair STP should use
487:29 - the Tia eia standards as a quick
487:33 - refresher for twisted pair wiring here
487:35 - are some common tools that you will need
487:38 - there are wire strippers these are used
487:40 - to remove the insulating jacket from the
487:42 - cable then there are crimping tools
487:45 - these are used to sec secure the wires
487:47 - into modular connectors then there are
487:50 - punchdown tools these are used to secure
487:52 - wires into punchdown blocks and finally
487:55 - there are cable testers these are used
487:58 - to test the Integrity of the network
488:01 - cables that you've just created with
488:03 - that covered let's move on to ethernet
488:07 - standards first up our distance
488:09 - limitations twisted pair copper wire is
488:12 - limited to 100 m without a repeater
488:16 - unless otherwise stated coaxial land
488:20 - cabling is limited to either
488:22 - 185 or 500 M depending upon the coaxial
488:27 - cable that is used as an example a
488:30 - 10base 2 coaxial Network uses RG58 and
488:35 - is limited to 185 m in length on the
488:38 - other hand a 10 base5 coaxial network
488:42 - using rg8 is limited to 500 m with fiber
488:47 - optics land transmission is limited by
488:49 - the cable type that is used the current
488:52 - maximum is over 40 km over a single mode
488:57 - optical fiber or SMF fiber now let's
489:00 - talk about twisted pair cable standards
489:04 - there's 10base T that's 10 megabits per
489:06 - second using UTP over a minimum of c 3
489:11 - cable then there's 100 Bas T that's 100
489:15 - megabits per per second using a minimum
489:18 - of cap 5 you can also have 100 Base TX
489:22 - this is 100 megabits per second
489:24 - networking using two pair over a minimum
489:27 - of cap 5 then there's 1,00 Base TX this
489:32 - is 1 gbits per second networking using
489:34 - two pair over a minimum of cap 5e cable
489:39 - then there's 10 gbas T that is 10 gbits
489:43 - per second networking using a minimum of
489:46 - cat 6 but it's only good for 40 m
489:49 - finally there's also 10 gbas T that's 10
489:53 - gigabits per second networking using a
489:56 - minimum of cat 6A cabling but that's
489:59 - good for up to 100 m now let's move on
490:03 - to the multiable standard and that's
490:06 - 1,000 base X under this standard there's
490:10 - 1,000 base SX which is 1 gbit per second
490:14 - networking over a short distance
490:16 - multimode fiber and it's usually less
490:20 - than 2 km then there's 1,000 base elx
490:24 - this is 1 gbits per second networking
490:26 - over long distance single mode fiber and
490:29 - it's usually a greater span than 2 km
490:33 - and finally there's 1,000 CX this is 1
490:37 - gbits per second networking over a
490:40 - coaxial cable that can be up to 25 M
490:43 - long now let's talk about 10 GB
490:46 - networking first up there's 10 gbas Sr
490:50 - over multimode fiber and it's good for
490:53 - up to 300 M then there's 10 gbas LR over
490:57 - single mode fiber which is good for up
491:00 - to 10 km then we have 10 gbas er which
491:05 - is over single mode fiber and it's good
491:07 - for up to 40 km then we have 10 gbas s
491:11 - SW this runs over MMF and it's good for
491:15 - up to 300 M and it's used on a wide area
491:18 - network then there's 10gb LW which runs
491:22 - over SMF up to 10 km and it's also used
491:27 - in a wide area network and then there's
491:29 - 10 gbas ew which runs over single mode
491:33 - fiber for up to 40 km and again on that
491:38 - Sonet type WAN network then there's 10
491:41 - gbas lx4 which runs over single mode
491:45 - fiber and it's good for up to 300 M then
491:48 - there is 10gbase lx4 over multim mode
491:53 - which is over multimode fiber which is
491:56 - good for up to 10 kilm and finally there
491:59 - is 10 gbas
492:02 - CX4 this runs over infinity band copper
492:05 - cabling and it's good for up to 15 M
492:09 - it's time to conclude with some other
492:13 - standards first up is Doc ACC are data
492:17 - over cable services interface
492:20 - specification these are the standards
492:22 - that have been established to provide
492:24 - the interface requirements for data
492:26 - Transmissions over a Broadband cable
492:29 - network to achieve the best performance
492:31 - when using Broadband cable the cable
492:34 - modem should meet the highest docis
492:37 - standard used by the cable provider the
492:40 - most current docus standard is 3.1 which
492:44 - allows for up to a theoretical maximum
492:47 - download speed of 10 gbits per second
492:51 - with a theoretical upload speed of 1
492:53 - gigabits per second then there's the I
492:57 - E1
492:59 - 1905.1
493:01 - d23 standard this is a standard that
493:04 - defines a network enabler or device that
493:08 - is used to create a convergent home
493:11 - networking environment that includes
493:13 - different types of wired and wireless
493:16 - networks the standard also includes
493:18 - ethernet over power line which is using
493:21 - the existing electrical wiring in a
493:23 - structure as the media to transport data
493:27 - the standard also includes ethernet over
493:30 - HDMI which is using an HDMI interface
493:34 - and cable to transport Network traffic
493:38 - now that concludes this session on the
493:40 - introduction to wired Network standards
493:43 - I began by talking about the Tia eiia
493:48 - 568a and 568b standards then I moved on
493:52 - to the ethernet standards and I
493:55 - concluded with a brief discussion on
493:57 - some other standards on behalf of pace
494:00 - it thank you for watching this session
494:03 - and I hope to do another one
494:14 - soon
494:17 - good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to
494:20 - pait's session on security policies and
494:24 - other documents today I'm going to be
494:26 - discussing some security policies and
494:29 - then I will conclude with a brief
494:31 - discussion on other documents there's a
494:34 - fair amount of ground to cover but not a
494:36 - whole lot of time so let's go ahead and
494:39 - begin this session of course I'm going
494:42 - to begin by discussing security policy
494:45 - policies policies are a set of
494:48 - guidelines established by management
494:51 - that are used to set the expected
494:53 - behavior in the workplace procedures are
494:56 - different than policies in that a
494:58 - procedure is a set of steps required to
495:01 - be taken in a given situation policies
495:04 - and procedures work hand inand to create
495:08 - a safe and secure work environment in
495:10 - which employees know the guidelines and
495:13 - what is expected of them policies and
495:16 - procedures should be given to every
495:18 - person on the day they start and
495:21 - periodic training should be conducted to
495:23 - ensure that they remain fresh in
495:25 - everyone's mind one of the security
495:28 - policies to consider is the consent to
495:31 - monitoring this is a policy that
495:34 - establishes an employer's right to
495:36 - monitor the employees actions and
495:40 - Communications this can include
495:42 - monitoring emails if they Traverse
495:45 - company equipment in any way then the
495:48 - emails are not considered private but
495:51 - are actually company assets that they
495:54 - have a right to view and do with as they
495:57 - please these consent to monitoring
496:00 - policies also include the monitoring or
496:03 - recording of phone conversations also
496:06 - monitoring activities on computers hard
496:09 - drives and phones in a highly secure
496:12 - work environment it may also include
496:15 - include the video monitoring and
496:17 - recording of normal work activities
496:20 - another security policy is a clean desk
496:23 - policy this is a policy that is
496:26 - concerned about the handling of
496:28 - sensitive data sensitive data should not
496:31 - be left unattended in a workplace and
496:33 - should be put away when not in use not
496:36 - left on a desktop these policies also
496:40 - include the computer desktop sensitive
496:43 - data should not be left left easily
496:46 - accessible on the PC then there are
496:49 - recording policies this is a policy that
496:52 - restricts the use of cameras tape
496:55 - recorders portable storage devices or
496:58 - any other device that may be used to
497:00 - record or a copy sensitive workplace
497:04 - information then there are equipment
497:06 - access policies there are a security
497:09 - policy that establishes who has access
497:12 - to which equipment and when these could
497:14 - incl include access to server rooms
497:17 - wiring closets Network racks or any
497:21 - other area that is deemed to have a
497:23 - security risk there are security
497:26 - policies that deal with the handling of
497:29 - user or customer information they're
497:31 - used to establish how to secure
497:34 - sensitive employee and customer
497:36 - information User and customer
497:38 - information is a major Target of hackers
497:41 - when they breach Computing systems the
497:44 - loss of control of this data can
497:47 - severely damage a company any policy
497:51 - that is used to help secure the
497:52 - workplace or company data is by default
497:56 - a security policy Approximately 80% of
498:00 - all Network and data breaches occur from
498:03 - within the companies that are attempting
498:06 - to secure the data sometimes they occur
498:08 - by mistake however all too often they
498:12 - are intentional all policies should have
498:15 - an enforcement aspect to them that
498:18 - details what employees should expect to
498:21 - happen if they violate the policy the
498:24 - range of actions can be from retraining
498:27 - to termination and
498:29 - prosecution now let's conclude with a
498:32 - brief discussion on some other
498:35 - documents first up is the AUP or
498:39 - acceptable use policy these are a set of
498:42 - rules and guidelines established by the
498:45 - Creator owner or administrator of
498:48 - information systems that detail what
498:51 - users may or may not do with that
498:55 - information system it is considered to
498:58 - be part of the security policy the AUP
499:02 - should be fairly detailed in what is
499:05 - allowed or not allowed to occur all
499:08 - users should be required to sign the
499:11 - acceptable use policy and these records
499:14 - should should be kept on file then there
499:17 - are network policy documents there are a
499:20 - broad range of policies that establish
499:23 - the guidelines for the network they
499:25 - include policies that control the use
499:27 - and operation of the network as well as
499:30 - policies on how to implement changes to
499:33 - it many security policies fall under the
499:37 - general Network policies category there
499:41 - are some standard business documents
499:43 - that you should be familiar with the
499:46 - first one is the memorandum of
499:48 - understanding or mou it's an agreement
499:52 - between two or more organizations that
499:55 - detail how those organizations are to
499:58 - undertake a common course of action anou
500:02 - is often used before a legally binding
500:05 - agreement has been created sometimes the
500:08 - mou is called a letter of intent or
500:13 - Loi then there is the the statement of
500:15 - work or the S so it's a detailed
500:19 - document that specifies what work is to
500:22 - be performed the expected outcome of the
500:25 - work or the deliverables of the work and
500:28 - the timelines to perform that work the S
500:31 - so plays an important role in project
500:35 - management documentation then there is
500:37 - the master license agreement or the MLA
500:41 - it's a legal agreement between two
500:44 - entities in which one agrees to pay the
500:46 - other for the use of a specific piece of
500:50 - software or a software package for a
500:54 - specific period of time so the person
500:57 - using the software doesn't actually own
501:00 - the software the Creator or the vendor
501:03 - retains the legal rights to that
501:06 - software or that software package and
501:09 - finally there's the service level
501:11 - agreement or the SLA it's an agreement
501:14 - that details the allowable amount of
501:17 - response time the vendor has to resolve
501:20 - an issue or problem the SLA is most
501:23 - commonly associated with a service
501:26 - contract now that concludes this session
501:29 - on security policies and other documents
501:33 - I briefly talked about security policies
501:35 - and then I concluded with a discussion
501:38 - on some other documents on behalf of
501:41 - pait thank you for watching this session
501:44 - and I hope to do another one
501:53 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
501:56 - welcome to Pace it session on
501:59 - introduction to safety practices part
502:01 - one today I'm going to be talking about
502:04 - electrical safety and then I'm going to
502:06 - move on to installation safety I have a
502:09 - fair amount of ground to cover but not a
502:12 - whole lot of time so let's go ahead and
502:14 - begin in this session of course I'm
502:17 - going to begin with electrical safety
502:20 - electrical grounding is used to protect
502:22 - technicians and equipment in the case of
502:25 - electrical insulation failure electrical
502:28 - grounding provides an alternate path for
502:31 - the electricity this is often referred
502:34 - to as a return to Earth all electrical
502:37 - systems should be connected to properly
502:40 - grounded circuits this helps to protect
502:43 - both the technician
502:45 - and the equipment then there's ESD or
502:48 - electrostatic discharge ESD is caused
502:51 - when two electrically charged objects
502:54 - that have different amounts of
502:55 - electrical charge come into contact
502:58 - creating a sudden flow of energy between
503:01 - the objects as they normalize the levels
503:04 - this is a static discharge ESD can
503:08 - damage sensitive components particularly
503:11 - the CPU and or your Random Access memory
503:15 - using an ESD mat helps to reduce the
503:19 - chances of ESD using an ESD strap will
503:23 - further reduce the chances for ESD the
503:27 - strap goes around the wrist of the
503:30 - technician and then is clipped to a
503:32 - ground Source usually to an exposed
503:35 - metal surface inside of a piece of
503:37 - equipment's case you should always
503:40 - practice self- grounding self- grounding
503:43 - is a normalization technique used to
503:46 - equalize the amount of electrical charge
503:48 - between the worker and the equipment
503:50 - being worked on after the case has been
503:53 - opened and the ESD strap is attached to
503:56 - a ground Source touch an exposed metal
503:59 - surface inside the case before actually
504:02 - touching any of the components this will
504:04 - normalize electrical charge between you
504:07 - and the equipment that you're working on
504:10 - in some cases additional equipment
504:12 - grounding may be necessary
504:15 - in case of an electrical fire unplug the
504:18 - power source or turn off the circuit
504:20 - breaker always use a Class C or
504:23 - multiclass fire extinguisher on
504:26 - electrical fires never use water you run
504:30 - the risk of
504:32 - electrocution and damaging that
504:34 - equipment even more than the fire is
504:37 - already doing so let's talk about fire
504:40 - suppression systems building codes often
504:43 - call for the install a of fire
504:45 - suppression systems and there are
504:47 - several different types of common
504:50 - systems there's the wet pipe the
504:53 - overhead pipes are pressurized and
504:55 - contain water all of the time then
504:58 - there's the dry pipe the pipes are not
505:01 - pressurized the water is contained in a
505:03 - holding tank until a fire breaks out and
505:06 - then it is pumped to the area where it
505:08 - needs to be dispersed there are
505:11 - pre-action types of fire suppression
505:13 - systems the they're similar to a dry
505:15 - pipe system but the sprinkler head
505:18 - contains a thermal fusible link that
505:21 - must melt before the water is released
505:24 - then there's the delug fire suppression
505:27 - system these are designed to release a
505:29 - large amount of water in a short amount
505:32 - of time into a predefined space the
505:36 - Deluge system is the least desirable
505:39 - option for electrical components on the
505:42 - other hand a Halon type system is the
505:45 - most desirable type of fire suppression
505:48 - system for electrical components Halon
505:51 - is a
505:53 - non-conducting volatile gaseous chemical
505:56 - it works by chemically disrupting the
505:59 - combustion process Halon does not leave
506:02 - a residue upon evaporation and unlike
506:06 - water Halon will not ruin electrical
506:09 - components it is safe for exposure to
506:12 - humans in limited amounts for a limited
506:15 - amount of time Halon is also
506:18 - environmentally safe it's also known as
506:21 - a clean agent now it's time to move on
506:25 - to installation Safety First up is using
506:30 - proper lifting techniques Bend at the
506:32 - knees not at the waist keep your head up
506:35 - when lifting avoid twisting when
506:38 - carrying items if the item is heavy or
506:41 - awkward request help in lifting it also
506:44 - remember most companies establish weight
506:47 - limitations so if you're going to lift
506:49 - something that is going to exceed that
506:51 - weight limitation ask for help more than
506:54 - likely you are going to need to install
506:57 - equipment racks at some point in time or
506:59 - another racks are used to help create a
507:02 - clean organized environment especially
507:05 - when they're used with proper cable
507:07 - management techniques racks are designed
507:10 - to provide sufficient airf flow for the
507:12 - electrical components that are placed in
507:15 - them when assembling and installing
507:17 - racks always follow the manufacturer's
507:20 - instructions always use the proper tools
507:23 - to prevent damaging the racks or the
507:25 - Fasteners that hold them together many
507:28 - servers and networking components come
507:31 - rack ready that means they're
507:32 - specifically designed to be placed into
507:35 - an equipment rack let's talk about rack
507:39 - placement when designing a room that is
507:41 - going to hold multiple racks of
507:43 - computing systems
507:44 - some thought needs to go into the
507:46 - placement of those racks HVAC and rack
507:50 - placement should be done concurrently
507:53 - heating ventilation and air conditioning
507:55 - systems should be designed to control
507:58 - both heat and humidity levels when
508:01 - multiple racks are going to be installed
508:03 - creating a hot Isle cold aisle design is
508:06 - recommended the hot aisle is the side of
508:09 - the aisle that receives the exhaust air
508:12 - flow from the Computing equipment this
508:14 - aisle should face an HVAC air intake the
508:19 - cold aisle is the side or aisle that the
508:21 - air intakes of the Computing equipment
508:24 - face this aisle should face an HVAC air
508:28 - vent also whenever possible a server
508:32 - room should be designed with a raised
508:34 - floor to help protect against water
508:36 - damage the raised floor like a drop
508:39 - ceiling can also be utilized as part of
508:42 - the cable management system system let's
508:45 - talk about tool safety always use the
508:48 - proper tool for the job that is what it
508:51 - was designed for do not use pencils as a
508:55 - probe it is possible for the pencil to
508:58 - conduct electricity leading to an ESD
509:01 - situation or shock hazard do not use
509:04 - magnetized tools when working on
509:06 - electrical components as the magnetic
509:09 - charge can be harmful to the
509:10 - magnetically kept data and that
509:13 - magnetically charged tool may damage
509:15 - sensitive components when using
509:18 - compressed air to blow out debris
509:20 - maintain a minimum distance of 4 in from
509:24 - the nozzle to the component always use
509:27 - isopropyl alcohol to clean products in
509:30 - place of rubbing alcohol rubbing alcohol
509:33 - contains a higher water content of
509:36 - approximately around 30% whereas the
509:39 - water content and isopropyl alcohol is
509:42 - lower never use a standard vacuum
509:45 - cleaner when vacuuming electrical
509:47 - components is necessary due to the
509:50 - design of the standard vacuum
509:51 - electrostatic discharges are a common
509:54 - occurrence there are specifically
509:57 - designed vacuum cleaners that can be
509:59 - used on electrical components now that
510:03 - concludes this session on the
510:05 - introduction to safety practices part
510:07 - one I talked about electrical safety and
510:11 - then I concluded with installation
510:13 - safety safety on behalf of pace it thank
510:16 - you for watching this session and I hope
510:18 - to do another one
510:25 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
510:29 - welcome to pait's session on the
510:31 - introduction to safety practices part
510:34 - two today I'm going to talk about the
510:36 - MSDS and then I'm going to conclude with
510:40 - some emergency preparations there's a
510:43 - fair amount of to cover so let's go
510:45 - ahead and begin this session of course
510:48 - I'm going to begin with the
510:51 - MSDS part of any Safety First approach
510:54 - to a safe work environment includes
510:57 - knowing what hazards are present in the
511:00 - workplace material safety data sheets or
511:04 - msdss contain safety information on
511:07 - materials and chemicals found in the
511:10 - workplace an MSDS will contain all known
511:14 - health issues associated with a
511:16 - particular material it also outlines
511:19 - what protective measures must be taken
511:22 - to reduce risks from exposure and what
511:25 - actions must be taken if the chemical is
511:28 - ingested the MSDS will also detail the
511:32 - physical properties of the material as
511:35 - in its flash point or boiling point and
511:38 - the MSDS will outline the proper steps
511:41 - to take when disposing of it each
511:44 - workplace will have its own set of
511:47 - msdss as each workplace is different it
511:51 - is your responsibility to understand the
511:53 - hazards that are present so you need to
511:56 - know where the msdss are kept for your
512:01 - workplace it's time to move on to some
512:04 - emergency
512:05 - preparations part of any Safety First
512:08 - approach to a safe work environment
512:10 - includes preparing for various types of
512:13 - emergencies
512:14 - these preparations should be detailed in
512:17 - a set of emergency procedure documents
512:20 - the procedures should contain Escape
512:22 - Routes including where employees will
512:24 - meet to ensure that all are accounted
512:27 - for information on what type or types of
512:30 - fire suppression systems are present as
512:33 - well as what steps have been taken to
512:36 - increase the day-to-day safety in the
512:40 - workplace there are some building layout
512:43 - consideration ations that concern
512:45 - emergency preparations all walls should
512:48 - have a minimum 2hour fire rating this is
512:52 - the amount of time it takes for the
512:54 - average fire to burn through the wall
512:57 - exterior doors and other secure doors
513:00 - must be designed to resist forcible
513:03 - entry but the doorways should also be
513:06 - designed to be able to handle the amount
513:08 - of expected traffic in an emergency fire
513:12 - suppression systems should be
513:14 - appropriate for the type of asset that
513:16 - they are protecting a wet pipe system is
513:19 - not appropriate for a server room or
513:22 - data center however a Halon system may
513:26 - not be the correct fire suppression
513:28 - system for an open cubical area backup
513:32 - power should also be incorporated into
513:34 - the building layout not all areas are
513:38 - going to require backup power but for
513:40 - some areas it is going to be essential
513:44 - emergency preparations need to include
513:47 - escape plans each area or room should
513:50 - have an Escape Plan map posted in a
513:53 - prominent area ideally by the main
513:56 - access doorway into that area this map
513:59 - needs to show the preferred route out of
514:02 - the facility the map should also include
514:05 - the meeting area outside of the danger
514:07 - zone this allows for supervisors or
514:10 - managers to account for all personnel
514:14 - safety or emergency exits should be
514:16 - clearly marked they should also be well
514:19 - lit with independent battery power
514:21 - sources they should be wide enough to
514:24 - handle the expected traffic and
514:26 - emergency exits should always be kept
514:29 - clear of
514:30 - obstructions talking about doors there
514:33 - are some other considerations are they
514:35 - going to be fail open or fail closed so
514:38 - what happens to doors with electronic
514:40 - locks when the power is out needs to be
514:43 - considered they could be fail closed
514:46 - type doors with this type of door when
514:48 - the power is cut the locks engage these
514:51 - are suitable for keeping secure areas
514:54 - secure in an emergency then there are
514:57 - fail open type electronic locks when the
515:00 - power is cut the locks disengage these
515:03 - are suitable for non-secure areas or for
515:07 - areas where two-way traffic is going to
515:09 - occur in an emergency in many facilities
515:12 - fail close closed type fire doors are
515:15 - used usually they're kept open by
515:18 - electromagnetics once the fire alarm has
515:20 - been tripped the power is cut to the
515:22 - magnets and the doors swing Clos they
515:26 - usually do not lock when closed but are
515:29 - used to help slow the spread of fire or
515:32 - other dangers another emergency
515:34 - preparation that should be considered
515:36 - are emergency alert systems all
515:39 - facilities should have an emergency
515:42 - alert system installed
515:44 - it is usually required by local building
515:46 - codes these are your fire alarms and
515:48 - whatnot combinations of sound and Light
515:51 - have proven to be highly effective in
515:54 - some situations it may be advisable to
515:57 - connect the facility to the National
516:00 - emergency alert system now that
516:03 - concludes this session on introduction
516:05 - to safety practices part two I began
516:09 - with the MSDS and then I concluded with
516:12 - emergency
516:14 - preparations on behalf of pace it thank
516:17 - you for watching this session and I hope
516:19 - to do another one
516:27 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
516:31 - welcome to pait's session on rack and
516:34 - power management today I'm going to talk
516:37 - about rack management and then I'm going
516:39 - to conclude with a brief segment on
516:41 - power management with with that let's go
516:44 - ahead and begin today's session I'm
516:47 - going to begin by talking about rack
516:50 - management rack systems are specially
516:53 - designed racks used to hold networking
516:55 - and Computing equipment sometimes they
516:58 - are referred to as server racks these
517:02 - rack systems follow one of several
517:05 - different designs however they all
517:08 - follow the same height
517:10 - specification that specification is the
517:13 - standard unit and it's designated by the
517:16 - capital letter U now the standard unit
517:19 - involves the amount of vertical space
517:21 - that can be used to hold equipment a
517:24 - standard unit is equal to
517:27 - 1.75 in so a 15 U rack has 26 and 1/4 in
517:34 - of vertical storage space most rack
517:37 - servers and Enterprise level networking
517:40 - equipment are designed to fit within r
517:43 - rack systems there are several different
517:46 - types of racks racks are normally either
517:49 - two poost or four poost racks they may
517:52 - be freestanding or they may be floor
517:56 - mounted server rail racks have slide
517:59 - mounts to make it easy to pull out
518:01 - servers to perform necessary maintenance
518:04 - now let's talk about device placement
518:07 - devices that generate the most amount of
518:10 - heat or are not heat sensitive should be
518:13 - be placed towards the top of the rack
518:16 - devices that generate the least amount
518:18 - of heat or are heat sensitive should be
518:21 - placed toward the bottom of the rack all
518:25 - equipment cold air intakes should face
518:28 - the same direction all equipment exhaust
518:31 - Outlets should therefore also face the
518:34 - same direction when mounting equipment
518:36 - in racks vertical space should be left
518:39 - between the equipment to promote
518:41 - adequate air flow when when multiple
518:43 - rows of racks are implemented a hot Isle
518:46 - cold Isis approach should be used to
518:49 - promote proper air flow and cooling
518:53 - racks should be monitored for
518:54 - environmental factors to help ensure the
518:57 - health of the servers and other
518:58 - equipment monitor should be in place for
519:01 - temperature humidity vibration water
519:05 - leaks smoke and intrusion and that
519:08 - brings us to Rack security most rack
519:11 - systems do not come with rack Security
519:14 - in mind but it can be easily added after
519:18 - rack installation rack doors can be
519:20 - added that have either keyed or
519:23 - electronic locks if the equipment is not
519:25 - secured it can be easily stolen now
519:29 - let's have a brief discussion on power
519:33 - management so before I begin talking
519:35 - about power management let me give you a
519:38 - little bit of trivia we're all familiar
519:41 - with the power symbol that you see there
519:43 - to the right that's actually a binary
519:47 - symbol what that is is a zero with a one
519:50 - poking through it I knowe not very
519:53 - relevant to today's discussion but it's
519:56 - an interesting bit of trivia Now power
519:59 - is often overlooked when designing a
520:01 - network however without power management
520:04 - the network may never work properly most
520:08 - people assume that when they plug a
520:10 - piece of equipment into a wall socket
520:12 - that that piece of equipment is going to
520:14 - power up just fine in most cases they
520:17 - are correct however if the circuit
520:20 - cannot provide enough amps to the
520:22 - equipment damage may occur it is
520:25 - important to know the power requirements
520:27 - and loads for all of the equipment that
520:30 - will be in place this helps to ensure
520:33 - that the proper electrical circuits are
520:35 - installed so that sufficient power is
520:38 - delivered where it is needed when it is
520:42 - needed power converters convert
520:44 - electrical energy from one form to
520:47 - another as in from AC to DC or from one
520:51 - voltage level to another on the other
520:54 - hand power inverters are a type of power
520:58 - converter that specifically converts
521:01 - voltages from DC to AC then we have the
521:06 - uninterruptable power supply the UPS it
521:10 - uses power converters to rece receive
521:13 - electrical current from an AC electrical
521:16 - source and it passes that current to a
521:19 - battery or set of batteries for storage
521:22 - it then uses a power inverter to receive
521:26 - DC current from the batteries and pass
521:28 - it to another device as a conditioned
521:32 - and well regulated AC flow they're used
521:35 - to provide a steady stream of
521:38 - conditioned electrical power to
521:40 - components they help to protect sens of
521:43 - electrical components from Power
521:45 - anomalies either from Power spikes power
521:48 - outs or from Power sags in some cases
521:52 - you may want to consider installing
521:54 - power redundancies critical components
521:57 - should include redundant power supplies
522:01 - that means that if one power supply
522:03 - fails the other one takes over
522:05 - immediately without any loss of service
522:09 - now that concludes this session on rack
522:12 - and Power Man management I began by
522:14 - talking briefly about rack management
522:17 - and then I concluded with a brief
522:19 - discussion on power management on behalf
522:22 - of pace it thank you for watching this
522:24 - session and I hope you watch another one
522:34 - soon good day I'm Brian F and welcome to
522:38 - pait's session on cable management today
522:41 - I'm going to be talking about cable
522:44 - distribution and then I will conclude
522:46 - with some cable management components we
522:49 - have a fair amount of ground to cover
522:51 - with not a whole lot of time so let's go
522:54 - ahead and begin this session of course
522:57 - I'm going to begin by talking about
522:59 - cable
523:00 - distribution and the first item under
523:03 - cable distribution is the main
523:05 - distribution frame or MDF this is the
523:08 - location where the dmark DeMark
523:11 - extension Main switch or router in patch
523:14 - panel are placed the MDF is where
523:17 - outside traffic ERS a location and is
523:20 - then distributed to the internal Network
523:24 - it is possible to also have an
523:26 - intermediate distribution frame or IDF
523:30 - it's a location solution for when a
523:32 - single MDF is not sufficient they
523:35 - usually occur in multistory buildings
523:38 - the idfs are connected to the MDF by
523:42 - vertical cross-connect cables or VCC
523:45 - cables it is common for an MDF to
523:48 - contain separate IDF panels for each
523:51 - floor of a building a vertical cross
523:54 - connect is the main patch panel for a
523:57 - location it usually resides in the same
524:00 - location or very close to the Demar and
524:03 - Main switch or router I mentioned patch
524:07 - panels earlier so let's talk about those
524:10 - they're used to terminate network cable
524:12 - runs usually within a building as in
524:15 - from the wall jacks to a central
524:17 - location the network runs are called
524:20 - horizontal cabling patch panels are used
524:23 - to organize and administer the physical
524:26 - aspects of the network cables network
524:29 - runs are punched down to the back of the
524:32 - patch panel which normally contains
524:34 - either a 66 or 110 block with an
524:38 - Associated port on the front of the
524:40 - patch panel patch cables are used to
524:43 - connect the patch panel ports to
524:45 - networking gear quite often a switch
524:49 - workstations connect to the patch panel
524:52 - using horizontal cabling this location
524:55 - is called the horizontal cross connect
524:57 - or HCC and is usually located in the IDF
525:02 - switches may or may not be present in
525:05 - this location if a workstation needs to
525:08 - be relocated to a different switch or
525:10 - Port all that needs to be done is to
525:13 - make the change in the location of the
525:15 - patch panel so you unplug the cable from
525:18 - one port and you plug it into a new port
525:22 - with that covered let's talk about Cable
525:24 - Management
525:25 - components labeling is an important part
525:28 - of cable management it can cause stress
525:31 - when working with networks but it
525:33 - doesn't have to the key to proper
525:36 - labeling is to create a naming
525:38 - convention which is a systematic and
525:40 - consistent method that makes sense for
525:43 - the situation proper labeling will ease
525:47 - the management of the physical aspects
525:49 - of the network especially when dealing
525:51 - with cables labels should be placed on
525:54 - everything that deals with the network
525:57 - beginning from the wall jacks all the
525:59 - way through to the patch panel switches
526:01 - and routers the naming convention should
526:04 - be documented and kept with the network
526:07 - diagrams let me give you an example of a
526:10 - naming convention suppose office 219 has
526:14 - Network outlets on all four walls the
526:17 - Jacks could be labeled 219 n 219 W Etc
526:23 - and that would be for 219 North or 219
526:26 - West Etc the horizontal cabling from 219
526:30 - feeds into a patch panel in an IDF
526:33 - located on the second floor that
526:35 - contains two 48 Port switches that tie
526:39 - in all the horizontal cross connects the
526:42 - cable coming in from Office 219 to the
526:45 - patch panel could be labeled 219 W or
526:49 - 219s etc etc as it relates to their
526:53 - location in the office the switches
526:55 - could be labeled s SW 2A and S SW 2B now
527:00 - suppose that the patch cables for office
527:03 - 219 connect to switch 2bs ports 20
527:06 - through 24 the patch cables could be
527:09 - labeled 219 n-
527:13 - s sw2
527:15 - B-21 or 219 e- s sw2
527:21 - b-22 etc etc the key is to be consistent
527:25 - and to document
527:27 - everything and finally there are cable
527:30 - trays masses of cables can block air
527:33 - flow and act as an insulator that allows
527:35 - for excessive heat to build up cable
527:39 - trays are used to organize cabling and
527:41 - to keep it away from areas where cabling
527:44 - may cause heat to build up cable trays
527:47 - keep bundles of cables neat and fairly
527:50 - well
527:51 - organized that concludes this session on
527:54 - cable management I talked about cable
527:57 - distribution and then I briefly covered
527:59 - some cable management components on
528:02 - behalf of pace it thank you for watching
528:05 - this session and I hope to do another
528:07 - one
528:11 - soon
528:17 - good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to
528:20 - pacit session on the basics of change
528:23 - management today we're going to be
528:25 - talking about the reasons for change
528:27 - management and then we're going to
528:29 - conclude with some different change
528:31 - management processes I have a fair
528:34 - amount of ground to cover but not a
528:36 - whole lot of time so let's go ahead and
528:38 - begin this session of course I'm going
528:41 - to begin with the reason for change
528:44 - management in a fairly simple Network it
528:47 - is fairly easy to evaluate not only the
528:50 - necessity for a change but also the
528:53 - possible impacts of that change however
528:56 - as the network system increases in size
528:59 - and complexity it becomes more difficult
529:02 - to not only determine what changes are
529:05 - necessary but also the possible impacts
529:08 - that the proposed changes will have on
529:11 - the system as a whole it is quite
529:14 - possible even highly probable that a
529:17 - single change will have a ripple effect
529:20 - on the whole system change management
529:23 - processes are used to introduce changes
529:25 - to a system in a controlled manner to
529:28 - minimize possible disruption and
529:30 - potential
529:32 - pandemonium with the reason for change
529:34 - management covered let's move on to
529:37 - different change management
529:39 - processes first up is document the
529:42 - reason for a change proposed changes
529:45 - should have a solid reason for occurring
529:48 - a best practice is to include why the
529:50 - change is needed for it reasons and also
529:54 - for business reasons as the change
529:56 - proceeds through the process more
529:59 - documentation may be added to the reason
530:02 - for a change so let's talk about the
530:04 - change request a formal change request
530:08 - procedure is used during the approval
530:10 - process and should include several other
530:13 - subdocuments that can be used to gain
530:16 - approval one of those documents is the
530:18 - configuration procedures documents these
530:22 - document the exact steps required to
530:24 - implement the change including affected
530:26 - devices applications and processes the
530:30 - change request should also include a
530:33 - roll back process as all change carries
530:36 - risk a plan to reverse changes is
530:39 - required in order to gain approval then
530:42 - there are potential impact documents the
530:45 - potential impact documents are a good
530:47 - faith effort to identify all possible
530:50 - impacts to the overall system both the
530:53 - positive and the negative then there is
530:56 - the notification procedures after the
530:59 - potential impacts have been identified
531:01 - the people responsible for the affected
531:04 - systems must receive notification of the
531:07 - proposed change keeping your
531:09 - stakeholders informed and involved will
531:13 - greatly increase the chances of a
531:15 - successful change let's talk about
531:18 - approval processes proposed changes
531:21 - should be vetted and approved not only
531:23 - by management but also by senior IT
531:26 - personnel Security Experts and by a
531:29 - selection of those affected by the
531:32 - change some companies create Change
531:34 - Control boards to not only evaluate
531:37 - proposed changes but to also Implement a
531:40 - means of approving changes these boards
531:43 - also assure that all approved changes
531:46 - have been fully tested and documented
531:49 - the change boards meet periodically to
531:51 - assess the status of an approved change
531:54 - this helps to keep it on track for
531:57 - implementation change boards maintain
531:59 - responsibility for the change and verify
532:02 - that the process is proceeding according
532:05 - to the configuration procedure and
532:08 - finally change boards help to ensure
532:10 - that approved changes are are
532:12 - implemented correctly when planning out
532:15 - a change to an IT system it's important
532:18 - to involve a maintenance window
532:20 - procedure a maintenance window is the
532:22 - amount of time that a system will be
532:24 - down or unavailable during the proposed
532:27 - change before the final schedule is
532:29 - developed an evaluation of all affected
532:32 - systems must be performed with
532:35 - particular attention paid to Mission
532:37 - critical systems it is possible that the
532:40 - proposed maintenance window May exceed
532:42 - the allowable downtime for critical
532:44 - systems which will affect when the
532:47 - maintenance window can be scheduled a
532:50 - subprocedure to the maintenance window
532:52 - procedure is authorized downtime once a
532:55 - maintenance window has been identified
532:57 - it is then possible to determine the
532:59 - optimum time to implement the change in
533:03 - many cases system changes need to occur
533:05 - during off hours as in after the close
533:08 - of business or during weekends when
533:11 - systems are not not utilized as much
533:14 - then there's the notification of change
533:16 - procedure after a sufficient time has
533:18 - elapsed in which to evaluate any issues
533:22 - all stakeholders those are the people
533:24 - who approved the change and all others
533:26 - affected by the change should be
533:28 - notified of the successful completion of
533:31 - the change this allows the stakeholders
533:34 - to further monitor the systems for any
533:37 - unforeseen or residual issues relating
533:40 - to the change and finally there's final
533:43 - documentation the change process should
533:46 - end with an update to the appropriate
533:49 - documentation including Network
533:52 - configurations additions to the network
533:54 - and physical location changes a closing
533:58 - Change Report should also be created
534:00 - that summarizes the change to help
534:02 - refine the change procedures and
534:05 - processes even further this closing
534:08 - report should include what went right
534:10 - and what went wrong during the the
534:12 - approved change that concludes this
534:15 - session on the basics of change
534:18 - management I talked about the reasons
534:20 - for change management and then I
534:22 - concluded with different change
534:25 - management processes on behalf of pait
534:29 - thank you for watching this session and
534:30 - I hope to do another one
534:35 - soon good day I'm Brian frell and
534:38 - welcome to pait's session on common
534:42 - networking protocols part one today I'm
534:45 - going to briefly discuss TCP and UDP and
534:48 - then I'm going to briefly run through
534:51 - some common ports and protocols with
534:54 - that let's go ahead and begin this
534:56 - session let's begin with a brief
534:59 - overview of TCP and
535:02 - UDP both transmission control protocol
535:05 - and user datagram protocol are both
535:08 - transport layer or layer 4 protocols the
535:11 - they're both responsible for the
535:13 - delivery of network data between nodes
535:17 - while they are both layer 4 protocols
535:19 - they do have some differences TCP uses a
535:23 - reliable delivery method this ensures
535:26 - that all the packets that are sent are
535:29 - received it uses acknowledgements as a
535:32 - means of error correction TCP also
535:35 - establishes flow control to reduce the
535:39 - error rate and ensure proper delivery on
535:42 - the other hand UDP uses a best effort
535:45 - delivery method it sends data but
535:48 - doesn't care if the packets are all
535:50 - received there is no error correction
535:53 - and with UDP speed and low Network
535:56 - overhead are the major concerns not the
536:00 - reliable delivery of the
536:02 - information now let's discuss some
536:05 - common ports and
536:07 - protocols first up is HTTP that's
536:10 - hypertext trans transfer protocol it's
536:13 - the primary protocol used to transfer
536:15 - data over the Internet it is assigned to
536:19 - Port 80 then there's
536:21 - https which is hyper text transfer
536:24 - protocol secure it is the primary
536:27 - protocol to securely transfer data over
536:30 - the internet using SSL or TLS technology
536:35 - that's secure socket layer or transport
536:37 - layer security technology in actuality
536:41 - as SSL should no longer be used you
536:44 - should only be using TLS by default
536:48 - https is assigned to Port
536:51 - 443 then there's net bios that's Network
536:55 - basic input output system this was
536:58 - originally developed to allow hosts to
537:01 - be able to communicate with servers by
537:04 - default it's assigned to Ports 137
537:06 - through
537:08 - 139 then we have SMTP or simp simple
537:11 - mail transfer protocol this is the
537:14 - protocol that's used to transfer email
537:16 - from a client to an email server or to
537:19 - transfer email between different email
537:22 - servers by default it's assigned to Port
537:25 - 25 post office protocol version 3 or pop
537:29 - 3 is the protocol used by clients to
537:32 - retrieve email from servers once engaged
537:36 - POP 3 downloads all the messages from
537:38 - the servers the user cannot access email
537:41 - messages until they have been downloaded
537:44 - by the pop 3 protocol POP 3 is assigned
537:48 - to Port 1110 in contrast to pop 3 is
537:53 - IMAP that's internet message access
537:56 - protocol it's a protocol used by clients
537:59 - to access email on email servers allows
538:02 - the client to administer and organize
538:05 - email on the server into folders without
538:08 - having to download it first by default
538:11 - IMAP is assigned to Port
538:15 - 143 next up is sip or session initiation
538:19 - protocol it's a protocol that is most
538:21 - commonly used to set up and tear down
538:25 - multimedia communication sessions as in
538:28 - voice over IP in a voice over IP session
538:32 - sip is used to establish and determinate
538:35 - the session session initiation protocol
538:39 - is commonly assigned to either port 560
538:42 - or to Port
538:44 - 561 often used in conjunction with
538:47 - session initiation protocol is RTP
538:50 - that's realtime transport protocol this
538:54 - is the protocol that is commonly used to
538:56 - format and deliver multimedia or
538:59 - streaming content as an example RTP
539:03 - handles the flow of packets in a voice
539:05 - over IP session after session initiation
539:09 - protocol has established the connection
539:12 - RTP is commonly assigned to Ports
539:15 - 504 and to Port
539:19 - 505 then there's media Gateway control
539:22 - protocol or
539:23 - mgcp it's a protocol that defines a
539:26 - means of communication between a packet
539:29 - switched Network and a circuit switched
539:31 - Network as in the pstn it can be used to
539:35 - set up and maintain and terminate calls
539:39 - between multiple endpoints as and
539:42 - teleconferencing it's commonly assigned
539:44 - to Ports
539:46 - 2427 and or to Port
539:50 - 2727 last up we have
539:53 - h323 this is a protocol that provides a
539:56 - standard for delivering video over IP
539:59 - networks it defines how realtime audio
540:02 - video and data are to be transmitted it
540:05 - provides signaling and bandwidth control
540:09 - it's commonly assigned to Port
540:12 - 1720 that concludes this session on
540:15 - common networking protocols part one I
540:18 - did a brief summary of TCP and UDP and
540:22 - then I briefly ran through some common
540:25 - ports and protocols on behalf of pace it
540:28 - thank you for watching this session and
540:30 - I hope you watch another one
540:38 - soon hello I'm Brian frell
540:41 - welcome to pait's session on common
540:44 - networking protocols part two today I'm
540:48 - going to be talking about the difference
540:49 - between ports and protocols and then I'm
540:52 - going to conclude with a brief
540:54 - discussion on some common ports and
540:57 - protocols with that let's go ahead and
541:00 - jump into this session of course I'm
541:03 - going to begin by talking about the
541:05 - difference between ports and
541:07 - protocols ports are a method of
541:10 - specifying what protocol our service to
541:13 - access many protocols and services use
541:16 - default ports so they are easy to locate
541:20 - there are
541:22 - 65,536 ports available to be used for
541:25 - communication but Port zero is reserved
541:29 - the first
541:30 - 10,24 ports are specifically assigned
541:34 - and are called welln ports if you would
541:36 - like to learn more about those you can
541:39 - check out the.org or website ports can
541:43 - be thought of as a phone number
541:45 - extension the IP address is the main
541:48 - number you are trying to reach the port
541:51 - is the extension for the service or
541:53 - protocol that you want to access
541:56 - protocols can be thought of as the
541:59 - language that two applications on either
542:01 - side of the connection agree to speak
542:04 - protocols translate requests into
542:07 - Services most protocols use predefined
542:10 - port but some protocols must be user
542:14 - configured for the ports that they use
542:17 - something to remember ports are not
542:19 - protocols and Protocols are not ports
542:23 - even though the two are closely
542:25 - associated they are not the same ports
542:28 - are used to request or access services
542:31 - or applications Protocols are the
542:34 - services or applications that are being
542:37 - requested when a requestor seeks to
542:40 - connect to a specific specific Port the
542:42 - requestor is dynamically assigned a port
542:45 - number to listen to for the response
542:48 - this also allows computers to have many
542:51 - concurrent connections at the same time
542:55 - it's time to move on to a brief
542:57 - discussion on common ports and
543:00 - protocols first up is the file transfer
543:03 - protocol or FTP it's a standard protocol
543:07 - for transferring files between Computing
543:09 - systems and it it does require user
543:13 - authentication FTP uses ports 20 and 21
543:18 - although nowadays it mostly just uses
543:21 - Port 20 then there's tftp or trivial
543:25 - file transfer protocol this is used to
543:28 - transfer files between servers and
543:30 - clients but no user authentication is
543:34 - required by default tftp is assigned to
543:38 - Port 69 then there's s nmp or simple
543:42 - Network management protocol it's a
543:45 - protocol used to Monitor and manage
543:47 - local area networks by default it is
543:50 - assigned to Port
543:52 - 161 then we have tnet which is a
543:55 - protocol that is used for remote access
543:58 - to systems it is unsecure but it is also
544:02 - a bidirectional terminal service that
544:04 - comes in handy on occasion by default
544:07 - telnet uses Port 23 more secure than
544:11 - tnet is SSH or secure shell it's a
544:15 - protocol that's used to encrypt data
544:17 - traffic on networks it can be used in
544:20 - place of telet to provide a secure
544:23 - bidirectional terminal Connection by
544:26 - default SSH uses Port 22 a very useful
544:31 - protocol to have is DNS or the domain
544:34 - name system protocol this is the
544:37 - protocol that's used to map computer
544:39 - names to their IPs addresses DNS is
544:42 - assigned to Port 53 by default then
544:47 - there's DHCP or dynamic host
544:49 - configuration protocol this is the
544:52 - protocol used within networks to
544:54 - automatically configure computers with
544:57 - the correct IP configuration there are
545:00 - two ports used with
545:02 - DHCP requests are assigned to Port
545:06 - 67 responses from the DHCP server are
545:10 - ass assigned to Port 68 remote desktop
545:14 - protocol or RDP is used in Microsoft
545:17 - networks by both the remote desktop
545:20 - connection and remote assistance
545:22 - applications to make remote connections
545:26 - RDP is assigned to Port
545:30 - 3389 last up we have SMB or server
545:33 - message Block it's a protocol used to
545:36 - transfer files over a network the
545:39 - process is transparent to the user the
545:41 - user never sees SMB SMB can be
545:45 - configured to run over net bios on ports
545:49 - 137 through Port 139 but by default SMB
545:54 - is assigned to Port 400 and
545:57 - 45 that concludes this session on common
546:01 - networking protocols part two today I
546:04 - talked about the differences between
546:06 - ports and protocols and then I briefly
546:09 - discussed some common ports and
546:11 - protocols on behalf of pace it thank you
546:14 - for watching this session and I hope to
546:17 - do another one
546:39 - soon

Cleaned transcript:

hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on the introduction to network devices part one today we're going to be talking about layer one devices layer 2 devices and then we're going to conclude with layer three devices there's a fair amount of information to cover so let's go ahead and dive in into this session of course I'm going to begin with layer one devices well before I start talking about the layer one devices we need to talk about the Open System interconnection model The OSI model it was developed as a way to help disparate Computing systems to communicate with each other the OSI reference model has seven layers layer one is the physical layer Layer Two two is data link Layer Three is Network layer four is transport layer five is session layer six is presentation and layer seven is application we're going to be discussing the bottom three layers layers one two and three today now most devices do function at more than one layer of the OSI reference model but when it comes time to determining where they fit into the model you must first determine the highest level at which they operate because that's where they fit into the OSI model to do that you must know what they do and how that relates to the OSI model and with that let's talk about analog modems the word modem is actually derived from contraction of modulator demodulator modems were developed to take a digital signal coming from a digital node and convert it to an analog signal modulating the signal and placing it on a wire in return it would accept an analog signal from The Wire and convert it demodulating the signal back to a digital signal that the node can understand modems were developed to create a connection between Network segments via the public switched telephone network using the plain old telephone system now modem provide for a single connection to a network and they're only concerned about the wire and the wire resides on the physical layer layer one of the OSI model it doesn't care where the signal comes from it just does its job then there's the Hub a hub functions as a concentrator or repeater in that it doesn't care where the signal comes from or where the signal is going kind of like the modem it takes an electrical signal that arrives on a port and replicates that signal out all of its other ports a hub may have just a few ports or it may have many ports and for a variety of reasons The Hub is not very common anymore in the modern Network so now let's move on to Layer Two devices the first layer 2 device that we're going to talk about is the switch a switch you I izes an application specific integrated circuit chip an Asic chip the Asic chip has specific programming that allows the switch to learn when a device is on the network and which ports it is connected to Via that devic's layer 2 Mac address that's what makes a switch a layer 2 device a switch may have just a few ports or it may have Min ports kind of like the Hub and although a switch is smarter than a hub it can still be very simple or it can be highly complex and programmable a switch can only communicate with local network devices another layer 2 device that we need to talk about are wireless access points the WAP a WAP is a specific type of network bridge that connects or Bridges wireless network segments with wired Network segments the most common type of WAP Bridges an 802.11 wireless network segment with an 802.3 Ethernet Network segment just like a switch a wireless access point will only communicate with local network devices now let's move on to layer three devices and first up is the multilayer switch a multilayer switch provides normal layer 2 Network switching services but it will also provide layer three or higher OSI model Services the most common multilayer switch is a layer three switch it not only utilizes an Asic chip for switching but that Asic chip is also programmed to handle routing functions this allows the device to communicate and pass data to nonlocal network devices a multilayer switch is a highly programmable and complex Network device a multilayer switch may have just a few ports or it may have a lot of ports they're not very common in the small office home office Network because they're really really expensive you're more likely to find them in an Enterprise local area Network now let's move on to the router a router is the most common Network device for connecting different networks together utilizing the OSI models layer three logical Network information that's what makes a router a layer 3 device the router uses software programming for decision making as compared to the switch's use of an ASAC chip the router uses this programming to keep track of different networks and what it considers to be the best possible route to reach those networks a router can communicate with both local and nonlocal network devices in most cases a router will have fewer ports than a switch now that concludes this session on the introduction to network devices part one we talked about layer one devices we talked about layer 2 devices and we concluded with a couple of layer three devices now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm pretty certain I'll do another one good day I'm Brian Ferell and welcome to Pace's session on introduction to network devices part two today we're going to discuss some security network devices and then we'll move on to some optimization and performance devices and with that let's go ahead and begin this session and we will Begin by talking about security devices first up is the firewall now a firewall can be placed on routers or hosts in that it can be software based or it can be its own device a firewall functions at multiple layers of the OSI model specifically at layers 2 3 4 and 7 a firewall can block packets from entering or leaving the network and it does this through one of two methods it can do it through stateless inspection in which the firewall will examine every packet that enters or leaves the networks against a set of rules once the packet matches a rule the rule is enforced and the specified action is taken or it may use State full inspection this is when a firewall will only examine the state of a connection between networks specifically when a connection is made from an internal Network to an external network the firewall will not examine any packets returning from the external connection it only cares about the state of the connection as a general rule external connections are not allowed to be initiated with the internal Network now firewalls are the first line of defense in protecting the internal network from outside threats you can consider the firewall to be the police force of the network then there is the intrusion detection system the IDS an IDs is a passive system designed to identify when a network breach or attack against the network is occurring they're usually designed to inform a network administrator when a breach or attack has occurred and it does this through log files text messages and or through email notifications an IDs cannot prevent or stop a breach or attack on on its own the IDS receives a copy of all traffic and evaluates it against a set of Standards the standards that it used may be signaturebased this is when it evaluates Network traffic for known malware or attack signatures or the standard may be anomaly based this is where it evaluates Network traffic for suspicious changes or it may be policy based this is where it evaluates networ traffic against a specific declared security policy an IDs may be deployed at the host level when it's deployed at the host level it's called a host based intrusion detection system or heads more potent than the intrusion detection system is the intrusion prevention system the IPS an IPS is an active system designed to stop a breach or attack from succeeding in damaging the network they're usually designed to perform an action or set of actions to stop the malicious activity they will also inform a network administrator through the use of log files SMS text messaging and or through email notification for an IPS to work all traffic on the network segment needs to flow through the IPS as it enters and leaves the network segment like the IDS all of the traffic is evaluated against a set of standards and they're the same standards that are used on the IDS the best placement on the network segment is between a router with a firewall hopefully and the destination Network segment that way all the traffic flows through the IPS ipss are programed programmed to make an active response to the situation they can block the offending IP address they can close down vulnerable interfaces they can terminate Network sessions they can redirect the attack plus there are more actions that an IPS can take the main thing is is that they are designed to be active to stop the breach or attack from succeeding and damaging your network let's move move on to the virtual private Network concentrator the VPN concentrator now this will allow for many secure VPN connections to a network the concentrator will provide proper tunneling and encryption depending upon the type of VPN connection that is allowed to the network most concentrators can function at multiple layers of the OSI model specifically they can operate at layer 2 layer three and layer 7 now outside of Internet transactions which use an SSL VPN connection at layer 7 most concentrators will function at the network layer or layer three of the OSI model providing IP SEC encryption through a secure tunnel now let's talk about optimization and performance devices we will begin by talking about the load balancer a load balancer may also be called a Content switch or content filter it's a network appliance that is used to load balance between multiple hosts that contain the same data this spreads out the workload for greater efficiency they're commonly used to distribute the requests or workload to a server Farm among the various ser servers in the farm helping to ensure that no single server gets overloaded with work requests then there's the proxy server a proxy server is an appliance that requests resources on behalf of a client machine it's often used to retrieve resources from outside untrusted networks on behalf of the requesting client it hides and protects that requesting client from the outside untrusted Network it can also be utilized to filter allowed content back into the trusted Network it can also increase Network performance by caching or saving commonly requested web pages now that concludes this session on the introduction to network devices part two we talked about some security devices that you may find on your network and we concluded with optimization and performance devices that may also be present now on behalf of pit thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on networking services and applications part one today I'm going to be discussing the basics of the virtual private Network and then I'm going to move on to protocols used by virtual private networks now there's a whole lot of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about the basics of the virtual private Network a virtual private Network or VPN is used by remote hosts to access a private Network through an encrypted tunnel through a public network once the VPN connection is made the remote host is no longer considered remote it's actually seen by the private Network as being a local host there are many advantages to that but I'm not going to cover them right now even though the network traffic may pass through many different routes or systems it's seen by both ends as being a direct connection the use of the VPN can help to reduce networking costs for organizations and business business the cost reduction is partially achieved because the VPN doesn't require the use of a dedicated least line to create that direct connection there are several different types of vpns there is the sight to sight VPN which allows a remote sites Network to connect to the main sites Network and be seen as a local network segment VPN concentrators on both ends of the the VPN will manage that connection then there's the Remote Access VPN which is also called a host to site VPN it allows select remote users to connect to the local network a VPN concentrator on the local network will manage the connection coming in from the remote users the remote system making the connection uses special software called VPN client software to make that connection the third type of VPN is the host to host VPN which is often called an sslvpn it allows a secure connection between two systems without the use of VPN client software a VPN concentrator on the local network manages the connection the host seeking to connect uses a web browser that supports the correct encryption technology which is either either SSL or more likely TLS to make the connection to the VPN concentrator it's time to discuss some protocols used by the virtual private Network the big protocol for vpns is called Internet Protocol security IP SEC which isn't actually a protocol in itself but a whole set of protocols IPC works at layer three of the OSI model or above it's the most common Suite of protocols used to secure a VPN connection ipet can be used with the authentication header protocol or the ah protocol ah only offers authentication services but no encryption so it authenticates the user but there is no encryption of the session or ipset can be used with encapsulating security payload protocol or the ESP protocol ESP both authenticates and encrypts the packets it is the most popular method of securing a VPN connection both ah and ESP will operate in one of two modes the first mode is transparent mode that is between two devices as in a host to host VPN or they can be used in tunnel mode which is between two endpoints as in a sight tosite VPN IPC implements Internet Security Association and Key Management Isa Camp by default Isa Camp provides a method for transferring security key and authentication data between systems outside of the security key generating process it is a much more secure process then we have generic routing encapsulation gr GRE is a tunneling protocol that is capable of encaps capsulating a wide variety of other network layer protocols it's often used to create a sub tunnel within an IPC connection why is that well IPC will only transmit unicast packets that's onetoone communication in many cases there's a need to transmit multicast which is one to some communication or broadcast which is one to many communication packets across an ipset Connection by using gr we can get that accomplished then there's Point topoint tunneling protocol pptp this is an older VPN technology that supports dialup VPN connections on its own it lacked native security features so it wasn't very secure but Microsoft's implementation included additional security by adding GR e to pointtopoint tunneling protocol transport layer security is another common VPN protocol TLS is a cryptographic protocol used to create a secure encrypted connection between two in devices or applications it uses asymmetrical cryptography to authenticate endpoints and then negotiates a symmetrical security key which is to encrypt the session TLS has largely replaced its cousin secure socket layer protocol and TLS works at layer five and above of the OSI model its most common usage is in creating a secure encrypted internet session or sslvpn all modern web browsers support TLS now I just mentioned secure socket layer or SSL SSL is an older cryptographic protocol that is very similar to TLS the most common use is in Internet transactions why because all modern web browsers support SSL but due to issues with earlier versions of the protocol it has largely been replaced by TLS SSL version 3.3 has been developed to address the weaknesses of earlier versions but it may never again catch up to its cousin the TLs protocol now that concludes this session on networking services and applications part one I talked about the basics of the virtual private Network and then I talked about the protocols used by the VPN network on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on networking services and applications part two today we're going to be discussing network access services and then we're going to move on to other services and applications as always there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and dive into this session I will be begin with network access Services the first network access service that I'm going to discuss is actually a piece of Hardware the network interface controller or Nick it can also be called the network interface card the Nick is how a device connects to a network the network interface controller works at two layers of the OSI model at Layer Two which is the data link layer it provides the functional means of network communication by determining which networking protocols will be used as in a Nick that will provide ethernet communication or a Nick that will provide pointtopoint protocol it also provides the local network node address through its burned in physical media Access Control address at layer one the physical layer the network interface controller determines how the network data traffic will be converted a bit at a time into an electrical signal that can Traverse the network media being used I.E it provides the connection to the network most modern computers come with at least one builtin ethernet Nick routers and other network devices may use separate modules that can be inserted into the device to provide the proper network interface controller for the type of media they're connecting to and the networking protocols that are being used another network access service is radius remote authentication dialin user service radius is a remote access service that is used to authenticate remote users and Grant them access to authorized network resources it is a popular AAA protocol that's authentication authorization and accounting protocol it's used to help ensure that only authenticated end users are using the network resources they are authorized to use the accounting services of radius are very robust the only drawback to radius is only the requesters the end users password is encrypted everything else gets sent in the clear terminal Access Controller access control system Plus or Taca plus terminal Access Controller hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on DHCP in the network today we're going to be talking about static versus Dynamic IP addressing then we're going to move on to how DHCP works and then we will conclude with components and processes of DHCP and with that let's go ahead and begin this session and of course we begin by talking about static versus Dynamic IP addressing so how does a computer know what its IP configuration is well more than likely a computer received its IP configuration from a dynamic host configuration protoc call server not only did the server give the PC an IP address but it also told the PC where the default gateway was and more than likely how to find a DNS server a computer will receive its IP configuration in one of two ways either statically which means manually set or dynamically which means through a service like thcp static IP addresses assignment works fine for very small and stable networks but quickly becomes unwieldly and error prone as the network grows and more nodes come onto the network so let's talk a little bit more about static IP addressing the administrator assigns an IP number in subnet mask to each host in the network whether it be a PC router or some other piece of electronic equipment each networ network interface that is going to be available to connect to the network requires this information the administrator also assigns a default gateway location and DNS server location to each host in the network now these settings are required if access to outside networks is going to be allowed that would be through the default gateway and if humanfriendly naming conventions are going to be allowed and that way you can more easily find network resources and that would be through a DNS server now each time A Change Is made as in a new default gateway is established each IP configuration on each host must be updated that's why it becomes rather cumbersome and complicated as the network grows now with Dynamic IP addressing the administrator configures a DHCP server to handle the assignment process which actually automates the process and eases management the DHCP server listens on a specific port for IP information requests once it receives a request the DHCP server responds with the required information now let's move on to how DHCP works here is the typical DHCP process upon bootup a PC that is configured to request an IP config configuration sends a DHCP Discovery packet now the discovery packet is sent to the broadcast address 255.255.255.0 on UDP Port 67 the DHCP server is listening to that Port it's listening for that Discovery packet when the DHCP server receives the discovery packet it responds with an offer pack packet basically saying hey I'm here to help now the offer packet is sent back to the MAC address of the computer requesting help and it's sent on Port 68 once the computer receives that offer packet from the DHCP server if it's going to use that DHCP server it returns a request packet that means it's requesting the proper IP configuration from from that specific DHCP server once the DHCP server receives the request packet it sends back an acknowledgement packet now this acknowledgement packet contains all of the required IP configuration information once the PC receives the acknowledgement packet the PC changes its IP configuration to reflect the information that it received from the DHC P server and that's the typical DHCP process in a nutshell now let's talk about components and the process of DHCP we're going to begin by talking about the ports used now I already mentioned this once but I'm going to mention it again because you need to know this the PC sends its Discovery packet out on the broadcast address . 255 on Port 67 that's UDP Port 67 when the DHCP server responds it responds to the PC's Mac address media Access Control address on UDP Port 68 that's important to remember the PC uses UDP Port 67 the DHCP server responds on UDP Port 6 68 then there's the address scope the address scope is the IP address range that the administrator configures on the DHCP server it is the range of addresses that the DHCP server can hand out to individual nodes there's also what are called address reservations now these are administrator configured reserved IP addresses the administrator reserves specific IP addresses to be handed out to specific Mac addresses now these are used for devices that should always have the same IP address as in servers and routers if you didn't do that there is the possibility that your default gateways IP address might change now the reason we use address reservation is this allows the these addresses to be changed from a central location instead of having to log into each device and change the IP configuration separately now part of the DHCP process are what are called leases the DHCP server hands out that IP configuration information but it sets a time limit for how long that IP configuration is good this is called the lease so the parameters are are only good for a specified amount of time now the administrator can configure how long the leases are there are also options that the administrator can configure the first one that's pretty obvious is the default gateway location there's also the DNS server address and the administrator can configure more than one DNS server location an administrator can also Al configure an option for the PC to synchronize with a Time server so the administrator can configure a Time server address there are many more additional options but those are the big three that you should remember now when a PC boots up it does have a preferred IP address that would be the IP address that it had the last time it booted up now it can request that same i p configuration from the DHCP server now the administrator can configure the DHCP server to either honor that preference or to ignore it now under the right circumstances a DHCP server isn't required to reside on the local network segment now as a general rule broadcast Transmissions Cann not pass through a router but if there is not a DHCP server on the local network segment the router can be configured to be a DHCP relay when a DHCP relay also called an IP helper receives a discovery packet from a node it will forward that packet to the network segment on which the DHCP server resides this allows for there to be fewer configured DHCP servers in any given Network reducing the amount amount of Maintenance that an administrator needs to perform now that concludes this session on DHCP in the network we started with static versus Dynamic IP addressing and then we moved on to how DHCP works and we concluded with components and processes of DHCP now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait session on the introduction to the DNS service today we're going to be talking about DNS servers DNS records and we will conclude with a brief discussion on dynamic DNS and with that let's go ahead and begin this session we're going to begin this session with a talk about DNS servers now DNS is the process that Maps humanfriendly names as in www.google.com to their appropriate IP addresses without DNS we would have to memorize all of the IP addresses that we wished to visit now DNS stands for domain name system and it's very structured in nature if the local DNS server apparatus doesn't contain the needed record it sends the request up the DNS chain until a positive response is received back now this positive response gets passed back down to the original requestor now DNS does require that an fqdn fully qualified domain name is used in order for it to function properly now an fqdn is the www.google.com it's that naming convention right there the www is the specific service that's being requested the Google portion is the local domain that contains the specific service and the com is the top level that contains the the Google that contains the specific service that is an fqdn now that we've got that covered let's talk about the different levels of DNS servers first off there can be a local DNS server this is the server on the local network that contains the hosts file that maps all of the fqdn to their specific IP addresses in the local subdomain it may be present or it may not be present then there are top level domain servers the TLD server now these are the servers that contain the records for the top level domains examples of top level domains are.org net.edu so on and so forth now each of these servers contains all of their information for their respective domains kind of and what do I mean by kind of well the TLD servers do delegate down to second level servers their information they do that to ease the load so that the TLD server is not overloaded but the TLD server is the server that is responsible for maintaining the record then there's the root server this is the server that contains all of the records for the TLD servers so if you're looking for a TLD that is kind of unknown you will actually go to the root server which will then pass you onto the appropriate TLD then there are authoritative servers and nonauthoritative servers an authoritative DNS server is one that responds to a request and that authorit server has been specifically configured to contain the requested information an authoritative response comes from a DNS server that actually holds the original record so an authoritative response comes from the name server that's been specifically configured to contain that record then there are nonauthoritative DNS servers now a nonauthoritative DNS server is one that responds to a to a request with DNS information that it received from another DNS server a nonauthoritative response is not a response from the official name server for the domain instead it is a second or thirdhand response that's given back to the requester in most cases when we send a DNS request we get a nonauthoritative response back now let's move on to the various DNS record types the first record that we're going to talk about is the a record now the a record Maps host names or fqdns to their respective ipv4 addresses closely associated with the a record is the AAAA record or quadruple a record this Maps the fqdn to its respective IPv6 address then there's the C name record now this Maps a canonical name or Alias to a host name what that means is that you can have edcc.edu be the same as EDC dog without having to maintain two sites the edcc.edu this works in part because of the pointer record the PTR record it's a pointer record that points out to DNS that there is a canonical name and finally we have the MS record now this record maps to the email server that is specified for a specific domain it is the record that determines how email travels from sender to recipient and now let's move on to Dynamic DNS now Dynamic DNS or ddns permits lightweight and immediate updates to a local DNS database this is very useful for when the fqdn or host name Remains the Same but the IP address is able to change on a regular basis Dynamic DNS is implemented as an additional service to DNS and it's implemented through DD NS updating now this is a method of updating traditional name servers without the intervention of an administrator so there's no manual editing or inputting of the configuration files required a ddns provider supplies software that will monitor the IP address of the referenced system once the IP address changes the software sends an update to the proper DNS server ddns is useful for when access is needed to a domain whose IP address is being supplied dynamically by an ISP or Internet service provider that way the IP address can change but people can still get to the service that they're looking for now that concludes this session on the introduction to the DNS service we talked about DNS servers we moved on to DNS records and then we concluded with a very brief discussion about Dynamic DNS now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm pretty sure I'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace session introducing Network address translation today we're going to be talking about the purpose of network address translation and then we're going to discuss how Network address translation works and with that let's go ahead and begin this discussion of course we're going to begin by talking about the purpose of network address translation Network address translation or n solves a very serious problem of how to route non routable IP addresses as a partial effort to conserve the ipv4 address space the private ipv4 addressing spaces were developed these address spaces were removed from the public ipv4 address space and made non routable across public ipv4 network and this led to the problem being non routable prevents that private ipv4 address from communicating with remote public networks natat very simply solves this problem a router with Nat enabled will translate a private IP address into a routable public IP address when the response returns to the router it passes passes the response back to the device that requested it so now that we've covered the purpose let's talk about how Network address translation works and first off we get to talk about the fact that there are two categories of net first up is static net with static net each private IP address is assigned to a specific routable public IP address this relationship is kept and maintained by the natat enabled router when a device needs access outside of the local network the router translates the local IP address to the assigned public IP address and when the response comes back the router will translate the public IP address back into a local one static n is not flexible and leads to some scalability issues an individual routable IP address must be kept for every device that requires access outside of the local network so as the network grows you need to increase the amount of public IP addresses that are under your control that gets kind of expensive and kind of complicated they developed Dynamic Gat to resolve some of that issue with Dynamic Gat the natat enabled router dynamically assigns a routable IP address to devices from a pool of available IP addresses when a device needs access outside of the local network the router performs the net function only the public IP address comes from a reusable pool of public IP addresses that private IP address is assigned the public IP address from the pool and once outside access is stopped the routable I IP address goes back into the pool to be reused as initially designed Dynamic Gat was more flexible than static n but it still led to some scalability issues as more Network traffic required access to outside networks the pool of available public IP addresses needs to increase or outside access cannot be achieved but thankfully there is a solution to this and that solution is called port address translation or in Cisco terms that would be natat with Pat Pat is a type of dynamic Gat that was developed to increase the scalability of network address translation when a local network device requires access to a public network the natat enabled router dynamically assigns the public IP address to the device with the addition of dynamically assigning a port number to the the end of the public IP address the router tracks the IP addresses and port numbers to ensure that Network traffic is routed to and from the proper devices Pat still requires a pool of public IP addresses but the pool may only contain one public IP address or it may contain several for a large private Network this is the preferred method of implementing Network address trans translation for two reasons first off there's less public IP addresses that are required and it makes it easier for an administrator to maintain now let's talk about natat terminology specifically about the types of addresses and we begin with the inside local address which is a private IP address on the local network it is the private IP address assigned to a specific device then there's the inside global address a public address referencing an inside device the inside global address is the public IP address assigned to the inside device by the natat enabled router allowing access outside of the network then there's the outside global address which is a public IP address referencing an outside device it is the public public IP address assigned to a device outside of the local network then there's the outside local address which is a private IP address assigned to an outside device this is the private IP address assigned to the outside device by the natat enabled router on the interior of the local network so that the inside device can communicate correctly with the outside device device now that concludes this session on introducing Network address translation we talked about the purpose of network address translation and then we talked about how Network address translation works on behalf of pacit thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on Wan Technologies part one today I'm going to be talking about the public switched telephone Network then I'm going to move on to Broadband cable and I'm going to conclude with a brief section on fiber optics and with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course we begin with the public switched telephone Network before I begin with the public switch telephone Network let's talk about what makes a w a w as opposed to a lan well as a general rule if you own and control the line that the data is using to get from one place to another you are not using a wide area network or W technology on the other hand if you are using a form of transmission that you don't own as in you're leasing a line or you're paying for the use of it then you are likely using W technology one of the most common physical infrastructures used in Wan technology is the public switched telephone Network the pstn due to its widespread availability just about everybody has a telephone line being run to their house or to their building an older technology but still somewhat valid today for w technology is dialup now dialup utilizes the pstn to transmit Network traffic as an analog signal dialup does require an analog modem to format the network traffic correctly so it can be transmitted your maximum theoretical speed on dialup is 56 kilobits per second it's not very fast then there's ISDN Integrated Service digital Network ISDN is a digital pointtopoint W technology that utilizes the pstn it's a completely digital service it requires the use of a terminal adapter or ta to make the connection to the end nodes this ta is often called a digital modem but it's not it's a terminal adapter ISDN can use a primary rate interface or pry now the pry is composed of 23 64 kilobit pers second B channels and one 64 kilobit pers second D channel that dchannel is used for call setup and Link management a pry can achieve 1.544 megabits per second speed and that is commonly referred to as a T1 least line the most commonly implemented form of an ISDN though is the Bri the basic rate interface it uses only two B channels and One D Channel and the bri can achieve speeds of up to 128 kilobits per second now ISDN is not as capable as a digital subscriber line or DSL but it can often be implemented Where DSL cannot be installed speaking about DSL let's move on to it xdsl is the term for generic DSL DSL is a digital when technology that utilizes the pstn DSL does require the use of a digital modem it uses a dedicated digital line between the endpoint and a class5 central office or Co now in order for the most basic forms of DSL to be installed you have to be within 18,000 ft of the co DSL is capable of carrying voice and data when it does carry both filters are put in place in order for the voice signal to come through without any interference now let's move on to the different types of DSL and first up is symmetric DSL or sdsl symmetric DSL is synchronous in nature that means that the upload and download speeds are the same sdsl does not carry voice communication so if you need voice service an additional line is going to be needed sdsl is used by businesses that don't quite need the performance of a T1 least line but they do require the symmetrical upload and download speeds more common than sdsl is ADSL or asymmetric DSL it's asynchronous in nature that means that the upload speed is slower than the download speed ADSL can carry data and voice common upload speeds for ADSL are 768 kilobits per second with download speeds of up to 9 megabits per second it is the most common implementation of DSL in the small office home office environment last up for DSL is vdsl or very high bit rate DSL it's a synchronous in nature as well it's used when high quality video and voice over IP is necessary vdsl is commonly limited to download speeds of 52 megabits per second with an upload speed of 12 megabits per second that's a whole lot faster than ADSL but vdsl is only possible when you're located within 4,000 ft of a central office there is an exception to what I just told you though the current standards do allow for up to 100 megabits per second speed over the pstn using vdsl but in order to achieve that you must be within 300 M of the central office now that the pstn is out out of the way let's move on to Broadband cable Broadband cable is coaxial cable networking it's a broadband connection to a location delivered by the cable company Broadband cable can deliver voice data and television all through the same connection and the way it works is the digital signal is delivered to the headend this is where all the cable signals are received the signal is then processed and formatted and then transmitted to the distribution Network the distribution network is a smaller service area served by the cable company the distribution Network architecture can be composed of fiber optic cabling or coaxial cabling and or a hybrid fiber coaxial cabling or hfc unlike DSL the bandwidth of the distribution Network is shared by all of those who connect to it this can lead to increased latency and congestion during busy times the final distribution to the premise is usually through a coaxial cable the other thing that you need to know about Broadband cable is that all cable modems and similar devices must measure up to the isp's required data over cable service interface specification or docis spe specification if it doesn't measure up you're not going to achieve the speeds that you expect now let's conclude with fiber fiber optic networking is using light to transmit data and voice this allows for more bandwidth over greater distances fiber optic networking is more expensive to install but it's also less susceptible to line noise the fiber synchronous data transmission standard in the United States is called the synchronous Optical Network or Sonet standard the international standard is called the synchronous digital hery or sdh both Sonet and sdh Define the base rates of transmission over fiber optic cabling which are known as Optical carrier levels dense wavelength division multiplexing is a method of multiplexing several Optical carrier levels together up to 32 of them into a single fiber optic cable effectively increasing the bandwidth of that single optical fiber instead of dwdm you could use cwdm coar wavelength division multiplexing it's similar to dwdm but it only allows for up to eight channels on a single fiber when fiber optic is delivered Ed to the premise it's usually delivered over a passive Optical Network or Pawn a pawn is a point to multipoint technology that uses a single optical fiber that's used to connect multiple locations to the internet the passive Optical Network uses unpowered Optical Splitters now that concludes this session on Wan Technologies part one I talked about the public switch telephone Network then we moved on to Broadband cable and I briefly ran through fiber optic networking on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm looking forward to doing another good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on Wan Technologies part two today we're going to be discussing GSM and CDMA Wan connections then we're going to move on to YX W connections and we're going to conclude with satellite wide area network connections there's a fair amount of information to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session and of course I'm going to begin with the GSM and CDMA wide area network connections all cellular carriers use one of two methods for connecting devices to their networks and those methods are not compatible currently in the United States AT&T and TMobile use the global system for mobile or GSM standard to connect their devices to their networks both Sprint and Verizon use code division multiple access also known as CDMA as their me method of connecting to networks and those two standards are not compatible the majority of the rest of the world utilizes GSM as the method for cellular network access let me speak briefly about cellular networking cellular networking involves using the cellular phone system for more than just phone calls cellular networking has been around for a while and it originally wasn't known as this but the first version of it is first G or 1G cellular and it was only capable of voice Transmissions as improvements came along we got 2G that is cellular with simple data transmission capabilities as in text messaging 2G Edge offered some basic cellular networking connectivity and was a stop Gap measure between 2G and third generation cellular 3G cell cellular is the beginning of cellular wi networking it's giving way to 4G cellular which is still an emerging technology 4G currently consists of both LTE and yaax as a special mention we need to talk about evolved highspeed packet access which is HSPA plus it was a stop gap between 3G and 4G networking it's still available today the current standard for HSPA plus allows for up to a maximum data rate of 84 megabits per second now it's not quite as good as LTE which is longterm Evolution LTE uses an all IP based core with high data rates now LTE is compatible with both 3G and yaax the current standard for LTE allows for up to 300 megabits per second in download speeds and up to 75 megabits per second in upload speeds now let me introduce you to ymax WAN connections ymax stands for worldwide interoperability for microwave access that's a mouthful that's why we say ymax ymax was originally developed as a last mile alternative to use when DSL or cable was not available it can provide an alternative broadband connection to a fixed location it uses microwave Transmissions as an overtheair method to transmit voice and data it does require line of sight between relay stations but ymax can be used to cover significant Geographic distances also many municipalities are exploring the use of ymax as a means of providing reasonably priced Broadband to their citizens without having to wire every household yaax is often considered to be a type of 4G technology because it is compatible with LTE networks but yaax is not compatible with third generation cellular networks it is time for us to conclude with satellite W connections satellite Wan connections are a type of microwave satellite networking it uses microwave Transmissions as an overtheair method of transmitting voice and data just like yaax it can be an effective means of extending networks into places that are hard to reach it does use microwave radio relay as the method of transmitting data through the atmosphere just like yat it requires line of sight relay stations but it can cover even more distances than yaax why is that that's because it utilizes a satellite Network by the way because of the distances that satellite Transmissions can cover this can lead to latency problems think about it the Signal's got to go from a terrestrial location up to the satellite probably over to another satellite and then down to another terrestrial station that's a significant amount of distance and there's going to be some lag I just talked about the communication satellite that are also known as comsats these do form part of the microwave relay Network comsats can use a variety of orbits including the molia geostationary low polar or polar orbits the low polar and polar orbits are used to boost microwave signals before sending the signal back to Earth now that concludes cludes this session on W Technologies part two I briefly talked about GSM and CDM W connections then I moved on to a yaax Wan connections and then we concluded with satellite Wan connections now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm looking forward to doing some more hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on Wan Technologies part three today I'm going to briefly discuss Metro ethernet W connections then I'm going to move on to least line Wan connections and we're going to conclude with some common standards and with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by discussing Metro ethernet W connections a Metro ethernet connection is when the service provider connects to the customer's site through an RJ45 connector the customer will view that Wang connection as an ethernet connection while in reality the type of connection will be dependent upon the level of service that has been purchased the service provider may also use a variety of different wide area Network Technology behind the scenes but the customer will always view it as being an ethernet connection Metro ethernet is commonly deployed as a wide area Network Technology by municipalities at the metropolitan area network or Man level as in at the municipal level it's time for us to discuss least line Wan connections a least line is a dedicated circuit or connection between two endpoints used for communication when we're talking about it a least line is usually a digital pointtopoint connection a least line can utilize either a plain old telephone service line a pots line on the public switched telephone Network or it can be a fiber optic circuit provided by a telecom Communications company leased lines tend to be more expensive for the customer as the circuit can't be utilized by any other entity so the whole cost is born by the customer because they're the only ones who get to use it most often the speed of a leas line is limited by what the customer is willing to pay there are some multiplexing technologies out there that can be used to increase the amount of channels that are provided on the connection one of the least line technologies that you need to know about is pointto point protocol PPP it is a common data link layer or layer 2 protocol that's used with least line networks PPP can simultaneously transmit multiple layer three protocols it can transmit IP and ipx and apple talk all at the same time through the use of control protocols which are actually specific to the layer three protocol that's being transmitted PPP can include a feature called multilink PPP which allows for multiple physical interfaces to be bonded together and act as a single logical interface this effectively increases the available bandwidth to that system there are different types types of least line connections in the United States Japan and South Korea there are t carrier lines each tline is composed of 24 Digital Signal channels these are often called Digital Signal zero channels are DSO channels each channel is capable of carrying 64 kilobits per second the 24 dsos make up what is called a DS1 channel in in Europe we have ecarrier lines each eline is composed of 30 Digital Signal channels these are also called DSO channels the 30 DSO channels also make up what is called a DS1 Channel when we're talking about fiber optic speeds we often talk about Optical carrier lines our OC lines the OC data rates per channel are established by both the Sonic and sdh networking standards Sonet is the United States standard and SD is the international standards interestingly enough the OC rates are the same across the two standards it's possible to Multiplex multiple channels into the same fiber using different methods the first method is dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm it allows for up to 32 separate channels on a single fiber cable or you could use coar wavelength division multiplexing which allows for up to eight separate channels on a single fiber optic cable let's conclude with common standards the standards I'm going to be talking about are the speeds and we begin with t lines a T1 is composed of 24 DSO channels which are also known as a DS1 and it's capable of achieving speeds of up to 1.544 megabits per second if that's not fast enough for you you can lease a T3 line it's composed of 28 T1 lines now a T3 line is also known as a DS3 and it can achieve speeds of up to 44.7 36 megabits per second if if you're in Europe you might lease an E1 line an E1 line which is composed of 30 DSO channels can achieve speeds of up to 2.48 megabits per second just as with the United States if that's not fast enough for you you can lease an E3 line which is composed of 16 E1 lines which gives you up to 34. 368 megabits per second speed while a T1 is slower than an E1 a T3 is faster than an E3 for OC lines we have the oc1 it's capable of 51.84 megabits per second in speed then there is the oc3 which gives you up to 155.52 megabits per second speed it's becoming more common now to see oc1 12s with those you get up to 622.org megabits per second if you want gigabit type speed you might consider leasing an oc48 that gives you up to 2488 gbits per second in bandwidth currently at the top of the line is the OC 192 that gives you up to 9953 gbits per second speed so essentially 10 gbits per second worth a bandwidth now that concludes this session on Wan Technologies part three I briefly discussed Metro ethernet Wan connections and then I went on to a discussion about least line Wan connections and then I briefly mentioned some common standards on behalf of pait thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian and welcome to Pace it session on Wan Technologies part 4 today I'm going to be discussing the difference between circuit switched and packet switched networks then I'm going to move on to a discussion comparing frame relay versus asynchronous transfer mode and then we're going to conclude with multiprotocol label switching there's a whole lot of ground to cover not a whole lot of time let's go go ahead and begin this session let's begin this session by talking about circuit switched and packet switched networks circuit switch networks have a dedicated circuit between two endpoints that is used for communication while set up the circuit can only be used for communication between those ends circuit switch networks are most common in networks with least line communication channels they're best used when there needs to be a fair amount of continuous data traffic between the two endpoints and with circuit switched networks there is only one path for the data to take on the other hand in packet switch networks data is broken up into smaller chunks and moved through the network only to be reassembled at the other end the data is routed using the destination address and the data may take different paths through the Network that it's traveling through as a general rule packet switch networks are less expensive to maintain why because the user doesn't have to maintain a dedicated circuit 24/7 they're only paying for what they're using now let's talk about the differences between frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode frame relay is a Wan technology in which variable length packets are switched across the network frame relay is less expensive than least lines but frame relay can be made to look like a least line through virtual circuits or VCS a frame relay network will track a VC using a data link connection identifier to identify the ends of the VC there are two terms associated with frame relay that you should be aware of the first is access rate that is the maximum speed of the frame relay interface the other term is the committed information rate the CI that's the guaranteed bandwidth that a customer receives so that's the minimum speed of that frame relay Network the access rate may be higher but the customers always guaranteed the committed information rate now let's talk about asynchronous transfer mode also known as ATM ATM is a Wan technology in which fixed length cells are switched across the network these cells are always 53 bytes long ATM can handle realtime voice and video because it's very fast but it has poor bandwidth utilization the small cell size reduces the efficiency of the technology but ATM is very fast even if it is inefficient common speeds on an at ATM network are 51.84 megabits per second and 155.52 megabits per second let's conclude with multiprotocol label switching the acronym for multiprotocol label switching is MLS MLS is a topology that's growing in popularity why because it's scalable also it is protocol independent MLS can be used to replace both frame relay switching and ATM switching it can be used to packet switch both frame relay and ATM network traffic this allows MLS to be used with both frame relay and ATM Technologies MLS is often used to improve quality of service and flow of network traffic it uses a label Edge router to add NLS labels to incoming packets if they don't have them the label Edge router then passes those packets onto a label switching router or LSR router the LSR forwards those packets based on their MLS labels to their final destination now that concludes this session on Wan Technologies part four I talked about the differences between a circuit switched and packet switch Network then we moved on to frame relay versus asynchronous transfer mode and we concluded with a brief discussion on multiprotocol label switching on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing some more hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on the network cabling part one today we're going to be talking about twisted pair network cabling then we're going to talk about twisted pair Network connectors and then we will conclude with categories of twisted pair I have a whole lot of information to cover and I need to get through this quickly so let's go ahead and begin this session and we'll Begin by talking about twisted pair network cabling most people are familiar with twisted pair cables because they are the standard in the modern land they are what you see most often when you're looking at Network CA twisted pair cables are composed of four pairs of wires contained within an insulating sheath each pair of wires is Twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference which is called Emi The Twist rates differ between the pairs to reduce cross talk between the pairs which is a type of Emi the colors of the pairs of wires are always white orange orange white blue blue white green green and white brown brown twisted pair network cabling comes an either unshielded or shielded twisted pair that would be UTP or STP the difference is that STP has an additional Shield that is either wrapped around each pair of wires or around all four pairs of wires that shielding reduces the opportunity for Emi or cross talk but it is more expensive and a little harder to work with because it's not as flexible UTP or unshielded twisted pair is deployed in the network much more often than STP there are also plenum and nonplenum types of twisted pair most twisted pair cabling is nonplenum grade but building codes often call for Plum grade cable to be run in plenum spaces now a plum space is that area that is designed to assist in the air flow of a building for HVAC purposes and most often the plenum is that space between the false ceiling and the actual ceiling plenum cable is jacketed in either a fire retardant cover or in a low smoke PVC jacket Plum cables often have a polymer or nylon strand woven into the cabling or into the jack ET to help take the weight of hanging cables this reduces the chance for the cable to stretch which can cause the pair or pairs of wires inside the jacket to break twisted pair is usually either a straight through cable or a crossover cable but it can also be used to create a rollover or console cable a straight through cable is used to connect different types of devices together as in a computer to a switch or a switch to a router well a crossover cable is used to connect similar devices together as in a PC to a PC or a switch to a switch the straight through and crossover cable use different pinouts to achieve their connections a rollover or console cable is often required to connect to the console port on a switch or a router it is quite common for one end of the rollover cable to use an RJ45 connector while the other end utilizes an rs232 also called a DB9 connector so now that I've mentioned those connectors let's go on to twisted pair Network connectors and we're going to begin with the rj11 you don't see these very much in what we think of as networking but you do see them all the time the rj11 uses a six position 4 contact modular connector that's a 6p 4C modular mod connector it can carry data or voice and its common usage is voice communication telephoning all of your telephone Jacks are rj1 111s then there's the RJ45 this is the one that we always think about when we think about networking with twisted pair of cabling it uses an 8 position 8 contact or 8p 8C modular connector it can carry data or voice and its common usage is data networking ethernet then there's the rj48c it also uses an 8 position 8 contact modular connector 8p8c just like the RJ45 as a matter of fact it's often thought of as being an RJ45 but it's used as the terminating connector at the dmark point for T1 lines and as I said just a moment ago it's often confused with the RJ45 but the active pin are different then we have the UTP coupler the unshielded twisted pair coupler it's used to connect UTP cables backto back and still maintain adherence to Industry standards you might still come across the 66 block being used for network connections but probably not it's a punchdown block that was initially developed to terminate and distribute telephone lines in an Enterprise Network so you might still see it for telephony but it's getting a little bit harder to find it it was also used in slower speed networks as it can handle data traffic That's rated for cat 3 cabling much more likely you'll find a 110 block now this is a punchdown block that was developed to terminate and distribute twisted pair network cabling it's capable of handling the signaling requirements of the modern Network I mentioned the DB9 or rs23 2 connector earlier well here we go it is a 9 pin D subminiature connector developed for asynchronous serial communication between nodes it was a common type of connector between a computer and an external modem and as I said earlier it often makes up one end of the rollover cable you might come across the db25 also known as an eia 2 32 or rs232 serial connector it is a 25 pin duub miniature connector developed for asynchronous serial communication between nodes just like the DB9 only it was larger it too provided a type of connection between a computer and an external analog modem and it's even less common than the DB9 now let's move on to categories of of twisted pair and we begin with cat 3 cat 3 was rated for up to 10 megabits per second speed that's 10 Bas T networking and it had a maximum distance of 100 m by the way unless I specify all twisted pair cabling has a max distance of 100 m that 10 megabits per second wasn't quite fast enough so then we got cap five cap five is rated for up to 100 megabits per second speed that's 100 Bas T networking and that still wasn't fast enough so they developed cap 5e cap 5e is rated for up to 1 gigabits per second that's 1,000 base T now we have cat 6 cat 6 is rated for up to 10 gbits per second that's 10 GB Ethernet or 10 GBE and with cat 6 you can can only get that 10 gbits per second over a max distance of 55 M for some reason they thought they needed to go more distance than 55 M so they developed cat 6A it has the same speed ratings as cat 6 but it has a max distance of 100 m and you can still achieve that 10 gbits per second networking now that concludes this session on network cabling part one I talked about twisted pair cabling then I talked about twisted pair Network connectors and I concluded with the categories of twisted pair cabling now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on network cabling part two today we're we're going to be talking about coaxial cabling and fiber optic cabling there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session and of course we're going to begin by talking about coaxial cabling coaxial or coax cabling is one of the oldest ethernet standards for network cabling it was standardized in 1973 it's been used for baseband carries just a single digital signal and it has been used for Broadband carrying multiple digital signals it is composed of a central conductor that is covered by an insulating layer which is covered by an outer mesh or foil layer which is then finished off with an outer insulating layer that inner metal mesh layer helps to protect against electromagnetic interference Emi there are several different types of coax cable there is RG58 it was used in 10base 2 networking it could span a maximum distance of 185 M and had a 50 ohms impedance value it's no longer commonly found in the modern Network then there's rg59 it's commonly used to provide a broadband connection between two devices over a short distance and it has a 75 ohms impedance value and it's only used for short distances because it leaks its signal it can't span very far then we have RG6 which is used for cable TV or Broadband now the distance that RG6 can spand varies but it still has a 75 ohms impedance value and it's commonly used to make the connection to a cable modem by the cable company there are are two basic types of coax cable connectors there is the BNC also known as the bayonet Neil councilman connector you can also call it a bayonet connector it is used with coax cabling but is now considered obsolete the connection from the cable to the device was achieved through a springloaded Twist lock type of connector a BNC coupler can also be used to connect two coax cables segments back to back much more common is the F connector it's a threaded bayet connector and it's also used with coax cable an F connector coupler can be used to connect two coax cable segments back to back now let's move on to fiber optic cabling so now let me describe fiber optic cabling first off it's relatively expensive and harder to work with than with other types of network cabling it's not as common as other types either coax or twisted pair in the land environment but it can resist all forms of electromagnetic interference and it cannot be easily tapped into that means it's harder for people to ease drop on your network Transmissions it also can cover long distances at high speed fiber optic cabling is designated by fiber type cladding size by the way the cladding is what the light bounces down and it's jacket size that outer jacket that covers the cable the size of the cladding and the size of the jacket are listed in micrometers most applications of fiber optic cabling require that the cables be run in pairs one cable to send Transmissions one cable to receive Transmissions the type of connector used on fiber optic cabling can impact act the performance of the transmission there are two basic categories of connectors there is the UPC the ultra physical contact this connector has a back reflection rating of around a NE 55 dbel loss then there's the APC the angled physical connector which has a back reflection rating of around a 70 DB loss making it the better performance form in connector now let's talk about fiber types there's multimode fiber which uses an infrared LED system to transmit light down the fiber it sends multiple rays of lights down the cable at the same time it is used for shorter fiber runs under 2 km it is less expensive than the other type of fiber cabling then we have single mode fiber SMF it us uses a laser diode arrangement to transmit light down the fiber it only sends a single ray of light down the cable even though my diagram depicts it as going straight it still bounces down the cladding but there's only one of them it's used for longer runs that require high speed and it can span more than 40 km so now let's talk about fiber optic CA and connectors and first up is the SC that is the subscriber connector or the square connector you can also call it a standard connector an easy way to remember it is stick and click it's a push pull type connector then we have the St the straight tip you can also think of this as stick and twist it is a springloaded Twist lock type of connector there's also the LC which can be called the local connector or loosened connector or little connector it's a type of connector that uses a locking tab to secure the connection similar to the LC is the mtrj the mechanical transfer registered Jack it's a small form factor connector that contains two fibers and that also utilizes a locking tab to secure the connection you might also find a fiber optic coupler guess what it does it's used to connect two fiber optic cables back to back now that concludes this session on network cabling part two I talked about coaxial cabling and I concluded with fiber optic cabling now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pce it T's session on network cabling part three today I'm going to be talking about media converters and then I'm going to talk about some cabling tools that you should know about and with that let's go ahead and begin today's session I will Begin by discussing media converters it is not uncommon to be in a situation where Network contains more than one type of cabling this can lead to a situation where there's a desire to connect different types of media together in order to make a cohesive or single Network thankfully media converters are readily available the issue of trying to connect these disparate types of transmission together mostly comes into play when you're trying to join a fiber optic transmission to a copper wire infrastructure and that's actually represented in the types of readily available media converters that that are out there the most common media converters will connect single mode fiber to ethernet or multimode Fiber to ethernet or single mode fiber to multimode fiber and finally there is a fiber to coaxial cabling media converter you need to be aware that these devices are out there to help you create a solid Network now let's move on to cabling tools so every technician should put some thought into the tools that are in his or her toolbox it is often said that you get what you pay for and that is very true with tools while a good technician can get away with buying the most inexpensive tools by spending a little more money for a better tool that can often make the task easier and ultimately make the technician more efficient but you also need to be aware that you can spend more money than is necessary and not utilize all of the features in a given tool so you need to find that balance point between spending too much money and not spending enough money to become a really efficient technician now let's move on to the tools themselves and we'll begin with crimpers crimpers are used to place cable ends on cables they can be designed to work with a single type of cable as in twisted pair or with multiple types of cable I've seen some crimpers that have been able to work with rj1 111s rj45s and with a coaxial F connector next up are wire strippers wire strippers are used to remove the insulating covers on wires and cables many are designed to just cut through the insulation without damaging the cable contained within that insulation but some are also designed to cut all the way through the cable so that excess cabling can be trimmed when you're using those to cut insulation you need to be careful that you don't cut the underlying cable then there are punchdown tools these are used to secure cable wires into punchdown blocks a good punchdown tool will trim the ends at the same time as it places the wire in the punch down block then there are cable testers these are used to test cables for common problems as in misconfiguration of the ends or incorrect pinouts cable testers will often test for the cable standard used either the t568a or the t568b or they can tell you whether or not you've created a crossover cable cable testers will test for shorts or breaks in the continuity of the cable some types of testers can also test for cable length and quality these type of testers are called cable certifiers then we have the TDR the time domain reflectometer now this is a cable tester for copper cabling that can determine the length of a segment and the electrical characteristics of the cable also a TDR can tell you where a break hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on network topologies today we're going to discuss what a topology is then we're going to discuss peertopeer in client server networking and then we're going to talk about some common Network topologies and with that let's go ahead and begin this session so what is a topology well a topology is basically a map that can be used to describe how a network is laid out or how a network functions a network topology can be described as either being logical or physical a logical topology describes the theoretical signal path while the physical topology describes the physical layout of the network and you should know that a logical and physical topology don't need to match and with that let's move on to peertopeer versus the client server networks so are these really topologies no not really they don't describe the signal path or the physical layout of the network but yes they are topologies because they do describe how the network functions so that's why they're here in this discussion now in a peertopeer topology the nodes control and Grant access to resources on the network no one node or group of nodes controls access to a single specific type of resource there's no real server present each node is responsible for the resources it's willing to share now a client server topology differs Network resource access is controlled by a central server or servers a server determines what resources get shared who is allowed to use those resources and even when those resources can be used now in the small office home office it's common to find a hybrid topology that's where a combination of peertopeer and client server networking is used now let's move on to some common Network topology models the first one we're going to discuss is the bus the original ethernet standard established a bus topology for the network both logically and physically and what I mean by a bus topology is the signal traveled along a predetermined path from end to end it went from one direction to the other direction and then it could come back now as time went on the bus developed some mechanical problems that led to the development of different physical topologies but the logical topology remained the same in order to maintain backward compatibility so when we discuss ethernet networks the logical topology is always a bus topology while the physical topology can be different so let's talk about the bus again the signal traverses from one end of the network to the other now a Breaking the line breaks the network the ends of the bus line needed to be terminated in order to prevent signal bounce and what that means is that if there was a break or the ends of the line were not terminated when the signal got to the end it would bounce back through and create a storm in a bus topology the network cable is the central point now kind of related to the bus is the ring it's a bus line with the end point connected together a break in the ring breaks the ring in a ring topology it's common to use two rings multiple rings that counter rotate this safeguards against a break in one ring Bringing Down the whole network now ring topologies are not very common anymore in the land but they're still used in the wide area network especially when Sonet or SD is used moving on from The Ring we have the star the nodes radiate out from a central point now when a topology is implemented with a hub a break in a segment brings down the whole bus because the Hub retransmits out all ports now when it's implemented with a switch a break in a segment only brings down that segment it is the most common implementation in the modern land then there's the mesh a true mesh topology is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes that's a full mesh now those aren't very common because the they are expensive and difficult to maintain but it's common to find partial meshes that's where there are multiple paths between nodes now everyone knows at least one partial mesh Network and that would be the internet now let's move on to the point topoint topology that's where two nodes or systems are connected directly together now if you're talking about two PCS that's when they use a crossover cable to create a pointtopoint topology there there's no Central device to manage the connection now this is still a common topology when implemented across a Wan connection utilizing a T1 line we also need to discuss point to multipoint in a point to multipoint topology a central device controls the paths to all other devices this differs from a star in that the central device is intelligent now wireless networks often Implement point to multipoint to IES when the wireless access point sends all devices on the network receive the data but when a device sends its message is only passed along to the destination it's also a common topology when implementing a Wan across a packet switched Network now let's discuss MLS MLS is multiprotocol label switching and it is a topology that's used to replace both frame relay switching and ATM switching it's a topology because it specifies a signal path and layout MLS is used to improve the quality of service and flow of network traffic it uses label Edge routers LS which add MLS labels to incoming packets if they don't already have them now the ls add the labels and pass the packets along to lsrs label switching routers these forward packets based on their MLS labels that's what makes this a topology now that concludes this session on network topologies we discussed what a topology is then we discussed the differences between peertopeer and client server networking and then I brought up some common Network topology models that you should know now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on network infrastructure implementations today I'm going to be talking about design versus function and then I'm going to talk about categories of different networks and with that let's go ahead and begin this session let's begin this session by talking about the difference between design and function when describing a network you have a couple of different options are you describing its design or its function if you are going to describe its design then the first place to start is to describe its topology is it a bus network is it a star Network or a point too but if you're going to describe how the network functions then the first place to start is to describe the category or infrastructure implementation of that Network and with that let's move on to categories of networks first up is the local area network or the landan most lands are encompassed by a single Network address range that address range may be broken up into subgroups through the use of virtual local area networks vlans a land can span anywhere from a small area like a single room to a whole building or a small group of buildings the land tends to be the highest speed Network it is becoming more common to see 10 gbits per second networking on the land the most common types of network on the land are the 802.3 or ethernet Andor the 802.11 or Wireless local area network these are the most common types of network found on the land then there is the metropolitan area network or the man it is larger than a land most often it contains multiple local area networks mans or metropolitan area networks are often owned by municipalities when a man is owned by a private entity it is sometimes called a campus area network then there is the Wan the wide area network now A W spans significant Geographic distances they can be described as a network of networks and the best example of a Wan is the internet so how do you tell when a man becomes a Wan well as a general rule if all of the infrastructure implementation has a single owner then it is not a Wan if it's large it'll be a man and if it's not quite so large it'll be a lan but it's really easy to tell a personal area network a pan why because they are extremely distant and size limited most often a pan is a connection between only two devices common examples include a Bluetooth connection between a keyboard and a computer that's a pan then there are infrared or IR connect C between a smartphone and a printer that's a pan another example of a pan is near field communication which is now becoming seen between a smartphone and a payment terminal the pan tends to have low throughput of data and low power output they don't consume a whole lot of power as the distance between devices increase the throughput on a pan will decrease now a couple of special categories of networks and first is the supervisory control and data acquisition Network the scata network now a scata network is a type of industrial control system or IC that is designed to control large scale deployments of equipment the controlled equipment is usually at more than one site scata is often deployed in energy distribution system systems by utility companies scata uses a distributed control system or DCS to communicate with programmable logic controllers plc's and or remote terminals to control the equipment and processes from a central location so they have a central location to control equipment that's at remote locations scatter networks are often proprietory and often require a additional training to understand them and operate them the last special mention on categories of networks is the Media Net it's a network designed and implemented specifically to handle voice and video they are designed and implemented to remove quality of service issues like latency or Jitter that can occur in other types of infrastructure a video teleconference Network or VTC is an example of a Media Net they are often implemented as its own infrastructure or as a sub infrastructure of a larger Network that concludes this session on network infrastructure implementations I talked about the differences between design and function of networks and I concluded with a discussion on the different categories of networks on behalf of P it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the introduction to ipv4 part one today we're going to be talking about the purpose of Ip addressing and then we're going to move on to some ipv4 address properties there's a whole lot of ground to cover and we need to do it quickly so let's go ahead and begin this session of course we're going to start with the purpose of Ip addressing when Bob on network a wants to view a web page hosted on a server on network C how does Bob's computer know where to send him well somehow Bob has gotten that server's IP address either an ipv4 format or IPv6 IP addresses are the location of a PC or server or some other network device that identifies it by both its Network location and host location within that Network IP addressing provides a logical addressing scheme for our computers so that they can communicate on networks being logical means that the IP address can be changed ched with minimal fuss at any time unlike the MAC address or the media Access Control address which is physically embedded into the device on the other hand IP addresses are programmed in and are easily changed now that we know the purpose of Ip addressing let's move on to some ipv4 address properties ipv4 is made up of a 32bit binary number that means there are two to the 32nd power possible address combinations that gives us 4 b294 m967 296 possible address combinations with all of these possibilities a process needed to be developed to keep everything neat and tidy and most of all find able the implementation of a subnet mask was the answer and I'll get to that subnet mask in just a moment something that you will find useful is learning how to convert from binary to decimal now decimal is base two that means there are only zeros and ones as opposed to the base 10 that we're all used to dealing with if you would like more information on how to convert from decimal to Binary or binary to decimal you can go to that website that's listed under this heading so now let's talk about the initial properties of ipv4 it is a 32bit binary number as I said before it's divided into four sets of eight called octets These are separated by periods or decimals each octet is 8 Bits which equals 1 byte we often represent ipv V4 addresses in a human friendly format that's called dotted decimal now when we look at this address 192.168.1 n that is an IP address but we don't know which portion is the network or which portion is the host to be able to resolve this it requires the use of a mask which determines or defines which portion is which this mask is called the subnet mask and the subnet mask has the same format as the IP address as in its 32 bits and it's represented in dotted decimal format so let's take a look at how an IP address and subnet mask operate together so we're going to begin with 1 192.168.1 n with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 now the 1 192.168.1 n is the IP address like I said and the other portion the 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask and it's easiest to show how the subnet masks by converting that dotted decimal back into binary so we can do that by deconstructing the IP address so the first octet would be 1 one followed by 6 Z that equals 192 the second octet is 1011 followed by three zeros that equals 168 that third octet is real easy it's seven zeros followed by a one and then we have the fourth octet which is four zeros a one two zeros and a one that equals N9 now if we deconstruct the subnet mask what we have is we have three octets that are full of ones and one octet that's full of zeros that represents that 255.255.255.0 now if we put the subnet mask under the representation of the IP address anything that's not covered by a one in the subnet mask is a part of the host address everything that is covered by a one is the network address so what we have for that IP address is that 1 192.168.1 is the network portion of the address and the node portion of the address is the nine and that's how the IP address and subnet mask work together to define the network and the node now that concludes this session on the introduction to ipv4 part one we talked about the purpose of Ip addressing and then we moved on to some ipv4 address properties now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure we'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on the introduction to ipv4 part two today we're going to talk about classes of ipv4 addresses and then we're going to move on to classless ipv4 addressing and we will conclude with a brief discussion on subnetting ipv4 addresses there's a whole lot of technical information to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session let's begin by talking about classes of ipv4 addresses Internet Protocol version 4 ipv4 is a binary addressing scheme that's used for networking it was initially finalized as a standard in 1981 ipv4 is a common Network addressing scheme that is still being deployed today there is an issue though with ipv4 because of its structure and the growth and popularity of the internet most of the world has run out of assignable ipv4 addresses but thanks to some forethought it's still a valid scheme today we need to talk about classes of ipv4 addresses and we begin with a class class a network address Class A networks have an address range of 0 to 127 in the first octet that gives us addresses from 0.0.0.0 up to 12725 five. 255.255 the first octed on the left has a binary representation that always begins with a zero this gives us a possible 16 million 7772144 host addresses and the subnet mask with a Class A network is always 255.0.0.0 then there are class B Network addresses they have an address range of 128 to 191 in the first octet that means that class B networks can have a range of 128.0 do0 .0 up to 191 255.255.255.0 host and the subnet mask used with a class spe network is always 255.255.0.0 then there are class c network addresses and they have an address range in the first octet of 192 up to 223 that means that we have an address range of 1920. z.0 up through 223 255.255.255.0 Class C Network address give us a possible 254 post addresses or node addresses and the subnet mask with a Class C is always 255.255.255.0 the last class of address that you need to concern yourself with is the class D Network address it has an address range of 224 up through 239 in the first octave which means that it can range from 2240 up through 239 255 255.255 and that first octed on the left has a binary representation of 1 1 1 0 so the first four bits are always taken and they are always 1 1 1 0 now subnet masks are not defined for class D networking class FD Network addresses are used for multicast communication and finally we have a special class of addresses well kind of a class of addresses and that involves automatic private IP addressing a Pippa in some cases the dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP process May Fail in these cases a node or host will selfconfigure an aipa address address now with an apipa address the first two octets are always 168 254 and if you see that in your IP configuration you know that you have a DHCP problem so one of the first methods that they used to conserve the ipv4 address space was they broke them out into public and private IP addresses public IP addresses are routable and being routable means that each public IP address is unique there can only be one now public IP addresses are not flexible you are assigned to your network space you're not really given a choice what your public IP address is going to be and then there are the private IP addresses these are non routable they do not need to be completely unique throughout the world they only have to be unique on their Network the first one that we're going to discuss is the class A license there is only one class a license you have a possible address range of 10.0.0.0 up through 10. they have an address range of 172.16.0.0 up through 17231 255.255 and last but not least is the Class C license there are 256 Class C licenses with a possible address range of 192.168.0.0 up through 192.168.255.255 5255 now private IP addressing is highly flexible you get to assign the network space it's not assigned to you now let's move on to classless ipv4 addressing now the classes of addresses actually limited the flexibility of ipv4 part of the reason for that was that the first routing protocols required the class structure and you would think that with over 4 billion possible IP addresses that we'd still have flexibility but we really didn't classless addressing which is called classless interdomain routing or cider was developed to slow the growth of routing tables it also slowed the exhaustion of ipv4 addresses it also created much more flexibility the subnet mask becomes fluid it's not rigid with cider addressing it does not affect the private address space ranges though even though the subnet mask is now fluid you still only have those range of addresses available and with the introduction of classless addressing subnetting is now possible and it's highly desirable so let's take a look at how cider notation works and we'll begin with 192.168.0 N with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 is 192.168.0 N24 that sl24 represents all of the ones in the subnet mask and that's those first three octets on the left the 255.255.255.0 255.0.0.0 but it now becomes fluid with cider we can take it and we can make it a 192.168.1 128.0 sl23 and what that really represents that sl23 is a subnet mask of 255.255 128.0 and that gives us a network of 192.168.1 128.0 which actually gives us a Host range of 192 .1 1681 1281 through 192.168.1 129. 254 that gives us 512 host addresses as opposed to the possible 254 now the broadcast address for that Network would be 192.168.1 129. 255 so now let's move on on to subnetting ipv4 addresses so what is subnetting well subnetting Cuts address spaces into smaller pieces it takes one range of addresses and splits it this creates flexibility and network design and creates efficiency in address space utilization so let's take a look at an example of subnetting and this will involve a small office Network so originally we have a network address of 22315 1.024 this is a Class C private Network and it gives us a possible 254 hosts available why only 254 well because a host cannot be assigned to the network address which is 22315 1.0 and it can't use the broadcast address which is 22315 15.125 in this example with this network address all the hosts in the network can see all the other nodes now let's say that for security considerations you want to split this into two networks well you can do this using subnetting so what you do is you take that sl24 Network and you create two25 networks and those would be 22315 1.0 25 and 22351 do1 12825 in this situation the first Network's host address range would be 22351 up through 22315 do11 126 and why is that well because you can't use the network address which is 22315 1.0 and you can't use the broadcast address which is is 22351 1227 the second address range that would be created through this subnetting process would give us a Host range of 22315 do11 129 up through 22315 1.254 that's because you can't use the network address which is 22351 1228 and you can't use the broadcast address which is to 23151 255 each of those subnets would have 126 possible host addresses so you took your possible 254 hosts available in one network and you broke it down so that that you now have two separate networks each that's capable of having 126 hosts and that's an example of subnetting an ipv4 address now that concludes this session on the introduction to ipv4 part two I talked about classes of ipv4 addresses I then moved on to classless ipv4 addressing and we concluded with a brief discussion on subnetting ipv4 addresses now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the introduction to IPv6 today we're going to be talking about the IPv6 address structure and then we're going to move on to IPv6 Network transmissions and with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by by talking about the IPv6 address structure now IPv6 is the answer to the question of what do we do about running out of ipv4 addresses unlike ipv4 IPv6 will provide enough Internet Protocol IP addresses for the foreseeable future now shortly after the creation of ipv4 and its implementation the the organization that's tasked with assigning routable IP addresses realized the available ipv4 address space would not be enough in very short order if nothing was done the an then set about creating the replacement and they initially started by working on ipv5 while they were working on ipv5 they found that due to the popularity of the internet which was increasing at that point in time that it wasn't going to be enough so they scrapped ipv5 and began working on IPv6 now the I is confident that IPv6 will function as the replacement for ipv4 for many decades to come why are they so confident well we'll get to that here in just a moment now IPv6 works at layer three of the OSI model just like ipv4 does layer three of the OSI model is also known as the network layer and its major focus is logical Network and host addressing ipv 6's job is to provide logical Network and host addressing to devices IPv6 is a 128bit binary addressing scheme as opposed to ipv 4's 32 bits the 128 bits are grouped together in sets with each set being separated by a colon now each of these sets is 2 bytes long and a bite is 8 Bits for human readability kind of the binary IPv6 number is converted to hexadecimal that's base 16 with each hexadecimal number being equal to four bits now those four bits can actually be referred to as a nibble because it's half of a bite and IPv6 address is eight sets of four hexadecimal numbers each being separated by a colon that means that there are over 340 undecillion addresses available to IPv6 that's 2 to the 128 power which is roughly equal to 340 * 10 to the 36th power see that number there I'm not even going to begin to read that one to you so now let's talk about ipv 6's local ad address structure for the local address the first 64 bits on the left represent the local network and the last 64 bits on the right always represent the host the local address structure follows the eui or extended unique identifier format specifically the eui 64 format for those hosts that have a 48bit MAC address that 48 bits is actually padded with an extra 16 bits to make it 64 bits in length you can always tell a local address which is also called the link local address as it always begins with an fe80 with IPv6 every device gets both a local address and it gets a global address now the global address is unique there is only one and every device gets one the host address is still always the last 64 bits but every device actually gets assigned to a Global Network the network portion is actually composed of a routing prefix and a subnet this portion of the global address structure follows the classless in domain routing or cider convention with the number that follows the slash denoting the routing prefix that's the part of the extremely Global Network that you belong to the subnet is composed of the bits between the prefix and the eui 64 host address Global IPv6 addresses always begin in the range of 2,000 up through 3,999 in that first group of numbers on the left now in most cases the need for dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP has been eliminated when implemented IPv6 will autoconfigure both the local and the global addresses that are required for their networks when a device first comes online it will use the neighbor Discovery protocol NDP to discover what the required Network addresses are both the local and Global addresses this allows devices to configure its own IPv6 address without an administrator's inter intervention so let's talk about IPv6 notation the 128bit nature of IPv6 makes it cumbersome to write out and it can take up unnecessary space because of this some rules were developed to ease the burden and save space when you're looking at a group of IPv6 numbers any leading zeros in a set can be dropped the thing to really remember about IPv6 is that only a single set of consecutive zeros may be replaced with the double colon why is that well because if you could do it more than once how would routers and other devices know how many zeros to pad in there even with this ability to shorten it it's still difficult for us to remember IPv6 addresses but it is still easier to write out and it still conserves space within systems now let's move on to types of ipv 6 Network transmissions and we begin with the unicast unicast is on toone communication that is where a specific device is sending Network traffic to another specific device unicast can occur on the local network which remember always begins with fe80 or it can occur on the global Network then there's multicast which is one to a few communication with multicast a specific device is sending Network traffic to a specific group of devices that have registered to receive that traffic routers register to receive multicast Transmissions that involve the routing protocols that they are programmed to use with IPv6 multicast addresses always begin with an FF both IPv6 and ipv4 use both unicast and multicast Transmissions a unique type of transmission to IPv6 is anycast anycast is one to the closest communication this is where a specific device is sending Network traffic to a specific IPv6 address that has been assigned to multiple devices the router only sends the communication to the closest one at least from its perspective any cast transmission involves implementing DHCP V6 earlier I said we really don't need to worry about DHCP anymore but that's only partially true while IPv6 is capable of autoc configuring its own local and Global addresses in certain situations that's not always desirable DHCP V6 version 6 can be configured to hand out specific IPv6 addresses or duplicate IPv6 addresses when necessary that's useful for when load balancing a network or when Network redundancy has been created or when you have a user that has a tablet a cell phone and a laptop and you want to deliver the transmission to the closest device the device that he's using at that point in time that is where DHCP V6 comes in handy IPv6 and ipv4 are not compatible but we can do what's called a dual stack configuration that's where the network and devices on the network receive both an IPv6 configuration and an ipv4 configuration or we can use what's called tunneling there's 6 to4 tunneling which is used to encapsulate an IPv6 data packet and an ipv4 datagram allowing that IPv6 packet to travel across or through an all ipv4 Network 6 to4 tunneling can also be called too tunneling now that concludes this session on the introduction to IPv6 I talked about the IPv6 address structure and then I talked about IPv6 Network Transmissions now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to casit session on special IP networking Concepts today I'm going to be talking about the media Access Control address and then I'm going to talk about the difference between Collision domains and broadcast domains and we're going to conclude with types of network Transmissions there's a whole bunch of technical information to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session let's begin the formal part of this session by discuss assing the media Access Control address all networking interfaces come with their own special address already configured that would be the media Access Control address the MAC address the MAC address is often referred to as the physical address or the burned in address of the interface while Mac addresses may be changed or spoofed most often it's set by the manufacturer and never actually changes now switches and other OSI layer 2 devices rely upon that Mac address in order to get network packets to their correct destinations the MAC address has a specific format actually it has two specific formats one is 48 bits in length and the other is 64 bits in length and both of them are represented by hexadecimal numbers both formats can be broken down into two parts the organizationally unique identifier or UI and the extended unique identifier the eui The Institute of electrical and electronic Engineers the it Triple E assigns all electronic manufacturers their own oui which always makes up the first portion of the MAC address each manufacturer then assigns its own eui to each device that is produced usually it is the serial number of that device theoretically no two interfaces will have the same Mac address I need to mention the eui 64 format IPv6 requires that the node address or the MAC address be in an eui 64 format so that Mac address has to be 64 bits in length if the eui of the interface is only 24 bits in length it is actually split into two parts and 16 bits of padding are added to create the eui 64 format now let's discuss the difference between Collision domains and broadcast domains before I can talk about Collision domains and broadcast domains I need to talk about carrier sense multiple access with Collision detection all ethernet networks use this technology also called csma with CD when transmitting data in an Ethernet Network all ethernet devices have equal access to the network media and are capable of transmitting data at any time this can lead to data collisions with csmac CD a device listens to the carrier signal on the network media if no other device is transmitting the device is free to send data if another device sends data at the same time a collision is possible which can corrupt the data the devices listen for collisions that's the Collision detection part if a collision occurs the devices will stop transmitting and wait a random period of time before attempting to transmit again to do this they use what is called a backoff algorithm with that out of the way now let me explain what Collision domains are Collision domains are an area of the network where packets or network traffic can Collide there are some devices that break up Collision domains they can be broken up by switches Bridges and routers but not by hubs on the other hand a broadcast domain is defined as all the nodes that can be reached by a broadcast transmission all the nodes that can be reached reside in the same network broadcast traffic cannot pass routers so the domain is also defined by the subnet mask and that subnet mask defines the network here's a special note technically IPv6 does not use broadcast Transmissions IPv6 replaces broadcast Transmissions with multicast transmissions and what do you know that's a good segue for us to discuss types of network Transmissions we're going to begin this section by talking about types of ipv4 network transmissions and first up is unicast unicast is a specific Source address transmission going to a specific Source destination address it can be thought of as on toone communication it's only two devices transferring data between each other then there's multicast transmission this is where a specific Source address transmission is going to a set of registered destination addresses this is one to a few communication routers often use multicast Transmissions to track their routes and to make changes to their routing tables and finally there are broadcast Transmissions this is where a specific Source address transmission is going to all addresses on the local network this can be considered as one to all communication because all devices on the local network are going to be able to receive this broadcast transmission so let's move on to types of IPv6 Network transmissions and IPv6 uses unicast just like ipv4 does IPv6 also uses multicast just like ipv4 where IPv6 differs is with any cast transmission any cast is where a specific Source address transmission is going to a specific IPv6 address that has been assigned to multiple devices the router uses an algorithm to determine which Mac address that has that specially configured IPv6 address is closest and only that device receives the anycast transmission anycast can be considered as one to the closest communication that concludes this session on special IP networking Concepts I talked about the MAC address I talked about the differences between a collision domain and a broadcast domain and then I concluded with a discussion on the types of network transmission now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on introduction to routing Concepts part one today I'm going to talk about the purpose of routing and then I'm going to move on to some basic routing Concepts there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session first up is the purpose of routing the basic purpose of routing is to connect different networ NWS together to allow them to communicate and pass data traffic between them most often routing Protocols are how networks determine where to send Network traffic that's the routes that they will take and these routing protocols build Maps actually they build routing tables but we'll get to that later that they use for directing Network traffic routing is what makes this interconnected World function as well as it does networking would be pure chaos without it as we'd have no idea where to send traffic now let's move on to some basic routing Concepts first up is static routing static routing uses administrator defined routes each router in a static routing configuration must contain the route a static route from router a to router B requires that router B has a static route back to router a in order for twoway communication to take place if we had a static route from A to B and B didn't have one back to a a could send traffic to B but B could not send traffic back to a now static routing is easy to set up in small networks but it's not so easy to maintain networks change all the time with static routing when a change occurs in routers the administrator has to go around to each router and Implement that change then there's Dynamic routing this is where routers use protocols in order to determine the best route between two networks the administrator determines which protocols will be used on the routers in order for the routers to communicate they must all be using the same protocols there is an exception to that and that's route redistribution an administrator can configure a router to take one Dynamic protocol and transform it into a different routing protocol to be used from that point on this is the only case when routing protocols can be different across the network routing protocols can be stacked within a router that means that there can be more than one Dynamic routing protocol programmed into a router Dynamic routing is very fluid and Dynamic and it's what makes possible today's interconnected world the next concept is the default route the default route is the direction that a router will send Network traffic when there is no known route in the routing table the default route is assigned by an administrator it is usually a designated interface on the router or it is the next designated next hop interface then then there is the routing table the routing table is a list of known routes to all known networks from the router's perspective it is established by an administrator when static routing is used it is dynamically built by routing protocols when Dynamic routing is employed each routing protocol maintains its own routing table different routing protocols may have different routes to the same network the loop back interface is an administratively configured logical number assigned to a router to ease administrative functions or routing processes often the loop back interface is assigned in an ipv4 address format even when ipv4 isn't used on the router many routing protocols have been designed to take the loop back interface into a when performing administrative functions the loop back interface may be completely logical or a physical interface may be assigned to be the loop back interface let's move on to routing Loops a routing Loop is a possible problem that can be created if interconnected routers have a breakdown in their routing algorithms when a routing Loop occurs Network traffic keeps looping through the routers until some system or mechanism breaks the cycle routing Loops can create network congestion or even bring down a network routing protocols use multiple methods to prevent routing Loops from occurring one of the main methods that they use is What's called the time to live field or the TTL field the TTL field keeps track of how long that packet has been in existence and how far it has traveled and after a specified amount of time or distance it will inform the next router to drop it this helps to prevent routing Loops that concludes this session on the introduction to routing Concepts part one I talked about the purpose of routing and then I moved on to some basic routing Concepts now on behalf of pacit thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on introduction to routing Concepts part two today I'm going to be talking about routing metrics routing aggregation and then I'm going to conclude with a brief discussion on high availability we have a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about routing metrics it is quite common for there to be more than one route available to a remote Network routing protocols use metrics to determine which route is the best route to reach those remote networks each routing protocol will use its own set of metrics in determining which routes to which networks are placed in its routing table the same basic metric may be used by different routing protocols but when this occurs the metric is usually implemented in a different manner through the use of different algorithms the first metric that we're going to discuss is the hop count the hop count is the number of routers between two end points this is determined from the center router's perspective the maximum transmission unit or MTU is another metric that is used by routing protocols the MTU is the maximum allowed size of a packet measured in bytes that's allowed through an interface the standard MTU for ethernet is 1,500 bytes packets that exceed the MTU must be fragmented into smaller pieces leading leading to more packets leading to a slower connection bandwidth is another common routing metric bandwidth is a measure of the speed of the network connection the speed is commonly measured in either kilobits per second megabits per second or gigabits per second another common metric is latency latency is a measure of time that a packet takes to Traverse a length when latency is implemented by routing protocols the total amount of latency or delay to go in to end between two points is what is used in the metric the administrative distance or add is probably the most important metric that's used on routers the administrative distance is the believability of a routing protocol's advertised routes different routing Protocols are considered to be more believable or trustworthy than others routers use the ad to help determine which routing protocol to use when more than one protocol is installed on the router the lowest ad of an advertised route will determine the protocol that's used there are some common standard administrative distance first up is the directly connected route that's a direct link between two routers that has an ad of zero and it is the most believable or trustworthy of routes next is the statically configured route it has an ad of One external border Gateway protocol has an ad of 20 it's still fairly trustworthy internal eigrp has an ad of 90 it's not as trustworthy as BG GP but it is more trustworthy than ospf open shortest path first which has an ad of 110 Isis has an ad of 115 so not quite as believable as ospf but more believable than rip which has an ad of 120 external eigrp has an ad of 170 and internal bgp and I've never seen internal bgp used has an ad of 200 now if you see an administrative distance of 255 that means that that route is not believable at all as a side note the ad can be set by an administrator so if you are running both ospf and Isis on a router but you want Isis to be used you could actually set osf's ad to a higher number than Isis and then Isis would always be used before ospf now let's move on to Route aggregation without some mechanism put in place routing tables would soon become very large and highly inefficient through careful Planning Network administrators use a process called route aggregation to condense the sign of routing tables they do so through the use of classless interdomain routing CER to summarize routes to different networks route aggregation is common in networking let's take a look at an example of Route aggregation suppose we have a router that has the following networks on its serial 0/1 interface it has 10.1.1 024 known on that interface 10.1.1 17.0 sl24 101320 sl24 and 10.1.1 128.0 sl24 all of those networks are known to that interface that S01 interface these routes are what are known as contiguous routes they're all in a line they can be summarized or aggregated by a common cider entry in the routing table they could all be summarized by the following entry 10.1.0 sl16 now there is a warning about route aggregation route aggregation takes careful planning during the network design phase that above example would not work if the serial interface 1/1 on on that same router was connected to network 10.1.2 sl24 because that new network makes those networks on on the 01 interface noncontiguous networks All the known networks are no longer all in a road this leads to the fact that the routes could no longer be aggregated or summarized let's conclude with a discussion on high availability part of a network administrator's job is to ensure that networks remain up and active for the maximum amount of time in an effort to ensure that networks don't go down administrators often remove single points of failure a single point of failure in a network is the point where a single failure will cause the network to cease functioning Network administrators often use high availability techniques in order to remove those single points of failure an example of a high availability technique is the use of redundant links to outside networks hot standby router protocol hsrp is a specific example of a high availability technique hsrp is a proprietary Cisco method of creating a fault tolerant link using two or more routers with connections outside of the local subnet the two routers are connected together as well as having connections outside of the local network a virtual IP address is created and shared between the two routers devices on the network are configured to use that virtual IP address as their default gateway for packets leaving the network if a single router goes down the link outside of the network is still available another high availability technique is Virtual Router redundancy protocol vrp it is an ietf internet engineering task force standard that is similar in operation to hsrp that concludes this session on the introduction to routing Concepts part two I discussed some routing metrics then I moved on to Route aggregation and I concluded with a brief discussion on high availability on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing some more hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the introduction to routing protocols today we're going to be talking talking about some of the differences between interior and exterior Gateway routing protocols we will introduce some more routing Concepts and then we will end with routing protocols in themselves there's a whole lot of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and jump into this session let's begin with a comparison between interior and exterior Gateway protocols interior Gateway protocols or igps are a category of protocols used within autonomous networks autonomous networks are networks that you control or that are under the control of a single organization the most popular igp Protocols are OSF open shortest path first and rip version two that's routing information protocol version two now there is a special mention here and that's Isis which is intermediate system to intermediate system Isis is popular with extremely large autonomous networks like an isps or internet service providers Network exterior Gateway protocols on the other hand are a category of protocols used between nonautonomous networks so egps are used between Networks that are controlled by different organizations or entities the most popular EGP protocol is border Gateway protocol now it's not uncommon for organizations to have more than one network that they are routing traffic between these are called autonomous networks some igp routing protocols use an administrator defined autonomous system number or as number as one means of identifying which networks can directly communicate with each other the autonomous system number is not a metric but a means of identifying a network that might possibly accept another Network's traffic something to remember is that the as is only significant within autonomous networks and has no relevance outside of them now let's move on to more routing Concepts routing protocols can be classified by how they perform their routing interior Gateway and EGP routing protocols can be broken out into three other categories of protocols which is designated by their main method of determining routes between networks the first class of routing Protocols are distance Vector routing protocols with distant Vector routing protocols the the routes are determined by by how many routers exist between the source and the destination the efficiency of the links in the selected route is not taken into consideration with distance Vector protocols periodically the whole routing table is broadcast out onto the network then there are link state routing protocols metrics are used to determine the best possible route between destinations doesn't really matter how many hops there are once the route has been established these protocols then only monitor the state of directly connected links and only make changes to their routing tables when changes to the links occur with link state routing protocols only changes in link status are broadcasted and finally there are hybrid routing protocols these use aspects of both the distance vector and Link state routing protocol let's talk about the next hop the next hop is the next router in the path between two points the next hop is often designated by an interface address of the device that is receiving the data or by that router's name or by that router's location the routing table is the database table that is used by a router to determine the best possible route between two points different routing protocols use different algorithms to place routes in the routing table the next concept is Convergence convergence can be thought of as steady state convergence is measured in the amount of time that it takes all of the routers in an autonomous system to learn all of the possible routes within that system faster convergence times hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on basic elements of unified Communications today I'm going to be talking about unified Communications and then I'm going to move on to some unified communication Concepts and then I'm going to end with voice over IP and with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I will begin this session by talking about Unified communication now unified Communications is not encompassed by a single product or device it's a growing category in the Enterprise Network unified communication or UC is the set of products and services that attempts to provide a consistent single user interface and experience across different media types and different devices UC allows a user to send a message from one type of media as an email and have that media received as a different type of media that email could become a text message or a voicemail so now let's talk about some unified communication devices first up is the UC server these are specialized servers which quite often are virtual in nature that are designed to implement unified communication solution Solutions in the workplace the UC servers work in conjunction with UC gateways a UC Gateway is a network device that is designed to translate between different signaling methods as in a voice over IP Gateway which will translate an analog public switched telephone Network voice signal into a signal that can be understood on the VoIP Network there are some other UC devices any device that can be used in the implementation of a unified communication solution is considered a UC device they may include but are not limited to VoIP phones email systems video conferencing systems and instant messaging networks now let's move on to some unified Communications Concepts the first concept that we're going to discuss is presence now presence is an indicator that is used to communicate the willingness or ability of a user to accept communication common presence statuses include available online offline busy and do not disturb present services are an important service provided in UC Solutions as they will track the individual users across multiple devices and networks in real time through the use of multicast Transmissions once a communication session has been established multicast communication is dropped and unicast network Transmissions are used another UC concept that you need to grasp is quality of service quality of service techniques are implemented to improve unified communication by managing Network traffic the most common implementation of quality of service is class of service cosos cosos is a quality of service technique that's used to manage Network traffic by grouping similar types of traffic and assigning a network priority to that traffic as in unified communication traffic is given a higher priority than email a sixbit differentiated service code point dscp is used in the IP header to establish the cosos or class of service now let's move on to voice over IP VoIP is one of the most common implementations in a unified Communications solution through the use of a present service calls can be routed to the correct location for where the user is at two important protocols used in voice over IP are session initiation protocol Sip and realtime transport protocol RTP sip has two purposes first it is used to establish a communication session between two endpoints the other purpose is that once the session is completed sip tears down that connection between the two end points during the communication session RTP is used as the transport call helping to provide that quality of service through cosos to the endpoints now that concludes this session on the basic elements of unified communication I talked about unified Communications then I moved on to some unified communication Concepts and I concluded with a brief discussion on voice over IP now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on virtualization Technologies today I'm going to be discussing the difference between a hypervisor and virtual machine manager then I'm going to move on to components of virtualization and then I'm going to have a brief discussion on softwar defined networking I have a whole lot of information to impart not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with hypervisors and virtual machine managers so what is the difference between a hypervisor and a virtual machine manager the difference could be nothing or the difference could be everything some people use the term hypervisor very broadly they use it to refer to any of the software that is used to manage virtual machines others will differentiate between the two terms in this way a hypervisor does not need a host operating system while a virtual machine manager or vmm requires a host operating system such as Microsoft Windows Apple OS X or a Linux operating system well the hypervisor can operate as its own operating system with that covered let's talk about some of the components of virtualization first up is the virtual desktop a virtual desktop is a virtual machine or VM that functions as a desktop now any modern operating system can be run inside of a VM desktop multiple virtual desktops may be hosted on or from a single host system then there are virtual servers which surprisingly is a virtual machine that functions as a server any modern server operating system can be used in a virtual server environment multiple virtual servers may be hosted on or from a single host guess what there are then virtual switches firewalls and routers these are virtual machines that fulfill the functions of the switch firewall and router router virtual firewalls and routers are particularly effective when they're combined with virtual network interface controllers or virtual Nicks and virtual switches to create virtual networks speaking of virtual networks an important consideration for when designing a virtual network is how that virtual network is going to pass traffic to remote networks or networks outside of the host system virtual ization by its nature leads to either an open and highly scalable Network or a closed selfcontained system it is possible to create a completely selfcontained network with all of the virtual components and never have Network traffic leave the host machine but if there is a desire or need for that Network traffic to pass beyond the host system then that function needs to be specifically granted a connection must be created between the host systems physical Nick and the virtual networking equipment to allow Network traffic to pass through the physical host system next up softwar defined networking softwar defined networking or sdn is the process of allowing the administration and configuration of a network to be done dynamically with s the end the administrator uses a frontend program to make adjustments to the network this program sends the instructions to the networking equipment which is then reconfigured to perform as the administrator desires sdn can allow Network administrators to dynamically adjust Network performance without the need to log into each individual device that needs to be adjusted to achieve the desired performance sdn is considered to still be an emerging technology but sdn also works well for virtual networks and cloud computing now that concludes this session on virtualization technology I talked about hypervisors and virtual machine managers then I moved on to a brief discussion on some components of virtualization and I concluded with another brief discussion on softwar defined networking on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on storage area networks today I'm going to discuss the justification for storage area networks and then I'm going to talk about storage area Network Technology and with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with justifications for storage area networks there have been several factors that have led to the increased demand for data storage one of them has been the dramatic decrease in the actual cost of data storage it actually costs us less now for storage on a per gigabyte basis than it has in the past what has happened is that as the cost of storage has decreased the demand for storage has increased dramatically businesses are now generating an analyzing huge amounts of data in an effort to create a competitive Advantage think big data I'm sure you've heard about Big Data recently or this increase in data collection has led to an increased demand for storage capacity another factor is that as the demand for data has increased it has needed to be more available which means that there has been a need to be able to access that data from anywhere and the accessibility is needed to be increased as well including from nonstandard devices a storage area network or san can be a solution to the need for both storage capacity and high availability there are several advantages to the storage area network first off is scalability the amount of data that is being generated today is huge this has led to a need to store that data the sand is more scalable than other options as your storage needs increase the capacity of the sand can be easily increased to meet that storage need then there's dat data availability the demand has also increased for that data to be available at any time from anywhere and a sand can play a vital role in creating that accessibility one of the most popular implementations of a sand is to deploy it as part of a cloud computing solution this increases the availability of that data that's being stored on the sand and finally there's optimization as the requirements to store data are removed from application servers those servers can then be optimized to run those applications much more efficiently at the same time data storage is also optimized it's time now to discuss some San technology the storage area network or san and the network attached storage or NZ often get confused with one another but they are different the sand is an actual network of devices that have the sole purpose of storing data efficiently on the other hand the NZ is a specifically designed Network appliance that has been configured to store data more efficiently than standard storage methods the difference is that a NZ is a data storage appliance that is placed on a network while a San is a network data storage devices it is not uncommon for a San to contain multiple NZ devices with all of that data storage capabilities several technologies have been developed to ease the transmission of that data the first one that we're going to discuss is fiber channel or FC fiber channel is a highe network technology that was originally developed to operate over fiber optic cables only since its introduction the standards have been modified to allow the use of copper cabling in conjunction with fiber optic cabling fiber channel is commonly used to connect to Sands when fiber channel is implemented it uses the fiber channel protocol or FCP as its transport protocol to transmit scuzzy commands so it transmits small computer system interface commands to storage devices as in the nas appliances so a San implements FCP as opposed to TCP as its transport protocol when fiber channel is used another technology that was developed was internet scuzzy or I scuzzy I scuzzy is an IP based networking standard that is used to connect data storage facilities and Sands I scuzzy allows for scuzzy commands and processes to take place over longer distances than the original scuzzy implementation jumbo frames are also allowed within the San environment jumbo frames allow for greater throughput of data by allowing up to 9,000 bytes of data to be in a single frame this can greatly increase the efficiency of a sand as a comparison the standard frame on an Ethernet Network can only be a maximum of 1,500 bytes now that concludes this session on storage area networks I talked about the justification for storage area networks and then I concluded with a brief discussion on some San technology on behalf of pit thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on basic Cloud Concepts today we're going to be talking about Cloud classifications and then we will conclude with different types of cloud computing there's a fair amount of information to cover so let's go ahead and Dive Right In I will begin our session with a discussion about Cloud classifications cloud computing is where the resources on the network are not actually physical in nature they are provided to the enduser virtually cloud computing can lead to a very fluid and dynamic environment as the required resources are normally only provisioned or supplied as needed and are decommissioned or shut down once their use is is done most often these virtual resources are not owned by the company or user that uses them but are provided by a service provider while cloud computing is highly configurable and changeable it does have some basic structures that are used in the classification of the type of cloud that is in use the first classification of cloud computing that we're going to talk about is the public cloud this is where systems can interact with services and devices within the public cloud and on public networks like over the internet and possibly with other public clouds the public cloud is where the services that are provided are not just provided to a specific user but are open for the public to purchase and use then there are private clouds this is where systems only communicate with with services and devices within a specific private Cloud a private cloud is essentially just that private the only users who have access to it are ones who are authorized to use it the cloud classification can be hybrid it can combine aspects of both the public and private clouds and last up there are Community clouds this is where cloud services are used by private individuals organizations or groups that have a common interest now let's move on to different types of cloud computing because of the nature of cloud computing it is very configurable to the needs and desires of the purchaser of the cloud services purchasers have many options beyond the type of cloud services that they want to provision they must also determine what type of service they are going to require from the most basic of services to the most highly complex of services the purchaser needs to have a plan going into cloud computing in order for it to be efficient and effective for them so now let's move on to some of those services that cloud computing can offer first up is software as a service the enduser purchases the rights to use an application or software without the need to configure the virtual servers that will deliver the application to them it is usually delivered as a web app or web application opened and used from within a web browser but not always if you have a subscription to Microsoft Office 365 you are utilizing software as a service then there is platform as a service or paas the user is provided with a development platform platform for the creation of software packages without the need to configure the virtual servers and the infrastructure that delivers it you are essentially renting server or computing power in order to develop your software packages paas is more complex than software as a service and finally we have infrastructure as a service this is where the enduser is provided with access to Virtual servers configurable by the customer and other virtual network resources their infrastructure is actually virtually provided to them this creates a highly configurable environment in which customers can create the resources and the performance that they require the enduser supplies the software that's going to be used on the IAS Network or they purchase it as an additional software as a service service as you could have guessed from that last statement it's not uncommon for the type of cloud computing being utilized by an organization to be a mix some departments May rely upon and use infrastructure as a service while the development team will only utilize a platform as a service service part of the advantage of cloud computing is that the purchaser only needs to initialize and pay for resources as they are needed in a private Cloud situation it is possible for an organization that is using it to actually own the cloud resources if they do own the cloud resources they may have it on site or they may pay to have those resources hosted off site that way they can offload the maintenance cost of maintaining those resources now that concludes this session on basic Cloud Concepts I talked about different Cloud classifications and then I concluded with a brief discussion on types of cloud computing now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on implementing a basic Network today we're going to discuss plan the network and then configure the network there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and dive into this session of course I'm going to begin with plan the network so you need a simple small office home office Network create just plug two PCS into a single Hub and you have a very basic network but doesn't it achieve what you want how do you know if you don't have a plan a network plan is vital when implementing any network more complicated than the most very basic of networks that plan should cover what you are hoping to achieve and how you are going to get there in addition to your expertise you are also going to need input from your end users nothing is quite so frustrating as to delivering the network that you've planned and built and having the customer tell you that it is not what they wanted or needed let's talk about that Network plan in a little bit more detail the first thing that you should do is create a list of requirements now in order to make that list you need to Define why the network is needed that will help you to Define what network features are required then you need to Define the scope or size of the network once you have those they will help to establish a budget to implement that Network once you know why the network is needed and what features are required then you can work on network design in network design you need to determine what equipment is needed to implement that Network part of the design is also how the network will be organized and how shared resources will be placed on the network when you're planning the network something that you should also consider are compatibility issues you need to know what standards are in use now and what standards will there be in the future included in those compatibility issues are does any current equipment that is required need specific cabling or connectors in order to be installed that is something that often gets overlooked your Network plan also needs to deal with network cabling runs your internal connections how many node connections will be required and where how will you plan for future expansion that future expansion is more than likely going to require more internal connections you should build in some tolerance for future expansion then you need to consider external connections how will the network connect to the outside where will that Wan connection come into your building and where will your equipment be placed so that it can reach those Wan connections that is also part of the network equipment placement plan part of that plan also needs to consider if there is a wiring or equipment closet and where it's going to be located if you do have a wiring or equipment closet are there environmental considerations about placing the equipment in there is it too hot is it too cold is it too hum humid or is it too dry you need to think about those things when you're placing your network equipment your plan should also cover how Network Security will be implemented Are there specific types of firewall and placement considerations for those firewalls will virtual local area networks be required and if so how many also how will your switch Port security be implemented all of these go into a successful Network plan now let's talk about configuring the network here are some network configuration considerations for you first up how will your clients receive their Internet Protocol addresses their IP addresses using static IP address configuration creates a higher level of security but it's harder to manage you could use Dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses from a preconfigured pool but your security may be a little bit lower if you do so if you do use DHCP you might want to consider using Mac filtering Mac filtering will only allow specified Mac addresses that physical burned in address onto the network it is an effective security measure but kind of like static IP addressing it can be difficult to control and manage especially as the network grows something else to consider is that if a server will be hosted on the network that needs to be accessed from outside of that Network as in you're hosting a web server then you're going to need a demilitarized zone a DMZ the DMZ is an area of the network in which outside connections are allowed while the internal Network remains protected from that outside traffic a DMZ will require a custom configuration of the firewall in most implementations two firewalls are used but it's not necessary to use two firewalls talking about firewalls firewall placement and configuration considerations are next most small office home office Wan connection devices as in their cable modems are DSL modems include firewall service that are sufficient in most cases for those small simple networks but if a DMZ needs to be deployed the best method is to introduce an additional router in firewall into the network with the DMC residing between the WAN equipment and the new router firewall combination another aspect of deploying a DMZ is that port forwarding should also be used at the router firewall level port forwarding is used to direct requests for specific resources like a request for a web page to the computer that has the resource let's move on to wireless network configuration considerations the first thing to consider in a wireless network is the name of the wireless network that's the service set identifier the SSID now the SSID can be set to broadcast in the clear alternatively the SSID can be set for the broadcast to be hidden some people consider hiding the SSID broadcast as a security measure but it really doesn't work that way it doesn't stop the broadcast it only hides the broadcast a packet sniffer can easily see those broadcasts and those broadcast packets can be easily interpreted so hiding the SSID is not an effective security measure but it does make things a little bit more difficult the next aspect of wireless network configuration that you need to consider is encryption first off I will say you need to have encryption on your wireless network not only that but you need to turn it on by default wireless routers and wireless access points waps do not have encryption enabled and at the minimum your encryption type should could be WPA2 personal that's at the minimum some wireless network equipment comes with a service that is called Wii protected setup WPS and if it does it's enabled by default this should be turned off and not used as it creates a weakness in the wireless network why is that well because WPS can be easily exploited by an attacker the network that you implement may not be exactly what you planned so document any changes to the plan undoubtedly during the process of implementing that plan some changes will be introduced some by you and some By Request of the end user always document those changes to the plan and have the end user sign off on them then be sure to incorporate those changes into the final Network documentation now that concludes this session on implementing a basic Network I talked about plan the network and then I talked about configure the network on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it T's session on analyzing monitoring reports today I'm going to talk about Baseline reports and then I'm going to move on to just reports in general I have a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and jump into this session and of course I'm going to begin by talking about baselines how do you know what constitutes good Network performance and what indicates that an issue is about to happen this is where Baseline documentation comes into play Baseline documentation provides a snapshot of the network when it is running efficiently at least hopefully when it's running efficiently baselines are usually kept as a log file at the minimum baselines should be established on CPU utilization and network bandwidth utilization you may also basemark other functions as you deem them to be relevant Network administrators should perform periodic tests against the Baseline to check to see if the Baseline is changed they will change over time and in order for Network administrators to know what constitutes good performance on their Network their baselines need to be current you can use Window performance monitor to help establish the baselines for your network let's talk about some of the items that should be considered for Baseline reports first up is Network device CPU utilization knowing the CPU utilization on a piece of equipment can help to determine when a network device is going to fail if your CPU utilization is constantly at 100% you know there's a problem that problem may be that it's going to fail or it may be that you need to install more network devices to take care of a growing network but you won't really know that if you're not baselining the CPU utilization Network device memory utilization should also be baselined it can help to determine when it is time to expand the memory of a network device a good item for baselining is bandwidth utilization this can help to determine the overall health of a network it can help to determine when Network segmentation should occur it can also help to determine if a network device is about to fail particularly if it's creating a storm of data Baseline utilization reports can help identifying when a security breach has occurred you might want to consider baselining your storage device utilization this can help to determine when storage utilization has become a bottleneck on the network where your storage device is actually causing the network to slow down because there's too much data being pushed into it which means that baselining your storage utilization can help determine when to increase the storage capacity of that Network you might also want to Baseline your wireless Channel utilization this can help to determine how saturated the wireless channels have become once it's been determined that your wireless channels are saturated a new wireless access point can be installed to alleviate the pressure and then you need to create a new Baseline for wireless Channel utilization this Baseline can also help to determine if there is unauthorized wireless access occurring on your wireless network especially if there is utilization on a channel that is not supposed to have any utilization now let's move on to analyzing reports before we talk about analyzing reports let's talk about log file management log files can accumulate data quickly and unfortunately some administrators only review log files after a major problem has occurred in most situations this is a case of too much information at the wrong time good administrators will set the proper reporting levels with their logging software they won't be logging all that debug information that level seven information unless of course they're actively debugging a system or application good administrators will review log files and compare them against their Baseline documentation they do this to find issues while the issues are still minor and before they become major log files should also be kept and archived in case there is a need for historical data when you do archive your log files you should follow the organization's data storage policy so something to consider is that you may want to create running graphs of important metrics that are captured by log files graphing the data gives a quick visual reference making it easier to spot issues and Trends many logging applications give the administrator the option of creating those graphs easily and quickly but then again they don't do you any good if you don't review them on a regular basis if you're having an issue with a router or link one of the first things that you want to do is you want to run an interface report now hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on network monitoring part one today we're going to be talking about the why of monitoring and then we're going to talk about tools to monitor the network there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and jump into this session I'm going to begin with the why of network monitoring how do you know what is going on in your network is it healthy or is it about to crash Network administrators really hate to be surprised by failures in their networks especially ones that could have been foreseen and therefore kept from happening how do they keep from being surprised well they enact a plethora of procedures and tools to monitor their networks and to keep track of how those networks are behaving they do this to reduce the surprise element now that we've covered the why of network monitoring let's talk about tools that you can use to monitor the network one of the main tools that Network administrators use to monitor their networks are log files all operating systems offer a means of viewing events that occur to that specific machine that also includes networking equipment there have been some applications that have been developed to monitor systems and networks that also generate log files among other actions that they can take log files can be used to help pinpoint when a problem occurred and to help narrow down the possible causes of that problem log files can also be used to help create a baseline of network Behavior so that you know what to expect from your network log files can usually be classified as being systems logs General logs or history logs as a general rule log files are an after Thea means of monitoring the network and they're not very good at realtime analysis that's partially due due to the sheer amount of information that log files can generate it's just too difficult to keep track of that in real time now let's talk about some specific logging tools that you can use the first one that I'm going to talk about is Event Viewer it's not really a log file in itself it comes with Windows server in most other Windows operating systems and this tool can be used to review Windows log files the most important log files that you can view from Event Viewer are application security and systems logs application logs contain events that are triggered by the actions of an application for example if you have live update enabled it will create log entries based on actions taken by live update then there are security logs these contain events that are triggered by security events for example some logs are created for successful and unsuccessful log on attempts then there are systems logs these contain events triggered by Windows systems components for example it will create an entry for when a driver starts or fails to start in either situation a log entry will be created now let's talk about a non Microsoft log and that would be CIS log CIS log was developed in the 1980s and it provides devices that normally would not be able to communicate with a means of delivering performance and problem information to systems administrators this permits there to be separation between the software that generates the message the storage of that message and the software that analyzes the generated message this separation of function allows CIS log to be highly configurable and has allowed it to continue to be a vital tool for monitoring networks even today as a matter of fact the internet engineering task force the ietf lik CIS log so much that they standardized it in 2009 CIS log can generate log messages based on the types of services that are running and it includes a severity level that rang is from zero the most severe up through seven the least severe CIS log can generate a lot of log messages most Network administrators configure it so that they only get alerted when a minimum severity level has been reached as a matter of fact you almost never want to capture debug log events unless you are actively debugging an application or service just because it generates so much information CIS log can be configured so that Network administrators receive their alerts via text message or SMS message or by email or they may even receive a voicemail message well CIS log is a cool tool it's not the only one that's out there there's also simple Network management protocol SNMP SNMP is an application layer protocol used to Monitor and manage a Network Health Network or systems administrators configure monitors these are often called traps on devices that view the operation of a specific item as in is that router's interface up or is that router's interface down the monitors periodically communicate with a network management station or nms through git messages that's G messages that the nms send out the response from the monitors is stored in a management information base or Mi which is a type of log file the administrator can custom configure the monitors with set messages sent from the network management station when an event occurs as in the interface goes down the Trap is tripped and the event is logged SNMP just like CIS log can be configured to just log the event or it can be configured to contact the network administrator SNMP gives Network and systems administrators the ability to provide more realtime monitoring of a Network's performance and health then there's security information and event management cm it's a term for software products and services that combine security information management or Sim and security event management Sam S may be provided by a software package a network Appliance or as a thirdparty cloud service it is used as a means of monitoring and providing realtime analysis of security alerts that is an example of the security event management function the Sim function it can also be used as a tool to analyze longterm data in log files that's an example of the Sim function or the security information management function s can be highly configured to the needs of the individual Network now that concludes this session on network monitoring part one I talked about the why of network monitoring and then I briefly touched on some tools for monitoring the network on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm sure I'll do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace's session on network monitoring part two today we're going to be talking about Active network monitoring tools then I'm going to move on to wireless monitoring tools and we're going to conclude with environmental monitoring we have a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about Active network monitoring tools Port scanners are used to scan a network for open ports and protocols the information that a port scanner gathers is Vital Information if you want to harden the network Port scanners are a great method of finding vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure allowing the network administrator to plug those vulnerabilities before before they become a security breach I do have to issue a word of caution you should only use a port scanner on a network or system that you are authorized to scan Port scanning is a possible sign of someone trying to breach a system and can lead to problems if you're not authorized to scan that system you don't want to have to try and explain to an information security specialist while you were scanning their network if you're not authorized to scan it a little bit different than a port scanner are applications that use interface monitoring or packet flow monitoring these are usually deployed as an active software tool to Monitor and analyze Network traffic within a network segment they're commonly called packet sniffers or protocol analyzers they allow for an indepth look at what traffic is on the network and may reveal security issues that the network administrator can then mitigate they help to identify top talkers on a network segment top talkers are those nodes or applications that generate the most amount of traffic packet sniffers can help to identify top listeners on a network segment a top listener is that interface or the interfaces that are receiving the most Network traffic or put another way those interfaces that are utilizing the most bandwidth for receiving packets this can help an administrator when they have determined that load balancing might be needed on the network Microsoft message analyzer and Wireshark are examples of free packet flow monitoring tools now let's move on to wireless monitoring tools and we're going to begin with the Wifi Analyzer a WiFi analyzer is a similar tool to a protocol analyzer but only for wireless networks it sniffs out packets on wireless networks and gives you statistics on those packets that it sees it can check for bandwidth usage Channel usage top talkers top listeners Etc just like a packet sniffer can WiFi analyzers can also identify networks by passively scanning the radio frequencies to determine where traffic is coming from given enough time a WiFi analyzer can also identify hidden networks are those that you don't know about a WiFi analyzer can also infer non beaconing networks Based on data traffic over the radio frequencies they may not be able to discover the SSID but they can tell the network administrator that something is passing traffic there another type of Wireless monitoring tool Are Wireless survey tools they're most commonly used as a design tool for setting up highquality wireless networks when used in conjunction with mapping tools the survey tools can help to establish the required amount of access points to get the proper amount of coverage the ideal antenna placement and the optimum amount of Channel overlap Wireless survey tools can also help to identify possible sources of radio frequency interference or RF I Wireless survey tools are often used to eliminate wireless network performance and security issues before they ever have a chance to occur let's move on to environmental monitoring a Network's Health can be affected by more than just a network interface failing or a possible security breach Network and systems administrators also need to be concerned about environmental factors some of those factors include the quality and quantity of electrical power being supplied to their equipment and the amount of heat in the rooms that equipment is kept and also with that the humidity level power monitoring tools are systems and tools that can be used to evaluate the amount of and the quality of the electrical power being delivered to the system they're often deployed with or alongside an uninterruptible power supply or UPS the monitor will issue an alert when an issue with electrical power has been identified giving the network or system administrator a chance to rectify the problem before any equipment has been damaged all electrical components are designed to operate within a specific heat range not only are they designed to operate within that heat range but all electrical equipment will generate some heat while they're in operation and the the harder that Equipment Works the more heat they will generate this is where heat monitors come into play the Heat monitor allows an administrator to control the temperature levels before they become an issue humidity is another item that Network administrators need to keep in mind too little humidity increases the risk of electrostatic discharge or ESD but too much humidity increases the risk of condensation on equipment and your electrical components do not like that condensation humidity monitors allow administrators the ability to control the humidity level through the proper means before it becomes an issue now that concludes this session on network monitoring part two I talked about Active network monitoring tools then I moved on to some Wireless monitoring tools and I concluded with a brief discussion on Environmental monitoring on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on supporting configuration management part one today I'm going to be talking about what configuration management is and then I'm going to discuss some documentation with that let's go ahead and jump into this session first up is configuration management why do we need configuration management because even fairly small modern networks can get very complex very fast configuration management or cm is a discipline that is used to evaluate coordinate approve deny or Implement change in or to an IT system configuration management plays a vital role in any network beyond the most simplistic of small office home office networks it helps to ensure that the network runs efficiently and smoothly Network administrators and support staff will play a vital role in developing and implementing any CM system or process now that you know what configuration management is let's talk about documentation documentation plays a key role in any configuration management system that gets developed in the CM process documentation is used to help evaluate and plan proposed changes documentation is also used to help in Asset Management network maintenance and vendor evaluations the documentation that is created will depend upon the complexity of the systems under consideration however even if your organization doesn't Implement a true CM sty some documentation should still be kept to reduce the burden on network personnel and to ease administrative management of the network some of the documentation that should be kept include policies and procedures policies are a set of guidelines that establish how the network is to be configured and operated they also set the expected behavior of the people within the organization as a general rule policies are put into effect at the mid to upper management level procedures on the other hand are a set of documents that detail how the policies are to be implemented as a general rule procedures are set by the management of the level that's affected by the policy and they get down to the stepbystep process of how to do things Asset Management documentation should also be maintained this covers a broad category of documentation that's often used to help in the change management process Asset Management documentation contains detailed information on what assets are present it also includes the maintenance history for those assets this documentation is often used to help track update and upgrade Cycles physical Network diagrams should also be kept these are a map or diagram of all network devices and how they connect a physical Network diagram specifies the cabling connectors and physical cabling runs it will also include Cable Management documentation which is considered a subcategory of the physical Network diagram the cabling management documentation will contain a wiring scheme which establishes the type of cabling and the connectors used it also defines the allowed standards for wiring those cables your documentation should also include a logical Network diagram it's similar to a physical Network diagram but more detailed it provides details on the IP address scheme active ports protocols that are allowed on the network etc etc your logical Network diagram also details connected networks so what local area networks are present or which virtual local area networks are present so on and so forth part of your logical Network diagram also details IP address utilization IP address utilization can greatly affect the efficiency and performance of the network by allowing you to know which lands or VLS have space on which nodes can be added your physical and logical Network diagrams may be combined into a single document vendor documentation also plays a role in supporting configuration management it covers a broad category of documentation that can include the approved vendor list the vendor approval process and purchase order documentation there are some common vendor documents that you should know first up is the memorandum of understanding or mou this is an agreement between two or more organizations that detail how those organizations are to take some common course of action it is also often referred to as a letter of intent it is not legally binding but it does often lead towards a binding agreement then there is the statement of work or the S so the S it's a detailed document that specifies what work is to be performed the expected outcome or deliverables and the timelines to perform the work the statement of work is often a key document in Project man management included in some vendor documentation is a master license agreement or MLA this is a legal agreement between two entities in which one agrees to pay the other for the use of a specific piece of software or software package for a specific period of time often instead of being called a master license agreement it is referred to as just a licens agreement last up is the service level agreement or SLA it details the allowable amount of response time the vendor has to resolve an issue or problem most commonly it is associated with a service contract that concludes this session on supporting configuration management part one I talked about configuration management and then I moved on to documentation on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pacit session on supporting configuration management part two today I'm going to be talking about backups and then we will conclude with a brief discussion on bring your own device and with that let's go ahead and begin this session I will be Begin by talking about backups backups are an essential part of any configuration management system that's because small changes in a network devic's configuration can introduce unexpected consequences into that Network in addition there is always the possibility of a failure of a key component which can lead to the loss of data or functionality backups play a key role in recovering from unexpected consequences or from the failure of a key component backup schedules must be implemented and periodic tests should be conducted to ensure that the backup process is working there's nothing worse than installing a backup and finding out that you really backed up nothing there are three basic types of backups there is the full backup all data on the targeted system is backed up this is the slowest backup method method with the highest storage requirements but it does lead to the fastest recovery method when recovering using a full backup it only requires the last full backup file then there's the incremental backup with this type only new or modified files are backed up this is the fastest backup method with the lowest storage requirements but it also leads to the slowest recovery method the recovery process with incremental backups requires the last full backup file in all of the incremental backup files the middle ground is the differential backup only data that is changed since the last full backup is saved the time to back up is moderate and it requires a moderate amount of storage but it also is the middle ground on the length of time for Recovery the recovery process requires the last full backup file and the last differential backup file something else that needs to be backed up are your configuration files of network devices once a network device has been configured and it's operating as expected a backup of the configuration files and operating system should be done this helps to speed up the recovery time in cases of equipment failure or when a change to the configuration has introduced unexpected consequences having the configuration file backups on hand means that you don't need to manually input it to recover in these situations now let's move on to bring your own device BYOD policies or bring your own device policies allow employees to use their own personal devices on an organization's Network while the employees are happy that they get to use their favorite it devices on the corporate Network it departments aren't quite as happy about it why it departments are tasked with keeping a network safe yet they have very little control over the devices that employees bring in in some cases bring your own device policies have led to the introduction of malware into an organization's Network environment this makes them very unhappy they can Implement Network admission control measures or Knack measures in an effort to reduce the risk associated ated with BYOD policies and to introduce configuration management to those devices Network admission control is a Cisco process Microsoft uses a similar process but it's called network access protection or nap while their names may be different they still function in the same way Knack includes more than just authenticating users and devices on the network all of the devices that are requesting access to network resources are screened for the type of device that it is the operating system that's used including any updates that are present neack will also check for security software making sure that it's up to date Knack can also check for the presence of malware or other security vulnerabilities in an advanced setup if the device requesting the connection has been rejected the device is then redirected to a remediation server which attempts to resolve the known issues so if the security software is out of date the remediation server may try and bring it up to date and then allow that device to connect to the corporate Network that concludes this session on supporting configuration management part two I talked about backups and we concluded with a brief discussion on bring your own device on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the importance of network segmentation today we're going to discuss the OSI model and segmentation and then we're going to conclude with reasons for segmentation and with that let's go ahead and begin this session we will Begin by talking about the OSI model and segmentation so what is segmentation well it's taking a single Network or system and breaking it into smaller discrete units this can be achieved physically or logically there are many reasons why you might want to segment a network some of them could include to ease a administrative tasks to achieve performance gains to increase security or to comply with regulations as I mentioned earlier segmenting a network can be achieved physically or logically and either way it involves different levels of the OSI reference model it can be achieved at layer one the physical layer this is taking a single Network and making it into more than one network through the use of cable runs and Equipment this is the most extreme example of network segmentation not only is this the most extreme example of segmentation but it's also an example of physically segmenting a network you can also segment a network logically at the data link layer which is Layer Two or at the network layer which is layer three of the OSI model this is taking a single Network and making it into more than one by logically dividing the network The Logical segmentation of a network takes the least amount of physical resources to achieve it now let's move on to reasons for segmentation first up is compliance some rules and regulations require that certain data be kept separate and secure as in the payment card industry data security standard or PCI DSS this requires that you keep customer information separate and secure from normal business information segmentation allows for the regulated data to flow across its own network keeping it more secure another reason for segmentation would be for Network performance optimization as a network increases in size the amount of data that flows through them usually increases this can slow down the performance of the network segmentation breaks the larger Network into smaller units which can lead to an increase in performance on those segments related to network performance optimization is the creating of high performance networks some applications require more bandwidth in order to perform at the desired higher level Voiceover IP video teleconferencing and media Nets which are all examples of streaming services all perform better when they are on their own network segments a a major reason for Network segmentation is to separate private from public networks organizations often allow the public to access the internet from their locations these are places that offer free WiFi segmentation allows this traffic to be kept separate from the private corporate traffic then there are Legacy systems some organizations use systems that are considered critical to their operation but are not capable of residing on Modern networks segmentation allows the Legacy system to reside on its own subnet and network without compromising its performance or the performance of the rest of the network then there are testing Labs the lab can be used to test new applications operating systems update patches so on and so forth if these tests occur on the main Network it is possible that this testing could inject a problem into the main system segmentation allows for the testing to occur in a secure easily controllable environment and finally their security one of the main reasons for performing Network segmentation is for security purposes segmentation allows Network and systems administrators to more easily control the flow of data between systems segmentation also allows Network and systems administrators to more easily control access to network resources therefore creating more security an example of segmentation for security would be honey Nets these are network segments that are created with the sole purpose of attracting any network attacks through the use of multiple honey pots honey pots are systems that are configured to be attractive to network attackers helping to draw attackers away from the main Network systems and into the honey net the network segment of honeypots allows the main Network to remain secure and gives Network administrators an opportunity to study and attack including the methods of Entry so that counter measures can be developed to prevent future breaches A system that should be segmented are scata systems or supervisory control and data acquisition systems these are the most widespread of industrial control systems or IC the industrial control system uses coded signals over communication channels to provide control of remote equipment they're commonly used in industrial applications to Monitor and control systems utilities often use scata systems to control their operations through the use of DCs networks that is a distributed control system Network the the DCS allows for the control of multiple scata systems from a single location the stut net virus was originally designed to attack scata systems and can spread through the DCS leading to more damage from the virus segmentation of the distributed control system can limit the amount of damage caused by such a virus attack on Industrial processes now that concludes this session on the importance of network segmentation we talked about the OSI model and segmentation and then I concluded with reasons for Network segmentation now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on applying patches and updates today we're going to discuss patches and updates and then we're going to conclude by talking about upgrading versus downgrading there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session and of course we're going to begin by talking about patches and updates today's modern operating systems are very complex and are composed of tens of millions of lines of code even your network devices and appliances are very complex and have complex software packages and configurations this complexity of the modern operating system has led to the necessity for updates patches and hot fixes these are used to add features fix bugs and repair security holes as they become known One goal of Administrators is to keep systems as up toate as possible through the use of these updates patches and hot fixes reducing the system's vulnerability and increasing its functionality while reducing maintenance costs a patch is a small section of code that is used to either increase functionality or fix a problem within a software package a patch will change the version of the software package in a minor manner as in version 1.0.0 will become version 1.0.1 an update is a larg section of code that is used to either increase functionality or fix problems within a software package that become known after production an update will change the version of the software in a more major manner as in version 1.0.0 will become version 2.0.0 or using a Microsoft example Windows 8.0 became Windows 8.1 a hot fix which can also be called a vulnerability patch is similar to a patch but it is actually smaller than a patch they are designed to be deployed to fix a very specific issue within an operating system or other software package hot fixes are usually issued to fix security problems that become discovered after the software package has been produced a service pack is a cumulative Windows update pack package that contains all patches updates and hot fixes between two points of time Microsoft releases service packs as a method of easing the installation of an operating system helping to keep it current you install the operating system and then you install the service pack that way you don't have to download and install every patch update and hot fix in most cases it is possible to automate the patch and update process process through registering the product with the vendor who created it Microsoft's operating systems can be set to automatically check for updates and it will download and install them if you configure it that way most Hardware vendors offer the same type of service for firmware and drivers in most cases these Services can also be set to just inform the system of the availability of patches and updates allowing administrator to manually download and install them in a production setting all patches and updates should be installed and tested in isolation as in on a test system in a Testing Lab before they are installed on vital production equipment this reduces the chances that a patch or update will bring down a system that is functioning all right but is in need of the patch or update now let's discuss upgrading versus downgrading quite often it is highly desirable to install the latest patches and updates in order to keep systems running efficiently however sometimes issues arise with the installation of a patch or update leading to problems that were not caught during the testing phase this is where backups and downgrading come into play backup copies of all systems and configuration files should be maintained in order to downgrade or roll back to the previous version for when a problem occurs during the deployment of a patch or upgrade being able to roll back to a prior version is often easier and more efficient than trying to resolve a problem that was introduced with an update administrators should keep backup copies that include the base package of the operating system or software package a backup of the system before the patch was installed and a backup of the system after the Patch was installed all of these backups should be kept and maintained as per your organization's policy now that concludes this session on applying patches and updates we started by discussing patches and updates and then concluded with a brief discussion on upgrading versus downgrading on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I'm looking forward to doing another one hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on configuring switches part one today we're going to talk about unmanaged versus managed switches and then we're going to talk about spanning tree protocol there is a whole lot of information to cover not a lot of time so let's jump into this session I'm going to begin by talking about unmanaged switches and managed switches before we begin discussing the differences between unmanaged and managed switches let's talk switch Basics most switches operate at layer 2 the data link layer of the OSI reference model what makes a switch a switch is an application specific integrated circuit chip or an ASAC chip it is used to make switching decisions in place of software this allows switches to break up Collision domains this allows switches to run in full duplex mode and this allows switches to make faster decisions than either Bridges or routers when a switch receives a frame on a port it makes some simple decisions based on its media Access Control table or its Mac table it will make one of three decisions it may decide to forward the frame that is where the frame is directed out the port on which the destination Mac address resides it may decide to filter the packet that is where the frame is not directed out of ports which are not associated with the destination Mac address the final decision that it may make is to flood the frame the frame is flooded or sent out all of the ports on the switch except for the port on which it came in on an unmanaged switch is a simple switch plug it in and it works there is no method provided for configuration the unmanaged switch is designed with ease of installation as its main attribute managed switches on the other hand can be configured through either the command line or a browser based interface managed switches provide for a high degree of network customization and control a managed switch can can also be set up so that an administrator can monitor its performance remotely and use protocols such as SNMP to make some modifications to its configuration now let's move on to spanning tree protocol spanning tree protocol is a loop avoidance technology a switching Loop can occur on networks where there are multiple paths to reach destination Mac addresses digital equip Corporation created the spanning tree protocol or STP to reduce the possibility of switching Loops the switches elect a root bridge to control the switched Network the switches will shut down ports that are not the best path to the root Bridge thus reducing the risk of Loops no network traffic can flow until after the STP process has taken place and a stable state has been achieved this stable state state is called convergence and it can take a significant amount of time with STP up to 50 seconds after convergence the STP selected switch ports send out Bridge protocol data unit packets or bpdu packets to help maintain the stable State all switch ports in an STP enabled Network can be in one of five states first off there is the disabled state that is where the port is administratively shut down it's not receiving packets it's not sending packets it's just completely disabled then there's the blocking state in this state the port will not forward packets but it's still receiving bpdu packets and will drop all other frames then there's the listening state in this state the port will not forward packets but listens to bpdu packets to make sure that no Loops can occur in preparation for the next state then there's the learning state in this state the port will not forward packets but it is learning all of the paths in the network it is populating its Mac address table in preparation for the next state the last state in spanning tree protocol is the forwarding state in this state the port will forward and receive all packets that are flowing across the network that are directed to that Port the i e liked STP so much that it created the 802.1d standard this is their version of STP all modern layer 2 switches run the 802.1d standard by default the slow convergence time of the 802.1d standard led to the creation of Rapid spanning tree protocol or rstp which is also known as the i e 80 21w standard rstp has a much faster convergence time than 802.1d with rstp enabled on all switches a network can achieve its stable state in approximately 5 Seconds that's a whole lot faster than the up to 50 seconds with the 802.1d standard but rstp is not turned on by default on layer 2 switches it must be enabled by an administrator instead of five possible Port States rstp defines three possible Port States the first of these states is discarding in this state the port may be administratively disabled or it may be in a blocking mode or listening mode the next state is learning in this state the port is populating its Mac address table in preparation for forwarding packets and the final state is forwarding in this state the port is actively forwarding packets now that concludes this session on configuring switches part one I talked about unmanaged versus managed switches and then I had a brief discussion on spanning tree protocol on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on configuring switches part two today we're going to discuss installation considerations and then we're going to move on to configuring the switch Port there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and dive into today's session of course I'm going to begin with installation considerations the first install ation consideration is whether or not you need a managed or unmanaged switch the business or Enterprise Network is more complex than the small office home office Network a Soho Network may be able to get by with using one or more unmanaged switches and still operate adequately but once beyond the level of a Soho more thought and planning is required as unmanaged switches are no longer up to the job you are going to need managed switches there are multiple issues to consider when installing a managed switch and it is wise to plan for those in advance to save both time and frustration in setting up a network one of the first things to consider is if there will be vlans virtual local area networks while switches may break up Collision domains they do not break up broadcast domains but vlans will a virtual local area Network takes a single Network environment and creates smaller Network segments by subnetting the network address range effectively breaking up the broadcast domains of that Network vlans are used in a switched Network environment for a variety of reasons to break up broadcast domains into smaller segments just like I just said another reason to use vlans is they increase security by limiting access to network resources the administ configures the vlans and then assigns users nodes or ports to a specific virtual local area network all managed switches do come with a native VLAN which is determined by the manufacturer this native VLAN is used to help manage the switch VLAN traffic is allowed to cross switch ports as long as the VLAN information matches so VLAN 2 can send traffic to VLAN 2 but VLAN 2 cannot send traffic to VLAN 3 VLAN traffic is allowed to cross switch ports as long as the VLAN information matches it does this through the use of trunk ports that means that VLAN 2 can send traffic across the trunk port to VLAN 2 but it cannot send traffic from VLAN 2 across the trunk port to VLAN 3 vtp or virtual trunk port Port protocol is a Cisco proprietary method of creating a virtual trunk Port which allows VLAN traffic to pass between switches and to automatically manage the VLAN environment in order for different vlans to communicate with each other a router or some other layer 3 device must be installed on the network the next consideration is how is the switch going to be managed switches may be managed out of band that means that no network connection is required this is achieved through the use of the console port on the switch the console Port is a specific port on managed switches used to connect to and configure or manage a switch a rollover cable may be required to make the connection to the console Port security should also be set on Console ports to prevent unauthorized access through that console port your other option for switch management may be to use inband management with inband management a network connection is used to manage the switch one of the most common methods of allowed inband management is through the use of virtual terminals or vty connections the most common vty connections are telnet or secure shell sessions SSH sessions security should also be set if telnet is allowed on vty type connections by default SSH is a secured connection if you determine that you're going to use inband management the next thing that you need to do is to establish a default gateway address that default gateway address must be placed on an interface that belongs to the native VLAN or the default virtual local area network the default gateway on a switch is different than the default gateway on on a router on a switch it is only used to manage the switch and not to pass other network traffic as part of the setup and management of the switch an administrator should configure which users and passwords are allowed to connect to the switch and what their level of access to the configuration is going to be inband and outof band management security settings may be different some users may be allowed inband management access while other others are not and vice versa if authentication authorization and accounting Protocols are used in the network the switch must be configured to use them as well with that done let's move on to configuring the switch Port I'm not going to actually show you the commands for how to configure the switch Port but I'm going to give you the information that you need to consider when configuring the switch Port first up is speed and duplexing most modern switch ports can autonegotiate both the speed of the link and the duplexing mode used but in some cases an administrator may be required to manually set both the speed and the duplex in order for a connection to occur speed and duplexing errors are the most common cause for a link not being established between a switch and a router or between switches next up is VLAN assignment all switch ports will beong to a VLAN and that VLAN will either be an administrator configured one or it will be the native virtual local area network as a side note the native VLAN can be administratively changed which should be done to increase the security level on the switch then there's trunking trunk ports are switch ports that are designed to carry VLAN traffic between switches the standard protocol used is 802.1q 802.1q strips off the VLAN tag actually it changes that tag to match the native VLAN which allows the traffic to cross over the port and then once on the other side then the 802.1 Q port on the other side reinserts the original VLAN tag and that is trunking in a nutshell you might want to consider Port bonding using lacp that's link aggregation control protocol it is is a protocol that is used to create a single logical channel from redundant connections between switches so it bonds those ports together this will increase the bandwidth between the switches now we're going to talk about po not Edgar alen po but power over ethernet some switches coming with power over ethernet ports or Poe ports these ports can use one of two methods to provide current over the network cable as well as carrying data allowing these ports to power small network devices while at the same time communicating with them the port itself May provide the current or the port may allow the use of a power injector to provide the power instead of the port itself there are multiple Poe standards in place the two most common are actually the poe standard the 802.3 AF which can provide up to 15.4 watts of current or the poe plus which is 802.3at which can provide up to 30 watts of Current Port mirroring may also be enabled on a switch Port this allows the configured port to receive all Network traffic going to and from a specific Port by using Port mirroring an administrator can examine and analyze the traffic going into and coming from from a specific host or Port Port mirroring is most often used in conjunction with a packet analyzer also known as a packet sniffer or network sniffer administrators often use port mirroring to examine the flow of traffic to determine what method of network optimization to use or for when they're determining which security measures to put in place Port mirroring can create a significant amount of network overhead so it should be used sparingly on an active Network and you may want to shut it down once your research has concluded that concludes this session on configuring switches part two I talked about installation considerations and then I talked about configuring the switch Port itself on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on wireless land infrastructure part one today I'm going to give an introduction to wireless network standards then I'm going to move on to inant technology and we will conclude with wireless access points there is a whole plethora of information to impart not a lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session I'm going to begin by giving an introduction to wireless network standards to talk about the standards I need to introduce you to the i e 802.11 specifications these are a set of specifications that deal with the data link layer and the physical layer of the OSI reference model these establish how wireless network communication can occur the 802.11 standard specifies the use of unlicensed radio frequency bands as the carrier for Network traffic it also specifies that network communication will be half duplex in nature and that it will be implemented using carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance or csma CA carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance technology requires that devices only transmit data when no other data transmission signal is present on the carrier wave now the 802.11 standards have been amended over time to become our common standards that we see today these standards include the 802.11b wireless standard it was commercially released in 1997 and operates within the 2.4 gigahertz industrial scientific and medical or ISM radio frequency band now within the 2.4 GHz RF band it uses multiple channels that are 22 MHz wide there are 11 separate channels of which only three do not overlap 802.11b has a theoretical throughput of 11 megabits per second and it is compatible with the 802.11g and N standards then there's 802.11a it was also commercial commercially released in 1997 and operates within the 5 GHz unlicensed National information infrastructure or u nii radio frequency band it offers up to 23 separate channels that offer a bandwidth of 20 mahz each none of the channels overlap 802.11a has a theoretical throughput of 54 megabits per second it is not compatible with any other standard EO 211g was commercially released in 2003 and operates within the 2.4 GHz radio frequency band just like 802.11b it also offers a bandwidth of 20 mahz on 11 separate channels it has a theoretical throughput of 54 megabits per second and it's also compatible with 802.11b it's also comp compatible with 802.11n and 802.11 AC and that brings us to 802.11n it was commercially released in 2009 and can operate on both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio frequency bands at the same time it uses a 20 MHz wide Channel within the 2.4 GHz band and a 40 mahz wide Channel with within the 5 GHz band it has a theoretical throughput of 600 megabits per second through the introduction of multiple input and multiple output mimo technology and beam forming and it is compatible with1 b1g And1 a and that brings us to 802.11ac it was commercially released in 2013 and operates on the 5 G gz radio frequency band The Available bandwidth varies by administrative settings and can be dynamically Changed by the wireless access point based on how much radio frequency interference or RFI is present and how many users are on the wireless network 802.11 AC has a theoretical throughput of over 1 gabit per second through the introduction of multiuser multiple input and multiple output technology or mu mimo technology and beam forming 802.11 AC is only compatible with 802.11g and N so why broadcast a wide signal to a specific device when it's possible to Target that device specifically this is the question that beamforming answered once a device makes a connection to an access point once a device makes a connection to an access point that is capable of beam forming the AP will autotune its antenna and transmitter to more specifically Target the device when communication occurs this can reduce RFI and increase throughput on the wireless local area network while 802.11n allowed for beam forming it was not a standardized option until the implementation of 802.11 AC since we've covered the standards let's move on to antenna technology first up the basics antennas are used to broadcast and receive radio frequency signals and they fall into two basic categories there are omnidirectional antennas which are designed to broadcast and receive signals in all directions then there are uni directional antennas which are designed to broadcast and receive signals in a specific Direction antenna placement and type of antenna will have an impact on wireless local area network performance both mimo and mimo are technologies that allow for more than one spatial stream to be transmitted and received by a single device through the use of multiple antennas mimo allows for up to four spatial channels while mimo allows for up to eight spatial channels mimo also allows for a single signal to be spread across multiple transmitters this accounts for the multiple user part of the name let's conclude with a discussion on wireless access points the wireless access point is a foundational piece of the wireless local area network the wireless access point or WAP can also be known as an access point or AP and it creates a point of entry for wireless to enter the more traditional wired networking environment the AP can also be used to join other types of networks wireless access points in most cases use unlicensed radio frequency bands in order to communicate with devices one or more antennas are used in order to radiate and receive radio frequency signals in a half duplex manner wireless routers are common in the small office home office environment they are wireless access points that have routers built good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on wireless land infrastructure part two today I'm going to be talking about basic Wireless landan topologies and then we're going to conclude with wireless landan Concepts and terms there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and jump into this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about Wireless local area network topologies and the first topology is the ad hoc topology it's a very basic Wireless local area network that does not require the use of a wireless access point which can also be called a WAP and it can also be called an access point the devices negotiate the wireless connection between themselves an example of this are when laptops connect wirelessly without the use of a wireless access point then there's the infrastructure topology it's a more common type of Wireless local area network that uses a WAP or multiple waps to create a connection point for wireless devices most often it's used to connect a wireless network to a more traditional wired network but that wired network is not absolutely required then there's the mesh topology this is a type of infrastructure topology that employs the use of multiple access points to create larger seamless network coverage areas they're commonly deployed with wireless controllers and wireless access points something to remember is that the higher the wireless device density the more wireless access points that will be required to handle the load like any other network device access points only have a certain amount of capacity as the workload increases the amount of throughput will decrease as each device contends for access to that wireless access point adding more waps Andor adding more access points and wireless controllers can greatly ease the load and increase the efficiency of the network now let's move on to wireless land Concepts and terms first up is the ibss or independent basic service set an ibss is created when an ad hoc network topology is created the devices use the ibss in order to control the communication that occurs between the connected devices then there's the BSS or basic service set when a single wireless access point is in infrastructure mode it will create a BSS this means that it can control the flow of communication between every device that connects to the SS IDs under its control then there's the ESS or extended service set an ESS is created when two or more access points share a common SSID and have overlapping coverage through the extended service set the waps will negotiate how to hand off a wireless device between them as it roams the network so I mentioned the service set identifier just a moment ago or the SSID it plays a key role in the wireless local area network environment all active wireless access points will use a Beacon transmission to advertise the networks that they belong to what they advertise is their SSID which can also be thought of as their network name those beacons are how devices know which networks they can connect to even when an access point is set to hide the beacon the broadcasts are still occurring so although hiding the SS ID broadcast may make it more difficult to join a wireless network it's not a true security measure because the broadcast is still occurring now let's talk about 802.11 at and 802.11g DHT both of these terms relate to the 80 211n standard they denote the type of connection a high throughput connection and the radio frequency which will either be the 2.4 GHz radio frequency band or it may be a 5 GHz connection then there's goodput goodput is the actual amount of application data passed through a connection with the overhead removed it's measured in bytes per second it is different than through throughput measures the total amount of data capable of being passed through a connection so it includes Network overhead then we have signal strength it's a measure of the strength of the radio frequency signal that comes from an access point which can help to determine the amount of area that can be covered by that access point as a general rule the closer a device is to the wireless access point the stronger the signal that is received this strength of signal can be affected by wireless access point or antenna placement the type of antenna used and interference sources that may be present a wireless sight survey with heat mapping tools can help in the setup of a high quality Wireless local area network or it can help you to pinpoint problem areas within your network the heat mapping software builds a visual map by measuring the received signal strength indicator or RSSI and the signal to noise Ratio or SNR which can be directly correlated to data throughput using these tools allows the administrator to find gaps and coverage as well as areas where the coverage extends beyond the desired boundaries helping to create a more efficient and secure network now that concludes this session on wireless land infrastructure structure part two I talked about basic wireless land topologies and we concluded with some wireless land Concepts and terms on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on risk RK and security related Concepts today I'm going to be talking about the big picture of recovery and then we're going to move on to some Concepts and terms that you should know there's a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and jump into this session we begin with the big picture of recovery standards and policies are used to help ensure that everyone is on the same page at the same time all organizations should review their operations and create standards and policies that suit their needs once they are created the standards and policies should be adhered to this includes all of the information technology systems by stressing the importance of standards and policies risks to an organization can be reduced and security can be strengthened all policies and standards should be reviewed on a periodic basis to help ensure that they remain relevant and be updated as necessary one of the standards or policies that should be created is the disaster recovery plan a disaster is any event or emergency that goes beyond the normal response resources as in an earthquake or a flood or a major fire the longer a business is not able to function the more damage is done the damage recovery plan or DRP detail the steps to recover from a disaster situation as in when the offsite backups need to be used or if a fall back site needs to be brought into operation they also have sections dealing with how to help ensure employee safety a subelement of the DRP is the business continuity plan or BCP a BCP includes an impact analysis of the business effects of down systems the impact analysis helps to identify single points of failure in the business system a BCP helps to prioritize what systems or processes need to be brought back first to get an organization operational again it identifies Mission critical systems processes and data the business continuity plan helps to guide the creation of the disaster recovery plan now let's talk about some concept ceps in terms that you should know first up is single point of failure a single point of failure is a system or component that if it goes down has a major impact on operations an example of a single point of failure is if a key router goes down and it prevents customers from ordering products that's a single point of failure once identified these failure points can be mitigated through several different methods such as redundant systems as in adding a backup router to the previous example or maybe a redundant power supply single points of failure can also be mitigated through system redesign as in removing that point of failure through a redesign of the system you should also be familiar with uninterruptable power supplies or the UPS a UPS will mitigate power issues that can have a negative impact on sensitive networking components it conditions the incoming power to remove spikes and sags in the current helping to ensure that the flow of current is even and consistent which is very beneficial to your electronic and networking components they also help to ensure the continued operation at least for a given period of time in the case of complete electrical power supply loss as in an outage depending upon your UPS you may be able to run for minutes hours or possibly days if you have a generator First Responders are the first people to discover or respond to a security issue ideally it will be someone who has been properly trained in how to deal with the situation within the network security realm First Responders can play a key role in mitigating damage and collecting evidence then there's the concept of a data breach which is any unon authorize access to data particularly to sensitive data breaches may be unintentional or intentional they may also occur from inside the network so internally or they may originate from an external source so they may come from outside of your network the severity of the breach is greatly determined by the sensitivity and the quantity of the data that's been accessed data breaches can be very expensive to organizations they can result in a loss of reputation which can lead to a loss of Revenue when it became known that Target lost sensitive customer information you know credit card information people became unwilling or uncomfortable with shopping at Target even though they quickly fixed the breach the results lingered on a data breach may result in a loss of business Secrets which may cost that organization a competitive advantage and finally data breach may result in fines or penalties levied by governments or other organizations user awareness and training can greatly reduce your security risks quite often the weakest link in the security chain is the end user the risks can be reduced by making the users properly aware of security and security threats through awareness training and just security training in general this training should be conducted on an ongoing basis it's never a oneandone thing penetration testing is the finding of weak spots and the hardening of systems it is actively and aggressively testing the whole it system in an effort to find weak spots this can include using social engineering methods on your end users to find out if they are your weak link the data generated is used to harden the it system in an effort to mitigate future risks similar to penetration testing is vulnerability scanning this is the finding of network holes and then plugging them it's mostly done through the use of automated software networks are probed for vulnerabilities as in open ports or unnecessary protocols once these ports or protocols have been identified these holes into the network can then be plugged but remember you need to have authorization to perform vulnerability scanning or you may be having an uncomfortable discussion with your security Personnel now that concludes this session on risk and security related Concepts I talked about the big picture of recovery and then I covered some Concepts and terms that you should know on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on common Network vulnerabilities today we're going to be discussing vulnerabilities associated with unsecure protocols and we're going to conclude with vulnerable Network practices there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's jump into this session I will Begin by discussing vulnerabilities associated with unsecure protocols network security is never a completely done deal it often seems as if as soon as one hole is plugged another one opens up vulnerabilities are discovered all the time making it difficult for Network administrators to keep up while this is true there are still some steps that administrators should take to reduce the vulnerabilities that exist in the systems under their control by reducing known vulnerabilities administrators can then spend their time preparing for in reducing exposure to upand cominging threats thus increasing their productivity the first vulnerable protocol that we're going to discuss is telnet telnet is a protocol that is used to create a virtual terminal connection that is commonly used for troubleshooting tnet is very insecure because all communication occurs in clear text tnut does not support encryption whenever possible secure shell or SSH should be used to create those virtual terminal Connections in place of tnet then there is SNMP simple Network management protocol versions one and two SNMP is a protocol that is used to remotely manage and configure network devices due to their lack of encryption support versions one and two are unsecure and susceptible to packet sniffers this can allow an attacker to grab those packets and actually gain control of the configuration and management of your network devices if you're going to use SNMP version 3 should always be used as it supports more security including encryption FTP or file transfer protocol is a prot call that is used to transfer files across a network connection while a username and password are required in most cases to use FTP it doesn't support encryption which creates a vulnerability in the process because of this lack of encryption support everything is done in the clear making it susceptible to being captured and you could lose sensitive information secure FTP or SFTP should be used to in place of FTP as it creates an SSH FTP session tftp or trivial file transfer protocol is a simple stripped down version of FTP that doesn't support authentication like standard FTP so it's even more unsecure it is commonly used to download and upload configuration files for networking equipment tftp should only be used when a connection to networking equipment is made through the console Port thus eliminating the possibility of EAS dropping and that console Port should have its own security measures in place everyone's fairly familiar with HTTP or hypertex transfer protocol it's the protocol that is used to send and receive data over the Internet it is unsecure in its basic format and susceptible to being intercepted due to a lack of encryption https or HTTP secure should be used when conducting sensitive business over the internet as it will provide encryption and other Security Services hopefully your network still doesn't use serial line IP or slip it is an early protocol that was developed for communicating over serial ports and modem connections that required a static IP address it is very outdated and very unsecure slip does not support encryption hopefully you will be using pointto Point protocol in its place PPP does support encryption and is much more secure now it's time to talk about vulnerable Network practices first up are unpatched or Legacy systems unpatch systems are by their very nature unsecure keeping all operating systems in applications up to date will reduce vulnerabilities in the network and it helps to harden that Network against attack in some situations it is necessary to keep Legacy systems alive this can create vulnerabilities in the system as weaknesses in these Legacy systems tend to be well known special security measures should be taken with Legacy systems in order to reduce the opportunity for exploitation one of the best security steps that you can take is placing these Legacy applications or systems on their own network or on their own virtual local area networks then there are open ports and an open port can either be physical or it can be an application Port these open ports create a hole in the security of the network and may be exploited while not all open ports can or should be closed security should be placed on these ports that need to remain open to reduce the vulnerability of the network a good practice is to use a port scanner periodically to verify that only absolutely required application ports are open another thing to remember is that you should only use a port scanner if you are authorized to scan that Network or you may end up in a rather lengthy discussion with your security Personnel unnecessary running services are another vulnerable Network practice operating system services are used to perform some functions within the system but it is possible for them to be exploited a periodic review of all running Services should be conducted on all equipment that is attached to the network all unnecessary running Services should be disabled to harden your network clear text credal credentials are another vulnerability that's rather common many applications and devices require the use of credentials in order to be used in some cases these credentials are sent in clear text format which makes them easier to read when captured a good practice is to periodically review all applications and systems to determine which ones use Clear text credentials then you need to either limit their use or figure out how to encrypt the Transmissions to secure your systems unencrypted communication channels are another problem any method of communication on the network that is not encrypted is an unencrypted channel that is subject to being breached while not all communication channels need to be encrypted a good practice is to review all channels and make a decision about which ones need to be encrypted and which ones do not all wireless network channels should be encrypted there are no exceptions do not create an unencrypted wireless network that's just asking for problems a vulnerability that few Network administrators think about our RF or radio frequency emanations one method of intercepting communication is to analyze signal leakage that's the RF emanation many forms of communication are subject to these signal emanations but there are steps that can be taken to reduce them Tempest is a set of Standards established by the NSA and NATO that outline steps that can be used to reduce the opportunity for the interception and Analysis of communication that concludes this session on common Network vulnerabilities I began with vulnerabilities associated with unsecure protocol calls I then concluded with vulnerable Network practices on behalf of pait thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on common Network threats part one today we're going to be discussing Inside Job or threats and we're going to conclude with some outside threats to your network with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about inside jobs or threats first up is malicious employees we may not know the reason why they're malicious but they are difficult to defend against as they are already inside the defenses of the network and because their employees resources have been granted to them in order for them to be able to do their job one of the best defenses against malicious employees is using the principle of least privilege only granting the least amount of authorization that is required for a person to get their work done that's the best defense against a malicious employee compromised systems are another threat once a PC or network device has been compromised it is vitally important to isolate it from the system as a whole a compromised PC could lead to a completely compromised Network as malware may be able to spread across its connections once malware has gained access to network resources it can be extremely difficult to root out and remove malware may also degrade the Network's performance causing other issues then there is social engineering this is the process of using social pressure to cause somebody to compromise a system from inside the defenses of the network social engineering pressure can be applied in multiple forms an employee can receive a phone call from somebody claiming to be from the IT department asking for their credentials it may occur in person the social engineering can occur through email or through a rogue website there are many Avenues in which social engineering can occur the best defense is through enduser education training your end users to resist social engineering is a good idea ARP cach poisoning is another threat that can occur on your network in ARP cach poisoning the ARP cach which maps IP addresses to Mac addresses is corrupted by an attacker with the end result being that the attack hacker has control of which IP addresses are associated with Mac addresses it's commonly used in man in the Middle attacks which I will cover in just a bit then there are protocol or packet abuse threats this is the process of taking a specific protocol and repurposing it to perform a different function protocol abuse is commonly used to bypass a router's Access Control list from inside of a network an example of this is encapsulating a not allowed protocol within a DNS packet which is almost always an allowed protocol in order to get that unallowed protocol out of the network the man in the middle attack is another threat that you should be aware of the attacker is not necessarily inside the network per se but is in between two endpoints that are Comm communicating on a network in most cases the manin themiddle attack involves disrupting the ARP process between the two endpoints the attack allows a malicious user to be able to view all Network packets that are flowing between the communicating hosts often a man in themiddle attack is used in an attempt to gain sensitive information like Network credentials then there's VLAN hopping this is circumventing the security that is inherent when virtual local area networks are created normally traffic that is tagged for one VLAN is not allowed onto another VLAN without the intervention of a router VLAN hopping occurs when the attacker adds an additional fake VLAN tag to the network packets once the packets get to the switch the switch strips one of the VLAN tags off the packet and then passes it through once through the switch packet is considered as belonging to the new VLAN thus bypassing the security that's inherent in vlans now let's move to outside threats one of the largest threats that face network security Personnel is the unknown vulnerability Network and systems administrators expend vast amounts of time protecting the assets under their control and they can do a pretty good job of hardening their systems but it's not a perfect job the problem lies with zero day attacks zero day attacks take advantage of either new or recently discovered vulnerabilities which means that the networks and systems probably haven't been hardened against them yet the unfortunate reality is that attacks keep changing and Security Experts must be willing to adapt in order to keep Pace if they can't adapt they will fall behind and their networks become become vulnerable let's talk about the Brute Force attack this is using computing power in time to compromise passwords the attacker uses a program that continually tries different password combinations often in the form of a special dictionary application in an effort to crack a password the best defense against this is to limit the number of times that a user can attempt to log on before they're locked down out then they're spoofing this is a category of threats where either the MAC address or the IP address of the attacker has been modified to look like a friendly address in order to bypass network security a common use in the past was for an attacker to spoof their IP address so that the outside attacker was actually viewed as an inside host a common defense against this type of spoofing is an ACL rule that does doesn't allow an inside IP address to come from outside of your network then there's session hijacking an attacker attempts to take over a communication session after a user has been authenticated the hijacking can occur through various methods as in using a packet sniffer to steal a session cookie or installing malware on a user's computer that is activated after the user is authenticated that concludes this session on common Network threats part one I talked about inside jobs or threats and then I concluded with a brief discussion on some outside threats now on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on common Network threats part two today I'm going to be talking about more outside threats and then I'm going to be talking about some wireless network threats I have a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about outside threats because of how they are implemented it is often difficult to put network security threats into a single category many attempts to breach a network combine different aspects of different threats for example a man in the Middle attack is often combined with some type of spoofing that is used to help it succeed that means that in most cases security requires more than just a single line of defense good administrators recognize this and Implement multiple layers of security in order to harden and protect their systems the first major threat that we're going to talk about is the denial of service threat or the Dos threat this covers a very broad category of threats to networks and systems that's because dos covers any threat that can potentially keep users or customers from using network resources as designed a traditional dos attack attempts to flood a network with enough traffic to bring it down it's commonly used with a flood of M well formed icmp requests the host that receives the flood can be so busy dealing with the delus of data that it cannot respond to legitimate requests then there's the permanent dos attack it's an attempt to permanently deny a network resource for others it can be achieved by physically destroying or removing the resource or it can also be achieved through the use of malware that corrupts or damages the underlying digital system to the point where it cannot be repaired and must be replaced there are also friendly or unintentional denial of service attacks an unintended dos attack can occur when poorly written applications consume more network resources than are available another unintentional dos attack can occur when a network interface controller or Nick begins to fail it's quite common when a Nick is about to fail for it to go offline and come back online repeatedly and rapidly this consumes network resources which can cause an unintentional dos more destructive than the standard denial of service attack is the distributed denial of service attack or the DDOS attack it's a denial of service attack in which more than a single system is involved in sending the attack a DDOS attack has a higher chance of succeeding due to the increased number of participants the machines used to send the attack may be voluntary participants this is called a coordinated attack or they may be part of a botn net with the botn net malware has been installed on the machines and they are no longer under the complete control of their owners many distributed denial of service attacks involve bot Nets where the attacker has actually rented the bot net for the sole purpose of Performing the DDOS the goal of the DDOS is to create a large enough enough spike in traffic that the target becomes unreachable in some cases the target system may need to be rebooted in order for it to come back online there's the reflective denial of service attack it's also known as an amplified dos the attacker uses some method usually some form of spoofing to hide the source of the attack in a reflective DNS attack the attacker usually spoofs the intended Target's IP address and sends multiple requests to an open DNS server the DNS server responds by sending traffic back to the targeted system and the attacker's hope is that the response from the DNS server will overwhelm the targeted system a cousin to the reflective DNS attack is the reflective ntp attack or the reflective Network time protocol attack it works in the same way however instead of using DNS it relies upon open ntp servers not very common anymore but you still need to know about it are the Smurf attacks also known as smurfing it's a type of reflective denial of service attack that also involves spoofing the intended Target's IP address another network is flooded with icmp requests in which the source address for the requests appear to be that of the intended target as the replies returned the network becomes slowed down by the traffic the goal is to overwhelm the target system and bring it down it's time to move on to wireless network threats our first topic is an unintended threat a common feature on Modern wireless access points is WiFi protected setup or WPS the goal of WPS is to create an easy and secure method for consumers and small businesses to set up a secure wireless network unfortunately the outcome has fallen short of the goal while WPS does ease the setup burden it is also easily exploited by an attacker and should actually be disabled on all equipment this exploit has been known for a couple of years years and you would think that equipment manufacturers would quit enabling WPS by default on their equipment but that's not the case so when you set it up you good day I'm Brian Ferell and welcome to Pace's session on network hardening techniques part one today I'm going to discuss using secure protocols using antimalware software and I'm going to conclude with implementing switch and router security there's a whole lot of information to impart not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about using secure protocols network security is always an ongoing process because the threats to it keep changing although security threats are continually evolving administrators can use some techniques to harden the base Network structure to help ease the ever shifting security landscape these hardening techniques establish a good security Foundation that can be further built upon making the network that much harder to crack one of these hardening techniques is to use secure protocols whenever possible so let's discuss some of those protocols first up is secure shell or SSH it's a protocol that is used to create an encrypted Communications session between devices it's commonly used to create a secure virtual terminal session it should be used in place of telnet whenever possible then there's SNMP version 3 that's simple Network management protocol version 3 it's a protocol that's used to manage and configure devices remotely on the network it's more secure than the prior two versions because it supports encryption secure file transfer protocol or SFTP should always be used in place of FTP it's a protocol that's used to transfer data and manage file structures in a secure manner through the use of an SS session as I said just a moment ago it is a better option than FTP which requires user authentication but does not encrypt the communication SFTP en CPS the whole process then there's TLS or transport layer security it's a cryptographic protocol that's used to encrypt online Communications it uses certificates and asymmetrical cryptography to authenticate hosts and exchange security Keys it is a better option than SSL or secure socket layer which functions in a similar manner when performing sensitive online online business you should use https hyper text transfer protocol secure it's a protocol that is used to secure the communications Channel between a web browser and a web server https uses either TLS or SSL technology IPC or IPC is a network layer IP security protocol Suite that can use multiple methods to mutually authenticate both ends of the communication Channel it also will encrypt all data Transmissions unlike most other protocols it can provide endtoend security for any application let's move to using anti maware software antimalware applications help to protect networks and network resources against malware intrusions as in spyware viruses and worms there are are three main options for using antimalware applications there's hostbased antimalware the application is installed on the individual machines and only protects those nodes on which it resides it's easily tuned to the needs of the individual host but requires that the user keep it up to dat then there's networkbased antimalware the application is installed within the local network and served to the individual client that require it it is easily administered but harder to tune for the individual hosts but the network administrator can ensure that it remains up to dat finally there's cloudbased antimalware the application resides in the cloud so it is outside of the local network and it is served to the clients inside the local network as needed this service has a very small footprint on the local machine and tends to be be kept more current than the other options but it is an added cost that must be evaluated let's conclude with talking about implementing switch in router security when is using a password not secure well the answer is when the password is kept in clear text one solution to this is to save passwords and other sensitive information as hashes hashing is a cryptographic process that uses an algorithm to derive a set value also known as the hashed value from the sensitive data the hash can be used to verify that data is coming from where it is supposed to and that it has not been intercepted or changed in transit the most popular hashing algorithms are md5 and Sh or Shaw of the two Shaw is the more secure and the wise network administrator makes sure that all password and usernames are kept as hashed values under implementing switch security measures switch Port security measures are vital first off switch Port security should be enabled all Enterprise switches are capable of having security measures enabled at the Port level and that should happen also the native VLAN should be changed from its default value all active ports should be assigned Ed to nonnative vlans all nonactive switch ports should be assigned to an unused nonnative VLAN also vlans should be created to clearly segment the network into logical secure areas a switchport security measure that should be considered is MAC address filtering this will only allow specific Mac addresses to connect to specific ports DHCP snooping should be enabled this will only allow DHCP responses from an administrator defined switch Port this means that all DHCP responses will come from the same port in addition to DHCP snooping Dynamic ARP inspection or Dai should also be enabled this process is combined with DHCP snooping to restrict the opportunity for ARP cache poisoning to occur all address resolution protocol requests are compared against the ARP table contained in the administratively defined DHCP server implementing these measures will greatly increase the security of your switches let's move on to router security measures each interface on a router should have an access control list or ACL in place to control and filter traffic each interface can actually have two ACLS one ACL on the inbound side of the interface and one ACL on the outbound side of the interface an ACL is a set of rules that is used to govern and filter the flow of network traffic into and out of a network the ACL examines packets against its established rules beginning from the first rule at the top of the list and continuing down through all the rules the rules either allow or deny the packet from continuing once the packet matches a rule the rule is enforced and the ACL process is exited ACL rules can be based on protocols and ports IP addresses Source addresses destination addresses Etc all ACLS end with an implicit deny statement meaning that if it isn't specifically allowed then the packet is discarded the ACL can be time based as in day of the week or time of day and it can fulfill a specific function based on the reason that it is created as in an ACL can be used to filter out websites or web content that concludes this session on network hardening techniques part one I talked about using secure protocol then we moved on to using antimalware software and we concluded with a brief discussion on implementing switch and router Security on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on network hardening techniques part two today we're going to talk about encryption Basics and then we're going to talk about wireless network hardening and then I'm going to conclude with a brief discussion on security policies with that let's go ahead and begin this session I'm going to begin by talking about encryption Basics encryption is the process of taking a message and scrambling the data so that it can't be read if it gets intercepted encryption relies upon the fact that the receiver of The Scrambled data has the proper key that allows it to unscramble the data and put the message back together the strength of the encryption is usually determined by the strength of the key the strength of the key is measured in the number of bits that it takes to generate the key the more bits that it takes the stronger the key the private key in this Arrangement the private key cannot decrypt what it encrypted and the public key cannot decrypt what it encrypted so it only works if there are two separate keys so let's talk about those asymmetrical encryption keys there are two main types tyes of asymmetrical encryption keys there is the EAP TLS type key that's extensible authenication protocol transport layer security type of key it requires the use of a certificate Authority or CA that is trusted by both parties the ca provides the certificates to both parties that allow for the generation of both the public and private security Keys it's very secure but it is also difficult to manage and maintain then there's ttls tunneling transport layer security it's as secure as the EAP TLs but only the authentication server receives a certificate for the key generation process and it's easier to manage and maintain than EAP TLS with that covered let's move on to wireless network hardening wireless networks can represent a special challenge in the network hardening process the goal of most hardening techniques is to keep nefarious elements from ever seeeing the network traffic but with wireless networks that is all but imposs as traffic is broadcast over known radio frequency channels this traffic is subject to capture and the Transmissions inform any who care that an active wireless network is present there are steps that can be taken as in encrypting the traffic to make sure that even if the network traffic is captured it cannot be read this helps to keep the network traffic safe and the network from being breached one of the first techniques that you can use to harden a wireless network is MAC address filtering MAC address filtering can be used to limit which devices can connect to the wireless network if an unknown Mac address attempts to connect to the network it is ignored by the wireless access point so when it requests to join the WAP checks its Mac filter and if that Mac isn't in the filter it just drops that requester while Mac filtering can be effective it can also be difficult to manage and it is also possible to spoof Mac addresses which brings us to basic authentication and encryption for wireless networ works first up is web or wired equivalent privacy it's an encryption standard that uses either a 40 bit or 128bit encryption key in the rc4 algorithm to authenticate devices and encrypt Transmissions it uses a preshared key as a password or passphrase to authenticate users web is easily cracked and should not be used as a matter of fact web can be cracked in minutes better than weap is WPA WiFi protected access it's an authentication and encryption standard that improved upon web but still uses psk and the rc4 algorithm but to increase security it also introduced temporal key Integrity protocol or tkip tkip generates a new security key for every packet and that new security key has a strength of 128 bits or greater now it's not as easily cracked as web but it can still be cracked and should not be used unless absolutely necessary and hopefully that's not the case in your wiress network better than WPA is WPA2 personal WiFi protected access to personal it's an authentication and encryption standard that improved upon WPA it does not rely upon the weak rc4 encryption algorithm but it does use AES as its algorithm that's Advanced encryption standard it can also use the psk method but this is not required as WPA2 personal can also dynamically assign security keys while it's theoretically possible to crack WPA2 personal it would be extreme extremely difficult to do so so this should be the minimum level of security on any wireless network better yet if possible deploy WPA2 Enterprise now this forms a portion of the 802.1x standard it is used to authenticate users on a wireless network and uses one of the forms of the extensible Authentication Protocol in setting up the encryption a central authentication server is required for 802.1x or WPA2 Enterprise which does allow for greater control over the authentication process as a side note EAP is actually a set of definitions for how security keys will be exchanged in order for encryption to take place it's time to conclude with a brief discussion on security policies while security policies are only written documents they can actually do quite a bit to harden a network against a breach security policies document or outline what is allowed or not allowed to occur on the network from a security point of view they're usually crafted at the upper layer of management with the help of knowledgeable IT personnel they establish the expected Behavior which can go a long ways towards hardening your network security policies give administrators the authority to put into place measures to protect the security of the network in many cases they also give administrators the authority to enforce the policies that lead to a hardened Network well that concludes this session on network hardening techniques part two I began by talking about encryption Basics then we moved on to wireless network hardening and we concluded with a brief discussion on security policies on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on network hardening techniques part three today I'm going to discuss user authentication and then I'm going to talk about some authentication and authorization methods there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and dive into this session of course I'm going to start by talking about user authentication hardening the network will not do you any good if there is poor authentication of the users and devices that are allowed on the network the process of proving that you are who you say you are if you are a person or that you are what you say you are if it's a device is called authentic ation authentication is different than authorization authorization is what you are allowed to do after you have been authenticated there are several different ways in which users can be authenticated and there are several different methods in which authentication can be implemented let's talk about basic authentication of the user there are three basic factors for authenticating users there's by by what you know this is the user and password method by what you are this is commonly implemented through biometric and finally there is by what you have this is commonly implemented through the use of security tokens these are the three basic factors for authenticating users now you can combine these in a process that's called multiactor authentication that's requiring the use of more than one of the factors of authentication as in requiring a password and a fingerprint scan or the code from a security token and a password those are multiactor authentication now multiactor authentication is used to increase the security of the authentication process you might also Implement a single sign on process it's a process in which the user only has to provide authentication once via a single smart device rather than having to authenticate for each and every Network resource that they request so let's talk about authentication and authorization methods the first method we're going to talk about is Pap password Authentication Protocol when logging into a network resource the user or device is required to supply a username and password the username and password are sent in clear text format so this method is considered unsecure and should only be used as a last resort more secure than Pap is Chap challenge handshake Authentication Protocol it is similar to Pap in that when logging into a network resource the user or device is challenged to supply a username and secret password and it authenticates through a threeway handshake process the way it works the resource issues a challenge it wants to know the hashed value of the username and secret password the user's device sends the hashed value to the resource device the resource evaluates the hashed value and either accepts or rejects The Connection by using chap the username and password are never sent in clear text it's much more secure than pap there's also Ms chap it's functionally the same as challenge handshake Authentication Protocol but it is Microsoft's proprietary implementation of it you might also Implement one of the forms of extensible Authentication Protocol or EAP it's not a single protocol on its own but a set of additional authentication methods used by remote access clients currently there are are more than 100 different methods defined by the EAP specifications one of the more popular is Kerberos so let's talk about Kerberos it's an Authentication Protocol which uses TCP or UDP Port 88 by default it's a system of authentication and authorization that works well in environments that have a lot of clients the main component of Kerberos is the key Distribution Center or the KDC the KDC has two parts the authentication server or as and the ticket granting service or TGs here's how it works when a user logs in a hashed value of his or her username and password is sent to the authentication server if the as likes the hash it responds with a ticket granting ticket and a timestamp so it will respond with a TGT that also has a timestamp the client then sends the TGT with the timestamp to the ticket granting service the TGs the TGs then responds with a service ticket which can also be called an access token or just a token the service ticket authorizes the user to access specific resources on that Network as long as the TGT is still valid the TGs will grant additional authorization by issuing a new service ticket as required for as long as the TGT and its Tim stamp are still valid now that concludes this session on network hardening techniques part three I talked about user authentication and then we concluded by talking about authentication and authorization methods on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I trust I'll new another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on physical network security control today we're going to be discussing the why of physical network security and then we're going to move on to some physical network security practices there's a fair amount of information to in part so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by discussing the why of physical network security your network security actually begins at the door the boundaries of your building should be your first line of defense if an attacker has physical access to the network resources then there is a high probability that those network resources can be breached the level of security that that gets deployed should be driven by the amount of security that is needed as the need for overall security increases so should the level of physical security there are dangers that are associated with unauthorized physical access there is theft of those network resources and they are expensive to replace unintentional damage can occur when there is unauthorized physical access it only takes a simple spilled drink to destroy a server or a router or a switch or some other expensive component it's also possible that if an attacker has physical access they can reconfigure those network resources this can result in a breached Network one type of reconfiguration that's possible are devices that have credential workarounds some networking equipment comes with known workaround rounds for when administrator credentials need to be recovered as in when an administrator leaves an organization without disclosing his or her log on credentials or when an administrator forgets those credentials Cisco even publishes the steps of its workaround on its website and those steps are available for anybody to review if you're curious about those steps you can check out that web link that I've posted here this wellknown vulnerability is an easy exploit for anybody that has physical access to Cisco equipment with the why of physical network security out of the way let's move on to physical network security practices basic physical security should include knowing who's in the building and who has access to equipment you can do that through employee badges security checkin should be implemented for all visitors all vulnerable network resources as in servers and networking equipment should be kept in a secure area then there's intermediate physical security this is where access to all vulnerable network resources is controlled and logged one way to implement this is to use RFID badges to gain access to network resources or you could Implement Cipher locks that people have to punch a code in order to unlock the door another step in intermediate physical security is the separation of resources switches and routers are secured separately from servers with different access levels for the servers and the networking equipment in environments where high security is needed advanced physical security needs to be implemented a zoned approach is an advanced physical security practice it's a layering of Security in which multiple barriers or security tests must be passed before physical access is granted the methods of physical security that are used can be thought of as those security tests you can use security guards requiring all authorized Personnel to have some form of ID so that the security guards can identify if that person is in an area in which they're allowed then there are door locks you could use Simple key locks the analog approach a slightly more advanced method would be Cipher locks with the deployment of different codes for different areas or different groups of people this allows for the logging of who has unlocked a door you might also Implement RFID magnetic locks which also allow for the logging of of who has unlocked the lock one of the most advanced types of door locks would be be a biometric lock they're locks that make the person gaining access prove who they are through either a fingerprint scan or a retinal scan or possibly even a voice print video monitoring can also be deployed as a form of physical security allowing you to record who has had access to those resources you need to remember to store the recordings separately from the resources being monitored so if the resource gets stolen they don't steal the recording as well you may Implement a separation of resources networking equipment is kept separate from servers and the methods of access for the two resources are different and finally in highly secure environments a man trap may be implemented a man trap usually involves at least two doors access is granted through one door but the next door cannot be opened until further verification a has been achieved and the person that's between the doors cannot go back out the other door that means that ideally the person between the doors is trapped until some action or verification takes place that concludes this session on physical network security control we talked about the why of physical network security and then we concluded with a brief discussion on physical network security practices on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian Ferrell and welcome to pait's session on firewall Basics today I'm going to discuss types of firewalls and then we're going to move on to firewall settings and techniques I have a whole whole plethora of information to impart not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and jump into today's session of course I'm going to start with types of firewalls first up are hostbased firewalls these are installed at the node which is usually a desktop computer they're often used in conjunction with network based firewalls now hostbased firewalls are always software applic ations then there are networkbased firewalls usually these are implemented on the perimeter of the network segment that needs the protection they're used to protect private networks from public or outside networks networkbased firewalls can be a network appliance which means that it was specially designed and deployed to provide only firewall services or it can be a software application either as part of the router's operating system or as a specialty application on a server that is providing some routing function it's time to move on to small office home office firewalls in most cases the network firewall is provided by a wide area network connection device so most often the main firewall is provided by the DSL modem or the cable modem in conjunction with this a hostbased firewall is often used with the networkbased firewall this provides a little bit more protection and it allows for more granular configuration of the firewall protection part of network security there are stateless inspection firewalls these examine all the packets either entering or leaving the network it examines these packets against a set of rules the set of rules is called an access control list or ACL the AC CL rules are defined as static values by an administrator as I stated all of the packets are examined against the rules in the ACL starting with the first rule if a packet matches a rule that rule is enforced and then the ACL is exited stateless inspection firewalls do not care about the state of the connection they only care about the packets and all packets are examined then there are State f inspection firewalls a stateful inspection firewall doesn't really care about the packets it only cares about the state of a connection between two endpoints as a general rule connections are not allowed to be made from outside of the local network segment to the local network segment being protected only the initial packets going from inside the network to a destination outside of the network are inspected against an ACL if the ACL allow allows those packets to leave the network and a connection is made or once the connection has been established the firewall only monitors the state of that connection it allows the free flow of packets between the inside note and the outside destination as long as the state of the connection remains valid there are application aware firewalls these are firewalls that not only examine the packets but also the app apption protocol that is being used so it knows if it's FTP or HTTP that's being used application aware firewalls make allow or deny decisions based on the application later protocol as well as other ACL rules they are slower but more thorough in protecting the private Network than firewalls that are not application aware there are also context aware firewalls these are firewalls that can identify not only applications but also users Andor devices this is the context of the traffic so context aware firewalls can be used to restrict or allow traffic based on the context as well as other ACL rules then there are unified threat management devices or UTM devices these are network appliances that include not only a firewall service but other services as as well usually intrusion detection services or intrusion Prevention Services one concern with a UTM device is that it can create a single point of failure in the network what happens to the network if that UTM device fails is your security gone or does the network go down that is a concern about using a UTM most often firewalls are implemented on a router's interface or at the host level when implemented on the router interface the firewall takes part in the routing process when implemented at the host level the firewall protects the host on which it resides there is an exception to these scenarios and it's the implementation of a virtual wire firewall this type of firewall is a networkbased firewall that resides between two devices and provides neither routing nor switching functions if it contains two interfaces and as traffic passes between those interfaces the packets are compared to an ACL but it's usually not used to protect a specific host and it does not take part in the routing function it's time to proceed with firewall settings and techniques first up is the ACL each firewall interface may have two ACLS associated with it an inbound ACL and an out outbound ACL the inbound ACL examines all packets inbound on that interface an outbound ACL examines all packets outbound on that interface the ACL contains a set of administrator defined rules that either allow or deny packet traffic rules can be based on such criteria as Source or destination IP address Mac address protocol and time of day when an ACL examined packets those packets are examined against the set of rules from top to bottom once a rule is matched as in deny FTP packets from leaving the network that rule is enforced and the ACL is exited the last rule of any ACL is an implicit deny that means if the packet being evaluated does not match any of the explicit rules of the ACL the implicit deny is enacted and the packet is blocked care and caution should be used whenever creating an ACL if nothing else because that implicit deny statement ends every ACL list you may end up blocking traffic that you did not intend to block it's time to discuss firewall placement and we're going to begin with perimeter placement this requires that the firewall be placed at the outside edge Edge usually at the wide area network connection of the local segment or the land segment stateful inspection firewalls work well on the perimeter they are usually slower to make the initial connection but once that connection is achieved they offer better performance you could have internal placement of your firewall this requires that the firewall be placed in a logical central location it's usually used to route between different internal private networks stateless inspection firewalls work well for internal placement they are faster to make connections and require less memory a DMZ or demilitarize Zone requires a special configuration or placement considerations for your firewalls the DMZ is a specific area that is created usually between two firewalls that allows outside access to network resources while the internal network is still protected from outside traffic you should consider using a DMZ if you're going to have a web server on your network outside users will need to access your web server which is on your network but your internal network still needs to be protected from malicious traffic the external facing router allows specific outside traffic into the DMZ while the internal router prevents that same outside traffic from entering the internal Network that concludes this session on firewall Basics I talked about types of firewalls and then we ended with firewall settings and techniques on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on network access control today we're going to be talking about Edge versus access control and then we're going to talk about some Access Control concepts with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about Edge versus Access Control when access to network resources is granted or denied by a firewall it is considered to be at the edge of the network so that is edge control while this may work well in smaller and simpler networks it can become very complicated and cumbersome as the network grows through implementing other Access Control measures these complications can be reduced while at the same time the security of the network may be increased this idea is called network access control control or Knack these Access Control measures do not replace the need for firewalls they do however allow the firewalls to concentrate on controlling Network traffic into and out of the network that is what they do best and that is what they should be concerned about not who or what type of device can connect to the network firewalls are not very efficient at that aspect of edge Access Control let's move on to some Access Control Concepts first up is authentication via 802.1x 802.1x is a popular method of authenticating client devices and users on either Ethernet or wireless networks when a client device which is called the supplicant attempts to join a network an authenticator which is usually a switch or wireless access point requests the supplicant credentials the authenticator then forwards the client's credentials to an authentication server or as which is typically running software such as remote authentication dial in user service or radius the authentication server evaluates the credentials and either informs the authenticator to allow or deny the supplicant device access to the protected network if the credentials are validated the authenticator that remember that's that switch or wireless access point grants the supplicant access to the protected network 802.1x is very popular in Enterprise type networks Access Control can also be achieved through posture assessment this is the process of evaluating more than just the client's credentials commonly posture assessment is used to evaluate the type of device that is requesting a connection is it a tablet or is it a PC or is it a mobile phone so on and so forth posture assessment can be used to evaluate the type of antimalware software that's on the device and how updated that software is during this process a check is also performed to determine if malware is present on the device posture assessment is commonly used to evaluate the operating system as well as in how updated that operating system is and what the registry settings are at the time that access is being requested if the client passes the assessment it is allowed onto the protected network if the client does not pass the assessment usually one of two actions are taken the first action could be that the client is notified of the rejection and what has to occur before it can pass the posture assessment does it need an operating system update does it need antimalware installed so on and so forth the other action that is commonly taken when a device has failed the posture assessment is that it is passed on to a remediation server which will then attempt to resolve the cause of the failed posture assessment it will do this with no user interaction required once it has remediated the device and it can pass the assessment it then goes through the process again and is allowed onto the network if it passes it's time to move on to the posture assessment process one of two types of Agents think software code is used on client devices during the assessment process it could be a persistent agent which is permanently loaded on the device and starts when the operating system loads this type of agent can provide more functionality than the other version a persistent agent is more likely to be used if that device regularly connects to the network the other type of agent is a nonpersistent agent when the client device attempts to access the network the agent is loaded onto the device to help in the assessment process once the assessment process is complet completed pass or fail the agent is removed from the device a nonpersistent agent would work best for a guest device when devices attempt to connect to the protected Network they are placed on a guest network with very limited access they are left on the guest Network until the assessment process is completed in some cases particularly when the client fails the antimalware check the client device may be placed into a quarantine Network which will only have access to a remediation server and it cannot move beyond that quarantine Network until it can successfully pass the posture assessment now that concludes this session on network access control I talked about Edge versus access control and then we concluded with some Access Control Concepts on behalf of pit thank you for watching this session and I trust you'll watch another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on basic forensic Concepts today I'm going to be discussing collecting the evidence and then we're going to have a discussion on what to do after the evidence has been collected I have a fair amount of ground to ever so let's go ahead and begin this session we will begin this session by talking about actually collecting the evidence the first step in basic forensics is the recognition that forensic measures need to take place as in that a security incident has occurred most of us at least hopefully will not need to deal with a murder mystery at least not in the workplace with that said it's almost certain that we will have to deal with some type of security or legal issue when supporting an organization's Network the response to security and legal issues needs to be done in a manner such that evidence is recorded and preserved the first step is recognizing that something has occurred which needs to be documented and that the evidence needs to be collected and preserved that's the first step in forensics at least as far as forensics pertains to network Administration Network administrators and technicians are quite often the First Responders to a security breach on it systems as such they have some responsibilities first off they need to secure the area and limit who has access as much as possible also do not power down computer systems the restricting of access and not powering down the system systems is done to protect possible evidence from being contaminated document everyone who has accessed the area after it has been secured this protects your chain of custody if necessary to stop an ongoing computer attack it is permissible to unplug the network cable from the computer but that's it once the area is secure if necessary now is the time to escalate the response depending upon the situation you may need to bring in Specialists or even the police no matter what it's important that the scene get documented thoroughly including what is on any computer monitors taking photographs is a great way to document the scene if photographs are taken they should be done with a polaroid type camera in film not with digital pictures it's harder to manipulate a Polaroid and therefore it's more believable than a digital image it may also be necessary to diagram to draw out the area also interview any witnesses as soon as possible before their memory starts to degrade or before they begin to collaborate on what story to tell also the electronic evidence collection process needs to begin as soon as possible and it needs to be collected by order of volatility so let's talk about the evidence and data collection process electronic evidence is volatile and easily corruptible just because of what it is it's magnetic data so the order of collection is important the first thing that should be collected are the contents of memory or Ram this is the most volatile of all types of data next are swap files they're not as volatile as random access memory but are still very temporary in nature then all Network processes need to be documented at least all of those that are active on the affected system or systems after documenting Network processes next up are the system processes and that is all system processes that are active on the affected system after that move on to file system information including the attributes of the files you need to do this before you do anything else so that you have completely documented the attributes of the files once all of that is done it's time to make a copy of all of the contents on all of the disk drives of the affected systems and that would be by raw disk blocks so let's talk about that a little bit more after isolating the affected system or systems from the network you need to create a bit level image of the system or systems that means an exact duplicate of the disk drives and actually you need to create two copies two images and with those two images you also need to create a message Mage digest of the image drives to be able to later prove that they have not been tampered with you can use md5 or sha as the hash algorithm to make that message digest one image should be securely stored to be used as evidence and with that should go the hashed image that way you can prove in court that it hasn't been tampered with the other image can be examined and modified in order to determine what exactly happened now let's move on to a discussion about what happens after the evidence has been collected and the first item is the chain of custody now this actually starts during the collection period and survives The Collection period on into the future the chain of custody is a document that identifies who collected the evidence when it was collected and who has had access to it since it has been collected proper chain of custody doc document can prove that the evidence has been accurately preserved and the chain of custody document can also be considered part of the evidence a chain of custody document will help to ensure that all the evidence that is collected is admissible in court a broken chain of custody will negate the collected evidence and by that if your chain of custody gets broken your evidence is no longer considered evidence so now let's talk about the Eis y process or the electronic Discovery process in legal situations the discovery process involves the exchange of evidence between both sides of a litigation or prosecution situation eisc Discovery refers to the Discovery process as it pertains to electronic data as in email database files or chat records any data that's kept in electronic format once identified in the Eis Discovery process a legal hold is placed on the data that has been identified a legal hold occurs when data has been deemed to be possibly relevant in either a prosecution or litigation situation if a legal hold occurs all normal processing of that data needs to cease that data needs to remain in the state that it was in during the ecovery process so a legal hold requires that back tapes not be recycled and that the normal archival process for that data be suspended until the legal hold is removed there are some items to consider when electronic data needs to be transported and it's considered evidence if it's physical evidence as in a hard drive a chain of custody document must be created for the transportation process and it needs to include an exact description of the evidence the means of Transport who received the evidence to transport it and who had access to the evidence during the transport process if you're using electronic means of transport a message digest should also be included to prove that the exact evidence sent is the evidence that is received once the forensic process has concluded or once the investigation has been completed a forensic report needs to be created based on the findings of the investigation during the evidence collection and investigation process the characteristics of the evidence should have been documented so you know what timestamps were present or any identifying properties that are associated with that evidence all of this information needs to be recorded and analyzed using scientific methods once completed the forensic report should be able to completely reconstruct and document the evidence a forensic report may be used in the litigation or prosecution process in addition a good forensic report may help in the creation of a better response plan for use in the future now that concludes this session on basic forensic Concepts I talked about collecting the evidence and then we concluded about what happens after the evidence has been collected on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on network troubleshooting methodology today I'm going to be talking about the importance of a methodology and then I'm going to cover the seven step troubleshooting methodology recommended by by comp Tia there's a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session we are going to begin by discussing the importance of a methodology first up is one of my favorite quotes concerning methodologies and it is my methodology is not knowing what I'm doing and making that work for me that's from Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam and unfortunately we don't quite have that kind of Liberty when it comes to troubleshooting networks all networks will require troubleshooting if you don't know where to start or haven't developed a methodology you will waste time and resources the complexity of modern networks means that there is a lot that can go wrong without a troubleshooting methodology your frustration levels and the frustration levels of those you support is going to rise a systematic trouble shooting methodology can significantly reduce the time required to resolve a problem and close a network trouble ticket saving both time and other resources it's time to move on to comp Tia's sevenstep troubleshooting methodology of course we're going to begin with step one which is identify the problem gather information what is actually occurring or not occurring is the problem extremely local as in relegated to your network or is the problem occurring in an area that is out of your control identify the systems remember the symptoms are not the problem they just point toward the underlying issue most often when the trouble ticket comes in it will have some of the symptoms but it will not have identified the actual problem approach multiple problems individually handle them one at a time question the users this needs to be done both politely and firmly many problems that are reported within a network are the result of the enduser needing to be educated or reeducated in proper procedures at the same time you also need to remember that most end users don't have your level of technical of technical knowledge so be patient but don't patronize and finally when identifying the problem determine if anything has changed this also requires a systematic approach so be very thorough step two is to establish a theory of probable cause make a list of all of the possible causes of the problem to develop this list of possible causes you should consider multiple approaches to the problem from bottom to top and then from top to bottom of the OSI model that is a great way to approach the problem from multiple Direction directions divide your list of possible causes into three ranked sections they should be not likely likely and most likely this will provide a great place to start when establishing your theory of probable cause remember to question the obvious if the network printer doesn't work check to be sure that it is turned on the third step is to test the theory of probable cause if the theory is confirmed move on to the next step if the theory is proven to be incorrect then reestablish a new theory of probable cause if you run out of probable causes or the situation worsens it may be time to escalate the issue up the troubleshooting chain once you've confirmed your theory of probable cause it's on to step four establish a plan of action and identify potential effects simple problem s may require a simple plan as in if the network printer doesn't work and the probable cause is that it's not turned on turn on the network printer more complex problems will require more complex plans in some cases it is a good idea to write the plan out step by step in order to determine the best course of action and to identify any possible repercussions that the resolution to the problem May introduce into the network step five is to implement the plan or to escalate the problem if you have the authority put your plan in action if you don't have the authority escalate the problem up the troubleshooting chain including all facts and determinations when you're escalating the problem don't make that next level above you have to recreate everything that you've done once you've implemented your plan it's on to step six verify full system functionality don't just verify that the original problem has gone away because sometimes a fix will introduce a new issue into the system if a new issue has occurred it's time to go back to Step One or to escalate the problem if you have verified full system functionality this is where you implement preventative measures to keep this problem from reoccurring and finally step seven document findings Act and outcomes document everything this will save time if and when the problem reoccurs your documentation may lead to new best practices for your organization it's important to document your missteps as well it will keep the next technician from making those same missteps that you have made and this will help to improve your chances of becoming the network support technician Rockstar in in your organization that concludes this session on network troubleshooting methodology I talked about the importance of a methodology and then I covered comp Tia's sevenstep troubleshooting methodology on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pit's session on TR shooting connectivity with utilities today I'm going to talk about connectivity utilities defined then I'm going to move on to connectivity utilities explained and we will conclude with some additional software for troubleshooting connectivity there's a fair amount of ground to cover let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with connectivity utilities defined before we can Define the utilities we need to Define Define connectivity connectivity is a program or devic's ability to connect or link to other programs or devices a connectivity utility is a utility or application that is used to establish connectivity and or to diagnose or fix a connectivity issue with that out of the way let's move on to connectivity utilities explained all modern operating systems come with prepackaged connectivity utilities designed to diagnose and or to repair connectivity issues in some cases you can use these utilities or programs from a graphical user interface or guei however in all cases you can use the following applications from the command prompt first up is Ping it is a simple utility that is used to determine if there's connectivity between two nodes or two endpoints it uses icmp Echo requests there are two basic formats to the Ping utility you can ping an IP address or you can ping the host name or the fully qualified domain name you can use ping 6 or ping minus 6 and you will ping only IPv6 hosts then there is Tracer or trace route it is a utility that is used to determine the path used between two nodes Tracer TR R A CER T is the windows version and trace route t r a c r o u t is the Linux Unix or OSX version of the command it also uses icmp Echo requests but it uses it with an incrementing time to live field to form queries and get responses each time the icmp echo request is sent out the TTL field is incremented by one and Tracer is used to determine how many routers are between two points it can be of limited value though as many routers have icmp disabled it uses the same basic format as ping then there is pathping it is a network connectivity utility that has been supplied in Microsoft operating systems since the introduction of NT path ping built upon the functionality of ping by combining it with Tracer when the application is used it will in effect perform a tracer command defining the path to the end node and then it will perform a ping test on each hop one disadvantage to path ping is that it requires 25 seconds per hop to show the Ping results and it uses the same command format as ping and Trace one of my favorite utilities is IP config or if config IP config is the windows version and if config is the Linux Unix OSX version it's used to determine the IP configuration of a given node it can also be used to change that IP configuration if used correctly when using to diagnose connectivity look for incorrect IP address es incorrect subnet masks incorrect DNS addresses and or an incorrect default gateway then there's ARP which stands for address resolution protocol ARP is used to correlate IP addresses to MAC address this utility can help to determine when there is an issue with an address resolution protocol table on a given node then we have NS lookup that stands for name server lookup it's supported by all major operating systems and it's used to diagnose domain naming system issues or DNS issues it can be very helpful in determining if a DNS server is having a problem dig is similar to NS lookup but it is specific to Unix Linux and OSX it does use different switch modifiers and returns slightly different results there is the route utility this is a Windows specific spefic command it's used to view and modify the routing tables on a Windows operating system node next up is NBT stat which stands for net bios over TCP statistics Windows implements the NBT protocol for backwards compatibility as a result the NBT stat utility is used if a net bios issue is suspected then there's net stat which stands for Network to statistics it's a utility that is used to display protocol statistics and current TCP IP network connections it's useful for determining if a connection has been made and the status of that connection it's time to move on to some additional software first up our throughput testers they're used to determine the data flow or bandwidth of a network they can be used internally to test the flow or bandwidth within a local area network or they can be used externally to test the flow of a Wan connection they are often used to create a baseline of network performance and last up we have protocol analyzers these are often called packet sniffers they examine Network behavior on a very basic level at the packet level they can examine all the packets coming into and out of an interface protocol analyzers are useful to see what is consuming network resources as in they can tell if a broadcast storm is occurring or if an interface is going bad wi shark is a common protocol analyzer that is often used and it's free that concludes this session on troubleshooting connectivities with utilities the first topic was connectivity utilities defined then we moved on to connectivity utilities explained and we concluded Ed with a brief discussion on some additional software on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on troubleshooting connectivity with Hardware today I'm going to discuss what makes a cable bad uh cable testing tools and I'm going to conclude with some additional tools I have a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session we will begin with what makes a cable bad network cables can go bad or be bad without any visible indication alternatively a cable may be inappropriate for a particular application it can be difficult to visually tell if cables are wired correctly and or a break in The Wire may not be visible both of these will cause problem problems additionally anything that makes the cable fall out of specification will make it a bad cable how long is the cable is it over the maximum length is the cable rated for the amount of data being run over the wire all of these are questions that can be answered using the proper tools it's time to discuss cable testing tools first up is the multimeter it can be used to test for brakes and copper wiring good network cables have a very low resistance value from one end of the cable to the other by the way your resistance is measured in ohms a high or infinite ohms value indicates a break in the cable so you can use multimeters to test for continuity to make sure that traffic can flow from one end to the other crimpers are not a testing tool per se but they are used for attaching cable ends onto cables which if you suspect you have a bad cable in or a miswired connector you're going to need a set of crimpers it can either be specific to a particular type of cable end or it may work for more than one type of cable and by the way it's not uncommon to need to replace the ends of twisted pair wiring cables every network technician should have a cable tester or cable certifier these can be either fairly simple or very complex cable testers will test for continuity in the wire as in is there a break cable testers will also test for proper pinouts are all the wires in the right places some will test for the wiring standard is it wired for the t568a standard or the t568b standard or have you created a crossover cable cable certifiers are a little bit more complex but they will also test for more Network related items they can test the speed of the wire they can test for duplex settings between two endpoints cable certifiers are used to certify a given Network segment toner probes are another handy tool they're usually a twopiece set they have an injector which places a signal onto the wire in a probe which detects the signal and emits a tone when it detects that signal these are also sometimes called a Fox and Hound they're used to find and Trace wires they're useful when having to replace a single wire in a bundle of wires you can place the injector on one end to figure out which wire it is at the other end then there is the time domain reflectometer this is a cable tester or certifier that can also determine the length of a M they can also tell where a break is in a segment which can then allow you to put in a splice they are more expensive than a standard cable tester or certifier related to the TDR is the optical time domain reflectometer are the otdr they perform the same function as a TDR but it is used for fiber optic cabling it is often called a light meter as it can measure the quantity and quality of the light going through a fiber optic cable some other thoughts on cable testing tools unless your job entails mostly installing cabling the most important tools are the cable tester crimper and toner probes personally I have never been able to justify the cost of a TDR I have used them but I've rented them instead of purchased them most of the time you can make do with inexpensive tools however spending more on certain tools will usually save time and money in the long run an exception to the inexpensive tool rule are toner probes inexpensive toner probes can be difficult to work with or they just don't work at all I would recommend stepping up and spending a little bit more for your toner probe try to strike a balance between cost and Effectiveness you can spend thousands of dollars on some of these tools especially tdrs and otdrs and never utilize them to their fullest potential the next topic is additional tools and we will begin with the wireless analyzer it is a similar tool to the protocol analyzer but it is used for wireless networks it sniffs out packets on wireless networks this information can be used to help solve Wireless connectivity issues a wireless analyzer can also perform other functions it can check for bandwidth usage Channel usage top talkers and top listeners it can identify networks by passively scanning the radio frequency channels it can identify hidden networks if given enough time and a wireless analyzer can also infer non beaconing networks Based on data traffic so it can help you to find those Rogue access points then there are looking glass sites or LG sites these are publicly available sites that can be used to view routing information remotely as viewed from the LG serers point of view they create a readonly portal on which routing statistics can be generated and viewed LG sites can be helpful in determining if the connectivity issue is occurring because of problems on the local network or if the remote connection is the issue that concludes this session on troubleshooting connectivity with Hardware I talked about what makes a cable bad I talked about cable testing tools and I concluded with some additional tools on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on troubleshooting wire less networks part one today I'm going to be talking about configuration issues and then we will conclude with some other issues there's a fair amount of information to go over so let's go ahead and begin this session I will Begin by talking about some common configuration issues while wireless networks are a huge convenience to users they do introduce a new set of troubleshooting issues into the network not only do the stand standard issues that crop up in a wired Network need to be considered the added layer of complexity that adding a wireless access point brings to the table will also need to be considered when Wireless networking is brought into the mix a very solid troubleshooting methodology becomes just that much more critical now on to the actual configuration issues first up is the service set identifier configuration or the SS ID configuration when this is an issue the major symptom is that the user is unable to connect to the wireless network and the probable cause is an SSID mismatch the corrective measure is to check that the ssids match exactly remember they are case sensitive then there is encryption configurations it has the same symptom as the SSID misconfiguration the user is unable to connect to the wireless network probable cause is an encryption type mismatch or incorrect security key the possible corrective measure is to check the encryption settings on the wireless access point and on the device to make sure they are the same another configuration issue that can cause problems is an incorrect Channel or overlapping Wireless channels the symptom is that the user is unable to connect or the wireless network has very poor performance the probable cause is either incorrect channels or the overlapping channels is causing the signal to noise ratio to be reduced that's the SNR the possible corrective measure include adjusting the WAP settings and device settings so that they're using the same channel hence there are only three available nonoverlapping channels on the 2.4 GHz radio frequency then there are incompatibilities and the symptom is again the user is not able to connect to the wireless network the probable cause is you have an 802.11a device being used in an environment in which it won't work as in you're using 802.11g or n or there's a frequency mismatch between the wireless access point and the devices the the possible corrective measure is to make sure you're using equipment with compatible wireless standards untested updates can also cause a configuration issue the symptom again is the user is unable to connect or there is poor performance the probable cause is a conflict between the update and other configuration settings or the wireless network settings the possible corrective measure is to roll back the system to the prior conf configuration here's another Hint it is a best practice to make a backup copy of a system before installing any updates let's move on to other wireless issues troubleshooting networks requires a combination of Art and Science some of the best tools in Your Arsenal will be patience and strategic thinking network issues can express themselves in a multitude of ways one of the best things that you as a technician can do is to see if you can recreate the problem an issue that can be recreated can usually be resolved easily also remember that the users you are dealing with are the reason that you have a paycheck treat them as you would like to be treated even if it is the 10th time that you've reminded Bob that his username and password are case sensitive interference is a common issue on wireless networks the symptoms include slow performance Andor intermittent drops the probable causes can include overlapping channels walls or other equipment that operates in the same frequencies some possible corrective measures include changing the RF Channel or frequency or adjusting the wireless access point placement then there's poor signal strength the symptoms include slow performance and or intermittent drops especially towards the end of your wireless network coverage area probable causes include low RF power settings antenna type Andor the placement of the access point possible corrective measures include changing the RF power setting as in increasing it or adjusting the antenna and or WAP placement there is a caution here increasing your radio frequency power or adjusting the equipment placement may cause the signal to go where it was not intended to go so if you do either of those you need to check and make sure that you're not putting your signal where you don't want it to be bandwidth or device saturation can also become an issue the symptoms include slow performance Andor intermittent drops the probable cause is that there are too many users or applications for the available bandwidth possible corrective measures include increasing the number of wireless access points and or changing to a wireless standard with more throughput the wrong antenna type may also become an issue the symptoms include low or no signal in an area or signal in an area where it is not supposed to be the probable cause is the wrong antenna type for the coverage the corrective measure would be to change to an antenna type to suit the required coverage then there is signal bounce the symptom is poor performance in unexpected locations or an unexpected wireless network signal in an area that was not intended to be covered the probable cause is the RF signal bouncing off of a hard object the possible corrective measure would be to adjust the wireless access point placement that concludes this session on troubleshooting wireless networks part one I talked about configuration issues and then I moved on to some other wireless network issues on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon good day I'm Brian Ferell and welcome to Pace's session on troubleshooting wireless networks part two today I'm going to be discussing Wireless environmental factors and then we're going to conclude with wireless standard related factors there's a whole lot of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about Wireless environmental factors when planning and setting up a wireless network quite often environmental factors that may impact the wireless network are disregarded it is easy to get distracted by all the moving pieces of the wireless network as in the SSID configuration encryption and which standards to use dealing with these often leads to overlooking factors in the environment that may impact the quality of the planned Network to get the most out of a wireless network these factors need to be taken into consideration as they can have a major impact on the overall quality and performance of the in installed Network we don't think about it very often but building materials can influence wireless networks a wireless network works by sending and receiving radio frequency waves across a given area anything that can interrupt the signal or change the path of the waves can create a problem in the network this is called signal bounce the signal May return to the wireless access point out of phase leading to poor performance or dropped packets alternatively the signal may end up being bounced into areas where coverage was not planned leading to a security issue or an interference issue with other wireless networks some building materials of concern include concrete walls metal studs and Window Films particularly window tinting with the metallic content when evaluating environmental factors it is important to consider consider more than just the building materials all hard surfaces have the potential to create an out of phase or bounced signal including office furnishings and file cabinets using a wireless analyzer and wireless survey tools during the planning stage of a wireless network will lead to better placement of the wireless equipment which ultimately leads to a better performing Network let's move on to some wireless standard related factors first up is wireless standard compatibility not all of the 802.11 standards are compatible with each other this is partially due to the RF frequencies that are used and with the most common frequencies being the 2.4 GHz or the 5 GHz radio frequency band the problem with compatability can also be because of the type of modulation that is employed modulation is the encoding of information to be placed on a carrier wave and it's employed to put the signal on the network the most common forms of modulation are orthogonal frequency Division multiplexing ofdm and direct sequence spread Spectrum or dsss so let's look at a compatibility list for 802.11 802.11a is not compatible with most other standards 802.11b is compatible with 802.11g and N 802.11g is compatible with 11b and 11n 802.11n is compatible with 802.11b G and AC 802.11 AC is compatible with 802.11n so let's talk about the wireless standards 802.11b uses the 2.4 GHz RF band and dsss as its form of modulation it offers up to 11 megabits per second networking with a maximum indoor range of 115 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range of 460 ft 802.11a uses the 5 GHz RF band and ofdm as its method of of modulation 11a offers up to 54 megabits per second networking with a maximum indoor range of 115 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range of 390 ft then there's 802.11g it uses the 2.4 GHz RF band and it can use both ofdm and dsss as its methods of modulation 11g offers a to 54 megabits per second networking with a maximum indoor range of 125 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range of 460 ft then we have 802.11n it can use both the 2.4 and the 5 GHz radio frequency bands with ofdm as its method of modulation 802.11n can offer up to 600 megabits per second networking with a maximum indoor range of of 230 ft and a Maximum Outdoor range of 820 ft finally we have 802.11ac it uses the 5 GHz radio frequency band with ofdm as its method of modulation it's expected to offer up to 1 gbits per second networking with a maximum indoor range of 115 ft at this point in time we do not have a Maximum Outdoor range as there still working on establishing that that concludes this session on troubleshooting wireless networks part two we talked about some Wireless environmental factors and then we concluded with a brief discussion on wireless standard related factors on behalf of pait thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to to pait's session on troubleshooting fiber cable networks today we're going to be talking about using the specific tool for the job and then we will conclude with some common fiber cable problems there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about using the specific tool for the job the nature of fiber optic networks makes troubleshooting them a little more expensive than other types of networks the reason for this is that the best and sometimes only tool that can be used for troubleshooting fiber optic cable problems is the optical time domain reflectometer or the otdr using the specific tool for the job at hand will ease the burden of diagnosing and resolving any network issues while an otdr costs thousands of dollars or in some cases tens of thousands of dollars in many cases it can quickly diagnose the problem a quick diagnosis can lead to a quick solution often saving significantly more than the cost of the tool by preventing lost productivity Andor Revenue that is why we spend money on otdrs so let's talk about some common fiber cable problems we're going to begin by talking about attenuation or deciel loss all Network Transmissions degrade over distance this is called attenuation or deciel loss this loss of signal strength can lead to slower speeds loss or Corruption of network traffic or the loss of the network communication link the otdr can not only diagnose attenuation but it can also help in the placement of a repeater station then there's broken Fiber Optic Cables as with all types of cable media fiber optic cables are subject to breakage as a matter of fact in some cases they are more delicate than other types of media certain types of fiber cable can span many kilometers making it difficult to determine where a break has occurred the otdr can be used to determine where a break in the fiber optic cable has occurred allowing the technician to insert a splice at that point a common cause of brakes and fiber optic CA is exceeding the bend radius limitations of the cable due to the construction of fiber optic cables it is subject to breakage if it is bent Beyond a certain point it is possible for small form factor plugable transceivers or for gigabit interface converter transceivers to go bad the SPF and gck transceivers are hot swappable replaceable modules that are used to add gigabit capabilities to switches routers and other networking equipment a bad transceiver will prevent communication from occurring and otdr can be used to help diagnose a bad SPF or gbck module it is possible to have a fiber type mismatch single mode fiber and multi mode fiber use different methods for placing the signal on the optic fiber if a mismatch occurs the most common problem is that it will be imp possible to make a network connection this is also referred to as a wavelength mismatch as the wavelength or color of the light being used is different between the modes of fiber transceivers the otdr can be used to determine the types of transceivers that are being used there are some other fiber optic cable issues that can arise anything that can interrupt the flow of light from transceiver to transceiver will create a problem dirt or smudges on the connectors may cause an issue with fiber optic cable Transmissions when this is suspected using a soft polishing cloth to clean the ends of the cable will solve the problem there is a caution never look directly into the ends of connected fiber optic cable if you do so you run the risk of damaging your eyes connectors are also specific to the mode of transmission as in SMF or MMF connecting the wrong type of connector to a cable will prevent proper communication from occurring also check to make sure that the proper connectors are being used with the proper type of fiber optic cables worn or broken connectors will create an air gap which will create a network transmission problem always inspect the connectors for their condition before use an otdr can be used to determine where the loss of signal is occurring even if it is at the connector that concludes this session on troubleshooting fiber cable networks we talked about using the specific tool for the job and then we concluded with common fiber cable problems on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you do watch another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace's session on troubleshooting common network issues today we're going to talk about problems that should be escalated and then we will conclude with problems that you should resolve there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session we're going to begin by talking about problems that an entrylevel network technician should escalate the complexity of mod modern networking is made using a solid troubleshooting methodology a necessity not an option networks can express problems and issues in many ways this can lead to much frustration on the part of the network users and the technicians responsible for fixing problems if such problems are not resolved quickly they can lead to loss of Revenue and productivity for an organization there are a number of problems that should be escalated up the troubleshooting chain as soon as they're discovered in order for them to be resolved in the most expedient manner the first of those problems is the switching Loop users complain that the network works fine for a while and then goes down and then works fine for a while and then goes down this indicates a spanning tree protocol convergence issue or a switching Loop in either case this is beyond the entry level technicians cap capabilities and should be escalated as soon as possible then there's the broadcast storm a failing Nick or application may cause a situation in which a broadcast storm is created the Nick goes down then comes back up then goes back down and it does this repeatedly this is often referred to as a flapping Nick each time it comes up it sends out a broadcast advertising its status which creates traffic congestion an application can do the same thing in either case escalate this up your support chain as soon as it's discovered similar to the switching Loop is the routing Loop but it involves the routing process this is more likely to occur when older routing Protocols are used but may also occur due to a misconfiguration of routers as in there are multiple static routes to the same location often switching to a newer routing protocol like OSF will resolve or banish routing Loops but this needs to occur farther up the support chain there are other routing problems that once discovered should be moved up the chain routing problems can manifest themselves in many different ways including missing IP routes failure to discover neighboring devices or failure to connect to neighboring devices once they're discovered when routing problems are suspected it is necessary to escalate the issue to the proper technical team one problem that can be difficult to diagnose is the mismatched maximum transmission unit or MTU this is often called an MTU black hole different types of Wan connections have different MTU settings that is the largest allowable size of a packet that can Traverse a link or be accepted by the link the MTU for ethernet by the way is 1,500 bytes routers will negotiate the MTU between links using icmp that's internet control message protocol if icmp has been disabled on the router which is a common practice when a router receives a packet that exceeds the MTU it will not respond and it will drop the packet the sending router continues to send the oversight packets into the MTU black hole never getting a response back that the packets are too big so the data is Flowing but it's not going anywhere when suspected this to should be moved up the support chain to the correct technical team Nick teaming can also create a problem this is the process of bonding multiple network interface controllers on a single system for the purpose of increasing bandwidth or for fail over purposes a misconfiguration may actually cause a loss of performance or in a worst case scenario the total loss of functionality if you're dealing with teamed Nicks move it up the support chain then there are power failure or power anomalies power failures are easy to diagnose but may be difficult to recover from while battery backup and generators May mitigate the issue they will not resolve the problem if the problem occurs within the building contact the appropriate group responsible for building maintenance if the problem occurs outside the building contact the appropriate utility electronic devices are sensitive to power issues anomalies in the quality of the electricity delivered to the device may cause problems using battery backups or uninterruptible power supplies with power conditioners will help to mitigate power anomalies with problems to escalate covered let's move on to problems that you can resolve we will begin with incorrect IP configurations under incorrect IP configurations we will begin with the default gateway the default gateway is the local network or computer's access to outside networks an incorrect Gateway will keep traffic from reaching its destination if it's suspected verify what the correct Gateway settings should be and correct it then there are duplicate IP addresses when duplicate IP addresses have been configured the first device booted up will get the address and the second one that gets booted up will get an address supplied by a Pippa this can occur when DHCP address reservation have not been configured correctly this is easy to verify and correct and should be done when an aipa address is received by a device there are other DHCP misconfigurations that can occur the problem is expressed in a similar manner as the duplicate IP address problem as in an a pipa address is supplied and is configured by a and is caused by a misconfigured DHCP server again verify your DHCP settings and correct then there are DNS misconfigurations users complain that they cannot get to resources or destinations on the network when using the host name DNS is used to resolve host names to IP addresses so a misconfiguration will prevent the function of the DNS process verify the correct DNS settings and correct as needed it's also possible to have incorrect VLAN assignments or incorrect virtual local area network assignments users will complain that they cannot get to necessary network resources this tends to be a single host issue or to involve a small group of hosts verify the VLAN settings and again correct as necessary incorrect interface configurations will also create network issues users May complain of poor Network performance or not being being able to connect to resources at all this issue tends to affect a whole network segment configuration issues could include mismatched Port speeds and or duplex settings on the interfaces verify the correct interface configurations and correct the settings simultaneous Wireless and wired connections will also create some networking issues many laptops come with wireless and wired Network capabilities built built into them it is possible for a laptop to attempt to use both at the same time this may cause the device to quit communicating on the network as a whole reminding users to turn off wireless capabilities before joining the wired network will resolve this problem not having good endtoend connectivity is another common problem the complexity of networks will just about guarantee that endtoend connectivity the ability to reach remote hosts will be lost at some point the Ping and Tracer utilities can be used to find where the breaking communication occurs this information can then be used to determine the next course of action last up is Hardware failure networking equipment and devices will fail when this happens it is usually denoted by the sudden loss or intermittent loss of networking fun functions or access the key to resolving this issue is in determining what has failed and replacing it that concludes this session on troubleshooting common network issues I began by talking about problems that should be escalated and then I concluded with problems that should be resolved on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I look forward to doing another one good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on common network security issues today I'm going to be discussing security issues caused by misconfiguration and then I will conclude on other network security issues with that let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about security issues caused by misconfiguration it's easy to assume that a network is secured from threats while in reality it may be very vulnerable a network may actually be vulnerable because of a misconfigured security setting or because of a common practice within an organization a network may not be as secure as you think due to the everchanging threat landscape nefarious hackers are continually seeking new exploits that they can use to breach network security including possible misconfigurations in network security settings the security settings may have been correct at the time that they were set up but due to the changing landscape they may be considered a misconfiguration now a misconfigured firewall Andor Access Control list may cause a security issue these can result in three different categories of security issues traffic that should be blocked isn't allowing threats in traffic that shouldn't be blocked is this can prevent the receiving of vital updates or all traffic is blocked this isn't necessarily a security issue per se but it is still a misconfiguration and it is possible for a junior network administrator to just remove the access control list or firewall to allow the traffic to start flowing again which is a security issue to protect against a misconfigured firewall or ACL thoroughly test them before putting them into action a misconfigured application may become a security threat a web application that does not perform proper validation of input may lead to a buffer overflow attack this may lead to a successful attack on the web server on which it is hosted thoroughly testing applications before placing them into service will mitigate the threat unpatched operating system or firmware will become a major security issue quickly the manufacturer of operating systems and Hardware firmware will often produce security patches or fixes for vulnerabilities as they become known an unpatched OS or firmware becomes very vulnerable in short order and may become a threat to the network most software makers have an updating service subscribing to that service will help to mitigate the threat open TCP IP ports are a security issue open ports on networks are listening for requests for or by Services applications or protocols all open ports are a security vulnerability and there are 65,535 possible ports that may be open a best practice for Network Security is to specifically close all unnecessary ports to harden a network the tacx plus and radius services are often used to authenticate devices and users on networks a misconfiguration on either may lead to a security issue that allows malicious users to be authenticated to use network resources thoroughly reviewing the configuration of authentication services will help to mitigate the problem in addition all default local accounts should be disabled these default local accounts may present a slight opening for a malicious user to exploit authentication Services active default usernames and passwords are an issue almost all devices and applications come with default usernames and passwords to ease the setup process if left active these defaults create a security issue as they tend to be well known or are easy to find through simple research a best practice is to disable all default usernames and passwords after setting up the device or application it's time to move on to other network security issues first up are malicious users malicious users may be the single biggest security issue facing any network and they will fall into one of two categories there is the untrusted malicious user this is an outside entity that has exploited a security weakness to gain access to network resources as in a hacker who has breached a databases security features to gain access to valuable information even worse than the untrusted malicious user is a trusted malicious user this this is a person or entity that has been explicitly granted access to network resources that then exploits this trusted position for malicious purposes and they are harder to guard against because you've already granted them access inside of your defenses a best practice is to review log files on a regular basis to see what resources are being accessed and by whom to help maintain security packet sniffers are also a security issue packet sniffers examine Network traffic at a very basic level and can be used to help in the administration of a network but packet sniffers may also be used by malicious users to see what protocols and activities are allowed on the network this may help them in further attacking the network then there is malware it is usually defined as malicious software that has the intent of causing harm as a category malware covers any codebased threat to a network or system examples of malware include viruses Trojans and spyware to protect against malware antimalware applications should be running on every device to be proactive enduser education should also be in place to teach them to recognize the dangers that malware presents the internet control messaging protocol itself may become a security issue icmp can be a valuable tool for diagnosing issues on networks but it can also become a security vulnerability icmp can be exploited in a denial of service type of attack icmp can also be used to redirect legitimate users to a new malicious default gateway possibly resulting in loss of data or or sensitive information it is now a best practice to deny icmp requests on a router's outwardfacing interface denial of service or distributed denial of service attacks are becoming more common in an attempt to bring down a network or website malicious users will often send thousands or hundreds of thousands of requests for service the attacker's goal is to make that resource unreachable by legitimate users many modern firewalls and other network appliances have been configured to recognize the signature of such an attack and can take steps to mitigate the results when creating applications developers often create back doors into the programs back doors are a method of accessing an application or service while bypassing the normal authentication process unfortunately these back door doors are sometimes left open after the development process has been completed once these become known they can be exploited in most cases the application is listening on a specific port for a request for access the best mitigation technique is to close all unnecessary ports on a network kind of sounds familiar doesn't it then there's jamming all wireless networks use radio frequency channels to transmit data on the network it is possible to create enough interference on the RF channel that it is no longer usable on the network an attacker will often use jamming when performing a denial of service type attack however it can also be used to perform an evil twin type attack by jamming the legitimate channel the attacker is hoping that users will switch to the channel That the Rogue access point is transmitting on many of the modern networking standards and devices employ techniques to mitigate the threat of jamming as in both 802.11n and 802.11 AC are difficult to jam standards then there is Banner grabbing many network devices display banners when users are signing into are requesting services from network devices these banners can impart information about the type of device or the type of service that is being requested this information may be used by a hacker to research possible exploits the best practice is to disable all unnecessary services and Banners on network devices that concludes this session on common network security issues I began by talking about security issues caused by misconfiguration and then I concluded with other networks security issues on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope I get to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on common W components and issues today I'm going to be talking about common wide area network components and then we're going to move on to Common Wan issu isues there's a fair amount of ground to cover not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about common Wan components first up our copper line drivers or repeaters these are used to allow Network traffic to go farther distances over copper wire type networks they take an incoming signal and regenerate it boosting the strength of that signal and then they send send it back out thus reducing attenuation common to all WS is the Demar Demar stands for the demarcation point this is the physical point where the telecommunication company's responsibility ends and the customers Begins the tel code takes care of the Upstream end of the network and the customer takes care of the downstream end of the network the dmark may be simple or it may be very complex depending upon the size of the organization and the required Services then there is the network interface unit or the NIU in the Soho environment the NIU is usually the DeMark also in the Soho environment the NIU is usually provided by the internet service provider or ISP and NIU can be a cable modem a DSL modem or another piece of Hardware that connects the customer to the ISP one type of NIU is the smartjack it's an NIU that can provide feedback on conditions to the ISP smart jacks help the ISP determine if a problem exists on its end of the dmark through the use of remote loop back capabilities Min smart Jacks can also provide translation between protocols as in translating a Serial PPP communic ation stream into ethernet more than likely on larger networks you will find CSU dsus that's Channel Service Unit digital service units this is the interface point that provides the connection between a pointtopoint line and the device that is directing Network traffic which is usually a router the CSU DSU may be an external device or it may be a removable module inside of a router only two c CSU dsus may exist on a single point topoint line one at either end of the connection with the common components covered let's move on to common wide area network issues first up is a loss of internet connectivity many factors can lead to a loss of connectivity on both sides of the DeMark before contacting the WAN provider check the local area network equipment for it operation if the issue is not to be found on the land side then contact the wide area network provider one of the tests that the WAN provider will conduct is a loop back test to check its line for interference DNS issues are also common in a Wan environment they may look like a loss of internet connectivity but it isn't the users May complain that they cannot connect to an outside Source like ww ww.google.com but it may not actually be a connectivity issue but a DNS issue if using a local DNS server verify the settings and make Corrections accordingly if the network is using the WAN providers DNS settings attempt to Ping the IP address if that works there is a Wan connection and if you then use the Ping utility with the fully qualified domain name and this fails then contact the Lan provider to resolve their DNS issue interface issues are also common errors on a router's w interface can indicate several different issues monitoring an interfaces status in reading the error reports May provide a clue as to the issue the most common issue that prevents a good connection is a speed or duplex mismatch a speed mismatch between interfaces will prevent a link from being established a duplex mismatch between the interfaces will create errors as in output and input errors if you're experiencing discards and drop packets there's a couple of things to consider if the device is discarding incoming packets then more than likely the device's CPU is being over utilized it may be time to upgrade if the device is dropping outgoing packets then there is a bandwidth congestion issue which may be caused by interference on the line so either you may be trying to move too much Network traffic or there may be an issue on the wide area network providers side of the line router configurations are a common problem when establishing a new W connection a misconfiguration of the WAN interface of a router will lead to guess what a w connection issue if this is suspected verify the proper configuration settings with the WAN provider unfortunately company policy and practices sometimes get reported as a wide area network issue some applications may be throttled or have their available bandwidth reduced for quality of service reasons leading to slow service which is a perceived wide area network issue also acceptable use policies May restrict or block access to certain sites or types of sites which may appear to the end user as a when issue there's not much that you as the technician can do to resolve this but it is up to you to explain it to the end user a satellite wide area network connection may also become an issue if a satellite Wan connection is used latency will increase due to the distance distances covered by the Transmissions latency is the measure of time between the sending of data and the receiving of the data careful application of quality of service techniques May mitigate the effects of latency on some applications but you're still going to have more latency with a satellite connection than other types of connections split Horizon is another issue split Horizon is a technique used in routing to help prevent routing loops with split Horizon a router will not advertise a route to another Network out of the interface that it learned the route on with a point to multipoint wide area network connection the router may have difficulty with split Horizon it will learn all of the routes available to it on the same interface but it can't advertise those routes back out of that interface creating logical iCal sub interfaces on the wide area network interface will usually resolve this problem The Logical sub interfaces appear to the router as individual interfaces allowing the router to advertise the routes back out of the WAN interface that concludes this session on common Wan components and issues I talked about common W components and then I concluded with some common wide area networ NW work issues on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I am Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the OSI networking reference model today I'm going to begin by talking about a brief history of the reference models and then I'm going to talk about the network reference models themselves and then I'm going to conclude with a comparison between OSI and TCP IP there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session so let's begin with a brief history the open system interconnection reference model is a conceptual model with two major components the first main component of the OS I networking reference model is an abstract model of networking it's a seven layer model the second major component is a set of specific protocols which allow differing Computing systems to communicate with one another despite their different architecture so why was a networking model required well early networks communicated using proprietory languages because of those proprietory Lang languages early networks could only communicate with like systems so an IBM Network could only communicate with another IBM Network in addition to that the US government desired a robust computer communication system that could survive disaster the first networking reference model that was developed was the TCP IP reference model the transmission control protocol Internet Protocol reference model was published as the United States Department of Defense standard in 1982 all of the major systems manufacturers adopted the TCP IP reference model beginning in 1984 AT&T moved the Unix implementation of tcpip to open source in 1989 further cementing TCP IP's place in networking the OSI reference model came later than the TCP IP reference model The OSI model was published in 1983 and it defines the relationships between differing protocols and Hardware it's time to move on to a discussion about the networking reference models in more detail we're going to begin with the OSI reference model it is a seven layer reference model layer one is also called the physical layer it standardizes the electrical signals that networks use it also defines cable standards and how the bits of data are placed on the physical media network cables and hubs are part of layer one of the OSI model then there's Layer Two which is also called the data link layer it's responsible for identifying the individual nodes both the sending node and and the receiving node it also introduces an error correction method known as the frame check sequence or FCS Layer Two is composed of two Su layers the first of those is The Logical link control layer it is mainly responsible for flow control and error correction then there is the media Access Control layer it is mainly responsible for node addressing switches and bridges are layer 2 devices then there's layer three the network layer it's responsible for routing functions between networks it also identifies networks and nodes on the network routers are layer three devices then there's layer four the transport layer it's responsible for breaking the data into smaller pieces for the lower layers and for the actual data transport protocol calls two of which are TCP and UDP the transport layer may be required to confirm the actual delivery of the data stream and it may be required to offer error correction and it does this through the use of TCP or transmission control protocol then there's layer five the session layer this is the layer that is responsible for establishing the initial parameters between two systems it sets up up and tears down the communication Channel layer six or the presentation layer is responsible for taking data and converting it from a machine dependent language to a machine independent language this is also the layer that has the main responsibility for encryption between networks and finally we have layer s the application layer this is the layer that is responsible for the protocol OLS that request services or functions from other systems these protocols may not be the actual application for instance Internet Explorer is an application that uses HTTP at layer 7 to request web pages now let's talk about the TCP IP reference model this is a four layer reference model the lowest layer is the network interface face layer which can also be known as the link layer it handles electrical signaling flow control error detection and node addressing then there's the internet layer this layer handles routing functions and identifies Network systems and nodes on those networks then there is the transport layer which handles breaking the data into more manageable pieces for the lower layers it is also the layer that is is responsible for the delivery method which can be either reliable or unreliable and error correction for when reliable delivery is used and finally there is the application layer this layer handles requests for services from applications it also handles translation to machine independent languages and encryption it also sets up and tears down communication sessions between system so now let's do a comparison between the OSI and TCP IP reference models while tcpip is the dominant model most technicians communicate issues using the OSI model because it is more specific when a problem occurs and believe me they will it is easier to resolve them with the more highly defined set of specifications of the OSI model versus the specifications of the TCP IP model it's easier to revolve an issue at the session layer of the OSI model than it is to track down what went wrong in the application layer of the TCP IP model both the OSI and TCP IP models are reference models only it is not mandatory that they be followed each developer and manufacturer determines if its own method of implementing the reference models while in theory there will never be a problem in communicating between devices and systems remember it is only a theory now that concludes this session on the OSI networking reference model I began with a brief history then I moved on to the networking reference models themselves and then I did a very brief OSI and TCP IP comparison on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on the transport layer plus icmp today I'm going to discuss TCP and UDP and then I'm going to conclude with a brief discussion on I CM there's a fair amount of ground to cover but not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about TCP and UDP before I can talk about TCP and UDP we need to talk about the transport layer most networking models follow the open Systems interconnection reference model or the OSI model it is composed of seven different layers which include the application presentation session transport network data link and physical layers the layers work together to create a system of communication that allows for different types of computing systems or networks to communicate with each other layer four also known as the transport layer receives data from the session layer which is layer five and determines what method or type of delivery is required for the data the transport layer then hands that data with the instructions for the method of delivery to layer three which is also known as the network layer which is then responsible for determining where the data is actually going there are two main transport layer protocols they are TCP and UDP TCP or the transmission control control protocol is a protocol that determines the type of delivery method that will be used in network communications TCP uses a reliable method to deliver Network packets TCP helps to set up the connection session it helps to establish error control during the communication session and it helps to tear down the communication session when it's done now TCP does use a reliable delivery method one of the main ways that it does this is through the use of a threeway handshake the first step of this handshake is the request for the connection the second step is the reception of the response from the other end the third part of the threeway handshake is when the requestor sends an acknowledgement back that sets the sequence numbers that will be used with every packet that is delivered every packet that gets sent must must be acknowledged by the receiver if the sender doesn't receive the acknowledgement of a packet the sender will then resend that packet all packets are sent and received in order they're never out of order are they should never be out of order so now let's talk about UDP or user datagram protocol it's a protocol that determines the type of delivery method that will be used in network communication just like TCP unlike TCP UDP uses an unreliable method to deliver Network packets it does not help to set up the connection session it does not establish error control and it does not help to tear down the communication session it uses an unreliable delivery method this could better be described as a best effort delivery method it sends the data dat stream to the destination trusting that the destination is a listening for the data stream and B willing to accept that data stream the data stream flows with no acknowledgment of it being received that's how UDP works not all communication can be treated the same that is why there are both reliable and unreliable delivery methods with TCP the sender can be a assured that the other end of the line has received all of the packets that were sent and that the packets were received in the proper order this works well for communication that is not sensitive to latency issues that are associated with the overhead of reliable deliveries UDP strips off the overhead but sacrifices reliability it is well suited for network communication in which speed is more important than reliability when using voice over IP it is more important for the flow of packets to be continuous than for communication to be held up while waiting for packets to arrive in the right order Voiceover IP communication can survive the occasional drop packet but it gets very miserable when it has to wait for those packets to arrive now let's move on to ICM the internet control message protocol works at layer three which is also known as the network layer of the OSI reference model and it is used by IP or the Internet Protocol to perform several Services as a messaging service for IP icmp packets are carried as encapsulated IP datagrams it provides information about network issues the Ping utility uses icmp test for endtoend connectivity between two devices using icmp Echo request packets the trace route utility uses a combination of icmp echo requests and destination unreachable packets to map the actual route between two endpoints also if a router's memory buffers are full it will continue to send out icmp buffer full messages until the congestion has been reduced this allows the other routers to slow down their Transmissions to avoid packet loss that concludes this session on the transport layer plus icmp I began with a brief discussion on TCP and UDP and I concluded with another brief discussion on icmp on behalf of pit thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on basic Network Concepts part one today we're going to be talking about encapsulation and modulation there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session we're going to begin by talking about encapsulation the open Systems interconnection reference model or the OSI model uses a layered approach to enable disparate devices to be able to communicate effectively during the communication between two devices or nodes each layer is only responsible for being understood by the corresponding layer on the other device as data flows down from the application layer through to the physical layer it is encapsulated at each layer with information to help the corresponding layer at the other end of the communication line understand what is happening as the data is received at the other end it is De encapsulated or unwrapped as it moves up the OSI stack by the corresponding layer let's talk about how encapsulation works the application layer begins the process by sending data that is encapsulated or wrapped with application layer control information to the presentation layer the encapsulated data is called a pdu or protocol data unit the application layer pdus are segmented by the presentation layer with each segment being encapsulated by presentation layer control information they are now presentation layer pdus the process of segmenting and encapsulating continues down through the OSI stack until it is transmitted as bits by the physical layer the receiving physical layer passes the bits to the receiving data link layer which reads the data link layer pdu information and then de encapsulates and Des segments it sending the new packets to the network layer as Network layer pdus the process of De encapsulating in D segmenting continues up the OSI stack until it is received by the application layer where it is finally fully de encapsulated and fully reassembled this encapsulation and de encapsulation allows differing systems to be able to communicate together effectively with that covered let's move on to modulation the physical layer of the OSI stack is responsible for transmitting bits of data across some form of media so it literally is responsible for transmitting zeros and ones across the media like a cable the question arises how does the physical layer transmit the data across the media the bits of data are modulated or encoded by the physical layer and placed on the carrier signal of the media which carries the modulated data onto its next destination the carrier signal can also be referred to as the carrier Channel Once the bits are received they are demodulated or unencoded by the receiving physical layer a carrier signal is a standard wave form usually in the form of a sine wave that is used as the base carrier of another input signal a sine wave is a mathematical curve that is represented by a smooth repeating oscillation now let's Define modulation modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a carrier signal with an input signal usually for the purposes of conveying information modulation can be used to encode digital Network traffic onto media that uses a digital carrier signal as in using an ISDN connection between two networks modulation can also be used to encode a digital signal onto a media that uses an analog carrier signal as in digital Network traffic traveling over the public switched telephone Network or pstn multiplexing is often ten used with modulation multiplexing can be used to increase the number of modulated signals that can be placed onto a carrier signal so let's talk about multiplexing and I don't mean your local movie theater the type of carrier signal will determine if multiplexing can occur a baseband carrier signal cannot have multiplexing occur as the modulated signal will consume all of the available frequency or Channel weight with multiplexing can be utilized on a Broadband carrier Channel as each modulated input is assigned a portion of the Channel width of the carrier channel multiplexing can use one of two methods to weave streams of modulated signal into the carrier signal there's frequency division multiplexing this is the process of mathematically dividing the carrier channel frequency into multiple segments and assigning the results to modulated input signals then there is time division multiplexing this is the process of mathematically dividing the carrier Channel width into multiple time segments and assigning the time slots to different modulated signal input streams it's time to talk about the difference between a baseband and Broadband carrier Channel and we're going to begin with baseband a simple definition of baseband is a stream of data that is sent over a carrier Channel as is a digital modulated signal the digital signal will take all of the carrier signals available frequency or time while the modulated input does take all of the carrier channels available frequency the communication is bidirectional it can flow back and forth a simple definition of a Broadband carrier channel is a stream of data that is sent over a carrier Channel as an analog modulated signal the analog signal will be assigned a portion of either the carrier channels available frequency or time while the modulated input doesn't take all of the carrier channels available frequency the communication is not bidirectional for twoway communication to take place Multiplex channels must be created that is a channel for each Direction now that concludes this session on basic Network Concepts part one I began with with encapsulation and I concluded with modulation on behalf of pit thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on basic Network Concepts part two today we're going to be talking about Network transmission Concepts and then we're going to conclude with CSM CD and CS ma CA there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with the network transmission Concepts the first concept is wavelength wavelength is a measurement of the distance between peaks in a wave pattern emitted by electromagnetic radiation as in in light waves radio waves or microwaves each type of electromagnetic radiation falls into a specific range of wavelengths by modifying a wavelength data can be encoded into the wavelength and transmitted to a receiving device which then decodes the transmission then there's B rate and bit rate the B rate was originally used to measure the speed of a telegraph transmission it is a measure of the number of State changes in a given period of time the usual state change that was measured was electricity as in the number of times the state changed from .5 volts to 1.5 volts the bit rate is a measure of the number of zeros and ones that can be transmitted across the medium in a given period of time so it is a measure of the actual bits that can be transmitted it is usually measured in bits per second or BPS the bit rate is a more accurate measure of transmission throughput than the B rate then there's sampling size when converting from an analog audio signal to a digital signal a computer or other device captures the analog audio waveform and mathematically converts the captured sample into different wavelengths which is how we get the discrete sounds this occurs over a specific period of time which is called the size of the sample or the sampling size and finally there's carrier detect and carrier sense carrier detect is when a device can only tell when a carrier signal or channel is present by the reception of a control signal the presence of the control signal signifies that Transmissions can occur the control signal controls the order of Transmissions so data collisions are not possible the control signal can also be used to establish the maximum speed of the transmission that can be used carrier sense is when a device uses feedback from a receiver to determine if a carrier channel is present if a carrier signal is detected the device can send Transmissions data transmission collisions are possible with carrier sense and that logically leads us into csmac CD and csmac CA the carrier detect method of network transmission works well when there are just a few nodes that need to be connected together however as the number of nodes that need to transmit increase the efficiency of carrier detect begins to decrease to the point where it can become unmanageable although the carrier sense method of network transmission is not as efficient when the scale of the network is small as the number of nodes increases it becomes more efficient than the carrier detect method so let's talk about csmac CD or Carrier sense multiple access with Collision detection csmac CD of course uses the carrier sense method of network transmission every device on the network uses feedback from a receiver to determine if a carrier channel is present every device connected to the network has an equal opportunity to place a transmission on the carrier Channel That's the multiple access part of the name before placing a transmission on the carrier Channel a device will listen to the channel to determine if another node is transmitting if it detects a signal on the carrier channel the node will wait before attempting to transmit if no signal is detected the node is free to send if two devices send a transmission at the same time a collision between the Transmissions is possible sending devices will listen for transmission collisions if a collision is detected a jamming signal is sent informing all nodes that a collision has taken place all devices that receive the jamming signal will wait for a random amount of time before attempting to transmit now let's talk about CSM CA or Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance CS maaca operates in the same manner as csmac CD with one exception it uses a collision avoidance scheme through the use of a controlling device before attempting to send data a device will place a specific signal on the network called a request to send packet or RTS packet if no other device is utilizing the network the controlling device will respond with another specific signal called a clear to send packet or CTS packet once the sending device receives the CTS it knows it can send a transmission without a collision occurring csmac CD is better suited for highspeed High throughput networks and is the specified Network transmission standard for the 802.3 ethernet networking standard as it has a low amount of network overhead CSA is better suited for lower speed lower throughput types of networks where the possibility of data Collision is higher it is the specified standard for 802.3 wireless networks or WiFi networks now that concludes this session on basic Network Concepts part two I began with network transmission Concepts and I concluded with a brief discussion on csmac CD and Cs maaca on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to paace it session on basic Network Concepts part three today we're going to be talking about numbering systems and we will conclude with a very brief discussion on conversion tables with that let's go ahead and begin today's session of course I'm going to begin by talking about numbering systems while computer code and communication can get very complex it can also be broken down to a basic bit level a bit has one of two values it either has a value of zero or it has a value of one these values can be thought of as being either off which is a zero or on a one these bit values are actually the only information that Computing devices know by combining and adding different bits together computers can communicate with each other and programs can be created because of this technicians need to know how to work with binary or the base 2 numbering system binary is a base 2 numbering system where each position has one of two basic values it is either a zero or a one it is written from right to left with the potential value of digits being doubled with each additional digit that's added if a zero is the placeholder it has a null value or no absolute value and if a one is present the actual value is double the potential value of of the digit to the right to derive the final value of a binary number add all of the potential values together and that will give you the decimal value of the binary number the binary numbering system is very important when dealing with computers and networking you should become comfortable with converting from decimal or base 10 values to Binary and from binary back to the decimal format if you need help with that there are multiple websites that can help one website that I recommend is mathisfun.com you can look on their website for their binary numbering lessons now let's talk about bit bite and nibble a bit is a single zero or one a bite is8 bits and it can also be referred to as an octet a nibble is half of a bite or four bits and these terms are used quite frequently when dealing with binary now let's talk about heximal heximal is a base 16 numbering system that uses the numbers 0 through 9 and then it uses the letters a through F to represent the values 10 through 15 it functions in the same manner as binary but with base 16 each hexadecimal digit has a potential binary value of 1 1 1 1 or 15 and it can be referred to as a nibble as it's half of a bite a heximal number can often be recognized by the notation prefix of zero lowercase x which directly precedes the heximal number heximal is widely used in programming and networking along with binary some examples of binary and heximal use include ipv4 addresses which can be represented by a 32bit binary number that is divided into four 8bit sets each 8bit set is equal to one BTE and is often called an octad an IPv6 address which is a 128bit binary number is usually represented by hexadecimal and it is divided into eight two byte sets each set being separated by colons and I recommend that you watch my presentations on ipv4 and IPv6 to get a better understanding of how binary and hexadecimal are used in networking and now let's move on to conversion tables when working with binary and hexadecimal numbers I recommend creating a conversion table before doing the math I find it to be very useful when I need to convert from decimal to Binary or from heximal to binary to decimal now that concludes this session on basic Network Concepts part three I began by talking about numbering systems and I concluded with a very brief discussion on conversion tables on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon hello I'm Brian Ferell and welcome to Pace it session on the introduction to wireless standards today I'm going to talk about CS MAA and then I'm going to conclude with a discussion on wireless standards there's a fair amount of ground to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about CSM CA all Wireless ethernet standards employ an algorithm called carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance that's csma CA a csma CA Network involves a method of transmission that avoids packet collisions once a wants to send a packet it listens to the carrier wave if no other node is transmitting it will then transmit if another node is transmitting it will wait a random amount of time and then listen to the carrier wave again to see if it's free to send this differs from a csmac CD which stands for Collision detection type of network which is all about how to transmit after a collision has occurred now let's talk about frequency modulation frequency modulation is the process used to encode data into a carrier wave 802.11 uses two main frequency modulation methods the first one is orthogonal frequency division multiplexing or ofdm ofdm is a frequency division multiplexing scheme that uses multiple subcarrier channels to carry data it is used to mitigate against attenuation which is loss of signal strength over distance and multipath issues that exist in networking the other frequency modulation method is direct sequence spread Spectrum or dsss dsss is a modulation technique that uses spread Spectrum technology to affect data transfer it is used to mitigate the problem of multiple users on a channel and for Effective timing between the transmitter and the receiver now let's move on to the wireless standards Wireless networking standards are established by the 802.11 committee of The Institute of electrical and electronics Engineers or the i e quite often the term WiFi is used to describe an 802.11 Network which is technically incorrect WiFi is actually a reference to the wifi Alliance which is responsible for certifying that wireless networking equipment actually meets the 802.11 standards WiFi has become synonymous with the wireless local area network in the English language so don't be surprised if you find yourself using the term Wii when you really mean 802.11 now let's talk about the standards and first up is 802.11a it has a maximum speed of 54 megabits per second and it operates on the 5 GHz frequency band it uses ofdm as its form of modulation and has a maximum distance of 150 ft 80211 a is compatible with 802.11 AC then there's 802.11b it has has a maximum speed of 11 megabits per second and it operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency band 11b uses dsss as its technique for modulation it has a maximum distance of 300 ft and it is compatible with 802.11g and 802.11n now let's move on to 802.11g it has a maximum speed of 5 4 megabits per second and it also operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency band 11g can use ofdm and dsss for its modulation techniques it has a maximum distance of 300 ft 802.11g is compatible with 802.11b and 802.11n now talking about 802.11n it has a max maximum speed of up to 600 megabits per second and it can operate on both the 2.4 and the 5 GHz frequency band it does use ofdm as its form of modulation it offers a maximum distance of 300 ft 802.11n is compatible with 11b 11g and 11 a with the introduction of 802.11n We Now find Mimo multiple input multiple output it's a technology that allows for the increase in speed for the wireless network with 11 in there can be up to four antennas which allow for up to four separate spatial streams and finally we have 802.11 AC now 802.11 AC offers speed anywhere from up to 433 megabits per second up to multiples of gigabits per second and it operates on the 5 GHz frequency band it uses ofdm as its method of modulation but its implementation is an advanced form of ofdm 11 AC offers a theoretical maximum distance of 300 ft 11ac can be compatible with 11a G or n when 802.11 AC was introduced the improved the mimo technology which now allows for up to eight antennas which means that there can be up to eight separate spatial streams of data now that concludes this session on the introduction to wireless standards I began this discussion by talking about CSM CA and then I concluded with a brief discussion on the wireless standards on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on introduction to wired Network standards today I'm going to be discussing the Tia eia 568a and tia eia 568b standards then I'm going to move on to ethernet standards and I'm going to conclude with some other standards I have a whole lot of information to cover but not not a whole lot of time so let's dive into today's session of course I'm going to begin with the Tia eia 568a and 568b wired standards the Tia eia 568a and 568b standards deal with twisted pair wires these are the two cable pinout standards that are regulated by the Tia eia that the Telecommunications industry Association electronic Industries Alliance the pinout standard specify The Ordering of the wires to ensure that proper networking communication can take place the t568a standard is white green green white orange blue white blue orange white brown brown on the other hand the t568b standard is white orange orange white green blue white blue green white brown brown all modern ethernet networks that utilize unshielded twisted pair UTP or shielded twisted pair STP should use the Tia eia standards as a quick refresher for twisted pair wiring here are some common tools that you will need there are wire strippers these are used to remove the insulating jacket from the cable then there are crimping tools these are used to sec secure the wires into modular connectors then there are punchdown tools these are used to secure wires into punchdown blocks and finally there are cable testers these are used to test the Integrity of the network cables that you've just created with that covered let's move on to ethernet standards first up our distance limitations twisted pair copper wire is limited to 100 m without a repeater unless otherwise stated coaxial land cabling is limited to either 185 or 500 M depending upon the coaxial cable that is used as an example a 10base 2 coaxial Network uses RG58 and is limited to 185 m in length on the other hand a 10 base5 coaxial network using rg8 is limited to 500 m with fiber optics land transmission is limited by the cable type that is used the current maximum is over 40 km over a single mode optical fiber or SMF fiber now let's talk about twisted pair cable standards there's 10base T that's 10 megabits per second using UTP over a minimum of c 3 cable then there's 100 Bas T that's 100 megabits per per second using a minimum of cap 5 you can also have 100 Base TX this is 100 megabits per second networking using two pair over a minimum of cap 5 then there's 1,00 Base TX this is 1 gbits per second networking using two pair over a minimum of cap 5e cable then there's 10 gbas T that is 10 gbits per second networking using a minimum of cat 6 but it's only good for 40 m finally there's also 10 gbas T that's 10 gigabits per second networking using a minimum of cat 6A cabling but that's good for up to 100 m now let's move on to the multiable standard and that's 1,000 base X under this standard there's 1,000 base SX which is 1 gbit per second networking over a short distance multimode fiber and it's usually less than 2 km then there's 1,000 base elx this is 1 gbits per second networking over long distance single mode fiber and it's usually a greater span than 2 km and finally there's 1,000 CX this is 1 gbits per second networking over a coaxial cable that can be up to 25 M long now let's talk about 10 GB networking first up there's 10 gbas Sr over multimode fiber and it's good for up to 300 M then there's 10 gbas LR over single mode fiber which is good for up to 10 km then we have 10 gbas er which is over single mode fiber and it's good for up to 40 km then we have 10 gbas s SW this runs over MMF and it's good for up to 300 M and it's used on a wide area network then there's 10gb LW which runs over SMF up to 10 km and it's also used in a wide area network and then there's 10 gbas ew which runs over single mode fiber for up to 40 km and again on that Sonet type WAN network then there's 10 gbas lx4 which runs over single mode fiber and it's good for up to 300 M then there is 10gbase lx4 over multim mode which is over multimode fiber which is good for up to 10 kilm and finally there is 10 gbas CX4 this runs over infinity band copper cabling and it's good for up to 15 M it's time to conclude with some other standards first up is Doc ACC are data over cable services interface specification these are the standards that have been established to provide the interface requirements for data Transmissions over a Broadband cable network to achieve the best performance when using Broadband cable the cable modem should meet the highest docis standard used by the cable provider the most current docus standard is 3.1 which allows for up to a theoretical maximum download speed of 10 gbits per second with a theoretical upload speed of 1 gigabits per second then there's the I E1 1905.1 d23 standard this is a standard that defines a network enabler or device that is used to create a convergent home networking environment that includes different types of wired and wireless networks the standard also includes ethernet over power line which is using the existing electrical wiring in a structure as the media to transport data the standard also includes ethernet over HDMI which is using an HDMI interface and cable to transport Network traffic now that concludes this session on the introduction to wired Network standards I began by talking about the Tia eiia 568a and 568b standards then I moved on to the ethernet standards and I concluded with a brief discussion on some other standards on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on security policies and other documents today I'm going to be discussing some security policies and then I will conclude with a brief discussion on other documents there's a fair amount of ground to cover but not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by discussing security policy policies policies are a set of guidelines established by management that are used to set the expected behavior in the workplace procedures are different than policies in that a procedure is a set of steps required to be taken in a given situation policies and procedures work hand inand to create a safe and secure work environment in which employees know the guidelines and what is expected of them policies and procedures should be given to every person on the day they start and periodic training should be conducted to ensure that they remain fresh in everyone's mind one of the security policies to consider is the consent to monitoring this is a policy that establishes an employer's right to monitor the employees actions and Communications this can include monitoring emails if they Traverse company equipment in any way then the emails are not considered private but are actually company assets that they have a right to view and do with as they please these consent to monitoring policies also include the monitoring or recording of phone conversations also monitoring activities on computers hard drives and phones in a highly secure work environment it may also include include the video monitoring and recording of normal work activities another security policy is a clean desk policy this is a policy that is concerned about the handling of sensitive data sensitive data should not be left unattended in a workplace and should be put away when not in use not left on a desktop these policies also include the computer desktop sensitive data should not be left left easily accessible on the PC then there are recording policies this is a policy that restricts the use of cameras tape recorders portable storage devices or any other device that may be used to record or a copy sensitive workplace information then there are equipment access policies there are a security policy that establishes who has access to which equipment and when these could incl include access to server rooms wiring closets Network racks or any other area that is deemed to have a security risk there are security policies that deal with the handling of user or customer information they're used to establish how to secure sensitive employee and customer information User and customer information is a major Target of hackers when they breach Computing systems the loss of control of this data can severely damage a company any policy that is used to help secure the workplace or company data is by default a security policy Approximately 80% of all Network and data breaches occur from within the companies that are attempting to secure the data sometimes they occur by mistake however all too often they are intentional all policies should have an enforcement aspect to them that details what employees should expect to happen if they violate the policy the range of actions can be from retraining to termination and prosecution now let's conclude with a brief discussion on some other documents first up is the AUP or acceptable use policy these are a set of rules and guidelines established by the Creator owner or administrator of information systems that detail what users may or may not do with that information system it is considered to be part of the security policy the AUP should be fairly detailed in what is allowed or not allowed to occur all users should be required to sign the acceptable use policy and these records should should be kept on file then there are network policy documents there are a broad range of policies that establish the guidelines for the network they include policies that control the use and operation of the network as well as policies on how to implement changes to it many security policies fall under the general Network policies category there are some standard business documents that you should be familiar with the first one is the memorandum of understanding or mou it's an agreement between two or more organizations that detail how those organizations are to undertake a common course of action anou is often used before a legally binding agreement has been created sometimes the mou is called a letter of intent or Loi then there is the the statement of work or the S so it's a detailed document that specifies what work is to be performed the expected outcome of the work or the deliverables of the work and the timelines to perform that work the S so plays an important role in project management documentation then there is the master license agreement or the MLA it's a legal agreement between two entities in which one agrees to pay the other for the use of a specific piece of software or a software package for a specific period of time so the person using the software doesn't actually own the software the Creator or the vendor retains the legal rights to that software or that software package and finally there's the service level agreement or the SLA it's an agreement that details the allowable amount of response time the vendor has to resolve an issue or problem the SLA is most commonly associated with a service contract now that concludes this session on security policies and other documents I briefly talked about security policies and then I concluded with a discussion on some other documents on behalf of pait thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to Pace it session on introduction to safety practices part one today I'm going to be talking about electrical safety and then I'm going to move on to installation safety I have a fair amount of ground to cover but not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin in this session of course I'm going to begin with electrical safety electrical grounding is used to protect technicians and equipment in the case of electrical insulation failure electrical grounding provides an alternate path for the electricity this is often referred to as a return to Earth all electrical systems should be connected to properly grounded circuits this helps to protect both the technician and the equipment then there's ESD or electrostatic discharge ESD is caused when two electrically charged objects that have different amounts of electrical charge come into contact creating a sudden flow of energy between the objects as they normalize the levels this is a static discharge ESD can damage sensitive components particularly the CPU and or your Random Access memory using an ESD mat helps to reduce the chances of ESD using an ESD strap will further reduce the chances for ESD the strap goes around the wrist of the technician and then is clipped to a ground Source usually to an exposed metal surface inside of a piece of equipment's case you should always practice self grounding self grounding is a normalization technique used to equalize the amount of electrical charge between the worker and the equipment being worked on after the case has been opened and the ESD strap is attached to a ground Source touch an exposed metal surface inside the case before actually touching any of the components this will normalize electrical charge between you and the equipment that you're working on in some cases additional equipment grounding may be necessary in case of an electrical fire unplug the power source or turn off the circuit breaker always use a Class C or multiclass fire extinguisher on electrical fires never use water you run the risk of electrocution and damaging that equipment even more than the fire is already doing so let's talk about fire suppression systems building codes often call for the install a of fire suppression systems and there are several different types of common systems there's the wet pipe the overhead pipes are pressurized and contain water all of the time then there's the dry pipe the pipes are not pressurized the water is contained in a holding tank until a fire breaks out and then it is pumped to the area where it needs to be dispersed there are preaction types of fire suppression systems the they're similar to a dry pipe system but the sprinkler head contains a thermal fusible link that must melt before the water is released then there's the delug fire suppression system these are designed to release a large amount of water in a short amount of time into a predefined space the Deluge system is the least desirable option for electrical components on the other hand a Halon type system is the most desirable type of fire suppression system for electrical components Halon is a nonconducting volatile gaseous chemical it works by chemically disrupting the combustion process Halon does not leave a residue upon evaporation and unlike water Halon will not ruin electrical components it is safe for exposure to humans in limited amounts for a limited amount of time Halon is also environmentally safe it's also known as a clean agent now it's time to move on to installation Safety First up is using proper lifting techniques Bend at the knees not at the waist keep your head up when lifting avoid twisting when carrying items if the item is heavy or awkward request help in lifting it also remember most companies establish weight limitations so if you're going to lift something that is going to exceed that weight limitation ask for help more than likely you are going to need to install equipment racks at some point in time or another racks are used to help create a clean organized environment especially when they're used with proper cable management techniques racks are designed to provide sufficient airf flow for the electrical components that are placed in them when assembling and installing racks always follow the manufacturer's instructions always use the proper tools to prevent damaging the racks or the Fasteners that hold them together many servers and networking components come rack ready that means they're specifically designed to be placed into an equipment rack let's talk about rack placement when designing a room that is going to hold multiple racks of computing systems some thought needs to go into the placement of those racks HVAC and rack placement should be done concurrently heating ventilation and air conditioning systems should be designed to control both heat and humidity levels when multiple racks are going to be installed creating a hot Isle cold aisle design is recommended the hot aisle is the side of the aisle that receives the exhaust air flow from the Computing equipment this aisle should face an HVAC air intake the cold aisle is the side or aisle that the air intakes of the Computing equipment face this aisle should face an HVAC air vent also whenever possible a server room should be designed with a raised floor to help protect against water damage the raised floor like a drop ceiling can also be utilized as part of the cable management system system let's talk about tool safety always use the proper tool for the job that is what it was designed for do not use pencils as a probe it is possible for the pencil to conduct electricity leading to an ESD situation or shock hazard do not use magnetized tools when working on electrical components as the magnetic charge can be harmful to the magnetically kept data and that magnetically charged tool may damage sensitive components when using compressed air to blow out debris maintain a minimum distance of 4 in from the nozzle to the component always use isopropyl alcohol to clean products in place of rubbing alcohol rubbing alcohol contains a higher water content of approximately around 30% whereas the water content and isopropyl alcohol is lower never use a standard vacuum cleaner when vacuuming electrical components is necessary due to the design of the standard vacuum electrostatic discharges are a common occurrence there are specifically designed vacuum cleaners that can be used on electrical components now that concludes this session on the introduction to safety practices part one I talked about electrical safety and then I concluded with installation safety safety on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on the introduction to safety practices part two today I'm going to talk about the MSDS and then I'm going to conclude with some emergency preparations there's a fair amount of to cover so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with the MSDS part of any Safety First approach to a safe work environment includes knowing what hazards are present in the workplace material safety data sheets or msdss contain safety information on materials and chemicals found in the workplace an MSDS will contain all known health issues associated with a particular material it also outlines what protective measures must be taken to reduce risks from exposure and what actions must be taken if the chemical is ingested the MSDS will also detail the physical properties of the material as in its flash point or boiling point and the MSDS will outline the proper steps to take when disposing of it each workplace will have its own set of msdss as each workplace is different it is your responsibility to understand the hazards that are present so you need to know where the msdss are kept for your workplace it's time to move on to some emergency preparations part of any Safety First approach to a safe work environment includes preparing for various types of emergencies these preparations should be detailed in a set of emergency procedure documents the procedures should contain Escape Routes including where employees will meet to ensure that all are accounted for information on what type or types of fire suppression systems are present as well as what steps have been taken to increase the daytoday safety in the workplace there are some building layout consideration ations that concern emergency preparations all walls should have a minimum 2hour fire rating this is the amount of time it takes for the average fire to burn through the wall exterior doors and other secure doors must be designed to resist forcible entry but the doorways should also be designed to be able to handle the amount of expected traffic in an emergency fire suppression systems should be appropriate for the type of asset that they are protecting a wet pipe system is not appropriate for a server room or data center however a Halon system may not be the correct fire suppression system for an open cubical area backup power should also be incorporated into the building layout not all areas are going to require backup power but for some areas it is going to be essential emergency preparations need to include escape plans each area or room should have an Escape Plan map posted in a prominent area ideally by the main access doorway into that area this map needs to show the preferred route out of the facility the map should also include the meeting area outside of the danger zone this allows for supervisors or managers to account for all personnel safety or emergency exits should be clearly marked they should also be well lit with independent battery power sources they should be wide enough to handle the expected traffic and emergency exits should always be kept clear of obstructions talking about doors there are some other considerations are they going to be fail open or fail closed so what happens to doors with electronic locks when the power is out needs to be considered they could be fail closed type doors with this type of door when the power is cut the locks engage these are suitable for keeping secure areas secure in an emergency then there are fail open type electronic locks when the power is cut the locks disengage these are suitable for nonsecure areas or for areas where twoway traffic is going to occur in an emergency in many facilities fail close closed type fire doors are used usually they're kept open by electromagnetics once the fire alarm has been tripped the power is cut to the magnets and the doors swing Clos they usually do not lock when closed but are used to help slow the spread of fire or other dangers another emergency preparation that should be considered are emergency alert systems all facilities should have an emergency alert system installed it is usually required by local building codes these are your fire alarms and whatnot combinations of sound and Light have proven to be highly effective in some situations it may be advisable to connect the facility to the National emergency alert system now that concludes this session on introduction to safety practices part two I began with the MSDS and then I concluded with emergency preparations on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on rack and power management today I'm going to talk about rack management and then I'm going to conclude with a brief segment on power management with with that let's go ahead and begin today's session I'm going to begin by talking about rack management rack systems are specially designed racks used to hold networking and Computing equipment sometimes they are referred to as server racks these rack systems follow one of several different designs however they all follow the same height specification that specification is the standard unit and it's designated by the capital letter U now the standard unit involves the amount of vertical space that can be used to hold equipment a standard unit is equal to 1.75 in so a 15 U rack has 26 and 1/4 in of vertical storage space most rack servers and Enterprise level networking equipment are designed to fit within r rack systems there are several different types of racks racks are normally either two poost or four poost racks they may be freestanding or they may be floor mounted server rail racks have slide mounts to make it easy to pull out servers to perform necessary maintenance now let's talk about device placement devices that generate the most amount of heat or are not heat sensitive should be be placed towards the top of the rack devices that generate the least amount of heat or are heat sensitive should be placed toward the bottom of the rack all equipment cold air intakes should face the same direction all equipment exhaust Outlets should therefore also face the same direction when mounting equipment in racks vertical space should be left between the equipment to promote adequate air flow when when multiple rows of racks are implemented a hot Isle cold Isis approach should be used to promote proper air flow and cooling racks should be monitored for environmental factors to help ensure the health of the servers and other equipment monitor should be in place for temperature humidity vibration water leaks smoke and intrusion and that brings us to Rack security most rack systems do not come with rack Security in mind but it can be easily added after rack installation rack doors can be added that have either keyed or electronic locks if the equipment is not secured it can be easily stolen now let's have a brief discussion on power management so before I begin talking about power management let me give you a little bit of trivia we're all familiar with the power symbol that you see there to the right that's actually a binary symbol what that is is a zero with a one poking through it I knowe not very relevant to today's discussion but it's an interesting bit of trivia Now power is often overlooked when designing a network however without power management the network may never work properly most people assume that when they plug a piece of equipment into a wall socket that that piece of equipment is going to power up just fine in most cases they are correct however if the circuit cannot provide enough amps to the equipment damage may occur it is important to know the power requirements and loads for all of the equipment that will be in place this helps to ensure that the proper electrical circuits are installed so that sufficient power is delivered where it is needed when it is needed power converters convert electrical energy from one form to another as in from AC to DC or from one voltage level to another on the other hand power inverters are a type of power converter that specifically converts voltages from DC to AC then we have the uninterruptable power supply the UPS it uses power converters to rece receive electrical current from an AC electrical source and it passes that current to a battery or set of batteries for storage it then uses a power inverter to receive DC current from the batteries and pass it to another device as a conditioned and well regulated AC flow they're used to provide a steady stream of conditioned electrical power to components they help to protect sens of electrical components from Power anomalies either from Power spikes power outs or from Power sags in some cases you may want to consider installing power redundancies critical components should include redundant power supplies that means that if one power supply fails the other one takes over immediately without any loss of service now that concludes this session on rack and Power Man management I began by talking briefly about rack management and then I concluded with a brief discussion on power management on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon good day I'm Brian F and welcome to pait's session on cable management today I'm going to be talking about cable distribution and then I will conclude with some cable management components we have a fair amount of ground to cover with not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about cable distribution and the first item under cable distribution is the main distribution frame or MDF this is the location where the dmark DeMark extension Main switch or router in patch panel are placed the MDF is where outside traffic ERS a location and is then distributed to the internal Network it is possible to also have an intermediate distribution frame or IDF it's a location solution for when a single MDF is not sufficient they usually occur in multistory buildings the idfs are connected to the MDF by vertical crossconnect cables or VCC cables it is common for an MDF to contain separate IDF panels for each floor of a building a vertical cross connect is the main patch panel for a location it usually resides in the same location or very close to the Demar and Main switch or router I mentioned patch panels earlier so let's talk about those they're used to terminate network cable runs usually within a building as in from the wall jacks to a central location the network runs are called horizontal cabling patch panels are used to organize and administer the physical aspects of the network cables network runs are punched down to the back of the patch panel which normally contains either a 66 or 110 block with an Associated port on the front of the patch panel patch cables are used to connect the patch panel ports to networking gear quite often a switch workstations connect to the patch panel using horizontal cabling this location is called the horizontal cross connect or HCC and is usually located in the IDF switches may or may not be present in this location if a workstation needs to be relocated to a different switch or Port all that needs to be done is to make the change in the location of the patch panel so you unplug the cable from one port and you plug it into a new port with that covered let's talk about Cable Management components labeling is an important part of cable management it can cause stress when working with networks but it doesn't have to the key to proper labeling is to create a naming convention which is a systematic and consistent method that makes sense for the situation proper labeling will ease the management of the physical aspects of the network especially when dealing with cables labels should be placed on everything that deals with the network beginning from the wall jacks all the way through to the patch panel switches and routers the naming convention should be documented and kept with the network diagrams let me give you an example of a naming convention suppose office 219 has Network outlets on all four walls the Jacks could be labeled 219 n 219 W Etc and that would be for 219 North or 219 West Etc the horizontal cabling from 219 feeds into a patch panel in an IDF located on the second floor that contains two 48 Port switches that tie in all the horizontal cross connects the cable coming in from Office 219 to the patch panel could be labeled 219 W or 219s etc etc as it relates to their location in the office the switches could be labeled s SW 2A and S SW 2B now suppose that the patch cables for office 219 connect to switch 2bs ports 20 through 24 the patch cables could be labeled 219 n s sw2 B21 or 219 e s sw2 b22 etc etc the key is to be consistent and to document everything and finally there are cable trays masses of cables can block air flow and act as an insulator that allows for excessive heat to build up cable trays are used to organize cabling and to keep it away from areas where cabling may cause heat to build up cable trays keep bundles of cables neat and fairly well organized that concludes this session on cable management I talked about cable distribution and then I briefly covered some cable management components on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pacit session on the basics of change management today we're going to be talking about the reasons for change management and then we're going to conclude with some different change management processes I have a fair amount of ground to cover but not a whole lot of time so let's go ahead and begin this session of course I'm going to begin with the reason for change management in a fairly simple Network it is fairly easy to evaluate not only the necessity for a change but also the possible impacts of that change however as the network system increases in size and complexity it becomes more difficult to not only determine what changes are necessary but also the possible impacts that the proposed changes will have on the system as a whole it is quite possible even highly probable that a single change will have a ripple effect on the whole system change management processes are used to introduce changes to a system in a controlled manner to minimize possible disruption and potential pandemonium with the reason for change management covered let's move on to different change management processes first up is document the reason for a change proposed changes should have a solid reason for occurring a best practice is to include why the change is needed for it reasons and also for business reasons as the change proceeds through the process more documentation may be added to the reason for a change so let's talk about the change request a formal change request procedure is used during the approval process and should include several other subdocuments that can be used to gain approval one of those documents is the configuration procedures documents these document the exact steps required to implement the change including affected devices applications and processes the change request should also include a roll back process as all change carries risk a plan to reverse changes is required in order to gain approval then there are potential impact documents the potential impact documents are a good faith effort to identify all possible impacts to the overall system both the positive and the negative then there is the notification procedures after the potential impacts have been identified the people responsible for the affected systems must receive notification of the proposed change keeping your stakeholders informed and involved will greatly increase the chances of a successful change let's talk about approval processes proposed changes should be vetted and approved not only by management but also by senior IT personnel Security Experts and by a selection of those affected by the change some companies create Change Control boards to not only evaluate proposed changes but to also Implement a means of approving changes these boards also assure that all approved changes have been fully tested and documented the change boards meet periodically to assess the status of an approved change this helps to keep it on track for implementation change boards maintain responsibility for the change and verify that the process is proceeding according to the configuration procedure and finally change boards help to ensure that approved changes are are implemented correctly when planning out a change to an IT system it's important to involve a maintenance window procedure a maintenance window is the amount of time that a system will be down or unavailable during the proposed change before the final schedule is developed an evaluation of all affected systems must be performed with particular attention paid to Mission critical systems it is possible that the proposed maintenance window May exceed the allowable downtime for critical systems which will affect when the maintenance window can be scheduled a subprocedure to the maintenance window procedure is authorized downtime once a maintenance window has been identified it is then possible to determine the optimum time to implement the change in many cases system changes need to occur during off hours as in after the close of business or during weekends when systems are not not utilized as much then there's the notification of change procedure after a sufficient time has elapsed in which to evaluate any issues all stakeholders those are the people who approved the change and all others affected by the change should be notified of the successful completion of the change this allows the stakeholders to further monitor the systems for any unforeseen or residual issues relating to the change and finally there's final documentation the change process should end with an update to the appropriate documentation including Network configurations additions to the network and physical location changes a closing Change Report should also be created that summarizes the change to help refine the change procedures and processes even further this closing report should include what went right and what went wrong during the the approved change that concludes this session on the basics of change management I talked about the reasons for change management and then I concluded with different change management processes on behalf of pait thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon good day I'm Brian frell and welcome to pait's session on common networking protocols part one today I'm going to briefly discuss TCP and UDP and then I'm going to briefly run through some common ports and protocols with that let's go ahead and begin this session let's begin with a brief overview of TCP and UDP both transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol are both transport layer or layer 4 protocols the they're both responsible for the delivery of network data between nodes while they are both layer 4 protocols they do have some differences TCP uses a reliable delivery method this ensures that all the packets that are sent are received it uses acknowledgements as a means of error correction TCP also establishes flow control to reduce the error rate and ensure proper delivery on the other hand UDP uses a best effort delivery method it sends data but doesn't care if the packets are all received there is no error correction and with UDP speed and low Network overhead are the major concerns not the reliable delivery of the information now let's discuss some common ports and protocols first up is HTTP that's hypertext trans transfer protocol it's the primary protocol used to transfer data over the Internet it is assigned to Port 80 then there's https which is hyper text transfer protocol secure it is the primary protocol to securely transfer data over the internet using SSL or TLS technology that's secure socket layer or transport layer security technology in actuality as SSL should no longer be used you should only be using TLS by default https is assigned to Port 443 then there's net bios that's Network basic input output system this was originally developed to allow hosts to be able to communicate with servers by default it's assigned to Ports 137 through 139 then we have SMTP or simp simple mail transfer protocol this is the protocol that's used to transfer email from a client to an email server or to transfer email between different email servers by default it's assigned to Port 25 post office protocol version 3 or pop 3 is the protocol used by clients to retrieve email from servers once engaged POP 3 downloads all the messages from the servers the user cannot access email messages until they have been downloaded by the pop 3 protocol POP 3 is assigned to Port 1110 in contrast to pop 3 is IMAP that's internet message access protocol it's a protocol used by clients to access email on email servers allows the client to administer and organize email on the server into folders without having to download it first by default IMAP is assigned to Port 143 next up is sip or session initiation protocol it's a protocol that is most commonly used to set up and tear down multimedia communication sessions as in voice over IP in a voice over IP session sip is used to establish and determinate the session session initiation protocol is commonly assigned to either port 560 or to Port 561 often used in conjunction with session initiation protocol is RTP that's realtime transport protocol this is the protocol that is commonly used to format and deliver multimedia or streaming content as an example RTP handles the flow of packets in a voice over IP session after session initiation protocol has established the connection RTP is commonly assigned to Ports 504 and to Port 505 then there's media Gateway control protocol or mgcp it's a protocol that defines a means of communication between a packet switched Network and a circuit switched Network as in the pstn it can be used to set up and maintain and terminate calls between multiple endpoints as and teleconferencing it's commonly assigned to Ports 2427 and or to Port 2727 last up we have h323 this is a protocol that provides a standard for delivering video over IP networks it defines how realtime audio video and data are to be transmitted it provides signaling and bandwidth control it's commonly assigned to Port 1720 that concludes this session on common networking protocols part one I did a brief summary of TCP and UDP and then I briefly ran through some common ports and protocols on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope you watch another one soon hello I'm Brian frell welcome to pait's session on common networking protocols part two today I'm going to be talking about the difference between ports and protocols and then I'm going to conclude with a brief discussion on some common ports and protocols with that let's go ahead and jump into this session of course I'm going to begin by talking about the difference between ports and protocols ports are a method of specifying what protocol our service to access many protocols and services use default ports so they are easy to locate there are 65,536 ports available to be used for communication but Port zero is reserved the first 10,24 ports are specifically assigned and are called welln ports if you would like to learn more about those you can check out the.org or website ports can be thought of as a phone number extension the IP address is the main number you are trying to reach the port is the extension for the service or protocol that you want to access protocols can be thought of as the language that two applications on either side of the connection agree to speak protocols translate requests into Services most protocols use predefined port but some protocols must be user configured for the ports that they use something to remember ports are not protocols and Protocols are not ports even though the two are closely associated they are not the same ports are used to request or access services or applications Protocols are the services or applications that are being requested when a requestor seeks to connect to a specific specific Port the requestor is dynamically assigned a port number to listen to for the response this also allows computers to have many concurrent connections at the same time it's time to move on to a brief discussion on common ports and protocols first up is the file transfer protocol or FTP it's a standard protocol for transferring files between Computing systems and it it does require user authentication FTP uses ports 20 and 21 although nowadays it mostly just uses Port 20 then there's tftp or trivial file transfer protocol this is used to transfer files between servers and clients but no user authentication is required by default tftp is assigned to Port 69 then there's s nmp or simple Network management protocol it's a protocol used to Monitor and manage local area networks by default it is assigned to Port 161 then we have tnet which is a protocol that is used for remote access to systems it is unsecure but it is also a bidirectional terminal service that comes in handy on occasion by default telnet uses Port 23 more secure than tnet is SSH or secure shell it's a protocol that's used to encrypt data traffic on networks it can be used in place of telet to provide a secure bidirectional terminal Connection by default SSH uses Port 22 a very useful protocol to have is DNS or the domain name system protocol this is the protocol that's used to map computer names to their IPs addresses DNS is assigned to Port 53 by default then there's DHCP or dynamic host configuration protocol this is the protocol used within networks to automatically configure computers with the correct IP configuration there are two ports used with DHCP requests are assigned to Port 67 responses from the DHCP server are ass assigned to Port 68 remote desktop protocol or RDP is used in Microsoft networks by both the remote desktop connection and remote assistance applications to make remote connections RDP is assigned to Port 3389 last up we have SMB or server message Block it's a protocol used to transfer files over a network the process is transparent to the user the user never sees SMB SMB can be configured to run over net bios on ports 137 through Port 139 but by default SMB is assigned to Port 400 and 45 that concludes this session on common networking protocols part two today I talked about the differences between ports and protocols and then I briefly discussed some common ports and protocols on behalf of pace it thank you for watching this session and I hope to do another one soon
