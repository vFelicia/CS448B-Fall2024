00:05 - so to start out probability we need to
00:08 - talk about events simple events compound
00:11 - events and sample space so the sample
00:14 - space is all the possible simple events
00:16 - in a simple event is simply a outcome of
00:20 - an action or an experiment that can't be
00:23 - broken down any further so if we're
00:25 - rolling a die
00:28 - that's the singular of dice in case
00:31 - you're curious and we've got six a
00:33 - six-sided die then the possible outcomes
00:37 - and this would be the the sample space
00:40 - the the possible outcomes are simple
00:45 - outcomes are rolling a one rolling a two
00:48 - rolling a three rolling four rolling a 5
00:51 - or rolling a six and each of these is a
00:55 - simple event now it is possible also to
01:00 - talk about things called compound events
01:05 - and compound events would be something
01:08 - like rolling something larger than four
01:13 - right and in that event there are two
01:16 - possible ways that you can achieve that
01:19 - event right you could either roll five
01:21 - or a six
01:22 - or another possible compound event would
01:24 - be rolling an even number right in this
01:28 - case there's three possible ways to have
01:33 - that event occur okay so these are our
01:36 - sample spaces those are all of our
01:38 - simple outcomes and now we can start
01:39 - talking about probability so if we're
01:41 - rolling one of those six-sided excited
01:45 - dies can we calculate this let's say the
01:49 - probability of rolling a 1 this notation
01:51 - here P parentheses is used to denote
01:54 - probability of and so this is the
01:56 - probability of rolling a 1 now a basic
01:59 - probability can be computed as the
02:02 - number of ways that this event can occur
02:05 - divided by the total number of possible
02:09 - events so for this particular case how
02:12 - many ways can we roll a 1 right remember
02:15 - that our sample space was the
02:18 - how many of those events are rolling a 1
02:22 - well only one of them how many total
02:25 - simple events are there how large is our
02:27 - sample space 6 so there is a 1/6
02:31 - probability of rolling a 1 on the die
02:35 - now you could also write that as a
02:36 - percent it's about 17% but we'll
02:39 - probably be using fractions most of the
02:41 - time because it's a little easier now
02:43 - how about in this one the probability of
02:45 - rolling a number bigger than 4 how many
02:48 - ways can that event occur well there's
02:50 - two numbers that are bigger than 4 so
02:53 - there's two outcomes that correspond to
02:57 - the event out of how many total outcomes
02:59 - are there six and this is a fraction so
03:02 - we can reduce it and so there's a one
03:05 - out of three or one-third probability if
03:07 - you roll a die of rolling a number
03:09 - bigger than 4
03:14 - so now let's continue talking about sort
03:16 - of basic probabilities let's say you
03:18 - have a back with 20 cherries 14 of which
03:20 - are sweet and 6 our if you pick a cherry
03:23 - at random what's the probability it will
03:25 - be sweet so again we say how many ways
03:28 - can out of all of the outcomes how many
03:31 - ways can our event occur in this case in
03:33 - order to be sweet there are 14 ways that
03:36 - we could end up with a sweet cherry out
03:38 - of how many possible outcomes well
03:40 - there's 20 possible cherries that we
03:42 - could have picked so there's a 14 out of
03:44 - 20 or 7 out of 10 or if you wanted to
03:47 - you could also say 70% chance or
03:50 - probability that our cherry will be
03:52 - sweet now that is of course assuming
03:54 - that all of our cherries are actually
03:56 - the same in shape and size if they
03:59 - happen to look different then then that
04:01 - might not be the case let's look at
04:04 - another one let's find the probability
04:06 - of randomly drawing one card from a
04:08 - standard deck of cards and getting an
04:11 - ace now if you're not familiar with a
04:13 - deck of cards here's what they look like
04:15 - there are four suits this top one is
04:18 - called a spade and then diamonds clubs
04:21 - and hearts there are the numbers 2
04:25 - through 10 an ace which sort of
04:27 - corresponds to the 1 and then these 3
04:30 - are called face cards the jack the Queen
04:33 - and the king so the question was compute
04:36 - the probability of randomly drawing one
04:38 - card from a deck and getting an ace well
04:41 - again we would need to say how many ways
04:44 - can that event occur out of all the
04:45 - possibilities so there are 13 different
04:49 - cards for each of four suits so there
04:53 - are 52 possible cards in the deck out of
04:57 - those how many of them are aces 1 2 3 4
05:01 - and so there is a 4 out of 52 or 1 13 or
05:07 - if you wanted it decimals you could say
05:09 - 0.076 9 or about seven point six nine
05:14 - percent probability or chance of
05:17 - randomly drawing a card from the deck
05:19 - and getting an ace
05:23 - if you pull a random card from a deck of
05:25 - playing cards what's the probability viz
05:27 - not a heart now this is what's called a
05:30 - complimentary event and because of the
05:35 - knot here so we're looking for the
05:37 - probability of something not happening
05:38 - so sometimes we like if E is our event
05:43 - then we'll use this notation a bar for
05:47 - the complement of that event which is a
05:51 - fancy way of saying that that event
05:54 - doesn't happen so this is saying he
05:58 - doesn't happen now because the
06:03 - probability of something happening is
06:06 - 100 percent or 1 then the probability of
06:09 - an event happening and the probability
06:12 - of the event not happening need to add
06:14 - up to 1 need to add up to 100% and so
06:18 - the probability of an event not
06:19 - happening is 1 minus the probability of
06:23 - the event happening so the probability
06:25 - of not getting a heart is 1 minus the
06:31 - probability of getting a heart and what
06:35 - is the probability of getting a heart
06:37 - well there are 13 hearts there are 13
06:43 - hearts out of the 52 cards in the deck
06:46 - so 1 minus 1/4 and that would be 3/4 so
06:54 - there's a 3/4 or 75% probability of not
06:57 - getting a heart and these are
06:59 - complementary events
07:03 - most we flipped a coin and rolled to die
07:05 - and we wanted to know the probability of
07:06 - getting a head on the coin and a six on
07:08 - the die now notice that we could list
07:11 - out all the possible outcomes here we
07:14 - could get a head and then a one a had a
07:16 - two ahead a three ahead of four ahead a
07:19 - five ahead a six right on the coin and
07:23 - then on the die or we could get tails
07:25 - and one tails and two tails and three
07:27 - tails in four tails in five tails and
07:29 - six and so there are a total of twelve
07:32 - possible outcomes here how many of them
07:35 - would have a head on the coin and a six
07:38 - on the die well only one of them right
07:41 - one out of those twelve and so there's a
07:44 - 1/12 probability of rolling a six on the
07:48 - die and getting a head on the coin now
07:50 - you might also notice that the
07:52 - probability of getting a head on the
07:53 - coin is one out of two the probability
07:57 - being a six on the die is one out of six
08:00 - and if we were to multiply those we
08:03 - would get the 1/12 and it turns out to
08:07 - be true that the probability of both
08:10 - events happening is the probability of a
08:13 - time's the probability of B if a and B
08:19 - are what's called independent now
08:24 - independence means that the result of
08:26 - the head of the coin flip does not
08:30 - depend or affect the result of the roll
08:33 - of the die let's look at some examples
08:35 - suppose we toss a fair coin
08:38 - the first event is the first toss and
08:41 - the second event is whether or not the
08:44 - second toss is a heads are these
08:46 - independent events yes these are
08:48 - independent independent why because the
08:55 - result of the second coin toss does not
08:57 - depend upon the first one the second
09:00 - toss has no idea whether the first toss
09:02 - was a was a head or not how about the
09:05 - two events it will rain tomorrow in
09:07 - Houston and it will rain tomorrow in
09:10 - Galveston which is a city near Houston
09:12 - these are not independent
09:16 - because the cities are close together
09:18 - they're likely to have similar similar
09:21 - weather patterns and so these are not
09:23 - independent events how about you draw a
09:25 - card from the deck and then draw a
09:27 - second card without replacing the first
09:29 - this is again not independent because
09:33 - the result of the first draw the will
09:36 - affect the result of the second draw for
09:38 - example if we're asking about let's say
09:41 - the probability of getting an ace the
09:43 - likelihood of getting an ace on the
09:45 - second draw depends upon whether or not
09:48 - we got an ace on the first draw so these
09:51 - are not independent but if two things
09:53 - are are independent then we can go ahead
09:58 - and use that multiplication idea so for
10:00 - example in your drawer you have six ten
10:03 - pairs of socks six of which are white
10:04 - and seven t-shirts three of which are
10:07 - white if you randomly reach in and pull
10:09 - out a pair of socks and t-shirt what's
10:10 - the probability both are white well the
10:12 - probability of white socks is let's say
10:18 - there's six white out of ten pairs right
10:22 - the probability of a white tee is let's
10:27 - hear three of them are white out of ten
10:30 - so the probability that both of them
10:33 - will be white will simply be the
10:37 - likelihood of the first being white
10:39 - times the second likely to the second
10:41 - one being white because the
10:43 - probabilities oops that's not right it's
10:47 - not out of ten it's out of seven right
10:50 - three out of seven sorry so the
10:54 - probability of both of them being white
10:55 - is this and we can simply multiply them
10:57 - because the probability of pulling out
10:59 - of the t-shirt being white is not
11:01 - dependent upon the probability of the
11:03 - socks being white so we can go ahead and
11:06 - multiply that that's 18 out of 70 in
11:10 - other words there are 70 possible
11:11 - outcomes and eighteen of them involve
11:14 - both of them being white and of course
11:16 - we can reduce that fraction down to nine
11:19 - thirty fifths so that's the probability
11:20 - that both of them are white later on
11:23 - we'll look at how to deal with a non
11:24 - independent case
11:31 - now suppose we flipped a coin and roll
11:34 - to die and we wanted to know the
11:36 - probability of getting a head on the
11:38 - coin or or a six on the die now this is
11:42 - different than the problems we did
11:43 - earlier where we're looking at the
11:44 - probability of both of the end so of
11:48 - course the easiest way to do this
11:50 - for a simple problem like this is to say
11:53 - well how many of these outcomes these
11:55 - twelve outcomes how many of them have a
11:57 - head on the coin or a six on the die and
11:59 - there are one two three four five six
12:04 - seven outcomes that have either a head
12:08 - on the coin or a six on the die now
12:12 - could we have figure that out another
12:14 - way by sort of looking at the two events
12:17 - separately so what's the probability of
12:19 - getting a head on the getting a head on
12:22 - the coin so the probability of a head is
12:26 - one-half or in twelfths right that'd be
12:30 - six out of 12 six of the outcomes have a
12:34 - head what's the probability of rolling a
12:39 - six on the die well there's two well
12:44 - that's one out of six right one roll out
12:47 - of the six possibilities on the die in
12:49 - terms of our total outcomes here two of
12:52 - them have a six on the die and notice if
12:56 - we hadn't just added these two up we get
12:59 - too many outcomes we'd get eight out of
13:02 - twelve
13:02 - why because we're counting one two three
13:05 - four five six for the heads and we're
13:08 - counting one two for the sixes but we've
13:12 - counted this value twice so in order to
13:14 - compensate for that we're going to have
13:16 - to subtract out that value that we
13:19 - double counted so we're going to
13:22 - subtract out the probability of heads
13:24 - and a six and there's 1 out of 12 there
13:28 - and if we combine that 6 plus 2 is 8
13:30 - minus 1 is 7 twelfths and we get the
13:34 - same answer that we had there so our
13:36 - basic rule here is that the probability
13:41 - of
13:42 - A or B is the probability of a plus the
13:48 - probability of B minus the probability
13:51 - of both and we again we got a subtract
13:55 - out that and so though we're not double
13:58 - counting it let's see if we can use this
14:00 - now supposed to draw one card from a
14:02 - standard deck what's the probability
14:03 - that we get a queen or a king well the
14:08 - probability of a queen is let's here
14:12 - there's four of them out of the 52 cards
14:13 - in the deck what's the probability of a
14:17 - king 4 out of 52 what's the probability
14:21 - that the card is both a queen and the
14:24 - king well none is impossible for a card
14:28 - to be both a king and a queen it's one
14:31 - of the other and so the probability of
14:33 - queen or king here is just 4 out of 52
14:37 - plus 4 out of 52 minus 0 is 8 out of 52
14:44 - is our is our probability there now the
14:50 - reason that we ended up with this 0 here
14:53 - is because these two events the
14:55 - probability of getting a queen and
14:56 - probability of getting a king are
14:58 - mutually exclusive there's no overlaps
15:00 - and so in this simple case in this case
15:04 - of mutually exclusive it turns out that
15:07 - the probability of the probability of
15:11 - getting a queen or king is just the
15:16 - probabilities of the queen plus the
15:18 - probability of the king again because
15:21 - they're mutually exclusive and there's
15:23 - no overlap now that's not always the
15:26 - case of course so in our second problem
15:28 - here what's the probability that we get
15:29 - a red card or a king the probability of
15:32 - a red card is oh let's here there are Oh
15:37 - half the deck is red so that would be 26
15:41 - out of the 52 what's the probability of
15:44 - a king that's 4 out of 52 what's the
15:48 - probability that's red and the King now
15:51 - here we do have overlap because there
15:53 - are two red kings
15:55 - and so for the probability of red or a
15:57 - king we're gonna have to add up the two
16:02 - individual probabilities and then
16:04 - subtract away the overlap which leaves
16:07 - us with a probability of 28 out of 52
16:10 - for the probability of getting a red
16:12 - card or a king
16:20 - so here we have a table showing the
16:22 - number of number of survey subjects who
16:26 - have received and not received a
16:28 - speeding ticket in the last year and the
16:31 - color of their car and we're gonna find
16:34 - the probability that if we were to
16:36 - choose one of these people our random
16:38 - that they've have had that the person
16:40 - has a red car and got a speeding ticket
16:42 - and then secondly has a red car or got a
16:46 - speeding ticket now if you look at the
16:49 - table here there's basically four
16:50 - different categories here we got
16:52 - speeding ticket and red car no speeding
16:55 - ticket and red car speeding ticket not
16:57 - Reds no speeding ticket not red and then
16:59 - we have totals for each of the columns
17:02 - totals for each the rows and then the
17:05 - total total of everyone surveyed so for
17:09 - the first question where it says has a
17:12 - red car and got a speeding ticket how
17:14 - many people got both had a red car and
17:17 - got a speeding ticket
17:18 - in this case there are 15 of them so 15
17:22 - people both had a red car and got a
17:25 - speeding ticket out of how many total
17:27 - people out of 665 total people so that's
17:33 - the probability of having a red car and
17:35 - getting a speeding ticket now these are
17:39 - dependent events and so we really have
17:42 - to work off the table it would not be
17:44 - correct to find the probability of
17:46 - having a red car the probability of
17:48 - speeding and just multiply them now how
17:51 - about for the next one so here we're
17:54 - trying to find the probability that they
17:55 - have a red car or getting us got getting
17:58 - a speeding ticket now there's a couple
18:01 - ways that we can go about this the
18:03 - easiest honestly is to just add up all
18:09 - the possibilities so let's see here
18:11 - these people got a speeding ticket these
18:15 - people have a red car so we have a total
18:19 - of 45 plus 15 plus 135 is a hundred and
18:26 - ninety five total people who either got
18:29 - a speeding ticket or up a red car and so
18:31 - our probability would be 195
18:33 - out of 665 now we could have also done
18:37 - this the sort of longer formulaic way
18:41 - and said well let's look at the
18:43 - probability that they got a speeding
18:44 - ticket that's 60 out of 665 and let's
18:48 - add to that the probability that they
18:50 - have a red car that's 150 out of 665 and
18:54 - then subtract the duplicates right
18:56 - subtract those that have both right our
18:59 - end probability here and if we do this
19:02 - we'll get exactly the same answer but
19:05 - wouldn't we have a small table like this
19:07 - it's probably just as easy to just count
19:09 - up the possibilities
19:14 - so what is the probability that two
19:17 - cards drawn at random from a deck of
19:19 - cards will both be aces now you note the
19:22 - probability of pulling one card in
19:25 - getting an ace is four out of out of 52
19:28 - and so it's really tempting to say the
19:31 - probability of getting an ace and
19:33 - another ace is 4 out of 52 times 4 out
19:37 - of 52 right using our multiplication
19:40 - rule now unfortunately this is not gonna
19:43 - work why because these two events are
19:46 - not independent because after we pull
19:52 - out our first card so after we pull out
19:56 - the first ace it changes the not only
20:00 - the number of cards in the deck but also
20:03 - the number of aces in the deck
20:05 - right so now for our first draw write
20:09 - probability of ace on the first draw is
20:11 - still 4 out of 52 but for our second
20:14 - draw this is going to change this is now
20:17 - the probability of an ace on the second
20:20 - draw second draw given and we use this
20:25 - little bar for a given given an ace on
20:29 - the first draw and this is what's called
20:32 - a conditional probability so here how
20:35 - many possible outcomes how many possible
20:38 - cards can one draw on the second draw
20:41 - there's only 51 cards left and so it's
20:44 - going to be out of 51
20:47 - now how many aces are left there are
20:52 - only three aces left now and so our
20:57 - probability ends up being 12 out of 26
21:01 - 52 or in other words 1 out of 221 rather
21:09 - than the 4 out of 52 times 4 out of 52
21:12 - ok so again this is called a conditional
21:15 - probability now let's look at another
21:19 - case let's find the probability that a
21:21 - die rolled shows a 6 and given so again
21:25 - this is a conditional probability given
21:27 - that a flip
21:28 - coin shows ahead so this is the
21:30 - probability of a six on a die given a
21:35 - head on a coin now in this case we need
21:40 - to ask ourselves are these two events
21:42 - independent and the answer is yes so in
21:45 - other words this in this particular case
21:48 - it doesn't matter why doesn't it matter
21:52 - because these are independent events so
21:56 - the probability of rolling on us the six
21:58 - on a die is the same as always
22:00 - it is one out of six let's look at one
22:04 - more case now let's look at a table of
22:07 - values here these are the speeding
22:09 - ticket folks so let's find the
22:12 - probability that they have a ticket
22:15 - given that they have a red car so now
22:19 - we're given that they have a red car so
22:21 - we know right away that we're only
22:23 - talking about these hundred and fifty
22:26 - people so we're only talking about out
22:29 - of these hundred and fifty people now
22:31 - out of those 150 people with a red car
22:33 - so we already know that how many of them
22:36 - got a ticket
22:37 - well 15 of them got a ticket so that's
22:40 - 15 out of 150 or one out of ten or ten
22:44 - percent of people with a red car also
22:46 - had a ticket now different question now
22:51 - is what's the probability that they have
22:55 - a red car given that they have a ticket
22:59 - now this is not the same thing because
23:02 - now we're limiting ourselves to these 60
23:05 - people so we have 60 people total who
23:09 - got a speeding ticket how many of them
23:11 - had a red car 15 of them had a red car
23:16 - so 15 out of 60 or 1/4 or 25% of people
23:22 - with a speeding ticket had red cars
23:26 - right so these are the conditional
23:28 - probabilities and it is important to
23:30 - notice here that the order here does
23:34 - matter it does matter which piece of
23:36 - information you're being given
23:44 - so let's look at a couple more
23:46 - conditional probabilities suppose you
23:48 - pull two cards out of the deck what is
23:50 - the probability that both are spades so
23:53 - the probability that the first card is a
23:57 - spade well let's see there are 13 spades
24:00 - out of the 52 cards in the deck so
24:04 - that's the probability that the first
24:06 - card is a spade so now what's the
24:08 - probability that the second card ii is a
24:14 - spade given that the first was a spade
24:19 - right in order for both cards to come
24:22 - out spades the first is gonna have to be
24:24 - a spade and the second and so what's the
24:27 - probability that the second one is a
24:28 - spade given the first was well in this
24:31 - case given that the first one was a
24:34 - spade then there's now one less card in
24:37 - the deck and one less Spade in the deck
24:40 - and so 12 out of 51 is the probability
24:44 - of the second one being a spade so if I
24:47 - want to find the probability that both
24:49 - are a spade I'm going to use the
24:54 - conditional probability version of the
24:56 - multiplication rule which says that the
24:59 - probability of the first event happening
25:01 - times the probability of the second
25:05 - event happening given that the first
25:07 - happened so in this case 13 out of 52
25:12 - for the first Spade 12 out of 51 for the
25:16 - second Spade gives us a probability
25:19 - oopsey gives us a probability of a
25:22 - hundred and fifty-six out of 26 52 or
25:26 - one out of 17 or about 5.9 percent
25:32 - probability of getting two spades and
25:37 - when we draw two cards so get another
25:39 - one if you draw two cards from the deck
25:41 - what's the probability that you'll get
25:43 - an ace of diamonds
25:44 - and a black card now this one's a little
25:46 - trickier because the events are
25:49 - different so there's two different ways
25:50 - that this could happen either we get it
25:53 - that we do the probability of the ace of
25:56 - diamonds
25:57 - then the black card and then separately
26:02 - we need to consider the probability of
26:04 - getting a black card than the ace of
26:07 - diamonds because it's sort of hard to
26:09 - think about putting those two cases
26:11 - together so here we're gonna find the
26:14 - probability of the ace of diamonds then
26:16 - the probability of getting a black card
26:19 - given that we already pulled the ace of
26:22 - diamonds and then for this case we're
26:25 - going to find the probability of getting
26:28 - a black card then for the second event
26:31 - the probability of getting the ace of
26:33 - diamonds given that we already pulled a
26:36 - black card okay
26:38 - so first case here what's the
26:40 - probability that we pull the ace of
26:42 - diamonds well there's only one of them
26:44 - out of the deck so one out of 52 how
26:47 - many ways could we pull a black card and
26:50 - given that the first card was the ace of
26:52 - diamonds
26:52 - now given that the first card is an ace
26:55 - of diamonds there's one less card in the
26:57 - deck but diamonds are not black so there
27:00 - are still 26 black cards in the deck so
27:03 - our probability here ends up being 26
27:06 - out of 26 52 is one out of a hundred and
27:12 - two here the probability of getting a
27:16 - black card on the first draw is 26 out
27:19 - of 52 here the probability of getting a
27:23 - ace of diamonds given that the first
27:25 - card is black if the first card was
27:27 - black then there's one less card in the
27:30 - deck but we know the ace of diamonds is
27:33 - still there so there's still one of them
27:34 - and so we end up with 26 out of 26 52 is
27:39 - one out of 102 so in both cases the
27:43 - probability is 1 out of 102 these are
27:46 - two different ways that the same result
27:49 - could happen so we need to add these
27:51 - together and so the total probability of
27:54 - getting an ace of diamonds and a black
27:57 - card is the sum of those two out of 102
28:02 - or 1 out of 51
28:13 - so this looks at sort of an important
28:16 - application of conditional probability
28:19 - so here we have a home pregnancy test
28:21 - that was given to women and then
28:23 - pregnancy is verified through blood
28:24 - tests and then this table shows the home
28:29 - test result up here and then whether
28:31 - they're actually pregnant or not down
28:32 - here so we're going to compute two
28:34 - different conditional probabilities
28:35 - first the probability that they're not
28:37 - pregnant given that they have a positive
28:40 - test result so this is you know you have
28:42 - a positive test result and then what's
28:46 - the likelihood that you're not actually
28:47 - pregnant so so here we're given that we
28:50 - have a positive test results who are
28:52 - limiting ourselves to these 75 people
28:55 - and of them five are not pregnant and
29:00 - that's about 6.7% so there's about a
29:04 - 6.7% chance here that there that this
29:08 - person is not actually pregnant given
29:11 - that they have a positive test result
29:13 - now let's look at the next one which is
29:16 - the probability of a positive test
29:18 - result given that they're not pregnant
29:20 - so here's somebody who's here's all
29:23 - nineteen people who are not pregnant and
29:27 - out of them five of them have a positive
29:32 - test result so this is what's called a
29:35 - false positive this is when somebody who
29:37 - doesn't actually have the condition gets
29:41 - a positive result anyway so it's an
29:43 - accidental positive result and you'll
29:46 - notice that this probability is
29:47 - substantially different this is about
29:50 - twenty six point three percent here yeah
29:53 - and it's it's really interesting to note
29:56 - these results are quite different so
29:59 - even though this test has a 26 percent
30:02 - false positive rate that means 26
30:05 - percent of the time it it will tell
30:08 - somebody who's not pregnant that they're
30:10 - pregnant that that is not the same
30:14 - probability as once you actually have a
30:17 - positive test result whether or not it
30:20 - is whether or not you're actually
30:22 - pregnant now admittedly this data is
30:25 - made up but this basic idea
30:27 - does hold true for for for test all
30:32 - pretty much all tests of disease and it
30:35 - all depends upon the incidence rate how
30:38 - likely it is that you actually have
30:39 - either the disease or in this case the
30:42 - likelihood of being pregnant
30:47 - so now we're gonna look at a sort of
30:49 - more complicated testing situation and
30:51 - this one fouls doctors up so let's look
30:54 - we'll walk our way through this so
30:56 - suppose a certain disease has an
30:58 - incidence rate of 0.1 percent that is it
31:01 - afflicts 0.1 percent of the population
31:03 - in other words the probability of having
31:05 - this disease is 0.001 0.1% so a test has
31:12 - been devised to detect this disease the
31:15 - test does not produce false negatives in
31:18 - other words anyone who has the disease
31:20 - will test positive for it in other words
31:23 - and the probability of a positive test
31:28 - given that the person has the disease is
31:33 - 100% they will definitely test positive
31:36 - if they have the disease but the false
31:41 - positive rate is is 5% this means that
31:46 - the probability that somebody will test
31:49 - positive if they do not have the disease
31:56 - yeah is is is 5% so 5% of people will
32:02 - test positive even if they don't have
32:04 - the disease so now if we randomly pick
32:06 - someone what's the probability that they
32:08 - actually have the disease in other words
32:11 - what is the probability of the disease
32:16 - given that they test positive and as we
32:22 - saw before this is not going to be the
32:24 - same as the probability of a positive
32:26 - test given the disease so let's work our
32:32 - way through this so here I've broken
32:35 - down all that information again so to
32:37 - think about this most simply let's
32:39 - imagine that we have 1,000 people now
32:43 - because the disease incidence rate is
32:46 - 0.001 or one out of a thousand then that
32:49 - tells me that out of these 1,000 people
32:52 - one of them will have the disease and
32:55 - 999 of them will not have the disease on
32:58 - average now
33:00 - if they have the disease we know that
33:03 - they're gonna test positive and so this
33:05 - one person is gonna have a positive test
33:07 - result there are no people who have the
33:10 - disease and test negative
33:12 - but now out of these 99 people who do
33:17 - not have the disease we know that 5% of
33:20 - them are gonna test positive so 5% of
33:23 - our 999 people is 49.95
33:29 - or about 50 so let's just call it 50 so
33:34 - 50 people are going to test positive who
33:38 - don't actually have the disease and the
33:40 - other 949 aren't going to test negative
33:46 - so that leaves us 51 people testing
33:50 - positive for the disease now remember
33:52 - what we're really interested in is what
33:54 - is the probability that you have the
33:58 - disease given that you tested positive
34:04 - well now we have enough information to
34:06 - figure that out how many people tested
34:09 - positive 51
34:10 - how many of them actually have the
34:12 - disease 1 and that comes out to about
34:17 - 1.96 percent so remarkably even though
34:22 - this test has no false negatives and
34:26 - only a 5% false positives rate if you
34:30 - test positive for this disease there's
34:33 - only a 2% chance that you actually have
34:35 - it and that should be surprising but
34:39 - that is the result of our probability
34:49 - so now we have another disease that has
34:51 - an incidence rate of two percent the
34:54 - false negative rate is 10 percent false
34:56 - positive rate is 1 percent so let's
34:59 - compute the probability that a person
35:01 - who test positive actually has the
35:02 - disease so there's two ways to do this
35:04 - let's start with the easy way and that
35:07 - is to create a table so now we got
35:11 - positive negative disease no disease now
35:15 - for simplicity let's imagine that we
35:16 - have some nice round number of people
35:19 - let's go with something pretty big like
35:20 - 10,000 just to make sure our numbers
35:22 - work out okay
35:24 - so now our we have a 2% incidence rate
35:27 - so out of these 10,000 people 2 percent
35:31 - of them or 200 of them will have the
35:34 - disease meanwhile the other 98 hundred
35:39 - of them will will not have the disease
35:42 - now we have a false negative rate of 10%
35:50 - and so that tells us that that tells us
35:55 - that 10% of these 200 are going to
35:59 - incorrectly test negative meanwhile the
36:02 - other 180 will correctly test positive
36:06 - meanwhile we have a false positive rate
36:09 - of 1% and that means that out of our
36:12 - people who don't have the disease 1% of
36:15 - them or 98 of them are going to test are
36:22 - going to test positive meanwhile the
36:24 - other let's see 8 9702 of them are going
36:29 - to correctly test negative so notice
36:33 - these these here and these 98 people
36:37 - here and these 20 people here are our
36:39 - errors right so altogether we have 278
36:45 - people testing positive so if we wanted
36:48 - to find out the probability that they
36:52 - have the disease given that they test
36:57 - positive
37:00 - then then we have 278 people who tested
37:07 - positive of them 180 have the disease
37:12 - and that comes out to be about sixty
37:15 - four point seven percent so sixty-four
37:20 - about 65 percent of people who test
37:23 - positive in this case will actually have
37:26 - the disease now there's another way we
37:28 - could go about this problem and that
37:30 - would be using using Bayes rule so let's
37:34 - take a look at what doesn't see what
37:35 - that would look like so Bayes rule says
37:37 - that the probability of a given B is the
37:43 - probability of a time's the probability
37:46 - of B given a over the probability of a
37:51 - time's the probability of B given a plus
37:55 - the probability of a compliment
37:58 - times the probability of B given a
38:03 - compliment
38:04 - now in terms of our disease that would
38:07 - look like look like this so now we could
38:11 - start filling in all this information so
38:16 - what is the probability that they have
38:18 - the disease well that is in this case
38:23 - two percent right it's a two percent
38:26 - incidence rate what's the probability
38:28 - that they have a get if a positive test
38:31 - given that they have the disease well
38:33 - there's a false negative rate of 10%
38:35 - which means there's a 90 percent chance
38:37 - that they'll test positive given they
38:40 - have the disease down here we got let's
38:43 - here again
38:44 - probability of disease probability of
38:46 - positive given disease probability of no
38:49 - disease would be 98 percent and then
38:52 - what's the probability that we test
38:54 - positive given that we don't have the
38:57 - disease that's our 1 percent false
38:59 - positive rate and if we compute all that
39:02 - out
39:03 - turns out to be 0.01 8 over 0.02 78
39:09 - which comes out to the same 64.7% we
39:13 - came up use
39:14 - with using our nice little table so this
39:17 - Bayes formula has its advantages but for
39:20 - a lot of cases working off the table
39:23 - like we did first is going to be a
39:25 - simpler approach
39:32 - so now we're going to talk about
39:33 - counting for a while and you're probably
39:36 - thinking counting I don't want to count
39:37 - but we're gonna talk about counting
39:39 - really large amounts of stuff so here's
39:41 - an example suppose a restaurant you have
39:43 - three choices of appetizer five choices
39:45 - for a main course and you're allowed to
39:47 - choose exactly one from each category
39:50 - how many different meal options do you
39:52 - have well there's several ways to
39:54 - approach this one way that I like is
39:57 - called a decision tree so you start out
39:59 - here and say okay I have how many
40:02 - choices for my appetizer I have three
40:06 - choices so I have one two three
40:10 - different directions I could go I could
40:12 - go soup direction salad direction and
40:16 - then breadsticks direction then at each
40:22 - of those points I now have to decide
40:24 - them on a main course and for each of
40:28 - those I now have one two three four five
40:30 - choices emanating out and so how many
40:36 - total choices do I have now you'll
40:39 - notice that there are five choices here
40:41 - another five here another five there we
40:44 - end up with a total of fifteen choices
40:47 - and that is how many meal options we
40:51 - have now you may have noticed that where
40:53 - does that 15 come from well it's three
40:55 - choices
40:56 - for our first decision times the five
40:59 - choices for the second decision because
41:01 - we have three live these little branch
41:03 - Eitri things so we end up multiplying
41:06 - those choices together and that's
41:09 - exactly how this works so let's look at
41:12 - another one suppose there's 21 novels
41:14 - and 18 volumes of poetry that you own a
41:17 - reading list for an English course how
41:19 - many different ways can you select one
41:21 - novel in one volume of poetry
41:23 - well there's 21 choices for the novel
41:26 - eighteen choices for the poetry we
41:30 - multiply those together and that gives
41:33 - us a total of three hundred and seventy
41:35 - eight possibilities so another one now
41:41 - suppose that we're at a restaurant and
41:42 - we have three choices for the appetizer
41:45 - we have five choices for a main course
41:47 - and now to choices for dessert if we're
41:51 - allowed to choose exactly one of them
41:53 - one of each of them then we would have 3
41:56 - times 5 times 2 equals 30 choices now it
42:01 - is important to note here that this is
42:02 - assuming that we actually pick one from
42:05 - each of them that we're not gonna you
42:07 - know not pick one of them okay one more
42:10 - so suppose quiz consists of three true
42:12 - or false questions how many ways can
42:13 - student answer this well so we have
42:16 - three questions each of those questions
42:18 - has two choices right so the first
42:23 - question all right so three questions
42:25 - the first question there are two choices
42:27 - for the second question there are two
42:30 - choices but the third question there are
42:33 - two choices and so altogether there are
42:36 - two to the third or eight different ways
42:39 - that a student could answer a three
42:43 - question true or false quiz
42:51 - so how many different ways could the
42:53 - letters of the word math be rearranged
42:55 - to form a four-level letter code word so
42:59 - we have four letters and we can ask
43:01 - ourselves how many choices do we have
43:03 - for the first letter well we have four
43:05 - choices how many choices do we have for
43:08 - the second letter now we're rearranging
43:10 - the letters so we can't use any letters
43:12 - twice and so there would be only be
43:14 - three choices for the second letter how
43:17 - about for the third letter two choices
43:19 - and then there's only one choice for the
43:20 - last letter because there's only one
43:22 - letter left and so we'd end up with 24
43:26 - different code words that we could
43:28 - create out of the letters of math now
43:31 - notice that's different than saying you
43:32 - slit letters from math and you can have
43:35 - repeats if we could have repeats we'd
43:38 - have 4 times 4 times 4 times 4 or 4 to
43:42 - the fourth different code words and
43:45 - that'd be 256 different code words we
43:49 - have a lot more if we allowed repeats
43:51 - but here we're not allowing repeats we
43:53 - end up with 24 possibilities now this
43:56 - sort of computation is done so often
43:59 - that we come up with a shorthand
44:01 - notation for it called the factorial
44:04 - factorial in general the idea is that n
44:09 - factorial means that number times one
44:13 - last times one last times keep on going
44:17 - down all the way down to till you get
44:21 - down to one so it's multiplying numbers
44:23 - in decreasing order until you get down
44:26 - to one so this is 4 factorial 4 times 3
44:29 - times 2 times 1 okay let's look at
44:32 - another problem how many ways can five
44:34 - different door prizes be distributed
44:36 - among five people so we've got 5 people
44:41 - and we got 5 different prizes so how
44:45 - many choices are there for the first
44:46 - person 5 how about for the second 4 3 2
44:51 - and 1
44:52 - or in other words 5 factorial and if you
44:55 - can find the factorial button on your
44:57 - calculator and will make your life a
44:59 - little easier here then hitting
45:00 - multiplication 5 times 4 times 2 times 1
45:03 - but either way we come up with
45:05 - 120 different ways to distribute those
45:08 - prizes now let's look at a slightly
45:11 - different one charity event is attended
45:14 - by 25 people and we're gonna give away
45:16 - three prizes and there are different
45:18 - prizes no person receives more than one
45:21 - prize how many different ways can we
45:23 - distribute these so we only have three
45:25 - prizes and the order does matter because
45:29 - it matters who gets the hundred dollar
45:32 - prize versus who gets the twenty-five
45:33 - dollar prize so how many choices do we
45:36 - have
45:36 - for the first prize for the hundred
45:40 - dollar prize
45:41 - well there's 25 people so there are 25
45:44 - possibilities for that prize how about
45:47 - for the second one for the 25 dollar
45:49 - prize well there's no repeats right no
45:52 - person receives more than one prize so
45:55 - there's only 24 people now and for the
45:58 - last prize for the $10.00 prize there's
46:01 - 23 people and so we end up with 13
46:05 - thousand eight hundred different ways
46:07 - that these prizes could be awarded and
46:10 - you'll notice that this looks awfully
46:12 - similar to our our factorial that we
46:16 - were doing earlier but a but truncated
46:21 - right where we don't go all the way down
46:22 - to one and it turns out that there is a
46:24 - nice way to represent this which will
46:26 - look about look at in a minute let's
46:28 - look at one more first dumb eight
46:30 - sprinters have made it to the Olympic
46:32 - finals 100 meters how many different
46:33 - ways could the gold silver and bronze be
46:36 - awarded or how many different possible
46:40 - outcomes are there basically so similar
46:42 - to the last problem there are eight
46:45 - possibilities for the first place for
46:48 - the gold there are seven possibilities
46:50 - for the for the silver and there are six
46:54 - possibilities for the bronze that gives
46:58 - us a total of 336 different orderings or
47:03 - 336 different outcomes
47:12 - so I have nine paintings in room to
47:14 - display only four of them on the wall
47:15 - the time how many different ways could I
47:17 - do this so I'm going to presume that
47:19 - ordering matters here in other words I
47:22 - care what order the pictures are in and
47:25 - and that I can't use the same picture
47:27 - twice so we certainly could answer this
47:30 - question by saying how many choices do I
47:33 - have for the first one the second one
47:34 - the third one and the fourth one and we
47:38 - could certainly do that and end up with
47:40 - our answer 3000 24 different orderings
47:45 - now to make that we're gonna try to come
47:48 - up with another way to do this and this
47:51 - thing is what we call a permutation a
47:56 - permutation is a rearrangement of items
47:59 - where order matters and we're selecting
48:03 - from a group the usual notation is n P R
48:08 - where n is the is the number of items
48:12 - number of choices and then R is is how
48:19 - many pick how many we're gonna pick the
48:22 - number we pick so R is the number we
48:24 - pick from our total number of choices so
48:28 - this problem here would be 9 P 4 we have
48:34 - nine choices and from them we're going
48:37 - to pick four of them and we're going to
48:39 - look at all the possible orderings or
48:41 - permutations of them now there's several
48:45 - ways to calculate a permutation one is
48:48 - the way we just did it which is to just
48:50 - multiply 9 times 8 times 7 times 6
48:55 - another way to do it is to use
48:57 - factorials you'll notice that this looks
49:00 - a lot like 9 factorial which is 9 times
49:04 - 8 times 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times
49:07 - 3 times 2 times 1 but it's not as much
49:10 - right we don't have the 5 4 3 2 1 so we
49:14 - can get rid of that by dividing by 5
49:16 - factorial which will then reduce all of
49:21 - those away leaving us with just the 9 8
49:25 - 7
49:26 - six so if we have NPR it turns out we
49:31 - can compute that using factorials as n
49:34 - factorial over n minus R factorial so in
49:41 - this case when we had 9p and four that
49:45 - would be nine factorial over nine minus
49:48 - four factorial or other words nine
49:50 - factorial over five factorial as we just
49:54 - saw here the other way you can do this
49:57 - is if your calculator happens is to have
49:59 - a permutations feature on it you can ask
50:02 - it what is 9p for and it should spit out
50:06 - this 3024 answer for you now this is
50:11 - kind of handy when we're looking at
50:12 - larger numbers so let's look at one more
50:14 - example how many ways can a four person
50:17 - Executive Committee president vice
50:19 - president secretary treasurer be
50:20 - selected from a sixteen member Board of
50:22 - Directors so in this case there are
50:26 - sixteen choices sixteen members on the
50:29 - board of director and from them we're
50:32 - looking at permutations of size four so
50:35 - we're looking at orderings again order
50:36 - matters here because it matters who's
50:40 - chosen as president and vice president
50:41 - versus the other way around so 16 people
50:44 - we're picking four of them order matters
50:47 - 16 P 4 now again we could either compute
50:50 - this as 16 times 15 times 14 times 13 or
50:56 - 16 factorial over 16 minus 4 is 12
51:00 - factorial or we could pull out our
51:03 - calculators either way we're gonna end
51:06 - up with 40 2680 and different executive
51:12 - committees
51:19 - so a charity event now is intended by 25
51:22 - people at which through 3 $50 gift
51:25 - certificates are going to be given away
51:26 - as door prizes how many ways could we do
51:28 - this now this is notice that all three
51:31 - prizes aren't the same here
51:33 - so we could go with the basic idea of
51:35 - saying okay we have three people there
51:38 - are twenty-five possibilities for the
51:40 - first prize 24 for the second and
51:42 - twenty-third for the third or in other
51:44 - words there are thirteen thousand eight
51:47 - hundred different ways that we could
51:51 - pick three people from our crowd now
51:54 - let's imagine now that we have three
51:57 - people a we're just gonna call them a B
52:01 - and C for simplicity so if a B and C
52:07 - were picked first second third that
52:09 - would be one of these 13,800
52:12 - possibilities but if B was picking
52:16 - picked first then a then C then this
52:20 - would also be one of those six one one
52:24 - of those 13,800 possibilities but really
52:27 - these are the same outcome in fact there
52:32 - are six different outcomes there are six
52:39 - different outcomes that are all really
52:41 - the same outcome because the order
52:43 - doesn't matter here it doesn't matter
52:45 - who's chosen first second or third so in
52:48 - order to compensate for this we end up
52:51 - needing to take our thirteen thousand
52:53 - eight hundred different permutations and
52:55 - divide it by six to come up with twenty
53:00 - three thousand what are called
53:02 - combinations combinations are what we
53:05 - call it when order doesn't matter in
53:10 - other words it doesn't matter who is
53:11 - chosen first now the way we can sort of
53:15 - generalize this is the idea of the total
53:19 - number of permutations so NP are divided
53:24 - by well what did where did this six come
53:27 - from that's the number of different ways
53:29 - of orderings three people so in this
53:33 - it was three people three people three
53:37 - possibilities for the first person 2 for
53:40 - the second one for the third that is 3 P
53:45 - 3 or in general this would be R P R and
53:49 - this is how we define a combination or
53:53 - how we calculate combinations and we
53:55 - denote combinations with n oops n see R
54:00 - so this is from N and choices we're
54:04 - choosing this R of them but the order
54:07 - doesn't matter so we're going to count
54:08 - ABC the same thing as BAC this is one
54:12 - way to compute it the other way is using
54:15 - factorials and that looks something like
54:18 - this so now let's look at let's look at
54:24 - an example so a group of four students
54:28 - is to be chosen from a 35 member class
54:31 - to represent the class on the Student
54:33 - Council
54:33 - now order doesn't matter here because
54:35 - they're all just representatives so in
54:37 - this case from our 35 students we're
54:41 - going to choose four of them but the
54:44 - order doesn't matter so this is a
54:45 - combination so using our sort of first
54:50 - version here the permutation version
54:53 - we're thinking from 35 from 35 how many
54:59 - different ways can I pick four people if
55:01 - order didn't matter and then I'm going
55:03 - to divide that by the number of ways of
55:06 - ordering four people so this says from
55:11 - 35 people I need to pick four so I got
55:14 - 35 choices for the first person 34 for
55:17 - the second 33 for the third and 32 for
55:20 - this last choice and I'm gonna divide
55:23 - that by the different ways of ordering
55:25 - for people so then I have four choices
55:27 - for the first person third three for the
55:30 - second two for the third and one for the
55:32 - last so this is the total number of ways
55:36 - of choosing four people if order matters
55:39 - divided by the number of ways of
55:41 - ordering them which takes care of the
55:43 - order it gives me 50 mm
55:46 - 60 different combinations
55:57 - so the Senate Appropriations Committee
56:00 - consists of 29 members and suppose that
56:03 - it was 15 Republicans and 14 Democrats
56:07 - the defense subcommittee which is a
56:10 - smaller group of that consists of 19
56:13 - members 10 Republicans and 9 Democrats
56:16 - how many different ways could the
56:18 - members of the defense subcommittee be
56:20 - chosen from among the 29 senators on the
56:23 - Appropriations Committee so you can see
56:26 - that for thee we're going to look
56:27 - separately at the Republicans or the
56:29 - Democrats here okay
56:31 - so forward the Republicans we have 15
56:38 - Republicans overall and 10 of them are
56:42 - going to end up on this subcommittee so
56:44 - from the 15 Republicans we're going to
56:47 - pick 10 of them in order does not matter
56:49 - so we're going to use combinations and
56:51 - that turns out to be three thousand and
56:54 - three for our Democrats we have 14
56:59 - Democrats altogether nine of them are
57:03 - going to end up on our committee so 14
57:06 - choose nine and that comes out to be two
57:10 - thousand and two different ways but then
57:14 - how about for our entire committee here
57:17 - so so now imagine that we let's put all
57:23 - the Republican choices on little slips
57:26 - of red paper so we've got three thousand
57:28 - and three pieces of red paper and then
57:31 - we put all 2002 Democratic choices on
57:35 - little slips of blue paper and threw
57:37 - them all in a hat how many ways could we
57:39 - pick one red slip in one blue slip well
57:42 - there's three thousand and three
57:44 - possibilities for choosing a Republican
57:50 - contingent and there's two thousand and
57:53 - two choices for choosing a Democratic
57:55 - contingent and so we've simply multiply
57:58 - those together just like our restaurant
58:00 - choices and we end up with a very large
58:03 - number over six million different ways
58:08 - of
58:09 - electing the members of the subcommittee
58:14 - so now we're going to compute some
58:16 - probabilities using counting so a four
58:20 - digit PIN number is selected what is the
58:22 - probability that there are no repeated
58:24 - digits so that would mean that all the
58:27 - digits have to be different so if I was
58:30 - going to pick four digits where they're
58:36 - all the digits are different I would
58:38 - have ten choices for the first digit
58:41 - assuming we're allowing values 0 1 2 3 4
58:44 - 5 6 7 8 9 we have 10 choices for the
58:47 - first digit 9 for the second digit
58:49 - because we're not gonna allow repeats 8
58:52 - for the third digit and 7 for the fourth
58:55 - digit or in other words that's 10 P 4
58:59 - right is 5040 different pins pins with
59:06 - no repeats now in order to compute the
59:11 - probability we're gonna have to find the
59:14 - total number of of pin numbers including
59:17 - repeats so all pins so if we consider
59:21 - all pins that including allowing repeats
59:24 - how many choices are there for the first
59:26 - number 10 how many for the second number
59:29 - also 10 also 10 also 10 because we allow
59:34 - repeats so there's no exclusions so
59:37 - that's 10 to the 4th and 10 to the 4th
59:39 - is 10,000 so there's 10,000 total pins
59:44 - out of those five thousand and 40 of
59:47 - them have no repeats so we got 5,000 and
59:51 - 40 out of 10,000 or about 50.4%
59:56 - of pins have no repeated digits so now
60:02 - let's look at a lottery problem so in a
60:05 - certain States lottery we got 48
60:07 - different numbers and six of them are
60:09 - drawn at random and if you have and you
60:14 - the player gets to choose six numbers
60:16 - and if there are six numbers match they
60:18 - win a million dollars in the order
60:21 - doesn't matter in this particular lotto
60:22 - so we're not playing Powerball and let's
60:25 - see if we let's see if we can find the
60:26 - probability that that will win
60:29 - we win that million dollar prize if we
60:31 - purchase a single ticket so the first
60:33 - thing we didn't know is how many
60:34 - possible outcomes are there so from 48
60:38 - different numbers there we're going to
60:42 - choose six of them and order here does
60:45 - not matter which is why we're using
60:47 - combinations and so we end up with 12
60:51 - million two hundred seventy-one thousand
60:53 - five hundred and twelve different six
60:55 - number outcomes now if you have one
60:58 - ticket then you have one outcome and so
61:01 - your probability of winning is 1 out of
61:04 - 12 million 271 512 which is a really
61:11 - really small number and so that's the
61:14 - probability of winning the main prize
61:16 - now oftentimes there's a second prize
61:18 - and in this case it's a thousand dollars
61:21 - if you can match five of the numbers now
61:24 - there are still 48 choose 612 million
61:29 - two hundred seventy-one thousand five
61:31 - hundred and twelve different outcomes
61:33 - but now we need to figure out how many
61:35 - of those involve us winning matching
61:39 - five of the numbers now in order for
61:42 - that to happen from our six numbers on
61:46 - the card we're going to have to match
61:48 - five of them so how many different ways
61:51 - can we pick five matching numbers out of
61:54 - our six that would be six choose 5 which
61:58 - is six now we also have to consider that
62:01 - you know how many different ways could
62:03 - we not pick the the last number so from
62:09 - the 42 non winning numbers we need to
62:13 - pick one of them to be on our card and
62:15 - so that is is 42 so our final
62:19 - probability of winning is going to be
62:22 - there are that many 42 times six is 252
62:30 - different ways that we can match five
62:33 - numbers and not match the six out of our
62:38 - 48 choose six out of our 12 million two
62:41 - hundred
62:42 - 1512 total outcomes and that gives us a
62:47 - you know marginally higher probability
62:50 - of winning though it's still pretty
62:52 - small
62:59 - so now suppose we randomly draw five
63:02 - cards from a deck
63:03 - what's our probability of getting
63:05 - exactly one ace now in order for us to
63:08 - get exactly one ace then from the four
63:12 - aces in the deck we need to be able to
63:15 - we need to pick one of them one of them
63:17 - needs to be in our in our hand in our
63:19 - set of five cards and there are four
63:23 - different ways that that can happen and
63:26 - then from the remaining 48 non aces
63:31 - we're gonna need four of them because in
63:36 - order for us to have exactly one ace we
63:39 - need to have one ace and for non aces so
63:44 - this is one ace and then this is picking
63:48 - for non aces now remember we're doing
63:52 - counting here so we're figuring out how
63:55 - many ways how many ways can I pick four
64:03 - you know one ace out of four and how
64:06 - many ways can I pick four non ace is out
64:09 - of 48 and there are a fair number of
64:12 - ways of doing that
64:13 - so our final probability our probability
64:16 - of exactly one ace is 4 choose 1 times
64:21 - 48 choose 4 again that's the picking one
64:25 - ace and for non aces out of all the ways
64:30 - of picking 5 cards that's 52 cards I
64:33 - choose 5 of them all together that comes
64:37 - out to be about 770 8320 out of all 2.5
64:48 - million hands and it turns out to be
64:51 - about 0.2 9 9 or in other words there's
64:55 - about a 30% chance that out of 5 cards
64:58 - one of them exactly one of them will be
65:01 - an ace so now what if we wanted to find
65:04 - the probability out of a 5 card hand of
65:09 - executive executive
65:13 - very similar to the last one here out of
65:18 - the four aces on the day in the deck
65:20 - we're gonna need to pick two of them and
65:22 - out of all the non aces in the deck
65:25 - we're gonna need to pick three of them
65:27 - this time right so we have a total of
65:30 - five cards two aces three non aces and
65:34 - that's out of all the ways that you can
65:37 - choose five cards out of 52 and that
65:40 - turns out to be about 0.03 99 so there's
65:46 - about a 4% chance that out of five
65:49 - five-card hand that you'll have exactly
65:51 - two aces a pair of aces in that hand
66:00 - so now we're gonna look at sort of a
66:02 - notorious problem in probability called
66:04 - the birthday problem so suppose that
66:06 - three people are in a room what's the
66:08 - probability that there's at least one
66:09 - shared birthday among these three people
66:12 - so now this this idea of at least one is
66:16 - kind of tricky so the way we're going to
66:19 - tackle this is the idea that the
66:21 - probability of at least one is easiest
66:25 - to think about through its complement so
66:28 - what is the complement of at least one
66:31 - shared birthday well the opposite of at
66:34 - least one shared birthday is no shared
66:37 - birthdays and so that's the probability
66:43 - we're going to try to find so let's see
66:46 - in order for them to there to not be any
66:50 - shared birthdays then each person is
66:52 - going to have to have a different
66:54 - birthday so for the first person in our
66:58 - group how many different how many
67:06 - different ways could we pick their
67:07 - birthday well they would have 365
67:10 - choices we're gonna ignore lis peers
67:13 - here out of the 365 choices for the
67:17 - fourth e for the year now the second
67:20 - person in order for them to have a
67:22 - different birthday then out of the 365
67:26 - days in the year they're gonna have to
67:29 - have a different one so they only get
67:31 - 364 choices and then our third person in
67:38 - the room is only gonna get 363 choices
67:42 - and so this is the probability of no
67:46 - shared birthday the probability that
67:48 - each person has a different birthday and
67:52 - and this turns out to be you'll notice
67:54 - that this first fraction is actually
67:56 - equal to one so this turns out to be
67:58 - about 0.99 1/8 again that's the
68:02 - probability of no shared birthday so the
68:05 - probability of at least one shared
68:08 - birthday is 1 minus that is you know
68:13 - pretty small
68:14 - it's about you know 0.8% not too big
68:18 - let's make our group a little bit bigger
68:21 - now
68:21 - so suppose we've got five people in the
68:23 - room so then the probability of at least
68:27 - one shared birthday again will be one
68:31 - minus the probability of no shared
68:34 - birthdays in order for that to happen
68:36 - again the first person gets you know can
68:40 - pick any day they want they aren't of
68:43 - course actually picking but you know
68:45 - what I mean they that there's 365 four
68:50 - different ways that this person can have
68:52 - a birthday and not conflict with that
68:53 - person and we do this for each of our
68:58 - people in the room and that would give
69:02 - us our our answer turns out to be about
69:04 - at 2.7 percent but we could simplify
69:08 - this a lot if we notice that the
69:11 - denominator here is 365 to the to thee
69:19 - we see that this is just 365 p5
69:28 - so through from 365 there's how many
69:32 - ways can we pick five or how many
69:33 - orderings are there and in the bottom
69:35 - we've got 365 multiplied together five
69:40 - times that's 365 to the fifth power and
69:44 - computing that we get exactly the same
69:46 - answer that we had there now this is
69:50 - really cool because now if we ask the
69:51 - question what happens if we put 30
69:53 - people in the room what's the
69:56 - probability of at least one shared
69:58 - birthday we can answer this pretty
70:01 - easily because we can say well two one
70:04 - minus the probability of no shared
70:06 - birthdays no shared birthdays mean from
70:09 - 365 possible birthdays we're gonna put
70:13 - how many ways could we pick 30 different
70:15 - birthdays out of from 365 how many
70:22 - different ways could there be 30
70:24 - birthdays including repeats right and
70:26 - that's the same idea as
70:28 - our numerator and denominator there and
70:30 - computing that that comes out to be 0.7
70:34 - zero six or 70 point six percent which
70:38 - is probably a little bit surprising that
70:40 - means out of 30 people in a room there's
70:42 - a 70% chance that there's at least one
70:46 - shared birthday in that room
70:54 - so when the game roulette a wheel was 38
70:57 - spaces 18 red 18 black and 2 green is
71:00 - spun in one of the possible bets of
71:03 - player bets $1 on a single number if
71:06 - that number is spot on the wheeled and
71:08 - they received 36 dollars our original
71:10 - dollar plus 35 additional otherwise they
71:14 - lose their dollar so on average how much
71:16 - money should a player expect to win or
71:19 - lose if they play this game repeatedly
71:21 - repeatedly so for winning let's first
71:25 - talk about the probability of winning if
71:27 - they bet on any one number their
71:29 - probability of winning the probability
71:32 - of winning is 1 out of 38 so then for
71:38 - losing the probability of losing is the
71:42 - complement of that so there are 37 ways
71:46 - that a player can lose now to compute
71:49 - this idea of expected value and we're
71:53 - talking here about sort of your
71:55 - expectations then we can compute that
71:59 - expected value by multiplying the
72:02 - probability of winning times the value
72:05 - of winning and adding to it or
72:08 - subtracting from it the probability of
72:10 - losing times the value of losing so for
72:14 - winning the value of winning is a
72:17 - positive $35 so we get $35 more than we
72:22 - started with if we win and the
72:25 - probability of that happening is 1 out
72:27 - of 38 we're going to add to that the the
72:32 - other outcome which is losing and that
72:34 - outcome has a value of negative $1 in
72:39 - other words when we lose $1 and that
72:41 - happens with probability 37 out of 38 if
72:46 - we add those together we end up with 35
72:49 - over 38 minus 37 over 38 is negative 2
72:56 - over 38 or in other words about negative
73:03 - 0.053 so in other words if you were to
73:07 - play this game you should expect on
73:10 - average to lose about five cents per
73:13 - spin so in other words if you were gonna
73:15 - if you played for hours and played for
73:17 - thousands of spins on average you should
73:20 - expect to lose about five cents per spin
73:25 - sometimes you win sometimes you lose but
73:28 - on average you'll lose about five cents
73:30 - per spin so now let's look at a lottery
73:33 - problem so we looked at this lottery
73:36 - before and we figured out that the
73:38 - probability of matching all six numbers
73:43 - was one out of the all the possible
73:50 - choices so it was one out of the ways of
73:53 - picking six numbers out of 48 which was
73:55 - 1 out of 12 million ish and the
74:02 - probability of matching 5 was let's see
74:06 - here we had two from six numbers we had
74:09 - to pick five and then from the 42 non
74:13 - winning numbers we had to pick one and
74:16 - we ended up with a probability of about
74:19 - 250 two out of again that 12 million
74:24 - there so now let's think about values so
74:28 - this thing has a value of positive 1
74:31 - million dollars this had this outcome
74:36 - has a value of positive $1000 and then
74:40 - of course there's a probability of not
74:42 - matching anything which is going to
74:46 - happen the rest of the time right so 1
74:49 - minus the 250 3 out of 12 million 270
74:53 - 1512 and this has a value of negative $1
74:57 - because it costs $1 to play so to
75:01 - compute our probability here we're going
75:04 - to multiply we're going to multiply this
75:08 - probability times this outcome this
75:11 - probability times this outcome
75:14 - and this probability times this outcome
75:17 - and add those up and when we do we get a
75:21 - value of about negative zero point eight
75:25 - nine eight in other words if you play
75:30 - lotto a whole bunch you should expect on
75:33 - average to lose about ninety cents per
75:36 - ticket of course most people lose their
75:39 - dollar and only a few people are
75:41 - actually win anything but on average you
75:43 - should expect to lose ninety cents
75:51 - okay a 40 year old man in the US has
75:54 - about a 0.242 percent risk of dying
75:57 - during the next year an insurance
76:00 - company charges $275 for life insurance
76:03 - policy that pays $100,000 death benefit
76:06 - in other words it pays that if the
76:07 - person dies during the year otherwise
76:11 - they they you know just get their $275
76:15 - and the person doesn't get anything so
76:17 - what is the expected value for the
76:18 - person who's buying the insurance so so
76:23 - so there's two possible outcomes here
76:25 - and so outcome number one of course is
76:31 - is is dying and outcome number two is
76:35 - not dying and each of those has an
76:42 - Associated probability the probability
76:44 - of of dying
76:46 - presumably is 0.002 for two and the
76:52 - probability of not dying then is the
76:53 - complement of that which is nine nine
76:56 - seven five eight right one minus the
76:58 - public bility of dying and then the
77:00 - value of the outcome well the value of
77:05 - dying and I know we're talking we're
77:07 - purely talking monetary values here of
77:09 - course not emotional values or life
77:13 - value purely monetary then for the
77:16 - person buying the insurance and their
77:19 - family the value of to them is the
77:24 - hundred thousand dollars they get - the
77:27 - two hundred seventy five dollars they
77:28 - had to pay for the policy so they have a
77:31 - positive net benefit of ninety nine
77:34 - thousand seven hundred twenty five if
77:36 - they don't die then the financial value
77:39 - of the insurance is a negative two
77:42 - hundred and seventy five dollars so that
77:45 - our expected value then this expected
77:49 - value is the probability
77:56 - multiplied by the value of the outcome
78:00 - plus our other probability times the
78:05 - value of its outcome and altogether that
78:10 - gives us a negative value of 33 in other
78:14 - words if we had a bunch of people you
78:17 - know thousands of people who are you
78:20 - know for you ten thousands of 40 year
78:22 - old men then on average the men will
78:24 - have lost 33 dollars now it's not
78:28 - surprising that this value is negative
78:29 - that's the only way the insurance
78:31 - company can afford to offer policies I
78:33 - mean not 33 dollars on average is is
78:37 - what's paying for their expenses and you
78:40 - know profits and everything else that
78:42 - goes into a business for the agents and
78:44 - everything else and really the reason
78:47 - that they can afford to pay out that
78:50 - occasional hundred thousand dollar
78:53 - benefit is because of all the people who
78:56 - don't die who balance it out so you know
79:00 - even though this has a negative expected
79:02 - value to the purchaser there's certainly
79:05 - security you know knowing that your
79:08 - family's cared for benefits to having
79:10 - insurance which might make that expense
79:13 - worthwhile

Cleaned transcript:

so to start out probability we need to talk about events simple events compound events and sample space so the sample space is all the possible simple events in a simple event is simply a outcome of an action or an experiment that can't be broken down any further so if we're rolling a die that's the singular of dice in case you're curious and we've got six a sixsided die then the possible outcomes and this would be the the sample space the the possible outcomes are simple outcomes are rolling a one rolling a two rolling a three rolling four rolling a 5 or rolling a six and each of these is a simple event now it is possible also to talk about things called compound events and compound events would be something like rolling something larger than four right and in that event there are two possible ways that you can achieve that event right you could either roll five or a six or another possible compound event would be rolling an even number right in this case there's three possible ways to have that event occur okay so these are our sample spaces those are all of our simple outcomes and now we can start talking about probability so if we're rolling one of those sixsided excited dies can we calculate this let's say the probability of rolling a 1 this notation here P parentheses is used to denote probability of and so this is the probability of rolling a 1 now a basic probability can be computed as the number of ways that this event can occur divided by the total number of possible events so for this particular case how many ways can we roll a 1 right remember that our sample space was the how many of those events are rolling a 1 well only one of them how many total simple events are there how large is our sample space 6 so there is a 1/6 probability of rolling a 1 on the die now you could also write that as a percent it's about 17% but we'll probably be using fractions most of the time because it's a little easier now how about in this one the probability of rolling a number bigger than 4 how many ways can that event occur well there's two numbers that are bigger than 4 so there's two outcomes that correspond to the event out of how many total outcomes are there six and this is a fraction so we can reduce it and so there's a one out of three or onethird probability if you roll a die of rolling a number bigger than 4 so now let's continue talking about sort of basic probabilities let's say you have a back with 20 cherries 14 of which are sweet and 6 our if you pick a cherry at random what's the probability it will be sweet so again we say how many ways can out of all of the outcomes how many ways can our event occur in this case in order to be sweet there are 14 ways that we could end up with a sweet cherry out of how many possible outcomes well there's 20 possible cherries that we could have picked so there's a 14 out of 20 or 7 out of 10 or if you wanted to you could also say 70% chance or probability that our cherry will be sweet now that is of course assuming that all of our cherries are actually the same in shape and size if they happen to look different then then that might not be the case let's look at another one let's find the probability of randomly drawing one card from a standard deck of cards and getting an ace now if you're not familiar with a deck of cards here's what they look like there are four suits this top one is called a spade and then diamonds clubs and hearts there are the numbers 2 through 10 an ace which sort of corresponds to the 1 and then these 3 are called face cards the jack the Queen and the king so the question was compute the probability of randomly drawing one card from a deck and getting an ace well again we would need to say how many ways can that event occur out of all the possibilities so there are 13 different cards for each of four suits so there are 52 possible cards in the deck out of those how many of them are aces 1 2 3 4 and so there is a 4 out of 52 or 1 13 or if you wanted it decimals you could say 0.076 9 or about seven point six nine percent probability or chance of randomly drawing a card from the deck and getting an ace if you pull a random card from a deck of playing cards what's the probability viz not a heart now this is what's called a complimentary event and because of the knot here so we're looking for the probability of something not happening so sometimes we like if E is our event then we'll use this notation a bar for the complement of that event which is a fancy way of saying that that event doesn't happen so this is saying he doesn't happen now because the probability of something happening is 100 percent or 1 then the probability of an event happening and the probability of the event not happening need to add up to 1 need to add up to 100% and so the probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of the event happening so the probability of not getting a heart is 1 minus the probability of getting a heart and what is the probability of getting a heart well there are 13 hearts there are 13 hearts out of the 52 cards in the deck so 1 minus 1/4 and that would be 3/4 so there's a 3/4 or 75% probability of not getting a heart and these are complementary events most we flipped a coin and rolled to die and we wanted to know the probability of getting a head on the coin and a six on the die now notice that we could list out all the possible outcomes here we could get a head and then a one a had a two ahead a three ahead of four ahead a five ahead a six right on the coin and then on the die or we could get tails and one tails and two tails and three tails in four tails in five tails and six and so there are a total of twelve possible outcomes here how many of them would have a head on the coin and a six on the die well only one of them right one out of those twelve and so there's a 1/12 probability of rolling a six on the die and getting a head on the coin now you might also notice that the probability of getting a head on the coin is one out of two the probability being a six on the die is one out of six and if we were to multiply those we would get the 1/12 and it turns out to be true that the probability of both events happening is the probability of a time's the probability of B if a and B are what's called independent now independence means that the result of the head of the coin flip does not depend or affect the result of the roll of the die let's look at some examples suppose we toss a fair coin the first event is the first toss and the second event is whether or not the second toss is a heads are these independent events yes these are independent independent why because the result of the second coin toss does not depend upon the first one the second toss has no idea whether the first toss was a was a head or not how about the two events it will rain tomorrow in Houston and it will rain tomorrow in Galveston which is a city near Houston these are not independent because the cities are close together they're likely to have similar similar weather patterns and so these are not independent events how about you draw a card from the deck and then draw a second card without replacing the first this is again not independent because the result of the first draw the will affect the result of the second draw for example if we're asking about let's say the probability of getting an ace the likelihood of getting an ace on the second draw depends upon whether or not we got an ace on the first draw so these are not independent but if two things are are independent then we can go ahead and use that multiplication idea so for example in your drawer you have six ten pairs of socks six of which are white and seven tshirts three of which are white if you randomly reach in and pull out a pair of socks and tshirt what's the probability both are white well the probability of white socks is let's say there's six white out of ten pairs right the probability of a white tee is let's hear three of them are white out of ten so the probability that both of them will be white will simply be the likelihood of the first being white times the second likely to the second one being white because the probabilities oops that's not right it's not out of ten it's out of seven right three out of seven sorry so the probability of both of them being white is this and we can simply multiply them because the probability of pulling out of the tshirt being white is not dependent upon the probability of the socks being white so we can go ahead and multiply that that's 18 out of 70 in other words there are 70 possible outcomes and eighteen of them involve both of them being white and of course we can reduce that fraction down to nine thirty fifths so that's the probability that both of them are white later on we'll look at how to deal with a non independent case now suppose we flipped a coin and roll to die and we wanted to know the probability of getting a head on the coin or or a six on the die now this is different than the problems we did earlier where we're looking at the probability of both of the end so of course the easiest way to do this for a simple problem like this is to say well how many of these outcomes these twelve outcomes how many of them have a head on the coin or a six on the die and there are one two three four five six seven outcomes that have either a head on the coin or a six on the die now could we have figure that out another way by sort of looking at the two events separately so what's the probability of getting a head on the getting a head on the coin so the probability of a head is onehalf or in twelfths right that'd be six out of 12 six of the outcomes have a head what's the probability of rolling a six on the die well there's two well that's one out of six right one roll out of the six possibilities on the die in terms of our total outcomes here two of them have a six on the die and notice if we hadn't just added these two up we get too many outcomes we'd get eight out of twelve why because we're counting one two three four five six for the heads and we're counting one two for the sixes but we've counted this value twice so in order to compensate for that we're going to have to subtract out that value that we double counted so we're going to subtract out the probability of heads and a six and there's 1 out of 12 there and if we combine that 6 plus 2 is 8 minus 1 is 7 twelfths and we get the same answer that we had there so our basic rule here is that the probability of A or B is the probability of a plus the probability of B minus the probability of both and we again we got a subtract out that and so though we're not double counting it let's see if we can use this now supposed to draw one card from a standard deck what's the probability that we get a queen or a king well the probability of a queen is let's here there's four of them out of the 52 cards in the deck what's the probability of a king 4 out of 52 what's the probability that the card is both a queen and the king well none is impossible for a card to be both a king and a queen it's one of the other and so the probability of queen or king here is just 4 out of 52 plus 4 out of 52 minus 0 is 8 out of 52 is our is our probability there now the reason that we ended up with this 0 here is because these two events the probability of getting a queen and probability of getting a king are mutually exclusive there's no overlaps and so in this simple case in this case of mutually exclusive it turns out that the probability of the probability of getting a queen or king is just the probabilities of the queen plus the probability of the king again because they're mutually exclusive and there's no overlap now that's not always the case of course so in our second problem here what's the probability that we get a red card or a king the probability of a red card is oh let's here there are Oh half the deck is red so that would be 26 out of the 52 what's the probability of a king that's 4 out of 52 what's the probability that's red and the King now here we do have overlap because there are two red kings and so for the probability of red or a king we're gonna have to add up the two individual probabilities and then subtract away the overlap which leaves us with a probability of 28 out of 52 for the probability of getting a red card or a king so here we have a table showing the number of number of survey subjects who have received and not received a speeding ticket in the last year and the color of their car and we're gonna find the probability that if we were to choose one of these people our random that they've have had that the person has a red car and got a speeding ticket and then secondly has a red car or got a speeding ticket now if you look at the table here there's basically four different categories here we got speeding ticket and red car no speeding ticket and red car speeding ticket not Reds no speeding ticket not red and then we have totals for each of the columns totals for each the rows and then the total total of everyone surveyed so for the first question where it says has a red car and got a speeding ticket how many people got both had a red car and got a speeding ticket in this case there are 15 of them so 15 people both had a red car and got a speeding ticket out of how many total people out of 665 total people so that's the probability of having a red car and getting a speeding ticket now these are dependent events and so we really have to work off the table it would not be correct to find the probability of having a red car the probability of speeding and just multiply them now how about for the next one so here we're trying to find the probability that they have a red car or getting us got getting a speeding ticket now there's a couple ways that we can go about this the easiest honestly is to just add up all the possibilities so let's see here these people got a speeding ticket these people have a red car so we have a total of 45 plus 15 plus 135 is a hundred and ninety five total people who either got a speeding ticket or up a red car and so our probability would be 195 out of 665 now we could have also done this the sort of longer formulaic way and said well let's look at the probability that they got a speeding ticket that's 60 out of 665 and let's add to that the probability that they have a red car that's 150 out of 665 and then subtract the duplicates right subtract those that have both right our end probability here and if we do this we'll get exactly the same answer but wouldn't we have a small table like this it's probably just as easy to just count up the possibilities so what is the probability that two cards drawn at random from a deck of cards will both be aces now you note the probability of pulling one card in getting an ace is four out of out of 52 and so it's really tempting to say the probability of getting an ace and another ace is 4 out of 52 times 4 out of 52 right using our multiplication rule now unfortunately this is not gonna work why because these two events are not independent because after we pull out our first card so after we pull out the first ace it changes the not only the number of cards in the deck but also the number of aces in the deck right so now for our first draw write probability of ace on the first draw is still 4 out of 52 but for our second draw this is going to change this is now the probability of an ace on the second draw second draw given and we use this little bar for a given given an ace on the first draw and this is what's called a conditional probability so here how many possible outcomes how many possible cards can one draw on the second draw there's only 51 cards left and so it's going to be out of 51 now how many aces are left there are only three aces left now and so our probability ends up being 12 out of 26 52 or in other words 1 out of 221 rather than the 4 out of 52 times 4 out of 52 ok so again this is called a conditional probability now let's look at another case let's find the probability that a die rolled shows a 6 and given so again this is a conditional probability given that a flip coin shows ahead so this is the probability of a six on a die given a head on a coin now in this case we need to ask ourselves are these two events independent and the answer is yes so in other words this in this particular case it doesn't matter why doesn't it matter because these are independent events so the probability of rolling on us the six on a die is the same as always it is one out of six let's look at one more case now let's look at a table of values here these are the speeding ticket folks so let's find the probability that they have a ticket given that they have a red car so now we're given that they have a red car so we know right away that we're only talking about these hundred and fifty people so we're only talking about out of these hundred and fifty people now out of those 150 people with a red car so we already know that how many of them got a ticket well 15 of them got a ticket so that's 15 out of 150 or one out of ten or ten percent of people with a red car also had a ticket now different question now is what's the probability that they have a red car given that they have a ticket now this is not the same thing because now we're limiting ourselves to these 60 people so we have 60 people total who got a speeding ticket how many of them had a red car 15 of them had a red car so 15 out of 60 or 1/4 or 25% of people with a speeding ticket had red cars right so these are the conditional probabilities and it is important to notice here that the order here does matter it does matter which piece of information you're being given so let's look at a couple more conditional probabilities suppose you pull two cards out of the deck what is the probability that both are spades so the probability that the first card is a spade well let's see there are 13 spades out of the 52 cards in the deck so that's the probability that the first card is a spade so now what's the probability that the second card ii is a spade given that the first was a spade right in order for both cards to come out spades the first is gonna have to be a spade and the second and so what's the probability that the second one is a spade given the first was well in this case given that the first one was a spade then there's now one less card in the deck and one less Spade in the deck and so 12 out of 51 is the probability of the second one being a spade so if I want to find the probability that both are a spade I'm going to use the conditional probability version of the multiplication rule which says that the probability of the first event happening times the probability of the second event happening given that the first happened so in this case 13 out of 52 for the first Spade 12 out of 51 for the second Spade gives us a probability oopsey gives us a probability of a hundred and fiftysix out of 26 52 or one out of 17 or about 5.9 percent probability of getting two spades and when we draw two cards so get another one if you draw two cards from the deck what's the probability that you'll get an ace of diamonds and a black card now this one's a little trickier because the events are different so there's two different ways that this could happen either we get it that we do the probability of the ace of diamonds then the black card and then separately we need to consider the probability of getting a black card than the ace of diamonds because it's sort of hard to think about putting those two cases together so here we're gonna find the probability of the ace of diamonds then the probability of getting a black card given that we already pulled the ace of diamonds and then for this case we're going to find the probability of getting a black card then for the second event the probability of getting the ace of diamonds given that we already pulled a black card okay so first case here what's the probability that we pull the ace of diamonds well there's only one of them out of the deck so one out of 52 how many ways could we pull a black card and given that the first card was the ace of diamonds now given that the first card is an ace of diamonds there's one less card in the deck but diamonds are not black so there are still 26 black cards in the deck so our probability here ends up being 26 out of 26 52 is one out of a hundred and two here the probability of getting a black card on the first draw is 26 out of 52 here the probability of getting a ace of diamonds given that the first card is black if the first card was black then there's one less card in the deck but we know the ace of diamonds is still there so there's still one of them and so we end up with 26 out of 26 52 is one out of 102 so in both cases the probability is 1 out of 102 these are two different ways that the same result could happen so we need to add these together and so the total probability of getting an ace of diamonds and a black card is the sum of those two out of 102 or 1 out of 51 so this looks at sort of an important application of conditional probability so here we have a home pregnancy test that was given to women and then pregnancy is verified through blood tests and then this table shows the home test result up here and then whether they're actually pregnant or not down here so we're going to compute two different conditional probabilities first the probability that they're not pregnant given that they have a positive test result so this is you know you have a positive test result and then what's the likelihood that you're not actually pregnant so so here we're given that we have a positive test results who are limiting ourselves to these 75 people and of them five are not pregnant and that's about 6.7% so there's about a 6.7% chance here that there that this person is not actually pregnant given that they have a positive test result now let's look at the next one which is the probability of a positive test result given that they're not pregnant so here's somebody who's here's all nineteen people who are not pregnant and out of them five of them have a positive test result so this is what's called a false positive this is when somebody who doesn't actually have the condition gets a positive result anyway so it's an accidental positive result and you'll notice that this probability is substantially different this is about twenty six point three percent here yeah and it's it's really interesting to note these results are quite different so even though this test has a 26 percent false positive rate that means 26 percent of the time it it will tell somebody who's not pregnant that they're pregnant that that is not the same probability as once you actually have a positive test result whether or not it is whether or not you're actually pregnant now admittedly this data is made up but this basic idea does hold true for for for test all pretty much all tests of disease and it all depends upon the incidence rate how likely it is that you actually have either the disease or in this case the likelihood of being pregnant so now we're gonna look at a sort of more complicated testing situation and this one fouls doctors up so let's look we'll walk our way through this so suppose a certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.1 percent that is it afflicts 0.1 percent of the population in other words the probability of having this disease is 0.001 0.1% so a test has been devised to detect this disease the test does not produce false negatives in other words anyone who has the disease will test positive for it in other words and the probability of a positive test given that the person has the disease is 100% they will definitely test positive if they have the disease but the false positive rate is is 5% this means that the probability that somebody will test positive if they do not have the disease yeah is is is 5% so 5% of people will test positive even if they don't have the disease so now if we randomly pick someone what's the probability that they actually have the disease in other words what is the probability of the disease given that they test positive and as we saw before this is not going to be the same as the probability of a positive test given the disease so let's work our way through this so here I've broken down all that information again so to think about this most simply let's imagine that we have 1,000 people now because the disease incidence rate is 0.001 or one out of a thousand then that tells me that out of these 1,000 people one of them will have the disease and 999 of them will not have the disease on average now if they have the disease we know that they're gonna test positive and so this one person is gonna have a positive test result there are no people who have the disease and test negative but now out of these 99 people who do not have the disease we know that 5% of them are gonna test positive so 5% of our 999 people is 49.95 or about 50 so let's just call it 50 so 50 people are going to test positive who don't actually have the disease and the other 949 aren't going to test negative so that leaves us 51 people testing positive for the disease now remember what we're really interested in is what is the probability that you have the disease given that you tested positive well now we have enough information to figure that out how many people tested positive 51 how many of them actually have the disease 1 and that comes out to about 1.96 percent so remarkably even though this test has no false negatives and only a 5% false positives rate if you test positive for this disease there's only a 2% chance that you actually have it and that should be surprising but that is the result of our probability so now we have another disease that has an incidence rate of two percent the false negative rate is 10 percent false positive rate is 1 percent so let's compute the probability that a person who test positive actually has the disease so there's two ways to do this let's start with the easy way and that is to create a table so now we got positive negative disease no disease now for simplicity let's imagine that we have some nice round number of people let's go with something pretty big like 10,000 just to make sure our numbers work out okay so now our we have a 2% incidence rate so out of these 10,000 people 2 percent of them or 200 of them will have the disease meanwhile the other 98 hundred of them will will not have the disease now we have a false negative rate of 10% and so that tells us that that tells us that 10% of these 200 are going to incorrectly test negative meanwhile the other 180 will correctly test positive meanwhile we have a false positive rate of 1% and that means that out of our people who don't have the disease 1% of them or 98 of them are going to test are going to test positive meanwhile the other let's see 8 9702 of them are going to correctly test negative so notice these these here and these 98 people here and these 20 people here are our errors right so altogether we have 278 people testing positive so if we wanted to find out the probability that they have the disease given that they test positive then then we have 278 people who tested positive of them 180 have the disease and that comes out to be about sixty four point seven percent so sixtyfour about 65 percent of people who test positive in this case will actually have the disease now there's another way we could go about this problem and that would be using using Bayes rule so let's take a look at what doesn't see what that would look like so Bayes rule says that the probability of a given B is the probability of a time's the probability of B given a over the probability of a time's the probability of B given a plus the probability of a compliment times the probability of B given a compliment now in terms of our disease that would look like look like this so now we could start filling in all this information so what is the probability that they have the disease well that is in this case two percent right it's a two percent incidence rate what's the probability that they have a get if a positive test given that they have the disease well there's a false negative rate of 10% which means there's a 90 percent chance that they'll test positive given they have the disease down here we got let's here again probability of disease probability of positive given disease probability of no disease would be 98 percent and then what's the probability that we test positive given that we don't have the disease that's our 1 percent false positive rate and if we compute all that out turns out to be 0.01 8 over 0.02 78 which comes out to the same 64.7% we came up use with using our nice little table so this Bayes formula has its advantages but for a lot of cases working off the table like we did first is going to be a simpler approach so now we're going to talk about counting for a while and you're probably thinking counting I don't want to count but we're gonna talk about counting really large amounts of stuff so here's an example suppose a restaurant you have three choices of appetizer five choices for a main course and you're allowed to choose exactly one from each category how many different meal options do you have well there's several ways to approach this one way that I like is called a decision tree so you start out here and say okay I have how many choices for my appetizer I have three choices so I have one two three different directions I could go I could go soup direction salad direction and then breadsticks direction then at each of those points I now have to decide them on a main course and for each of those I now have one two three four five choices emanating out and so how many total choices do I have now you'll notice that there are five choices here another five here another five there we end up with a total of fifteen choices and that is how many meal options we have now you may have noticed that where does that 15 come from well it's three choices for our first decision times the five choices for the second decision because we have three live these little branch Eitri things so we end up multiplying those choices together and that's exactly how this works so let's look at another one suppose there's 21 novels and 18 volumes of poetry that you own a reading list for an English course how many different ways can you select one novel in one volume of poetry well there's 21 choices for the novel eighteen choices for the poetry we multiply those together and that gives us a total of three hundred and seventy eight possibilities so another one now suppose that we're at a restaurant and we have three choices for the appetizer we have five choices for a main course and now to choices for dessert if we're allowed to choose exactly one of them one of each of them then we would have 3 times 5 times 2 equals 30 choices now it is important to note here that this is assuming that we actually pick one from each of them that we're not gonna you know not pick one of them okay one more so suppose quiz consists of three true or false questions how many ways can student answer this well so we have three questions each of those questions has two choices right so the first question all right so three questions the first question there are two choices for the second question there are two choices but the third question there are two choices and so altogether there are two to the third or eight different ways that a student could answer a three question true or false quiz so how many different ways could the letters of the word math be rearranged to form a fourlevel letter code word so we have four letters and we can ask ourselves how many choices do we have for the first letter well we have four choices how many choices do we have for the second letter now we're rearranging the letters so we can't use any letters twice and so there would be only be three choices for the second letter how about for the third letter two choices and then there's only one choice for the last letter because there's only one letter left and so we'd end up with 24 different code words that we could create out of the letters of math now notice that's different than saying you slit letters from math and you can have repeats if we could have repeats we'd have 4 times 4 times 4 times 4 or 4 to the fourth different code words and that'd be 256 different code words we have a lot more if we allowed repeats but here we're not allowing repeats we end up with 24 possibilities now this sort of computation is done so often that we come up with a shorthand notation for it called the factorial factorial in general the idea is that n factorial means that number times one last times one last times keep on going down all the way down to till you get down to one so it's multiplying numbers in decreasing order until you get down to one so this is 4 factorial 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 okay let's look at another problem how many ways can five different door prizes be distributed among five people so we've got 5 people and we got 5 different prizes so how many choices are there for the first person 5 how about for the second 4 3 2 and 1 or in other words 5 factorial and if you can find the factorial button on your calculator and will make your life a little easier here then hitting multiplication 5 times 4 times 2 times 1 but either way we come up with 120 different ways to distribute those prizes now let's look at a slightly different one charity event is attended by 25 people and we're gonna give away three prizes and there are different prizes no person receives more than one prize how many different ways can we distribute these so we only have three prizes and the order does matter because it matters who gets the hundred dollar prize versus who gets the twentyfive dollar prize so how many choices do we have for the first prize for the hundred dollar prize well there's 25 people so there are 25 possibilities for that prize how about for the second one for the 25 dollar prize well there's no repeats right no person receives more than one prize so there's only 24 people now and for the last prize for the $10.00 prize there's 23 people and so we end up with 13 thousand eight hundred different ways that these prizes could be awarded and you'll notice that this looks awfully similar to our our factorial that we were doing earlier but a but truncated right where we don't go all the way down to one and it turns out that there is a nice way to represent this which will look about look at in a minute let's look at one more first dumb eight sprinters have made it to the Olympic finals 100 meters how many different ways could the gold silver and bronze be awarded or how many different possible outcomes are there basically so similar to the last problem there are eight possibilities for the first place for the gold there are seven possibilities for the for the silver and there are six possibilities for the bronze that gives us a total of 336 different orderings or 336 different outcomes so I have nine paintings in room to display only four of them on the wall the time how many different ways could I do this so I'm going to presume that ordering matters here in other words I care what order the pictures are in and and that I can't use the same picture twice so we certainly could answer this question by saying how many choices do I have for the first one the second one the third one and the fourth one and we could certainly do that and end up with our answer 3000 24 different orderings now to make that we're gonna try to come up with another way to do this and this thing is what we call a permutation a permutation is a rearrangement of items where order matters and we're selecting from a group the usual notation is n P R where n is the is the number of items number of choices and then R is is how many pick how many we're gonna pick the number we pick so R is the number we pick from our total number of choices so this problem here would be 9 P 4 we have nine choices and from them we're going to pick four of them and we're going to look at all the possible orderings or permutations of them now there's several ways to calculate a permutation one is the way we just did it which is to just multiply 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 another way to do it is to use factorials you'll notice that this looks a lot like 9 factorial which is 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 but it's not as much right we don't have the 5 4 3 2 1 so we can get rid of that by dividing by 5 factorial which will then reduce all of those away leaving us with just the 9 8 7 six so if we have NPR it turns out we can compute that using factorials as n factorial over n minus R factorial so in this case when we had 9p and four that would be nine factorial over nine minus four factorial or other words nine factorial over five factorial as we just saw here the other way you can do this is if your calculator happens is to have a permutations feature on it you can ask it what is 9p for and it should spit out this 3024 answer for you now this is kind of handy when we're looking at larger numbers so let's look at one more example how many ways can a four person Executive Committee president vice president secretary treasurer be selected from a sixteen member Board of Directors so in this case there are sixteen choices sixteen members on the board of director and from them we're looking at permutations of size four so we're looking at orderings again order matters here because it matters who's chosen as president and vice president versus the other way around so 16 people we're picking four of them order matters 16 P 4 now again we could either compute this as 16 times 15 times 14 times 13 or 16 factorial over 16 minus 4 is 12 factorial or we could pull out our calculators either way we're gonna end up with 40 2680 and different executive committees so a charity event now is intended by 25 people at which through 3 $50 gift certificates are going to be given away as door prizes how many ways could we do this now this is notice that all three prizes aren't the same here so we could go with the basic idea of saying okay we have three people there are twentyfive possibilities for the first prize 24 for the second and twentythird for the third or in other words there are thirteen thousand eight hundred different ways that we could pick three people from our crowd now let's imagine now that we have three people a we're just gonna call them a B and C for simplicity so if a B and C were picked first second third that would be one of these 13,800 possibilities but if B was picking picked first then a then C then this would also be one of those six one one of those 13,800 possibilities but really these are the same outcome in fact there are six different outcomes there are six different outcomes that are all really the same outcome because the order doesn't matter here it doesn't matter who's chosen first second or third so in order to compensate for this we end up needing to take our thirteen thousand eight hundred different permutations and divide it by six to come up with twenty three thousand what are called combinations combinations are what we call it when order doesn't matter in other words it doesn't matter who is chosen first now the way we can sort of generalize this is the idea of the total number of permutations so NP are divided by well what did where did this six come from that's the number of different ways of orderings three people so in this it was three people three people three possibilities for the first person 2 for the second one for the third that is 3 P 3 or in general this would be R P R and this is how we define a combination or how we calculate combinations and we denote combinations with n oops n see R so this is from N and choices we're choosing this R of them but the order doesn't matter so we're going to count ABC the same thing as BAC this is one way to compute it the other way is using factorials and that looks something like this so now let's look at let's look at an example so a group of four students is to be chosen from a 35 member class to represent the class on the Student Council now order doesn't matter here because they're all just representatives so in this case from our 35 students we're going to choose four of them but the order doesn't matter so this is a combination so using our sort of first version here the permutation version we're thinking from 35 from 35 how many different ways can I pick four people if order didn't matter and then I'm going to divide that by the number of ways of ordering four people so this says from 35 people I need to pick four so I got 35 choices for the first person 34 for the second 33 for the third and 32 for this last choice and I'm gonna divide that by the different ways of ordering for people so then I have four choices for the first person third three for the second two for the third and one for the last so this is the total number of ways of choosing four people if order matters divided by the number of ways of ordering them which takes care of the order it gives me 50 mm 60 different combinations so the Senate Appropriations Committee consists of 29 members and suppose that it was 15 Republicans and 14 Democrats the defense subcommittee which is a smaller group of that consists of 19 members 10 Republicans and 9 Democrats how many different ways could the members of the defense subcommittee be chosen from among the 29 senators on the Appropriations Committee so you can see that for thee we're going to look separately at the Republicans or the Democrats here okay so forward the Republicans we have 15 Republicans overall and 10 of them are going to end up on this subcommittee so from the 15 Republicans we're going to pick 10 of them in order does not matter so we're going to use combinations and that turns out to be three thousand and three for our Democrats we have 14 Democrats altogether nine of them are going to end up on our committee so 14 choose nine and that comes out to be two thousand and two different ways but then how about for our entire committee here so so now imagine that we let's put all the Republican choices on little slips of red paper so we've got three thousand and three pieces of red paper and then we put all 2002 Democratic choices on little slips of blue paper and threw them all in a hat how many ways could we pick one red slip in one blue slip well there's three thousand and three possibilities for choosing a Republican contingent and there's two thousand and two choices for choosing a Democratic contingent and so we've simply multiply those together just like our restaurant choices and we end up with a very large number over six million different ways of electing the members of the subcommittee so now we're going to compute some probabilities using counting so a four digit PIN number is selected what is the probability that there are no repeated digits so that would mean that all the digits have to be different so if I was going to pick four digits where they're all the digits are different I would have ten choices for the first digit assuming we're allowing values 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 we have 10 choices for the first digit 9 for the second digit because we're not gonna allow repeats 8 for the third digit and 7 for the fourth digit or in other words that's 10 P 4 right is 5040 different pins pins with no repeats now in order to compute the probability we're gonna have to find the total number of of pin numbers including repeats so all pins so if we consider all pins that including allowing repeats how many choices are there for the first number 10 how many for the second number also 10 also 10 also 10 because we allow repeats so there's no exclusions so that's 10 to the 4th and 10 to the 4th is 10,000 so there's 10,000 total pins out of those five thousand and 40 of them have no repeats so we got 5,000 and 40 out of 10,000 or about 50.4% of pins have no repeated digits so now let's look at a lottery problem so in a certain States lottery we got 48 different numbers and six of them are drawn at random and if you have and you the player gets to choose six numbers and if there are six numbers match they win a million dollars in the order doesn't matter in this particular lotto so we're not playing Powerball and let's see if we let's see if we can find the probability that that will win we win that million dollar prize if we purchase a single ticket so the first thing we didn't know is how many possible outcomes are there so from 48 different numbers there we're going to choose six of them and order here does not matter which is why we're using combinations and so we end up with 12 million two hundred seventyone thousand five hundred and twelve different six number outcomes now if you have one ticket then you have one outcome and so your probability of winning is 1 out of 12 million 271 512 which is a really really small number and so that's the probability of winning the main prize now oftentimes there's a second prize and in this case it's a thousand dollars if you can match five of the numbers now there are still 48 choose 612 million two hundred seventyone thousand five hundred and twelve different outcomes but now we need to figure out how many of those involve us winning matching five of the numbers now in order for that to happen from our six numbers on the card we're going to have to match five of them so how many different ways can we pick five matching numbers out of our six that would be six choose 5 which is six now we also have to consider that you know how many different ways could we not pick the the last number so from the 42 non winning numbers we need to pick one of them to be on our card and so that is is 42 so our final probability of winning is going to be there are that many 42 times six is 252 different ways that we can match five numbers and not match the six out of our 48 choose six out of our 12 million two hundred 1512 total outcomes and that gives us a you know marginally higher probability of winning though it's still pretty small so now suppose we randomly draw five cards from a deck what's our probability of getting exactly one ace now in order for us to get exactly one ace then from the four aces in the deck we need to be able to we need to pick one of them one of them needs to be in our in our hand in our set of five cards and there are four different ways that that can happen and then from the remaining 48 non aces we're gonna need four of them because in order for us to have exactly one ace we need to have one ace and for non aces so this is one ace and then this is picking for non aces now remember we're doing counting here so we're figuring out how many ways how many ways can I pick four you know one ace out of four and how many ways can I pick four non ace is out of 48 and there are a fair number of ways of doing that so our final probability our probability of exactly one ace is 4 choose 1 times 48 choose 4 again that's the picking one ace and for non aces out of all the ways of picking 5 cards that's 52 cards I choose 5 of them all together that comes out to be about 770 8320 out of all 2.5 million hands and it turns out to be about 0.2 9 9 or in other words there's about a 30% chance that out of 5 cards one of them exactly one of them will be an ace so now what if we wanted to find the probability out of a 5 card hand of executive executive very similar to the last one here out of the four aces on the day in the deck we're gonna need to pick two of them and out of all the non aces in the deck we're gonna need to pick three of them this time right so we have a total of five cards two aces three non aces and that's out of all the ways that you can choose five cards out of 52 and that turns out to be about 0.03 99 so there's about a 4% chance that out of five fivecard hand that you'll have exactly two aces a pair of aces in that hand so now we're gonna look at sort of a notorious problem in probability called the birthday problem so suppose that three people are in a room what's the probability that there's at least one shared birthday among these three people so now this this idea of at least one is kind of tricky so the way we're going to tackle this is the idea that the probability of at least one is easiest to think about through its complement so what is the complement of at least one shared birthday well the opposite of at least one shared birthday is no shared birthdays and so that's the probability we're going to try to find so let's see in order for them to there to not be any shared birthdays then each person is going to have to have a different birthday so for the first person in our group how many different how many different ways could we pick their birthday well they would have 365 choices we're gonna ignore lis peers here out of the 365 choices for the fourth e for the year now the second person in order for them to have a different birthday then out of the 365 days in the year they're gonna have to have a different one so they only get 364 choices and then our third person in the room is only gonna get 363 choices and so this is the probability of no shared birthday the probability that each person has a different birthday and and this turns out to be you'll notice that this first fraction is actually equal to one so this turns out to be about 0.99 1/8 again that's the probability of no shared birthday so the probability of at least one shared birthday is 1 minus that is you know pretty small it's about you know 0.8% not too big let's make our group a little bit bigger now so suppose we've got five people in the room so then the probability of at least one shared birthday again will be one minus the probability of no shared birthdays in order for that to happen again the first person gets you know can pick any day they want they aren't of course actually picking but you know what I mean they that there's 365 four different ways that this person can have a birthday and not conflict with that person and we do this for each of our people in the room and that would give us our our answer turns out to be about at 2.7 percent but we could simplify this a lot if we notice that the denominator here is 365 to the to thee we see that this is just 365 p5 so through from 365 there's how many ways can we pick five or how many orderings are there and in the bottom we've got 365 multiplied together five times that's 365 to the fifth power and computing that we get exactly the same answer that we had there now this is really cool because now if we ask the question what happens if we put 30 people in the room what's the probability of at least one shared birthday we can answer this pretty easily because we can say well two one minus the probability of no shared birthdays no shared birthdays mean from 365 possible birthdays we're gonna put how many ways could we pick 30 different birthdays out of from 365 how many different ways could there be 30 birthdays including repeats right and that's the same idea as our numerator and denominator there and computing that that comes out to be 0.7 zero six or 70 point six percent which is probably a little bit surprising that means out of 30 people in a room there's a 70% chance that there's at least one shared birthday in that room so when the game roulette a wheel was 38 spaces 18 red 18 black and 2 green is spun in one of the possible bets of player bets $1 on a single number if that number is spot on the wheeled and they received 36 dollars our original dollar plus 35 additional otherwise they lose their dollar so on average how much money should a player expect to win or lose if they play this game repeatedly repeatedly so for winning let's first talk about the probability of winning if they bet on any one number their probability of winning the probability of winning is 1 out of 38 so then for losing the probability of losing is the complement of that so there are 37 ways that a player can lose now to compute this idea of expected value and we're talking here about sort of your expectations then we can compute that expected value by multiplying the probability of winning times the value of winning and adding to it or subtracting from it the probability of losing times the value of losing so for winning the value of winning is a positive $35 so we get $35 more than we started with if we win and the probability of that happening is 1 out of 38 we're going to add to that the the other outcome which is losing and that outcome has a value of negative $1 in other words when we lose $1 and that happens with probability 37 out of 38 if we add those together we end up with 35 over 38 minus 37 over 38 is negative 2 over 38 or in other words about negative 0.053 so in other words if you were to play this game you should expect on average to lose about five cents per spin so in other words if you were gonna if you played for hours and played for thousands of spins on average you should expect to lose about five cents per spin sometimes you win sometimes you lose but on average you'll lose about five cents per spin so now let's look at a lottery problem so we looked at this lottery before and we figured out that the probability of matching all six numbers was one out of the all the possible choices so it was one out of the ways of picking six numbers out of 48 which was 1 out of 12 million ish and the probability of matching 5 was let's see here we had two from six numbers we had to pick five and then from the 42 non winning numbers we had to pick one and we ended up with a probability of about 250 two out of again that 12 million there so now let's think about values so this thing has a value of positive 1 million dollars this had this outcome has a value of positive $1000 and then of course there's a probability of not matching anything which is going to happen the rest of the time right so 1 minus the 250 3 out of 12 million 270 1512 and this has a value of negative $1 because it costs $1 to play so to compute our probability here we're going to multiply we're going to multiply this probability times this outcome this probability times this outcome and this probability times this outcome and add those up and when we do we get a value of about negative zero point eight nine eight in other words if you play lotto a whole bunch you should expect on average to lose about ninety cents per ticket of course most people lose their dollar and only a few people are actually win anything but on average you should expect to lose ninety cents okay a 40 year old man in the US has about a 0.242 percent risk of dying during the next year an insurance company charges $275 for life insurance policy that pays $100,000 death benefit in other words it pays that if the person dies during the year otherwise they they you know just get their $275 and the person doesn't get anything so what is the expected value for the person who's buying the insurance so so so there's two possible outcomes here and so outcome number one of course is is is dying and outcome number two is not dying and each of those has an Associated probability the probability of of dying presumably is 0.002 for two and the probability of not dying then is the complement of that which is nine nine seven five eight right one minus the public bility of dying and then the value of the outcome well the value of dying and I know we're talking we're purely talking monetary values here of course not emotional values or life value purely monetary then for the person buying the insurance and their family the value of to them is the hundred thousand dollars they get the two hundred seventy five dollars they had to pay for the policy so they have a positive net benefit of ninety nine thousand seven hundred twenty five if they don't die then the financial value of the insurance is a negative two hundred and seventy five dollars so that our expected value then this expected value is the probability multiplied by the value of the outcome plus our other probability times the value of its outcome and altogether that gives us a negative value of 33 in other words if we had a bunch of people you know thousands of people who are you know for you ten thousands of 40 year old men then on average the men will have lost 33 dollars now it's not surprising that this value is negative that's the only way the insurance company can afford to offer policies I mean not 33 dollars on average is is what's paying for their expenses and you know profits and everything else that goes into a business for the agents and everything else and really the reason that they can afford to pay out that occasional hundred thousand dollar benefit is because of all the people who don't die who balance it out so you know even though this has a negative expected value to the purchaser there's certainly security you know knowing that your family's cared for benefits to having insurance which might make that expense worthwhile
