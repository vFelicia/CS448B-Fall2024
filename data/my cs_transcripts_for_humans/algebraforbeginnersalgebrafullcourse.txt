00:01 - this video is about the exponent rules
00:03 - rules that govern expressions like two
00:05 - to the fifth
00:07 - or x to the n
00:09 - two to the fifth is just shorthand for
00:12 - two times two times two times two times
00:15 - 2
00:16 - written 5 times
00:18 - and similarly x to the n is just x
00:21 - multiplied by itself
00:23 - n times
00:25 - when we write these expressions
00:27 - the number on the bottom
00:29 - that's being multiplied by itself is
00:31 - called the base
00:33 - and the number at the top
00:35 - telling us how many times we're
00:36 - multiplying the base by itself is called
00:39 - the exponent
00:41 - sometimes the exponent is also called
00:43 - the power
00:46 - the product rule says that if i have x
00:50 - to the power of n
00:51 - times x to the power of m
00:54 - that's the same thing as x to the n plus
00:57 - m power
00:59 - in other words when i multiply two
01:02 - expressions
01:03 - with the same base
01:06 - then i can add their exponents
01:11 - for example if i have 2 cubed times 2 to
01:14 - the 4th that's equal to 2 to the 7th
01:18 - and that makes sense because 2 cubed
01:21 - times 2 to the 4th means i multiply 2 by
01:24 - itself 3 times
01:26 - and then i multiply that by 2 multiplied
01:29 - by itself 4 times and in the end i have
01:33 - 2 multiplied by itself 7 times
01:37 - which is 2 to the 7th
01:40 - i'm just adding up the number of times
01:43 - that's multiplied in each piece to get
01:44 - the number of times that's multiplied
01:46 - total
01:48 - the quotient rule says that if i have x
01:50 - to the n power divided by x to the m
01:53 - power
01:54 - that's equal to x to the n minus m power
01:58 - in other words if i divide two
02:00 - expressions with the same base
02:04 - then i can subtract their exponents
02:08 - for example 3 to the 6th divided by 3
02:12 - squared is going to be 3 to the 6 minus
02:15 - 2 or 3 to the 4th and this makes sense
02:19 - because 3 to the 6 means i multiply 3 by
02:22 - itself 6 times and then i divide that by
02:26 - 3 multiplied by itself twice
02:29 - so when i cancel out 3s i have 4 3s left
02:33 - notice that i have to subtract the
02:36 - number of threes on the bottom from the
02:38 - number of threes at the top to get my
02:40 - number of threes remaining that's why i
02:43 - subtract my exponents
02:46 - the power rule tells us if i have x to
02:48 - the n power raised to the m power that's
02:52 - the same thing as x to the n times m
02:55 - power
02:56 - in other words when i raise a power to a
03:00 - power
03:02 - i get to multiply the exponents
03:05 - for example
03:06 - 5 to the 4th
03:08 - cubed
03:09 - is equal to 5 to the 4 times 3 or 5 to
03:13 - the 12th and this makes sense because 5
03:16 - to the 4th cubed can be thought of as
03:18 - five to the fourth times five to the
03:20 - fourth times five to the fourth
03:23 - expanding this out some more that's five
03:26 - times five times five times five
03:28 - times
03:30 - the same thing
03:32 - times the same thing again
03:35 - so i have three
03:37 - groups of four fives which is a total of
03:41 - three times four or twelve fives
03:47 - the next rule involves what happens when
03:49 - i raise a number or a variable to the
03:52 - zeroth power
03:54 - it turns out that anything to the zeroth
03:56 - power is equal to one
03:59 - usually this is just taken as a
04:00 - definition but here's why it makes sense
04:03 - to me
04:04 - if you have something like 2 cubed
04:07 - divided by 2 cubed
04:10 - well certainly that has to equal 1
04:12 - anything divided by itself is just one
04:14 - but
04:16 - using the quotient rule
04:19 - we know that this is the same thing as 2
04:21 - to the 3 minus 3 because when we divide
04:25 - two things with the same base we get to
04:28 - subtract their exponents
04:30 - therefore this is the same thing as 2 to
04:33 - the 0 so 2 to the 0 has to equal 1 in
04:36 - order to make it work with the quotient
04:39 - rule
04:40 - and the same argument shows that
04:42 - anything to the zero power has to be
04:44 - equal to one
04:46 - what happens when we take something to a
04:49 - negative power
04:51 - x to the n
04:53 - is equal to
04:54 - one over x to the n
04:57 - again most people just take this as a
04:59 - definition of a negative exponent but
05:01 - here's why it makes sense
05:04 - if i take something like 5 to the 7th
05:07 - times 5 to the negative 7th then by the
05:10 - product rule this has to equal 5 to the
05:13 - 7 plus negative 7
05:15 - which is 5 to the 0 and we just said
05:17 - that that is equal to 1.
05:21 - now i have the equation of 5 to the
05:23 - seventh times five to the negative
05:24 - seventh equals one if i divide both
05:27 - sides by five to the seventh i get that
05:29 - five to the negative seventh has to
05:32 - equal one over five to the seventh
05:34 - so that's where this rule about negative
05:36 - exponents comes from it has to be true
05:38 - in order to be consistent with the
05:40 - product rule
05:42 - finally let's look at fractional
05:44 - exponents what does an expression like x
05:47 - to the 1 over n really mean
05:50 - well it means the nth root of x
05:54 - for example 64 to the one-third power
05:58 - means the cube root of 64 which happens
06:00 - to be 4.
06:02 - and 9 to the one-half means the square
06:05 - root of 9 which is usually written
06:07 - without that little superscript up there
06:10 - now the square root of 9 is just 3.
06:14 - fractional exponents also make sense for
06:17 - example if i have
06:19 - five to the one third
06:22 - and i
06:23 - cube that
06:24 - then by the power rule that's equal to
06:27 - five to the one-third times three
06:30 - which is just five to the one or five
06:34 - so in other words
06:35 - five to the one third
06:37 - is the number
06:39 - that when you cube it you get five
06:41 - and that's exactly what's meant by the
06:43 - cube root of five the cube root of five
06:46 - is also a number that when you cube it
06:49 - you get 5.
06:51 - the next rule tells us we can distribute
06:53 - an exponent over a product
06:56 - in other words if we have a product x
06:59 - times y all raised to the nth power
07:02 - that's equal to x to the n times y to
07:05 - the n
07:06 - for example
07:08 - 5 times 7
07:11 - all raised to the third power is equal
07:13 - to 5 cubed times 7 cubed and this makes
07:17 - sense because 5 times 7 all raised to
07:20 - the cubed power
07:22 - can be expanded as 5 times 7
07:25 - times 5 times 7 times 5 times 7
07:29 - but if i rearrange the order of
07:30 - multiplication this is the same thing as
07:33 - five times five times five times seven
07:35 - times seven times seven
07:37 - or five cubed times seven cubed
07:41 - similarly we could distribute an
07:42 - exponent of our quotient
07:44 - if we have the quotient x over y
07:47 - all raised to the n power that's the
07:49 - same as x to the n
07:51 - over y to the n
07:53 - for example
07:54 - 2 7 raised to the fifth power is the
07:57 - same thing as two to the fifth
07:59 - over seven to the fifth
08:01 - this makes sense
08:03 - because two-sevenths to the fifth can be
08:05 - expanded
08:07 - as two-sevenths multiply by itself five
08:10 - times
08:12 - which can be written rewritten as two
08:14 - multiplied by itself five times divided
08:17 - by seven multiplied by itself five times
08:20 - and that's two to the fifth
08:22 - over seven to the fifth
08:24 - as wanted
08:27 - we've seen that we can distribute an
08:29 - exponent
08:31 - over multiplication and division
08:35 - but be careful because we cannot
08:38 - distribute an exponent
08:41 - over addition
08:43 - or subtraction for example
08:46 - a plus b to the n
08:48 - is not generally equal to a to the n
08:51 - plus b to the n
08:53 - a minus b to the n is not generally
08:56 - equal to a to the n minus b to the n
08:59 - and if you're not sure just try an
09:01 - example with numbers
09:04 - for example
09:05 - 2 plus
09:06 - 3 squared is not the same thing as 2
09:10 - squared plus 3 squared and 2 minus 3
09:14 - squared is definitely not equal to 2
09:17 - squared minus 3 squared
09:20 - in this video i gave eight exponent
09:22 - rules which i'll list again here
09:25 - there's the product rule
09:27 - the quotient rule
09:29 - the power rule
09:31 - the zero exponent
09:34 - the negative exponent
09:36 - the fractional exponent
09:39 - and the the two rules involving
09:41 - distributing exponents
09:44 - across multiplication
09:46 - and division
09:50 - in another video i'll use these exponent
09:52 - rules to rewrite and simplify
09:55 - expressions involving exponents
09:58 - in this video i'll work out some
10:00 - examples of simplifying expressions
10:02 - using exponent rules
10:05 - i'll start by reviewing the exponent
10:06 - rules
10:08 - the product rule says that when you
10:10 - multiply two expressions with the same
10:12 - base
10:13 - you add the exponents
10:16 - the quotient rule says that when you
10:18 - divide two expressions with the same
10:20 - base you subtract the exponents
10:23 - the power rule
10:24 - says that when you take a power to a
10:27 - power
10:28 - you multiply the exponents
10:31 - the power of zero rule says that
10:33 - anything to the zero power is one as
10:36 - long as the base is not zero
10:39 - since zero to the zero is undefined it
10:42 - doesn't make sense
10:44 - negative exponents
10:46 - to evaluate x to the minus n
10:48 - we take the reciprocal one over x to the
10:51 - n
10:53 - to evaluate a fractional exponent like x
10:55 - to the one over n
10:57 - we take the nth root of x
11:01 - we can distribute an exponent over a
11:04 - product
11:05 - a times b to the n is equal to a to the
11:08 - n times b to the n
11:10 - and we can distribute an exponent
11:12 - over a quotient a over b to the n
11:16 - is a to the n over b to the n
11:19 - in the rest of this video we'll use
11:21 - these exponent rules to simplify
11:24 - expressions
11:26 - for our first example we want to
11:28 - simplify 3 times x to the minus 2
11:31 - divided by x to the fourth
11:33 - there's several possible ways to proceed
11:36 - for example we could use the negative
11:38 - exponent rule to write x to the minus 2
11:42 - as 1 over x squared
11:44 - all that gets divided by x to the fourth
11:46 - still
11:48 - notice that we only take the reciprocal
11:50 - of the x squared the 3 stays where it is
11:54 - and that's because the exponent of
11:55 - negative 2 only applies to the x not to
11:58 - the 3.
12:00 - now if we think of 3 as 3 over 1
12:04 - we have a product of two fractions in
12:07 - our numerator
12:08 - and so we evaluate that by
12:11 - taking the product of the numerators
12:14 - times the product of the denominators
12:16 - which is 3 over x squared all divided by
12:20 - x to the fourth
12:22 - i can think of
12:23 - x to the fourth as x to the fourth over
12:26 - one
12:27 - so now i have a fraction over a fraction
12:30 - which i can evaluate by multiplying by
12:33 - the reciprocal
12:35 - that simplifies to three times 1 divided
12:38 - by x squared times x to the 4th which is
12:41 - 3
12:42 - over x to the 6th
12:44 - using the product rule since x squared
12:48 - times x to the 4th is equal to x to the
12:50 - 2 plus 4 or x to the 6th
12:55 - an alternate way of solving this problem
12:58 - is to start by using the quotient rule
13:03 - i can rewrite this as 3 times x to the
13:06 - minus 2 over x to the 4th
13:09 - and by the quotient rule that's 3 times
13:11 - x to the minus 2 minus 4
13:14 - or 3 times x to the minus 6.
13:18 - now using the negative exponent rule
13:21 - x to the minus six is one over x to the
13:24 - sixth
13:24 - and this product of fractions simplifies
13:27 - to three over x to the sixth
13:30 - the same answer i got
13:32 - before the second problem can be solved
13:35 - in similar ways
13:37 - please pause the video and try it before
13:39 - going on
13:42 - one way to simplify would be to use the
13:44 - negative exponent rule first and rewrite
13:48 - y to the minus 5 as one over y to the
13:51 - fifth
13:52 - thinking of this as a fraction
13:56 - divided by a fraction
13:58 - i can multiply by the reciprocal
14:03 - and get
14:04 - 4 y cubed y to the fifth over 1
14:09 - by the product rule the numerator here
14:12 - is for y to the 8th and so my final
14:15 - answer is just 4y to the 8th
14:19 - alternatively i could decide to use the
14:22 - quotient rule first
14:25 - as in the previous problem i can write
14:27 - this as 4 y cubed minus
14:31 - negative 5 by the quotient rule
14:33 - and so that's 4 y to the 8th as before
14:39 - i'd like to show you one more method to
14:40 - solve these two problems kind of a
14:42 - shortcut method before we go on
14:45 - that shortcut relies on the principle
14:47 - that a negative exponent in the
14:49 - numerator
14:51 - corresponds to a positive exponent in
14:54 - the denominator
14:56 - for example the x to the negative 2 in
14:58 - the numerator here
15:00 - after some manipulations became an x to
15:03 - the positive 2 in the denominator
15:07 - furthermore
15:08 - a negative exponent in the denominator
15:12 - is equivalent to a positive exponent in
15:15 - the numerator
15:18 - that's what happened when we had the y
15:20 - to the negative 5 in the denominator and
15:23 - translated into a y to the positive 5 in
15:26 - the numerator
15:28 - sometimes people like to talk about this
15:29 - principle by saying that
15:32 - you can pass a factor
15:36 - across
15:37 - the fraction bar
15:41 - by switching the sign of the exponent
15:44 - that is making a positive exponent
15:47 - negative or a negative exponent positive
15:51 - let's see how this principle gives us a
15:53 - shortcut for solving these two problems
15:57 - in the first problem 3x to the minus 2
16:00 - over x to the 4
16:02 - we can move the negative exponent in the
16:05 - numerator and make it a positive
16:07 - exponent of the denominator
16:09 - so we get 3 over
16:10 - x to the 4 plus 2 or x to the 6th
16:16 - in the second example
16:18 - 4y cubed over y to the minus 5
16:22 - we can change the y to the minus 5 in
16:25 - the denominator into a y to the 5 in the
16:28 - numerator and get our final answer of 4
16:31 - y to the 3 plus 5 or 8.
16:36 - we'll use this principle again in the
16:38 - next problems
16:40 - in this example notice that i have i
16:42 - have y's in the numerator and in the
16:44 - denominator and also z's in the
16:47 - numerator and in the denominator
16:49 - in order to simplify i'm going to try to
16:51 - get all my y's either in the numerator
16:53 - or the denominator and similarly for the
16:55 - z's
16:57 - since i have more y's in the denominator
17:00 - let me move this y to the 3 downstairs
17:03 - and make it a y to the negative 3.
17:06 - i'm using the principle here
17:08 - that
17:09 - a positive
17:10 - exponent in the numerator corresponds to
17:13 - a negative exponent in the denominator
17:17 - now since i have a positive exponent on
17:18 - z in the numerator and a negative
17:20 - exponent of the denominator and i want
17:22 - to get rid of negative exponents
17:25 - i'm going to pass
17:26 - the z's to the numerator as e to the
17:29 - minus 2 in the denominator becomes a z
17:32 - to the plus 2 in the numerator
17:37 - notice that my number 7 doesn't move and
17:40 - when i do any of these manipulations
17:42 - because it doesn't have an exponent and
17:44 - the exponent of negative 2 for example
17:46 - only applies to the z not to the 7.
17:50 - now that i've got all my z's in the
17:51 - numerator and all my y's in the
17:53 - denominator
17:54 - it's easy to clean this up using the
17:56 - product rule
17:58 - and i have my simplified expression
18:01 - in this last example we have a
18:03 - complicated expression raised to a
18:05 - fractional power
18:07 - i'm going to start by simplifying the
18:08 - expression inside the parentheses
18:12 - i can bring all my y's downstairs and
18:14 - all my x's upstairs and get rid of
18:17 - negative exponents at the same time
18:20 - in other words i can rewrite this as 25
18:24 - x to the fourth
18:26 - i'll bring the y to the minus 5
18:29 - downstairs and make it y to the fifth on
18:31 - the denominator
18:32 - bring the x to the minus 6 upstairs and
18:36 - make it x to the 6th the numerator and
18:38 - then i still have the y cubed on the
18:41 - denominator
18:42 - all that's raised to the three halves
18:44 - power
18:45 - using the product rule i can rewrite the
18:48 - expression on the inside of the
18:49 - parentheses as 25x to the tenth over y
18:53 - to the eighth
18:56 - recall that we're allowed to distribute
18:59 - an exponent across a product
19:02 - or across a quotient
19:08 - when i distribute my three-halves power
19:12 - i get 25 to the three-halves times x to
19:16 - the tenth to the three-halves divided by
19:19 - y to the eighth to the three-halves
19:24 - the power rule tells me when i have a
19:26 - power to a power i get to multiply the
19:28 - exponents
19:30 - so i can rewrite this as 25 to the three
19:33 - halves times x to the 10 times three
19:36 - halves over y to the eighth times three
19:39 - halves in other words twenty five to the
19:42 - three halves times x to the fifteenth
19:45 - over y to the twelfth
19:47 - finally i need to rewrite twenty five to
19:50 - the three halves
19:52 - since three halves can be thought of as
19:55 - three times one-half
19:57 - or as one-half times three
20:00 - i can write 25 to the three-halves as 25
20:04 - to the 3 times one-half or as 25 to the
20:08 - one-half times three
20:11 - well using the power rule in reverse i
20:13 - can think of this as 25 cubed to the
20:16 - one-half or as 25 to the one-half cubed
20:21 - since when i take a power to a power i
20:23 - multiply the exponents
20:27 - 25 cubed to the one-half might be hard
20:30 - to evaluate since 25 cubed is a huge
20:32 - number
20:33 - but 25 to the one-half
20:36 - is just the square root of 25 so i have
20:39 - the square root of 25 cubed or 5 cubed
20:43 - which is 125.
20:46 - therefore my original expression is
20:48 - going to be 125 x to the 15
20:51 - over y to the 12th
20:55 - in this video we use the exponent rules
20:58 - to simplify complicated expressions
21:02 - this video goes through a few tricks for
21:04 - simplifying expressions with radicals in
21:06 - them
21:07 - recall that this notation
21:09 - means the nth root of x so this notation
21:13 - here means the cube root of eight
21:15 - the number that when you cube it you get
21:18 - eight that number would be two
21:22 - when we write the root sign without a
21:24 - little number that just means the square
21:27 - root so the two is implied
21:31 - in this case the square root of 25 is 5
21:34 - since 5 squared is 25.
21:38 - let's start by reviewing some rules for
21:40 - radical expressions
21:42 - first if we have the radical of a
21:44 - product we can rewrite that as the
21:47 - product of two radicals
21:51 - for example
21:52 - the square root
21:54 - of 9 times 16 is the same thing as the
21:58 - square root of 9 times the square root
22:00 - of 16.
22:01 - you can check that both of these
22:03 - evaluate to 12.
22:05 - similarly it's possible to distribute a
22:08 - radical sign across
22:10 - division
22:11 - the radical of a divided by b is the
22:14 - same thing as the radical of a divided
22:17 - by the radical of b
22:20 - for example the cube root of 64 over
22:24 - eight is the same thing as the cube root
22:26 - of 64
22:28 - over the cube root of 8 and you can
22:30 - check that both of these evaluate to 2.
22:35 - you have to be a little bit careful
22:36 - though because it's not ok to distribute
22:40 - a radical sign across addition in
22:43 - general the nth root of a plus b is not
22:46 - equal to the nth root of a plus the nth
22:49 - root of b
22:50 - and similarly it's not okay to
22:53 - distribute a radical across subtraction
22:57 - if you're ever in doubt you can always
22:59 - check with simple examples for example
23:02 - the square root of 1 plus 1 is not the
23:06 - same thing as a square root of one plus
23:08 - a squared of one
23:10 - the right side evaluates to one plus one
23:13 - or two and the left side is square root
23:15 - of two and the irrational number
23:18 - the second expression
23:20 - to show that that fails i don't think it
23:22 - will work to use the square root of one
23:24 - minus one it'll actually hold in that
23:26 - case but i can show it's false by using
23:29 - say the square root of two minus one
23:31 - which does not equal the square root of
23:33 - two minus the square root of one
23:36 - you might notice that these rules for
23:38 - radicals the ones that hold and the ones
23:40 - that don't hold
23:42 - remind you of rules for exponents and
23:45 - that's no coincidence
23:47 - because radicals can be written in terms
23:49 - of exponents for example if we look at
23:51 - the first rule we could rewrite this
23:54 - the nth root of a times b
23:57 - is the same thing as the one over nth
24:00 - power
24:01 - and by
24:02 - exponent rules i can distribute an
24:04 - exponent
24:06 - across multiplication and so this
24:09 - radical rule can be restated
24:12 - completely in terms of an exponent rule
24:15 - similarly the second rule
24:18 - can be restated in terms of exponents as
24:21 - a over b to the one over n is equal to a
24:24 - to the one over n divided by b to the
24:27 - one over n
24:28 - we can use the relationship between
24:30 - radicals and exponents to rewrite a to
24:33 - the m over n
24:35 - a to the m over n is the same thing as a
24:38 - to the m
24:40 - with the nth root taken it's also the
24:43 - same thing as the nth root of a all
24:46 - taken to the nth power
24:48 - to see why that's true
24:50 - think about exponent rules
24:52 - so a to the m over n is the same thing
24:54 - as a to the m
24:56 - taken to the one over nth power
24:58 - that's because when we take a power to a
25:00 - power we multiply exponents and m
25:04 - times one over n is equal to m over n
25:09 - but a one over nth power is the same
25:11 - thing as an nth root and therefore this
25:14 - expression
25:15 - is the same thing
25:17 - as
25:18 - this expression and that proves the
25:20 - first equivalence
25:22 - the second equivalence can be proved
25:24 - similarly by writing a to the m over n
25:27 - as
25:29 - a to the
25:30 - 1 over n times m
25:33 - again this is works because when i take
25:36 - the power to the power i multiply
25:38 - exponents 1 over n times m is the same
25:41 - thing as m over n
25:43 - but now
25:45 - these two expressions are the same
25:47 - because the one over nth power is the
25:49 - same as the nth root
25:51 - one mnemonic for remembering these
25:53 - relationships is flower over root
25:57 - so flower is like power and root is like
26:00 - root so that tells us we can write a
26:02 - fractional exponent the m becomes the
26:04 - power and the n becomes the root
26:07 - in either of these two orders now let's
26:10 - use these rules and some examples
26:12 - if we want to compute
26:14 - 25 to the negative three-halves power
26:18 - well first i'll use my exponent rule to
26:20 - rewrite that negative exponent as 1 over
26:24 - 25 to the 3 half's power
26:28 - next i'll use the power over root
26:30 - mnemonic to rewrite this as
26:33 - 25 to the third power square rooted or
26:38 - as
26:39 - 25 square rooted to the third power
26:44 - i wrote the twos there for the square
26:46 - root for emphasis but most of the time
26:48 - people will omit this and just write the
26:50 - square root without a little number
26:52 - there
26:54 - now i could use either of these two
26:56 - equivalent expressions to continue but
26:59 - i'd rather use this one because it's
27:00 - easier to compute without a calculator
27:02 - the square root of 25 is just 5.
27:05 - five cubed is a hundred twenty-five so
27:08 - my answer is one over a hundred
27:10 - twenty-five
27:12 - if i tried to compute the cube of
27:14 - twenty-five first i'd get a huge number
27:17 - in general it's usually easier to
27:19 - compute the root
27:20 - before the power when you're working
27:22 - without a calculator
27:25 - now let's do an example simplifying a
27:28 - more complicated expression with with
27:30 - exponents in it
27:31 - i'm going to take the square root of all
27:33 - this stuff
27:34 - and since i don't really like negative
27:36 - exponents i'm first going to rewrite
27:38 - this as the square root of 60x squared y
27:42 - to the sixth over z to the 11th so i'll
27:45 - i'll change that negative exponent to a
27:47 - positive exponent by moving this this
27:49 - factor to the denominator
27:52 - now when you're asked to simplify a
27:54 - radical expression that generally means
27:56 - to pull as much as possible
27:59 - out of the radical sign
28:01 - to pull things out of the square root
28:03 - sign i'm going to factor my numbers and
28:06 - try to rewrite everything in terms of
28:09 - squares as much as possible since the
28:11 - square root of a square those two
28:14 - operations undo each other so i'll show
28:16 - you what i mean first i'll factor 60
28:20 - so 60 is going to be 2 squared times 3
28:23 - times 5
28:25 - and
28:26 - i'll just copy everything over for now
28:31 - now i'll break things up into squares as
28:33 - much as possible so i've got a 2 squared
28:36 - times 3 times 5. i've already got an x
28:38 - squared i'll write the y to the 6 as y
28:40 - squared times y squared times y squared
28:43 - and i'll write the z to the 11th as z
28:45 - squared times z squared
28:47 - i guess 5 times 1 2 3 4 5 times 1 extra
28:52 - z
28:53 - that should add up to z to the 11th if i
28:55 - add all those exponents together
28:59 - now i know that i can distribute my
29:01 - radical sign across multiplication and
29:03 - division so i'll write this with a
29:05 - zillion different radicals here
29:09 - and every time i see the square root of
29:12 - something squared i can just
29:15 - cancel those square roots and the
29:16 - squares out and get what's what's left
29:18 - here so so after doing that cancellation
29:21 - i get 2 times the square root of 3 times
29:24 - 5
29:25 - times x times y times y times y
29:29 - over
29:31 - z times itself i guess 5 times
29:34 - times the square root of z
29:36 - and now i can clean that up with
29:37 - exponents i'll write that as the square
29:40 - root of 15
29:41 - i guess 2 times the square root of 15
29:44 - times x times y cubed over
29:48 - z to the fifth the square root of z
29:53 - i'm going to leave this example as is
29:56 - but sometimes people prefer to rewrite
29:58 - radical expressions without
30:00 - radical signs in the denominator that's
30:02 - called rationalizing the denominator i
30:04 - won't do it here but i'll show you how
30:06 - to do it in the next example
30:08 - this example asks us to rationalize the
30:10 - denominator that means to rewrite as an
30:14 - equivalent expression without radical
30:17 - signs in the denominator
30:20 - to get rid of the radical sign in the
30:23 - denominator i want to multiply my
30:25 - denominator by
30:27 - square root of x
30:29 - but i can't just multiply the
30:30 - denominator willy-nilly by something
30:32 - unless i multiply the numerator by the
30:34 - same thing so that i'm just multiplying
30:36 - my expression by 1 in a fancy form and i
30:39 - don't change the value of my expression
30:42 - now if i just multiply together
30:44 - numerators 3x squared of x
30:46 - and multiply denominators
30:50 - square root of x times square root of x
30:51 - is the square root of x
30:53 - squared square root of x squared is just
30:56 - x
30:58 - now i can cancel my x's from the
31:00 - numerator and denominator and my final
31:02 - answer is 3 times the square root of x i
31:05 - rationalized my denominator and the
31:07 - process got a nicer looking expression
31:11 - in this video we went over the rules for
31:14 - radicals
31:15 - and we simplified some radical
31:16 - expressions by working with fractional
31:19 - exponents
31:21 - pulling things out of the radical sign
31:24 - and rationalizing the denominator
31:29 - hi class happy snow day since class is
31:32 - cancelled i'm putting together this
31:34 - video with some additional examples on
31:36 - simplifying radicals that i would have
31:38 - done in class i hope this will help you
31:39 - complete your assignment that's due
31:41 - tonight
31:43 - let's start with this example asking us
31:45 - to simplify the product of two radicals
31:48 - i could simplify each radical separately
31:50 - and then multiply things together but i
31:52 - think it'll save me trouble if i
31:54 - multiply first and then simplify
31:56 - so
31:58 - i'm going to multiply these together
32:02 - since the product
32:04 - of two radicals is the radical of the
32:07 - product
32:08 - assuming everything's positive
32:11 - i can rewrite my expression as the
32:13 - square root of let's see 5 times 15
32:16 - that's going to be 75
32:19 - x times x cubed that's x to the fourth
32:22 - because when i multiply two expressions
32:25 - i add the exponents and y to the seventh
32:28 - times y cubed that's going to be y to
32:30 - the tenth since 7 plus 3 is 10.
32:33 - now i want to simplify by pulling as
32:35 - much out of the square root sign as i
32:36 - can
32:37 - if 75 were a perfect square i could just
32:40 - take the square root of it but since
32:41 - it's not i'm going to factor it so 75
32:44 - let's see that's 25 times 3 and 25 is 5
32:48 - times 5 so i can write that as 5 squared
32:51 - times 3.
32:53 - now i can
32:54 - write my square root let's see so that's
32:56 - 5 squared times 3 times x to the 4th
32:59 - times y to the 10th
33:01 - now since i know that the square root of
33:03 - anything squared is just that original
33:06 - thing assuming variables are positive
33:10 - uh i can maybe rewrite this as by
33:13 - breaking everything up into a bunch of
33:15 - squares so let's see i already have a
33:17 - square here there's no hope for the 3.
33:19 - the x to the 4th i can write that as x
33:21 - squared times x squared right that makes
33:23 - four x's and y to the tenth i'm going to
33:26 - need
33:27 - five y squareds to get 10 y's out of
33:30 - that one two three y squared y squared
33:34 - now splitting up the square root back
33:36 - into
33:37 - a product of a bunch of square roots
33:40 - every time i see the square root of
33:42 - something squared i just replace it with
33:43 - the thing so that's five i still have
33:45 - the square root of three that gives me x
33:47 - x y y y y y
33:51 - and i can rewrite that as 5 square root
33:53 - of 3 times x squared y to the 5th so
33:56 - that's one way to simplify this
33:59 - expression
34:00 - alternatively i could complete this
34:02 - problem a little bit faster the
34:04 - following way
34:06 - i could go ahead and
34:08 - break up my 5 squared times 3 times x to
34:11 - the fourth times y to the 10th
34:13 - i'm going to break that up go ahead and
34:15 - break that out as a product of square
34:17 - roots
34:20 - now
34:21 - the square root of 5 squared is
34:22 - certainly 5 square root of 3 stays the
34:24 - same square root of x to the fourth is
34:27 - going to be x squared there are a couple
34:29 - ways to see that one way is the square
34:31 - root of x fourth that's x to the fourth
34:34 - to the one half power since square roots
34:37 - are the same as half powers and now i
34:39 - can multiply my exponents to get my x
34:42 - squared
34:43 - or alternatively i can think of that
34:45 - because the square root of x to the
34:46 - fourth that's the square root of x
34:48 - squared squared since i take a power to
34:50 - a power i multiply my exponents square
34:52 - root of something squared is just the
34:54 - thing so that's x squared
34:56 - similarly the square root of y to the
34:58 - tenth that's going to be y to the fifth
35:00 - notice i'm just taking half of the
35:02 - exponent and you can see that the same
35:04 - way
35:05 - that's because
35:07 - if i do
35:08 - the square root of
35:10 - y to the tenth that's the same thing as
35:12 - y to the tenth to the one-half which is
35:16 - y to the 10 times one-half or y to the
35:19 - fifth
35:20 - or alternatively you can think of this
35:22 - as the square root of y to the tenth is
35:24 - the square root of y to the fifth
35:26 - squared which is y to the fifth so if it
35:30 - weren't for all that little side work i
35:32 - did that would have this would have been
35:33 - a faster way to get to the same answer
35:36 - as before
35:39 - the next few examples have to do with
35:41 - rewriting expressions by rationalizing
35:44 - denominators please pause the video for
35:46 - a moment and see if you can decide if
35:48 - these two expressions represent the same
35:50 - thing or different things
35:53 - in fact they represent the same thing
35:56 - and we can see that that we can
35:58 - transform a to look like b
36:01 - by doing something called rationalizing
36:02 - the denominator trying to get all the
36:04 - square roots out of the denominator at
36:06 - the expense of maybe putting some more
36:07 - squares in the numerator so to
36:09 - rationalize the denominator in this case
36:11 - since there's just that one
36:12 - that one piece with square roots in it
36:15 - i'm going to multiply
36:17 - both the top and the bottom by the
36:19 - square root of y the thing that has the
36:21 - square root around it
36:22 - if i multiply the bottom by the square
36:24 - root of y
36:26 - i have to multiply the top also so i
36:28 - won't change the value of my expression
36:30 - this way i'm just multiplying by 1 in a
36:32 - fancy form
36:33 - now when i multiply fractions i multiply
36:36 - the numerator
36:38 - and i multiply the denominator
36:40 - well let's see the square root of y
36:41 - times the square root of y that's the
36:43 - square root of y squared which is the
36:45 - same thing as
36:49 - just
36:50 - y
36:52 - so i can bring my square roots together
36:54 - and get 3 square root of xy over 5y
36:57 - which is exactly the second expression
37:00 - here are two even crazier expressions
37:02 - the last one is especially crazy again
37:05 - try to decide if these two represent the
37:07 - same thing or represent a different
37:09 - thing
37:10 - kind of surprisingly they actually
37:12 - represent the same thing still
37:15 - and we can transform one to two
37:18 - by again rationalizing the denominator
37:20 - this time we're going to use something
37:21 - called the conjugate and that's because
37:23 - we have
37:24 - a difference in this case of two
37:26 - expressions one of which has a square
37:28 - root in it so
37:29 - when i have the difference of two
37:31 - expressions
37:32 - one of which with a square root in it
37:34 - i find the conjugate
37:37 - by taking the sum of those two
37:39 - expressions
37:40 - if instead i had had the sum of two
37:43 - expressions then the conjugate would be
37:45 - the difference
37:47 - okay so i'm going to multiply the top
37:49 - and the bottom
37:51 - by this conjugate of of the denominator
37:56 - so let me move down here and rewrite
37:58 - with more space
37:59 - once again i have to multiply the
38:01 - numerator and the denominator by the
38:03 - same thing so that i'm not changing the
38:04 - value of my expression i'm just
38:05 - multiplying by 1 in a fancy form
38:08 - now let's look at what happens in the
38:09 - denominator first i have to multiply 3
38:12 - by 3 3 by the square root of a
38:14 - negative square root of a by 3 and
38:16 - negative square root of a by square root
38:18 - of a
38:19 - so that's going to give me 3 times 3 is
38:20 - 9
38:22 - plus 3 squared of a minus 3 squared of a
38:27 - minus square root of a squared
38:30 - so in a moment that i'll simplify to
38:33 - these things cancel so that'll be 9
38:36 - minus square root of a squared is a
38:38 - notice how i've gotten rid of the square
38:40 - roots of the denominator which is why
38:42 - it's called rationalizing the
38:43 - denominator we get rid of the the i
38:46 - don't know the irrational numbers um the
38:49 - radical signs okay let's look at the
38:50 - numerator so again we have to we're
38:52 - going to have four terms this times this
38:54 - this times that b times 3 b times square
38:57 - root of a
38:58 - that gives us 15 a
39:01 - plus 5 a squared of a
39:05 - plus 3b
39:07 - plus b squared of a
39:09 - now that's starting to look similar to
39:12 - this expression here and in fact it we
39:14 - can see that it's exactly the same thing
39:16 - by turning our radicals into exponents
39:18 - so let's see we still have the 15a
39:22 - uh this is the same thing as 5a times a
39:25 - to the one-half we've still got the 3b
39:28 - and we've got b times a to the one-half
39:31 - and now
39:32 - let's see a times a to the one-half here
39:35 - that's really i can add my exponents so
39:37 - that's going to be
39:39 - 5 a to the 1 plus one-half is
39:41 - three-halves
39:43 - three b
39:44 - b a to the one-half and that's exactly
39:47 - what i have
39:49 - in this expression just in a slightly
39:51 - different order
39:52 - so these really are the same
39:54 - kind of weird
39:57 - please pause the video and try your hand
39:59 - at rationalizing the denominator of this
40:01 - expression
40:03 - since we have a sum of two expressions
40:05 - in the denominator we want to multiply
40:08 - the numerator and denominator by the
40:10 - conjugate of the denominator
40:12 - so that's square root of a minus 1.
40:16 - now when i multiply out the numerator
40:18 - we'll get four terms square root of a
40:20 - squared
40:22 - let's see minus the square root of a
40:27 - and now we have 7 times the square root
40:29 - of a
40:32 - and finally
40:34 - 7 times minus 1 that's minus 7. on the
40:37 - denominator we get the square root of a
40:38 - squared
40:40 - minus the square root of a plus the
40:42 - square root of a minus 1. notice how
40:45 - the square root things cancel
40:48 - just like before that's the whole magic
40:50 - of using the conjugate it makes those
40:51 - square roots cancel out so now on the
40:54 - numerator square root of a squared is a
40:56 - minus the square root of a plus seven
40:58 - squared of a that's a net of six squared
41:00 - of a's
41:01 - minus seven
41:03 - and then on the denominator we have a
41:05 - minus 1. we've gotten rid of the square
41:07 - roots on the denominator rationalize the
41:09 - denominator i'm happy leaving the square
41:12 - root in the numerator but if you want to
41:14 - you can change it to an exponent instead
41:16 - it's really up to you
41:18 - that's all the examples i have today i
41:19 - hope you enjoy the snow which hasn't
41:21 - started yet for me
41:23 - and um please do spend some time to
41:25 - finish your alex objective if you
41:27 - haven't done it already
41:29 - goodbye
41:31 - this video goes over some common methods
41:33 - of factoring recall that factoring an
41:35 - expression means to write it as a
41:37 - product so we could factor the number 30
41:40 - by writing it as 6 times 5
41:43 - or we could factor it more completely by
41:45 - writing it as 2 times three times five
41:49 - as another example we could factor the
41:52 - expression x squared plus five x plus
41:55 - six
41:56 - by writing it as x plus two
41:59 - times x plus 3.
42:02 - in this video i'll go over how i get
42:04 - from here to here how i know how to do
42:07 - the factoring
42:08 - but for right now i just want to review
42:11 - how i can go backwards how i can check
42:13 - that the factoring is correct and that's
42:15 - just by multiplying out or distributing
42:18 - if i distribute x plus 2 times x plus 3
42:22 - then i multiply x by x that gives me x
42:24 - squared x times 3 gives me 3x 2 times x
42:28 - gives me 2x and 2 times 3 gives me 6. so
42:32 - that simplifies to x squared plus 5x
42:35 - plus 6 which checks out with what i
42:37 - started with
42:38 - so you can think of factoring as the
42:41 - opposite of distributing out and you can
42:44 - always check your factoring by
42:45 - distributing or multiplying out
42:48 - a bit of terminology when i think of an
42:50 - expression as a sum
42:52 - of a bunch of things then the things i
42:54 - sum up are called the terms
42:57 - but if i think of the same expression as
43:00 - a product of things
43:02 - then the things that i multiply together
43:04 - are called factors
43:08 - now let's get started on techniques of
43:09 - factoring
43:11 - when i have to factor something i always
43:13 - like to start by pulling out the
43:15 - greatest common factor the greatest
43:17 - common factor means the largest thing
43:20 - that divides each of the terms
43:23 - in this first example the largest thing
43:25 - that divides both 15 and 25x is 5.
43:31 - so the gcf
43:33 - is 5.
43:34 - so i pull the 5 out and then i divide
43:37 - each of the terms by that number and so
43:40 - i get 3
43:41 - plus 5x
43:45 - pause the video for a moment and see if
43:47 - you can find the greatest common factor
43:49 - of x squared y and y squared x cubed
43:53 - the biggest thing that divides both x
43:55 - squared y and y squared x cubed is going
43:58 - to be x squared times y
44:03 - one way to find this is to look for
44:05 - the power of x that's smallest in each
44:08 - of these terms so that's x squared and
44:10 - the power of y that's smallest in each
44:12 - of these terms is just y to the 1 or y
44:16 - now if i
44:17 - factor out the x squared y from each of
44:20 - the terms that's like dividing each term
44:23 - by x squared y if i divide the first
44:25 - term by x squared y i just get 1. if i
44:28 - divide the second term by x squared y
44:31 - i'm going to be left with an x and a y
44:35 - i'll write this out on the side just to
44:37 - make it more clear
44:38 - y squared x cubed over x squared y
44:42 - that's like
44:43 - two y's on the and three x's on the top
44:46 - and two x's and a y on the bottom so i'm
44:50 - left with just an x and a y so i'll
44:54 - write the x y here and i factored my
44:57 - expression
44:58 - as always i can check my answer by
45:01 - multiplying out so if i multiply out
45:05 - my factored expression i get x squared y
45:08 - as the first term and the second term i
45:10 - get x they're now let's see three x's
45:13 - multiplied together and two y's
45:15 - multiplied together and that checks out
45:17 - with what i started with
45:20 - the next technique of factoring i'd like
45:22 - to go over is factoring by grouping
45:25 - in this example notice that we have four
45:27 - terms
45:28 - factoring by grouping is a handy method
45:30 - to look at if you have four terms in
45:34 - your expression you need to factor
45:37 - in order to factor by grouping i'm first
45:39 - going to factor out the greatest common
45:41 - factor of the first two terms and then
45:43 - separately factor out the greatest
45:45 - common factor of the last two terms
45:47 - the greatest common factor of x cubed
45:50 - and 3x squared is x squared
45:53 - so i factor out the x squared and i get
45:56 - x plus 3
45:58 - and now the greatest common factor of 4x
46:00 - and 12 is just 4
46:03 - so i factor out the 4 from those two
46:06 - terms
46:08 - notice that the factor of x plus 3 now
46:11 - appears in
46:13 - both pieces
46:15 - so i can factor out the greatest common
46:16 - factor of x plus 3 i think i'll factor
46:19 - it out on the left side instead of the
46:21 - right and now i have an x squared from
46:25 - this first piece
46:27 - and i have a 4
46:30 - from this second piece
46:32 - and that completes my factoring by
46:34 - grouping
46:36 - you might wonder if we could factor
46:37 - further by factoring the expression x
46:40 - squared plus 4. but in fact as we'll see
46:42 - later this expression which is a sum of
46:45 - two squares x squared plus two squared
46:48 - does not factor any further over the
46:50 - integers
46:52 - next we'll do some factoring of
46:54 - quadratics a quadratic is an expression
46:57 - with a squared term
47:00 - just a term with x in it and a constant
47:02 - term with no x's in it
47:05 - i'd like to factor this expression
47:08 - as
47:09 - a product of x plus or minus some number
47:13 - times x plus or minus some other number
47:17 - the key idea is that if i can find those
47:19 - two numbers
47:21 - then if i were to distribute out this
47:22 - expression those two numbers would have
47:24 - to multiply to give me my constant term
47:26 - of 8
47:27 - and
47:28 - these two numbers would end up having to
47:31 - add to give me my negative 6 because
47:34 - when i multiply out this number will be
47:36 - a coefficient of x and this number will
47:38 - be also another coefficient of x they'll
47:40 - add together to the negative 6.
47:44 - so if i look at all the pairs of numbers
47:46 - that multiply together to give me 8
47:49 - so that could be
47:51 - one and eight
47:52 - two and four
47:54 - four and two but that's really the same
47:56 - things i had before and that's sort of
47:58 - the same thing i had before i i
48:00 - shouldn't forget the negatives i could
48:01 - have negative one negative eight or i
48:04 - could have negative 2 negative 4 those
48:06 - also multiply together to give me 8.
48:08 - now i just have to find see if there's a
48:11 - a pair of these numbers that add to
48:14 - negative 6 and it's not hard to see that
48:17 - these ones will work so now i can write
48:20 - out my factoring as that would be x
48:23 - minus 2 times x minus 4. and it's always
48:28 - a good idea to check by multiplying out
48:31 - i'm going to get x squared minus 4x
48:34 - minus 2x plus 8 and that works out to
48:38 - just what i want
48:40 - now this second example's a bit more
48:42 - complicated because now my
48:44 - leading coefficient my coefficient of x
48:46 - squared is not just one it's it's the
48:48 - number 10.
48:50 - now there are lots of different methods
48:52 - for approaching a problem like this and
48:53 - i'm just going to show you one method my
48:55 - favorite method that uses factoring by
48:58 - grouping but but to start out i'm going
48:59 - to multiply my coefficient of x squared
49:02 - by my constant term so i'm multiplying
49:04 - 10 by negative 6. that gives me negative
49:08 - 60.
49:09 - and i'll also take my coefficient of x
49:11 - the number 11
49:13 - and write that down here now i'm going
49:15 - to look for two numbers that multiply to
49:18 - give me negative 60 and add to give me
49:21 - 11.
49:22 - you might notice that this is exactly
49:24 - what we were doing in the previous
49:26 - problem it's just here we didn't have to
49:28 - multiply the coefficient of x squared by
49:30 - 8 because the coefficient of x squared
49:32 - was just 1.
49:33 - so to find the two numbers that multiply
49:36 - to negative 60 and add to 11 you might
49:39 - just be able to come up with them
49:41 - in your head thinking about it but if
49:42 - not you can figure it out pretty
49:44 - systematically by writing out all the
49:47 - factors pairs of factors that multiply
49:50 - to negative 60. so i can start with
49:52 - negative 1 and 60 negative 2 and 30
49:56 - negative 3 and 20 and keep going like
49:59 - this until i have found
50:01 - factors that actually add together to
50:05 - give me the number 11 and and now that i
50:07 - look at it i've already found them
50:10 - 5 15 minus 4
50:13 - gives me 11. so i don't have to continue
50:15 - with my chart of factors
50:18 - now once i've found those factors i
50:20 - write out my expression
50:22 - 10x squared but instead of writing 11x i
50:25 - write negative 4x plus 15x now i copy
50:29 - down the negative 6. notice that
50:31 - negative 4x plus 15x equals 11x that's
50:35 - how i chose those numbers and so this
50:38 - expression is evaluates is the same as
50:41 - as this expression i haven't changed my
50:43 - expression but i have turned it into
50:46 - something that i can apply factoring by
50:47 - grouping on look i've got four terms
50:49 - here and so if i factor out my greatest
50:51 - common factor of my first two terms
50:54 - that's let's see
50:55 - i think it's 2x so i factor out the 2x i
50:58 - get 5x minus 2
51:01 - and then i factor out the greatest
51:03 - common factor of 15x and negative 6.
51:06 - that would be
51:07 - 3
51:08 - and i get a 5x minus 2 again this is
51:10 - working beautifully so i have a 5x minus
51:13 - 2 in each part and so i put the 5x minus
51:17 - 2 on the right and i put what's left
51:21 - from these terms in here so that's 2x
51:24 - plus 3
51:26 - and i have factored my expression
51:31 - there are a couple special kinds of
51:33 - expressions that appear frequently that
51:35 - it's handy to just memorize the formula
51:37 - for so the first one is the difference
51:39 - of squares if you see something of the
51:40 - form a squared minus b squared then you
51:44 - can factor that as a plus b times a
51:48 - minus b and let's just check that that
51:50 - works if i do a plus b times a minus b
51:53 - and multiply that out
51:55 - i get
51:56 - a squared
51:58 - minus a b plus b a minus b squared and
52:02 - those middle two terms cancel out so it
52:04 - gives me back the difference of squares
52:06 - just like i want it
52:07 - so for this first example i if i think
52:10 - of x squared minus 16 as x squared minus
52:15 - four squared then i can see that's a
52:17 - difference of squares and i can
52:18 - immediately write it as x plus 4 times x
52:22 - minus 4. and the second example
52:24 - 9p squared minus 1 that's the same thing
52:27 - as 3p
52:28 - squared minus 1 squared
52:32 - so that's 3p plus 1 times 3p minus 1.
52:39 - notice that if i have a sum of squares
52:43 - for example
52:46 - x squared plus 4 which is x squared plus
52:49 - 2 squared then that does not factor
52:54 - the difference of squares formula
52:55 - doesn't apply and there is no formula
52:57 - that applies for a sum of squares
53:00 - there is however a formula for both a
53:03 - difference of cubes and a sum of cubes
53:06 - the difference of cubes formula a cubed
53:09 - minus b cubed is a minus b
53:12 - times a squared plus a b plus b squared
53:17 - the formula for the sum of cubes is
53:19 - pretty much the same you just switch the
53:21 - negative and positive sign here and here
53:24 - so that gives us
53:25 - a plus b times a squared minus a b
53:29 - plus b squared as usual you can check
53:32 - these formulas by multiplying out
53:36 - let's look at one example of using these
53:37 - formulas y cubed plus 27 is actually a
53:41 - sum of two cubes because it's y cubed
53:44 - plus three cubed so i can factor it
53:48 - using the sum of cubes formula by
53:51 - plugging in y for a and three for b
53:54 - that gives me y plus 3 times y squared
53:59 - minus y times 3 plus 3 squared and i can
54:03 - clean that up a little bit to read y
54:04 - plus 3 times y squared minus 3y plus 9.
54:10 - so in this video we went over several
54:12 - methods of factoring we did
54:15 - factoring out the greatest common factor
54:17 - we did factoring by grouping we did
54:20 - factoring quadratics
54:23 - and we did
54:25 - a difference of squares
54:27 - and we did
54:29 - a difference and a sum
54:32 - of cubes
54:34 - in more complicated problems you may
54:36 - need to apply several of these
54:38 - techniques in order to get through a
54:40 - single problem
54:41 - for example you might need to start by
54:42 - pulling out a greatest common factor and
54:45 - then
54:46 - do a factoring of quadratics or
54:48 - something similar
54:50 - now go forth and factor
54:52 - this video gives some additional
54:54 - examples of factoring
54:56 - please pause the video and decide which
54:59 - of these first five expressions
55:02 - factor and which one does not
55:06 - the first expression can be factored by
55:08 - pulling out a common factor of x from
55:11 - each term
55:13 - so that becomes x
55:15 - times x plus one
55:19 - the second example can be factored as a
55:21 - difference of two squares since x
55:23 - squared minus 25
55:26 - is
55:27 - something squared
55:28 - minus something else squared and we know
55:31 - that anytime we have
55:32 - something like a squared minus b squared
55:34 - that's a plus b
55:36 - times a minus b
55:38 - so we can factor this as
55:40 - x plus five times x minus five
55:44 - the third one is a sum of two squares
55:47 - there's no way to factor a sum of two
55:49 - squares over real numbers
55:51 - so this is the one that does not factor
55:55 - just for completeness let's look at the
55:56 - next two
55:58 - this next one does factor
56:01 - by grouping
56:03 - when we factor by grouping we pull
56:06 - a the biggest common factor out of the
56:07 - first two terms that would be an x
56:10 - squared that becomes x squared times x
56:12 - plus two
56:14 - and then we factor as much as we can out
56:16 - of the next two terms that would be a 3
56:18 - times x plus 2.
56:20 - notice that the x plus 2 factor now
56:23 - occurs in both of the resulting terms so
56:26 - we can pull that x plus 2 out and get
56:31 - x plus 2
56:32 - times x squared plus 3.
56:36 - we can't factor any further because x
56:38 - squared plus 3
56:40 - doesn't factor
56:42 - finally we have a quadratic
56:45 - this also factors and i like to factor
56:47 - these
56:48 - also using a factoring by grouping trick
56:51 - so
56:52 - first what i do is i multiply the
56:56 - coefficient of x squared and the
56:58 - constant term 5 times 8 is 40. i'll
57:01 - write that on the top of my x
57:03 - now i take the coefficient of the x term
57:06 - that's negative 14 and i write that on
57:08 - the bottom part of the x
57:10 - now i'm looking for two numbers that
57:13 - multiply to 40 and add to negative 14.
57:18 - sometimes i can just guess numbers like
57:20 - this but if not i start writing out
57:22 - factors of 40.
57:24 - so
57:25 - factors of 40 i could do 1 times 40.
57:29 - well now i just noticed i'm trying to
57:31 - add to a negative number so if i use two
57:34 - positive factors there's no way this is
57:36 - going to add to a negative number it's
57:38 - better for me to use
57:39 - negative numbers that factor 40. a
57:42 - negative times a negative still
57:43 - multiplies to 40 but they have a chance
57:46 - of adding to a negative number
57:48 - so but negative 1 and negative 40 of
57:50 - course don't work they don't add to
57:51 - negative 14 they add to negative 41. so
57:53 - let me try some other factors the next
57:56 - biggest number that divides 40 besides 1
57:58 - is 2 so i'll try negative 2 and negative
58:01 - 20. those add to
58:03 - negative 22. that doesn't work next one
58:06 - that divides 40 would be 4 so i'll try
58:09 - negative 4 and negative 10.
58:11 - we have a winner so negative 4 plus
58:14 - negative 10 is negative 14 negative 4
58:17 - times negative 10 is positive 40. we've
58:20 - got it all right so the next step is to
58:22 - use factoring by grouping we're going to
58:25 - first split up this negative 14x as
58:29 - negative 4x minus 10x and carry down the
58:33 - 8 and the 5x squared notice that this
58:36 - works because i
58:38 - picked negative 4 and negative 10 to add
58:41 - up to negative 14. so so negative 4x
58:44 - minus 10x will add up to negative 14x so
58:48 - i've got the same expression just just
58:50 - expand it out a little bit now i have
58:52 - four terms i can do factoring by
58:53 - grouping so i can group the first two
58:56 - terms and factor out the biggest thing i
58:57 - can that would be an x
58:59 - times five x minus four and now i'll
59:02 - factor the biggest thing i can out of
59:03 - these two numbers including the the
59:06 - negative
59:07 - so that becomes let's see i can factor
59:10 - out a negative 2 and that becomes 5 x
59:14 - minus 4 since negative 2 times minus 4
59:17 - is 8. all right i've got the same 5x
59:20 - plus 4 in both my terms so factoring by
59:23 - grouping is going swimmingly i can
59:25 - factor out the 5x minus 4 from both
59:28 - those terms and i get the x minus 2. and
59:30 - i've factored this quadratic
59:33 - if i want to of course i can always
59:34 - check my work by distributing out by
59:36 - multiplying out so a check here
59:39 - would be
59:41 - multiplying 5x times x is
59:44 - 5x squared 5x minus times minus 2 is
59:48 - minus 10x
59:50 - minus 4 times x is minus 4x and minus 4
59:53 - times -2 is plus 8. so let's see this
59:56 - does check out to exactly what it should
59:58 - be
59:59 - so
60:00 - that was the method of
60:03 - factoring a quadratic
60:07 - and all of these factor except for
60:09 - the sum of squares
60:12 - so we saw that factoring by grouping is
60:14 - handy for
60:16 - factoring
60:17 - this
60:18 - expression here it was also handy for
60:20 - factoring the quadratic indirectly
60:23 - after splitting up
60:27 - the middle term
60:29 - into two terms
60:30 - so how can you tell
60:33 - when a an expression is is appropriate
60:36 - to factor by grouping there's a there's
60:38 - an easy way to to tell
60:41 - that it might be a candidate and that's
60:42 - that it has four terms
60:46 - so if you see four terms or in the case
60:48 - of quadratic you can split it up into
60:50 - four terms then that's a good candidate
60:52 - for factoring by grouping because you
60:53 - can group the first two terms group the
60:55 - second two terms
60:56 - factoring by grouping all won't always
60:58 - work on
60:59 - on
61:00 - expressions with four terms but
61:02 - but that's like the first thing to look
61:04 - for
61:05 - so let's just review what are the same
61:07 - main techniques of factoring we saw
61:09 - these on the previous page we saw there
61:11 - was pull out common factors
61:14 - there's
61:15 - difference of squares
61:18 - there's factoring by grouping
61:22 - there's factoring quadratics
61:26 - and one more that i didn't mention is
61:29 - factoring
61:30 - sums and differences of cubes
61:34 - that uses the formulas
61:36 - a cubed minus b cubed is a minus b times
61:40 - a squared plus a b plus b squared and a
61:44 - cubed plus b cubed is a plus b
61:47 - times a squared minus a b
61:50 - plus b squared
61:52 - one important tip when factoring
61:55 - i always recommend doing this first
61:58 - pull out the common factors first
62:02 - that'll simplify things in making the
62:03 - rest of factoring easier
62:05 - one more tip
62:06 - is that you might need to do several of
62:08 - these factoring techniques in one
62:10 - problem for example
62:13 - you might have to first pull out a
62:14 - common factor then factor a difference
62:16 - of squares and then you might notice
62:17 - that one of your factors is itself a
62:19 - difference of squares and you have to
62:21 - apply a difference of squares again
62:23 - so don't stop when you
62:25 - factor a little bit keep factoring as
62:27 - far as you can go
62:30 - here are some extra examples of
62:32 - factoring quadratics for you to practice
62:34 - please pause the video and give these a
62:35 - try
62:37 - for the first one let's multiply 2 times
62:41 - negative 14
62:43 - that gives us
62:44 - negative 28
62:46 - and then we'll bring the 3
62:49 - down in the bottom of the x now we're
62:50 - looking for two numbers that multiply to
62:52 - negative 28 and add to 3. well to
62:55 - multiply two numbers to get a negative
62:57 - 28 we'll need one of them to be negative
62:59 - and one of them to be positive so let's
63:02 - see
63:02 - 1 negative 1 28 or 1 negative 28 those
63:06 - don't work let's see negative 2 14 or 2
63:11 - negative 14. those don't work hey i just
63:13 - noticed the positive number had better
63:14 - be bigger than the negative number so
63:16 - that they add to a positive number
63:19 - let's see what comes next how about
63:22 - negative 4 times 7 4 times negative 7
63:26 - i think 4
63:27 - negative 4 times 7 will work so i'll
63:30 - write those here negative 4 7. i'll copy
63:34 - down the 2
63:36 - z
63:38 - squared and i'll split up the 3z into
63:41 - negative 4z plus 7z and then minus 14.
63:45 - now factoring by grouping pull out a 2z
63:48 - that becomes z minus 2
63:50 - pull out a 7 and that becomes z minus 2
63:54 - again looking good i've got
63:56 - 2 z plus 7
63:58 - times z minus 2 as my factored
64:01 - expression
64:03 - my second expression i could work it the
64:05 - same way drawing my x and factoring by
64:08 - grouping that kind of thing but it's
64:10 - actually going to be easier if i notice
64:12 - first that
64:13 - i can pull out a common factor from all
64:15 - of my terms that'll make things a lot
64:17 - simpler to deal with so notice that a 5
64:19 - divides each of these terms in fact i'm
64:21 - going to go ahead and pull out the
64:22 - negative 5 because i don't like having
64:24 - negatives in front of my squared terms
64:26 - so i'm going to pull out a common factor
64:27 - of negative 5.
64:31 - again it would work if i forgot to do
64:32 - this but it would be a lot more
64:33 - complicated so negative 5 v squared this
64:37 - becomes minus now this becomes plus 9v
64:41 - since 9 times negative 5 is negative 45
64:44 - and this becomes minus 10
64:46 - since negative 10 times negative 5 is
64:48 - positive 50.
64:49 - now i can start my x and my factoring by
64:51 - grouping or i can use kind of a shortcut
64:53 - method which you may have seen before so
64:56 - i can just put v's here and then i know
64:58 - that whatever numbers go here they're
65:00 - going to have to multiply to the
65:01 - negative 10 and they're gonna have to
65:03 - add to the nine
65:04 - so
65:05 - that would
65:06 - be a plus 10 and a minus one will do the
65:10 - trick
65:12 - those are all my factoring examples for
65:14 - today i hope you enjoy your snow morning
65:16 - and have a chance to spend some time
65:19 - working in alex
65:20 - bye
65:22 - this video is about working with
65:24 - rational expressions
65:26 - a rational expression is a fraction
65:28 - usually with variables in it something
65:30 - like x plus 2 over x squared minus 3 is
65:34 - a rational expression
65:36 - in this video we'll practice adding
65:38 - subtracting multiplying and dividing
65:41 - rational expressions
65:43 - and simplifying them to lowest terms
65:48 - we'll start with simplifying to lowest
65:50 - terms
65:51 - recall that if you have a fraction with
65:52 - just numbers in it something like 21
65:54 - over 45
65:56 - we can reduce it to lowest terms by
65:59 - factoring the numerator
66:02 - and factoring the denominator
66:07 - and then
66:08 - canceling
66:09 - common factors
66:12 - so in this example the threes can't
66:14 - solve
66:15 - and our fraction reduces to 7 over 15.
66:20 - if we want to reduce a rational
66:22 - expression with variables in it to
66:24 - lowest terms we proceed the same way
66:27 - first we'll factor the numerator that's
66:29 - 3 times x plus 2 and then factor the
66:33 - denominator
66:35 - in this case it factors to x plus 2
66:37 - times x plus 2 we could also write that
66:40 - as x plus 2 squared
66:42 - now we cancel the common factors
66:45 - and we're left with 3 over x plus 2.
66:49 - definitely a simpler way of writing that
66:51 - rational expression
66:54 - next let's practice multiplying and
66:56 - dividing
66:57 - recall that if we multiply two
67:00 - fractions with just numbers in them we
67:02 - simply multiply the numerators and
67:04 - multiply the denominators so in this
67:06 - case we would get 4 times 2 over 3 times
67:09 - 5 or 8 15.
67:13 - if we want to divide two fractions like
67:16 - in the second example
67:17 - then we can rewrite it
67:20 - as multiplying by the reciprocal of the
67:23 - fraction on the denominator
67:26 - so here we get
67:27 - four-fifths times three-halves and that
67:30 - gives us
67:32 - twelve tenths but actually we could
67:34 - reduce that fraction to six-fifths
67:38 - we use the same rules when we compute
67:41 - the product or quotient of two rational
67:44 - expressions with variables in them here
67:46 - we're trying to divide two rational
67:48 - expressions
67:49 - so instead
67:51 - we can
67:52 - multiply by the reciprocal i call this
67:55 - flipping and multiplying
67:59 - and now we just multiply the numerators
68:03 - and multiply the denominators
68:08 - it might be tempting at this point to
68:10 - multiply out to distribute out
68:12 - the numerator and the denominator but
68:14 - actually it's better to leave it in this
68:16 - factored form and factor it even more
68:18 - completely that way we'll be able to
68:21 - reduce the rational expression to cancel
68:23 - the common factors so let's factor it
68:26 - even more the x squared plus x factors
68:29 - as x times x plus one
68:32 - and x squared minus 16 that's a
68:35 - difference of two squares that's x plus
68:37 - 4 times x minus 4.
68:40 - the denominator is already fully
68:42 - factored so we'll just copy it over and
68:45 - now we can cancel common factors here
68:48 - and here and we're left with x times x
68:51 - minus 4.
68:53 - this is our final answer
68:57 - adding and subtracting fractions is a
68:59 - little more complicated because we first
69:00 - have to find a common denominator
69:03 - a common denominator is an expression
69:06 - that both denominators divide into
69:09 - it's usually best in the long run to use
69:11 - the least common denominator which is
69:14 - the smallest expression that both
69:16 - denominators divide into
69:19 - in this example if we just want a common
69:21 - denominator we could use 6 times 15
69:24 - which is 90 because both 6 and 15 divide
69:27 - evenly into 90. but if we want the least
69:30 - common denominator the best way to do
69:32 - that is to factor the two denominators
69:36 - so 6 is 2 times 3
69:39 - 15 is 3 times 5
69:42 - and then put together only the factors
69:44 - we need for both 6 and 15 to divide our
69:47 - number so if we just use 2 times 3 times
69:51 - 5 which is 30
69:55 - we know that 2 times 3 will divide it
69:57 - and 3 times 5 will also divide it
70:00 - and we won't be able to get a
70:01 - denominator any smaller because we need
70:03 - the factors 2 3 and 5 in order to ensure
70:06 - both these numbers divide it
70:08 - once we have our least common
70:10 - denominator we can rewrite each of our
70:12 - fractions in terms of that denominator
70:15 - so 7 6 i need to
70:18 - get a 30 in the denominator so i'm going
70:21 - to multiply that by 5 over 5. i multiply
70:24 - by the factors that are missing from the
70:28 - current denominator in order to get my
70:30 - least common denominator of 30.
70:33 - for the second fraction
70:35 - 4 15
70:36 - 15 times
70:38 - 2 is 30 so i'm going to multiply by 2
70:41 - over 2.
70:42 - now i can rewrite
70:44 - this as
70:46 - 35 30
70:49 - minus 8 30 and now that i have a common
70:52 - denominator i can just subtract my two
70:55 - numerators and i get 27 thirtieths
71:00 - if i factor
71:02 - i can reduce this
71:05 - to
71:06 - three squared over two times five which
71:09 - is nine tenths
71:11 - the process for finding the sum of two
71:14 - rational expressions with variables in
71:16 - them follows the exact same process
71:18 - first we have to find the least common
71:20 - denominator i'll do that by factoring
71:23 - the two denominators so 2x plus 2
71:25 - factors as 2 times x plus 1
71:28 - x squared minus 1 that's a difference of
71:30 - 2 squared so that's x plus 1 times x
71:33 - minus 1.
71:35 - now for the least common denominator i'm
71:37 - going to take
71:38 - all the factors i need to get an
71:40 - expression that each of these divides
71:42 - into so i need the factor 2 i need the
71:44 - factor x plus 1 and i need the factor x
71:47 - minus 1. i don't have to repeat the
71:50 - factor x plus 1. i just need to have it
71:51 - one time and so i will get my least
71:54 - common denominator 2 times x plus 1
71:57 - times x minus 1.
71:59 - i'm not going to bother multiplying this
72:00 - out it's actually better to leave it in
72:02 - factored form to help me simplify later
72:05 - now i can rewrite each of my two
72:08 - rational expressions by multiplying by
72:11 - whatever's missing from the denominator
72:14 - in terms of the least common denominator
72:16 - so what i mean is i can rewrite 3 over
72:19 - 2x plus 2. i'll write the 2x plus 2 as 2
72:22 - times x plus 1 i'll write it in factored
72:24 - form and then i notice that compared to
72:26 - the least common denominator i'm missing
72:28 - the factor of x minus 1. so i multiply
72:32 - the numerator and the denominator by x
72:35 - minus 1. i just need it in the
72:36 - denominator but i can't get away with
72:38 - just multiplying by the denominator
72:40 - without changing my expression i have to
72:42 - multiply by it on the numerator and the
72:44 - denominator so i'm just multiplying by 1
72:46 - in a fancy form and not changing the
72:49 - value here
72:50 - so now i do the same thing for the
72:52 - second rational expression i'll i'll
72:53 - write the denominator in factored form
72:55 - to make it easier to see what's missing
72:57 - from the denominator what's missing
73:00 - in this denominator compared to my least
73:02 - common denominator is just the factor 2.
73:05 - so i'll multiply the numerator and the
73:06 - denominator by 2.
73:09 - now i can rewrite everything so
73:11 - the first rational expression becomes 3
73:13 - times x minus 1 over 2 times x plus 1 x
73:18 - minus 1 and the second one becomes 5
73:21 - times 2
73:23 - over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. notice
73:27 - that i now have a common denominator so
73:30 - i can just add together my numerators so
73:32 - i get 3 times x minus 1 plus 10
73:36 - over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1.
73:40 - i'd like to simplify this and the best
73:42 - way to do that is to leave the
73:44 - denominator in factored form
73:46 - but i do have to multiply out the
73:48 - numerator so that i can add things
73:50 - together so i get 3x minus 3 plus 10
73:56 - over
73:56 - 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 or 3x plus 7
74:01 - over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. now 3x
74:05 - plus 7 doesn't factor and there's
74:08 - therefore no factors that i can cancel
74:11 - out so this is already reduced as much
74:14 - as it can be this is my final answer
74:20 - in this video we saw how to simplify
74:22 - rational expressions to lowest terms by
74:24 - factoring and canceling common factors
74:28 - we also saw how to multiply rational
74:30 - expressions by multiplying the numerator
74:32 - and multiplying the denominator how to
74:34 - divide rational expressions by flipping
74:36 - and multiplying and how to add and
74:38 - subtract rational expressions
74:41 - by writing them in terms of the least
74:43 - common denominator
74:45 - this video is about solving quadratic
74:47 - equations a quadratic equation is an
74:50 - equation that contains the square of the
74:52 - variable say x squared but no higher
74:56 - powers of x
74:58 - the standard form for our quadratic
75:00 - equation is the form a x squared plus b
75:03 - x plus c equals 0
75:06 - where a b and c
75:10 - represent real numbers
75:12 - and a is not zero so that we actually
75:15 - have an x squared term
75:16 - let me give you an example
75:18 - three x squared plus seven x minus two
75:22 - equals 0 is a quadratic equation in
75:25 - standard form here a is 3 b is 7 and c
75:30 - is minus 2.
75:32 - the equation 3x squared equals minus 7x
75:36 - plus 2 is also a quadratic equation it's
75:39 - just not in standard form
75:41 - the key steps to solving quadratic
75:43 - equations are usually to
75:45 - write the equation in standard form
75:48 - and then either factor it or use the
75:53 - quadratic formula which i'll show you
75:55 - later in this video
75:59 - let's start with the example y squared
76:01 - equals 18 minus 7y
76:04 - here our variable is y and we need to
76:06 - rewrite this quadratic equation in
76:08 - standard form we can do this by
76:11 - subtracting 18 from both sides and
76:13 - adding 7y to both sides that gives us
76:16 - the equation y squared minus eighteen
76:20 - plus seven y equals zero
76:22 - and i can rearrange a little bit to get
76:24 - y squared plus seven y minus eighteen
76:27 - equals zero now i've got my equation in
76:30 - standard form
76:32 - next i'm going to try to factor it
76:35 - so i need to look for two numbers that
76:37 - multiply to negative 18 and add to seven
76:42 - two numbers that work are nine and
76:44 - negative two so i can factor my
76:46 - expression on the left as y
76:49 - plus nine times y minus two equals zero
76:54 - now anytime you have two quantities that
76:57 - multiply together to give you zero
77:00 - either the first quantity has to be zero
77:02 - or the second quantity has to be zero or
77:04 - i suppose they both could be zero in
77:06 - some situations this is really handy
77:08 - because that means that i know that
77:10 - either y plus nine equals zero or y
77:13 - minus two equals zero
77:15 - so i can as my next step set my factors
77:19 - equal to 0.
77:21 - so y plus 9 equals 0 or y minus 2 equals
77:24 - 0 which means that y equals negative 9
77:28 - or y equals 2.
77:31 - it's not a bad idea to check that those
77:33 - answers actually work by plugging them
77:34 - into the original equation negative 9
77:37 - squared
77:38 - does that equal 18 minus 7 times
77:41 - negative 9 and you can work out that it
77:43 - does and similarly 2 squared equals 18
77:47 - minus 7 times 2.
77:50 - in the next example let's find solutions
77:53 - of the equation w squared equals 121.
77:56 - this is a quadratic equation because
77:58 - it's got a square of my variable w
78:01 - i can rewrite it in standard form
78:04 - by subtracting 121 from both sides
78:09 - notice that a is equal to 1 b is equal
78:12 - to zero because there's no
78:14 - w term and c is equal to negative 121 in
78:18 - the standard form a w squared plus b w
78:21 - plus c equals zero
78:23 - next step i'm going to try to factor
78:26 - this
78:27 - expression so since 121
78:30 - is 11 squared this is a difference of
78:33 - two squares and it factors as w plus 11
78:36 - times w minus 11 is equal to zero
78:40 - if i set the factors equal to zero
78:44 - i get w plus 11 equals zero or w minus
78:48 - 11 equals zero so w equals minus 11 or w
78:52 - equals 11.
78:54 - in this example i could have solved the
78:56 - equation more simply i could have
78:58 - instead said that if w squared is 121
79:02 - then w has to equal plus or minus the
79:04 - square root of 121 in other words w is
79:08 - plus or minus 11.
79:11 - if you solve the equation this way it's
79:12 - important to remember the plus or minus
79:15 - since minus 11 squared equals 121 just
79:18 - like 11 squared does
79:20 - now let's find the solutions for the
79:22 - equation x times x plus 2 equals 7.
79:26 - some people might be tempted to say that
79:28 - oh if two numbers multiply to equal
79:30 - seven then one of them better equal one
79:32 - and the other equals seven or maybe
79:34 - negative 1 and negative 7 but that's
79:36 - faulty reasoning in this case because x
79:40 - and x plus 2 don't have to be whole
79:42 - numbers they could be crazy fractions or
79:46 - even irrational numbers
79:48 - so
79:49 - instead let's rewrite this equation in
79:52 - standard form
79:54 - to do that i'm first going to multiply
79:56 - out
79:57 - so x times x is x squared x times 2 is
80:01 - 2x that equals 7 and i'll subtract the 7
80:04 - from both sides to get x squared plus 2x
80:07 - minus 7 is 0.
80:09 - now i'm looking to factor it so i need
80:11 - two numbers that multiply to negative 7
80:14 - and add to 2.
80:16 - since the only way to factor negative 7
80:18 - is as negative 1 times 7 or 7 times
80:21 - negative 1 it's easy to see that there
80:23 - are no whole numbers that will
80:25 - will work so there's no way to factor
80:28 - this expression over the integers
80:30 - instead let's use the quadratic equation
80:34 - so we have our
80:35 - leading coefficient of x squared is one
80:38 - so a is one b is two and c is minus
80:42 - seven
80:43 - and we're going to plug that into the
80:44 - equation quadratic equation
80:46 - which goes x equals negative b plus or
80:49 - minus the square root of b squared minus
80:52 - 4ac
80:53 - all over 2a
80:55 - different people have different ways of
80:57 - remembering this formula i'd like to
80:59 - remember it by singing it
81:01 - x equals negative b plus or minus the
81:03 - square root of b squared minus 4ac all
81:06 - over 2a
81:08 - but you can use any mnemonic you like
81:10 - anyway plugging in here we have x equals
81:13 - negative 2 plus or minus the square root
81:15 - of 2 squared minus 4 times 1 times
81:19 - negative 7. it's important to remember
81:21 - the negative 7 there
81:23 - all over 2 times 1.
81:26 - now 2 squared is 4
81:28 - and 4 times 1 times negative 7 is
81:31 - negative 28
81:33 - so this whole quantity under the square
81:35 - root sign becomes 4 minus negative 28 or
81:39 - 32.
81:40 - so i can rewrite this as x equals
81:42 - negative 2 plus or minus the square root
81:44 - of 32 all over 2.
81:47 - since 32 is 16 times 2 and 16 is a
81:52 - perfect square i can rewrite this as
81:55 - negative 2 plus or minus the square root
81:57 - of 16 times the square root of 2 over 2
82:00 - which is negative 2 plus or minus 4
82:03 - times the square root of 2 over 2.
82:06 - next
82:07 - i'm going to split up my fraction
82:10 - as negative 2 over 2 plus or minus 4
82:14 - square root of 2 over 2 and then
82:16 - simplify those fractions
82:18 - this becomes negative 1 plus or minus 2
82:21 - square root of 2.
82:23 - so my answers
82:25 - are negative 1 plus 2 square root of 2
82:28 - and negative 1 minus 2 square root of 2.
82:31 - and if i need a decimal answer for any
82:32 - reason i could work those out on my
82:34 - calculator
82:36 - as our final example let's find all real
82:39 - solutions for the equation one half y
82:41 - squared equals one third y minus two
82:45 - i'll start as usual by putting it in
82:47 - standard form
82:49 - so that gives me one half y squared
82:52 - minus one third y plus two equals zero
82:56 - i could go ahead and start trying to
82:58 - factor or use the quadratic formula
83:00 - right now but i find fractional
83:02 - coefficients kind of annoying so i'd
83:04 - like to get rid of them by doing what i
83:06 - call clearing the denominator that means
83:08 - i'm going to multiply the whole entire
83:09 - equation by the least common denominator
83:12 - in this case the least common
83:13 - denominator is 2 times 3 or 6. so i'll
83:17 - multiply the whole equation by 6. i have
83:20 - to make sure i multiplied both sides of
83:21 - the equation but in this case 6 times 0
83:23 - is just 0. and when i distribute the 6 i
83:26 - get 3y squared minus 2y plus 12 equals
83:31 - 0.
83:33 - now i could try to factor this but i
83:34 - think it's easier probably just to
83:35 - plunge in and use the quadratic formula
83:40 - so i get x equals negative b that's
83:43 - negative negative 2 or 2
83:46 - plus or minus the square root of b
83:47 - squared
83:48 - minus 4 times a times c
83:53 - all over 2 a
83:57 - working out the stuff on the square root
83:58 - sign negative 2 squared is 4 and here we
84:02 - have
84:03 - let's see 144
84:06 - so this simplifies to x equals 2 plus or
84:09 - minus the square root of
84:11 - 4 minus 144 that's negative 140 all over
84:16 - six
84:17 - well if you're concerned about the
84:19 - negative number under the square root
84:20 - sign
84:21 - you should be we can't take the square
84:23 - root of a negative number and get an and
84:26 - get a real number as our answer there's
84:28 - no real number whose square is a
84:30 - negative number and therefore our
84:32 - conclusion is we have no
84:34 - real solutions to this quadratic
84:37 - equation
84:39 - in this video we solved some quadratic
84:41 - equations by first writing them in
84:43 - standard form and then either factoring
84:45 - or using the quadratic formula
84:48 - in some examples factoring doesn't work
84:51 - it's not possible to factor the equation
84:53 - but in fact using the quadratic formula
84:55 - will always work even if it's also
84:58 - possible to solve it by factoring
85:01 - so you can't really lose by using the
85:02 - quadratic formula it's just sometimes
85:04 - it'll be faster to factor instead
85:07 - this video is about solving equations
85:10 - with absolute values in them
85:12 - recall that the absolute value of a
85:15 - positive number is just the number but
85:17 - the absolute value of a negative number
85:20 - is its opposite
85:21 - in general i think of the absolute value
85:24 - of a number as representing its distance
85:26 - from 0 on the number line
85:29 - the number 4
85:31 - and the number negative 4
85:33 - are both at distance 4 from 0 and so the
85:37 - absolute value
85:39 - of both of them is 4.
85:42 - similarly if i write the equation the
85:45 - absolute value of x is 3
85:48 - that means that x
85:50 - has to be 3 units away from zero on the
85:54 - number line
85:56 - and so x would have to be either
85:58 - negative three or three
86:01 - let's start with the equation three
86:03 - times the absolute value of x plus two
86:05 - equals four
86:08 - i'd like to isolate the absolute value
86:11 - part of the equation
86:13 - i can do this by starting with my
86:15 - original equation
86:19 - subtracting 2 from both sides
86:23 - and dividing both sides by 3.
86:30 - now i'll think in terms of distance
86:33 - on a number line the absolute value of x
86:36 - is two-thirds means that x
86:38 - is two-thirds away from zero
86:43 - so x could be here or here
86:46 - at negative two-thirds or at two-thirds
86:50 - and the answer to my equation is x is
86:52 - negative two-thirds or two-thirds
86:56 - i can check my answers by plugging in
87:00 - three times the absolute value of
87:02 - negative two-thirds plus two i need to
87:05 - check if that equals four
87:07 - well the absolute value of negative
87:08 - two-thirds is just two-thirds so this is
87:11 - three times two-thirds plus two
87:14 - which works out to
87:16 - four similarly if i plug in
87:20 - positive two-thirds
87:22 - it also works out to give me a correct
87:25 - answer
87:26 - this second example is a little
87:27 - different because the absolute value
87:29 - sign is around a more complicated
87:31 - expression
87:32 - not just around the x
87:35 - i would start by isolating the absolute
87:38 - value part
87:42 - but it's already isolated
87:44 - so i'll just go ahead and jump to
87:46 - thinking about distance on the number
87:48 - line
87:49 - so on my number line
87:51 - the whole expression
87:53 - 3x plus 2
87:55 - is supposed to be at a distance of 4
87:57 - from
87:58 - 0. so
88:01 - that means that three x plus two is here
88:04 - at four or three x plus two is at
88:06 - negative four
88:08 - i'll write those as equations
88:12 - three x plus 2 equals 4 or 3x plus 2 is
88:15 - minus 4
88:16 - and then i can solve
88:19 - so this becomes 3x equals 2 or x equals
88:22 - 2 thirds and over here i get 3x equals
88:26 - minus 6 or x equals minus 2.
88:31 - finally i'll check my answers
88:35 - i'll leave it to you to verify that they
88:37 - both work
88:39 - a common mistake on absolute value
88:41 - equations is to get rid of the absolute
88:43 - value signs like we did here and then
88:46 - just solve for
88:47 - one answer instead of solving for both
88:50 - answers
88:51 - another mistake sometimes people make is
88:53 - once they get the first answer they just
88:55 - assume that the negative of that works
88:57 - also
88:58 - but that doesn't always work
89:01 - in the first example our two answers
89:03 - were both the negatives of each other
89:04 - but in our second examples our two
89:06 - answers were not just the opposites of
89:09 - each other one was two-thirds and the
89:11 - other was negative two
89:13 - in this third example let's again
89:16 - isolate the absolute value part of the
89:18 - equation
89:19 - so starting with our original equation
89:24 - we can subtract 16 from both sides
89:28 - and divide both sides by five or
89:30 - equivalently multiply by one-fifth
89:37 - now let's think about distance on the
89:39 - number line
89:41 - we have an absolute value needs to equal
89:44 - negative 3. so that means whatever is
89:47 - inside the absolute value sign needs to
89:49 - be at distance negative three
89:52 - from zero well you can't be at distance
89:55 - negative three from zero
89:57 - another way of thinking about this is
89:58 - you can't have the absolute value of
90:00 - something and end up with a negative
90:02 - number absolute value is always positive
90:04 - or zero
90:05 - so this equation doesn't actually make
90:07 - sense and there are
90:09 - no solutions to this equation
90:15 - in this video we solved absolute value
90:17 - equations
90:19 - in many cases
90:20 - an absolute value equation will have two
90:22 - solutions
90:23 - but in some cases it'll have no
90:25 - solutions
90:26 - and occasionally it'll have just one
90:28 - solution
90:30 - this video is about solving rational
90:32 - equations a rational equation like this
90:35 - one
90:36 - is an equation that has rational
90:38 - expressions in it in other words an
90:40 - equation that has some variables in the
90:42 - denominator
90:44 - there are several different approaches
90:46 - for solving a rational equation but they
90:48 - all start by finding the least common
90:51 - denominator in this example the
90:53 - denominators are x plus 3 and x we can
90:56 - think of 1 as just having a denominator
90:58 - of 1.
91:00 - since the denominators don't have any
91:02 - factors in common i can find the least
91:04 - common denominator just by multiplying
91:06 - them together
91:08 - my next step is going to be clearing the
91:11 - denominator
91:13 - by this i mean that i multiply both
91:15 - sides of my equation
91:18 - by this least common denominator x plus
91:20 - 3 times x so i multiply it on the left
91:24 - side of the equation and i multiply by
91:27 - the same thing
91:28 - on the right side of the equation
91:31 - since i'm doing the same thing to both
91:32 - sides of the equation i don't change the
91:35 - the value of the equation
91:37 - multiplying the least common denominator
91:39 - on both sides of the equation is
91:41 - equivalent to multiplying it by all
91:43 - three terms in the equation i can see
91:46 - this when i multiply out
91:49 - i'll rewrite the left side the same as
91:52 - before pretty much and then i'll
91:54 - distribute
91:55 - the right side to get x plus 3 times x
91:59 - times 1 plus x plus 3 times x times 1
92:03 - over x so i've actually multiplied the
92:06 - least common denominator by all three
92:08 - terms of my equation now i can have a
92:10 - blast cancelling things the x plus 3
92:14 - cancels with the x plus 3 on the
92:16 - denominator
92:17 - the
92:19 - here nothing cancels out because there's
92:21 - no denominator and here the x in the
92:23 - numerator cancels with the x in the
92:24 - denominator
92:26 - so i can rewrite my expression as x
92:28 - squared equals x plus 3 times x
92:32 - times 1 plus x plus 3.
92:35 - now i'm going to simplify
92:38 - so i'll leave the x squared alone on
92:40 - this side i'll distribute out
92:42 - x squared plus 3x plus x plus 3.
92:47 - hey look the x squares cancel on both
92:49 - sides
92:50 - and so i get 0 equals 4x plus 3
92:54 - so 4x is negative 3 and x is negative 3
92:58 - 4.
92:59 - finally i'm going to plug in my answer
93:01 - to check this is a good idea for any
93:03 - kind of equation but it's especially
93:05 - important for a rational equation
93:07 - because occasionally for rational
93:09 - equations you'll get what's called
93:10 - extraneous solutions solutions that
93:12 - don't actually work in your original
93:14 - equation because they make the
93:15 - denominator zero
93:17 - now in this example i don't think we're
93:18 - going to get any extraneous equations
93:20 - because
93:21 - negative 3 4
93:23 - is not going to make any of these
93:24 - denominators 0. so it should work out
93:26 - fine when i plug in
93:28 - if i plug in
93:32 - i get this
93:34 - i can simplify
93:37 - the denominator here negative 3 4 plus
93:39 - 3. 3 is 12 4. so that becomes 9 4.
93:43 - and this is 1 i'll flip and multiply to
93:46 - get minus
93:47 - 4 thirds
93:49 - so here i can simplify my complex
93:53 - fraction it ends up being
93:55 - negative three ninths and one minus four
93:57 - thirds is negative one third so
94:00 - that all seems to check out
94:03 - and so my final answer is x equals
94:06 - negative three-fourths
94:08 - this next example looks a little
94:10 - trickier and it is but the same approach
94:12 - will work
94:13 - first i'll find the least common
94:15 - denominator
94:16 - so here my denominators are c minus five
94:21 - c plus one
94:23 - and
94:24 - c squared minus four c minus five i'm
94:27 - gonna factor that as c minus five times
94:31 - c plus 1.
94:32 - now my least common denominator needs to
94:34 - have just enough factors
94:37 - to
94:37 - that each of these denominators divide
94:39 - into it so i need the factor c minus 5 i
94:43 - need the factor c plus 1 and now i've
94:46 - already got all the factors i need for
94:47 - this denominator so here is my least
94:50 - common denominator
94:52 - next step is to clear the denominators
94:56 - so i do this by multiplying both sides
94:57 - of the equation
94:59 - by my least common denominator
95:01 - in fact i can just multiply each of the
95:04 - three terms by this least common
95:06 - denominator
95:09 - i went ahead and wrote my
95:11 - third denominator in factored form to
95:13 - make it easier to see what cancels
95:16 - now canceling time
95:18 - not dies
95:19 - this dies
95:21 - and both of those factors die
95:24 - canceling out the denominator is the
95:25 - whole point of multiplying by the least
95:28 - common denominator you're multiplying by
95:30 - something that's big enough to kill
95:31 - every single denominator so you don't
95:33 - have to deal with denominators anymore
95:36 - now i'm going to
95:38 - simplify by multiplying out
95:41 - so i get let's see
95:43 - c plus 1 times 4c that's 4c squared plus
95:47 - 4c
95:49 - now i get minus
95:51 - just c minus 5.
95:54 - and then over here i get 3c squared plus
95:57 - 3.
95:59 - i can rewrite the minus
96:03 - quantity c minus 5 as minus c plus 5.
96:08 - and now i can subtract the 3c squared
96:11 - from both sides to get just a c squared
96:14 - over here
96:16 - and the 4c minus c that becomes a 3c
96:23 - and finally i can subtract the 3 from
96:25 - both sides to get c squared plus 3c
96:29 - plus 2 equals 0.
96:32 - i've got myself a quadratic equation
96:34 - that looks like a nice one that factors
96:36 - so this factors to c plus one times c
96:39 - plus two equals zero
96:42 - so either c plus one is zero or c plus
96:45 - two is zero so c equals negative one or
96:48 - c equals negative two
96:52 - now let's see
96:53 - we need to still check our answers
96:57 - without even going to the trouble of
96:59 - calculating anything i can see that c
97:01 - equals negative 1 is not going to work
97:04 - because if i plug it in
97:06 - to this denominator here i get a
97:08 - denominator of zero which doesn't make
97:10 - sense so c equals minus one
97:14 - is an extraneous solution it doesn't
97:17 - actually
97:18 - satisfy
97:19 - my original equation and so i can just
97:22 - cross it right out
97:24 - c equals negative 2
97:27 - i can go if i go ahead that doesn't make
97:29 - any of my denominators zero so if i
97:31 - haven't made any mistakes it should
97:32 - satisfy my original equation but
97:36 - but i'll just plug it in to be sure
97:41 - and after some simplifying
97:44 - i get a true statement
97:47 - so my final answer is c equals negative
97:50 - 2.
97:51 - in this video
97:53 - we solved a couple of rational equations
97:55 - using the method of finding the least
97:58 - common denominator and then clearing the
98:01 - denominator
98:03 - we cleared the denominator by
98:04 - multiplying both sides of the equation
98:06 - by the least common denominator or
98:08 - equivalently multiplying each of the
98:10 - terms by that denominator
98:12 - there's another equivalent method that
98:14 - some people prefer it still starts out
98:17 - the same we find the least common
98:19 - denominator but then we write all the
98:21 - fractions
98:24 - over
98:25 - that least common denominator so in this
98:27 - example we'd still use the least common
98:30 - denominator of x plus 3 times x but our
98:33 - next step would be to write each of
98:35 - these rational expressions over that
98:37 - common denominator by multiplying the
98:39 - top and the bottom by the appropriate
98:40 - things so 1 in order to get the common
98:43 - denominator of x plus 3 x i need to
98:47 - multiply the top and the bottom by x
98:49 - plus 3 times x
98:50 - 1 over x i need to multiply the top and
98:52 - the bottom just by x plus 3 since that's
98:55 - what's missing from the denominator x
98:58 - now if i simplify a little bit
99:02 - uh let's see this is x squared
99:05 - over that
99:06 - common denominator and
99:10 - here i have just x plus 3 times x over
99:13 - that denominator and here i have
99:16 - x plus 3 over that common denominator
99:19 - now i'll add together my fractions
99:21 - on the right side
99:23 - so they have a common denominator
99:27 - so this is x plus 3 times x plus x plus
99:31 - 3.
99:32 - and now i have two fractions that have
99:35 - that are equal that have the same
99:37 - denominator therefore their numerators
99:39 - have to be equal also so the next step
99:42 - is to set the numerators equal
99:46 - so i get x squared is x plus 3 times x
99:51 - plus x plus three and if you look back
99:54 - at the previous way we solve this
99:56 - equation you'll recognize this equation
99:59 - and so from here on we just continue as
100:01 - before
100:05 - when choosing between these two methods
100:07 - i personally tend to prefer the clear
100:08 - the denominators method because it's a
100:10 - little bit less writing you don't have
100:11 - to you get rid of those denominators
100:13 - earlier you don't have to write them as
100:14 - many times but
100:16 - some people find this one a little bit
100:17 - easier to remember a little easier to
100:19 - understand either of these methods is
100:21 - fine
100:23 - one last caution don't forget at the end
100:26 - to check your solutions and eliminate
100:29 - any extraneous solutions
100:32 - these will be solutions that make the
100:34 - denominators of your original equations
100:36 - go to zero
100:38 - this video is about solving radical
100:40 - equations that is equations like this
100:42 - one
100:43 - that have square root signs in them or
100:46 - cube roots or any other kind of radical
100:49 - when i see an equation with a square
100:51 - root in it i really want to get rid of
100:53 - the square root
100:54 - but it'll be easiest to get rid of the
100:56 - square root if i first isolate the
100:58 - square root
101:00 - in other words i want to get the term
101:02 - with the square root in it on one side
101:04 - of the equation by itself and everything
101:06 - else on the other side of the equation
101:09 - if i start with my original equation x
101:11 - plus the square root of x equals 12
101:14 - and i subtract x from both sides then
101:17 - that does isolate the square root term
101:19 - on the left side with everything else on
101:21 - the right
101:22 - once i've isolated the term with the
101:25 - square root i'm going to
101:27 - get rid of the square root
101:29 - and i'll do that by squaring both sides
101:34 - of my equation
101:36 - so i'll take the square root of x equals
101:38 - 12 minus x
101:40 - and square both sides
101:44 - now the square root of x squared is just
101:47 - x taking the square root and then
101:49 - squaring those operations undo each
101:51 - other
101:53 - to work out 12 minus x squared i'll
101:56 - write it out and distribute 12 times 12
101:59 - is 144
102:01 - 12 times minus x is minus 12x
102:05 - i get another minus 12x from here
102:10 - and finally minus x times minus x is
102:13 - positive x squared
102:15 - so i can combine my minus 12 x's that's
102:18 - minus 24x
102:20 - and now i can subtract x from both sides
102:23 - to get 0 equals
102:25 - 144 minus 25x plus x squared that's a
102:29 - quadratic equation i'll rewrite it
102:32 - in a little bit more standard form here
102:36 - so now i've got a familiar quadratic
102:38 - equation with no radical signs left in
102:40 - my equation i'll just proceed to solve
102:43 - it like i usually do for a quadratic
102:45 - i'll try to factor it so i'm going to
102:47 - look for two numbers that multiply to
102:49 - 144 and add to minus 25.
102:53 - well i know i'm going to
102:54 - need negative numbers to get to
102:58 - negative 25 and in fact i'll need two
103:00 - negative numbers so they still multiply
103:02 - to a positive number so i'll start
103:05 - listing some factors of 144. i could
103:07 - have negative 1 and a negative 144
103:10 - negative 2
103:11 - and negative 72
103:14 - negative 4 negative 36 and so on
103:18 - once i've listed out the possible
103:19 - factors it's not hard to find
103:22 - the two that add to negative 25 so
103:24 - that's
103:25 - negative 9 and negative 16.
103:28 - so now i can factor my quadratic
103:29 - equation as x minus 9 times x minus 16
103:34 - equals 0. that means that x minus 9 is 0
103:37 - or x minus 16 is 0. so x equals 9 or x
103:41 - equals 16.
103:43 - i'm almost done but there's one last
103:46 - very important step
103:47 - and that's to check the solutions
103:50 - so that we can eliminate any extraneous
103:53 - solutions
103:55 - an extraneous solution is a solution
103:57 - that we get that does not actually
103:58 - satisfy our original equation and
104:00 - extraneous solutions can happen when
104:03 - you're solving equations with radicals
104:05 - in them
104:06 - so let's first check x equals 9 if we
104:09 - plug in to our original equation we get
104:11 - 9 plus the square root of 9 and we want
104:13 - that to equal 12. well the square root
104:16 - of 9 is 3 and 9 plus 3 it does indeed
104:20 - equal 12 so that solution checks out
104:22 - now let's try x equals 16 plugging in we
104:26 - get 16 plus the square root of 16 and
104:28 - that's supposed to equal 12.
104:30 - well that says 16 plus 4 is supposed to
104:33 - equal 12 but that most definitely is not
104:35 - true
104:36 - and so
104:38 - x equals 16 turns out to be extraneous
104:40 - solution and our only solution is x
104:43 - equals 9.
105:28 - this next equation might not look like
105:31 - an equation involving radicals but in
105:33 - fact we can think of a fractional
105:35 - exponent as being a radical in disguise
105:38 - let's start by doing the same thing we
105:40 - did on the previous problem
105:42 - by isolating
105:44 - this time we'll isolate the part of the
105:46 - equation
105:49 - that involves the fractional exponent
105:52 - so i'll start with the original equation
105:54 - 2 times p to the 4 5 equals 1 one-eighth
105:57 - and i'll divide both sides by two or
106:00 - equivalently i can multiply both sides
106:03 - by one-half
106:04 - that gives me p to the four-fifths
106:07 - equals one-sixteenth and i've
106:09 - effectively isolated the part of the
106:11 - equation with the fractional exponent as
106:13 - much as possible
106:15 - now in the previous example the next
106:18 - step was to get rid of the radical in
106:21 - this example we're going to get rid of
106:24 - the fractional exponent
106:26 - and i'm going to actually do this in two
106:28 - stages first
106:30 - i'm going to raise both sides to the
106:32 - fifth power
106:35 - that's because
106:36 - when i take an exponent to an exponent i
106:39 - multiply my exponents
106:42 - and so
106:43 - that becomes just p to the fourth
106:45 - equals 1 16 to the fifth power
106:48 - now i'm going to get rid of the fourth
106:51 - power
106:52 - by raising both sides to the one-fourth
106:54 - power or by taking the fourth root
106:57 - there's something that you need to be
106:59 - careful about though when taking
107:02 - an even root or the one over an even
107:05 - number power
107:07 - you always have to consider
107:09 - plus or minus your answer
107:13 - it's kind of like when you write
107:15 - x squared equals 4 and you take the
107:18 - square root of both sides
107:20 - x could equal plus or minus the square
107:22 - root of 4 right x could equal plus or
107:24 - minus 2 since
107:26 - minus 2 squared is 4 just as well as 2
107:30 - squared
107:31 - so that's why when you take an even root
107:34 - or a 1 over an even power
107:38 - of both sides you always need to
107:41 - include the plus or minus sign
107:44 - when it's an odd root or one over an odd
107:46 - power you don't need to do that
107:48 - if you had something like x cubed equals
107:51 - negative 8
107:52 - then
107:53 - x equals the cube root of negative 8
107:56 - which is negative 2 would be your only
107:58 - solution you don't need to do the plus
107:59 - or minus because positive 2 wouldn't
108:01 - work
108:03 - so that aside explains why we need this
108:06 - plus or minus power
108:07 - and now p to the 4 to the 1 4
108:12 - when i raise a power to a power i
108:13 - multiply by exponents so that's just p
108:15 - to the 1
108:17 - which is equal to plus or minus 1 16 to
108:21 - the fifth power to the one-fourth power
108:25 - now i just need to simplify this
108:27 - expression i don't really want to raise
108:29 - 1 16 to the fifth power because
108:32 - 16 to the fifth power is like a really
108:34 - huge number so i think i'm actually
108:36 - going to rewrite this first
108:40 - as p equals plus or minus
108:44 - 1 16. i'll write it back as the 5 4
108:48 - power again
108:50 - and as i continue to
108:52 - solve using my exponent rules
108:57 - i'm going to
108:58 - prefer to write this as
109:01 - 1 16 to
109:03 - the 4th root to the 5th power because
109:06 - it's going to be easier to take the 4th
109:09 - root let's see the 4th root of 1 16 is
109:11 - the same thing as the 4th root of 1 over
109:13 - the fourth root of sixteen
109:15 - raise all that to the fifth power
109:17 - fourth root of one is just one and the
109:19 - fourth root of sixteen is two
109:21 - raise that to the fifth power
109:23 - that's just gonna be one to the fifth
109:25 - over two to the fifth which is plus or
109:27 - minus 1 32nd
109:32 - the last step is to check answers
109:36 - so i have the two answers p equals 132nd
109:40 - and p equals minus one thirty seconds
109:43 - and if i plug those both in
109:46 - one thirty second to the fourth fifth
109:48 - power
109:50 - that gives me two times
109:53 - one to the four fifth power over 32 to
109:56 - the four-fifth power
109:58 - which is two times one over
110:01 - thirty-two
110:02 - fifth rooted to the fourth power
110:05 - fifth root of 32 is two
110:07 - raise that to the fourth power i get 16
110:10 - so this is 2 times 1 16 which is 1 8
110:14 - just as we wanted in the original
110:17 - equation up here
110:19 - similarly we can check that the
110:22 - p equals negative 1 32nd actually does
110:25 - satisfy the equation i'll leave that
110:27 - step to the viewer
110:31 - so our two solutions are p equals 1 over
110:34 - 32 and p equals minus 1 over 32. i do
110:38 - want to point out an alternate approach
110:40 - to getting rid of the fractional
110:41 - exponent
110:42 - we could have gotten rid of it all in
110:44 - one fell swoop by raising both sides of
110:47 - our equation to the five-fourths power
110:52 - 5 4 is the reciprocal of four-fifths so
110:55 - when i use my exponent rules and say
110:58 - that when i raise the power to the power
111:00 - i multiply my exponents that gives me p
111:04 - to the four-fifths times five-fourths is
111:07 - plus or minus one-sixteenth to the
111:09 - five-fourths in other words p
111:12 - to the one power which is just p
111:14 - is plus or minus one-sixteenth to the
111:16 - five-fourths so that's an alternate and
111:19 - possibly faster way to get to the
111:21 - solution once again the plus or minus
111:24 - comes from the fact that when we take
111:26 - the 5 4 power we're really taking an
111:29 - even root a fourth root and so we need
111:32 - to consider both positive and negative
111:33 - answers
111:35 - this video is about solving radical
111:37 - equations that is equations like this
111:40 - one
111:40 - that have square root signs in them or
111:43 - cube roots or any other kind of radical
111:46 - in this video we solved radical
111:48 - equations by first isolating the radical
111:52 - sign or the fractional exponent
111:55 - and then
111:57 - removing the radical sign or the
111:59 - fractional exponent
112:02 - by either squaring both sides or
112:05 - taking the reciprocal power of both
112:07 - sides
112:10 - this video is about solving inequalities
112:12 - that have absolute value signs in them
112:15 - let's look at the inequality absolute
112:17 - value of x is less than five on the
112:18 - number line
112:20 - thinking of absolute value as distance
112:22 - this means that the distance between x
112:25 - and zero is less than five units
112:28 - so x has to live somewhere in between
112:31 - negative five and five
112:35 - we can express this as an inequality
112:36 - without absolute value signs by saying
112:39 - negative five is less than x which is
112:42 - less than five or we can use interval
112:44 - notation
112:45 - soft bracket negative 5 5 soft bracket
112:50 - both of these formulations are
112:52 - equivalent to the original one but don't
112:54 - involve the absolute value signs
112:57 - in the second example we're looking for
112:59 - the values of x for which the absolute
113:01 - value of x is greater than or equal to
113:04 - five
113:06 - on the number line
113:08 - this means that the distance of x from
113:10 - the zero has got to be bigger than or
113:13 - equal to five units
113:15 - a distance bigger than five units means
113:18 - that x has to live somewhere over here
113:21 - or somewhere over here where it's
113:23 - farther than five units away from zero
113:26 - of course x could also have a distance
113:28 - equal to five units so i'll fill in that
113:31 - dot and shade in the other parts of the
113:34 - number line that satisfy my inequality
113:38 - now i can rewrite the inequality without
113:40 - the absolute value symbols by saying
113:42 - that x is less than or equal to negative
113:45 - 5 or
113:47 - x is greater than or equal to 5.
113:50 - i could also write this in interval
113:52 - notation
113:54 - soft bracket negative infinity negative
113:56 - five hard bracket
113:58 - and the second part is hard bracket five
114:02 - infinity soft bracket
114:04 - i combine these with a u for union
114:07 - because i'm trying to describe all these
114:09 - points on the number line together with
114:11 - all these other points
114:13 - let's take this analysis a step further
114:15 - with a slightly more complicated problem
114:17 - now i want the absolute value of 3 minus
114:20 - 2t to be less than 4.
114:23 - an absolute value less than 4 means a
114:26 - distance less than 4 on the number line
114:29 - but it's not the variable t that lives
114:32 - in here at a distance of less than 4
114:34 - from 0 it's the whole expression
114:36 - 3 minus 2t
114:39 - so 3
114:40 - minus 2t
114:42 - lives somewhere in here and i can
114:45 - rewrite this as an inequality without
114:47 - absolute value signs by saying
114:50 - negative 4 is less than 3 minus 2t is
114:54 - less than 4.
114:56 - now i have a compound inequality that i
114:58 - can solve the usual way first i'll
115:01 - subtract 3 from all three sides to get
115:04 - negative seven is less than negative two
115:06 - t is less than one
115:08 - and now i'll divide all three sides by
115:11 - negative two
115:12 - since negative two is a negative number
115:15 - this reverses the directions of the
115:17 - inequalities
115:20 - simplifying i get 7 halves is greater
115:23 - than t is greater than negative one-half
115:26 - so my final answer on the number line
115:29 - looks like all the stuff between
115:31 - negative a half and seven halves
115:35 - but not including the end points and in
115:38 - interval notation i can write this soft
115:40 - bracket negative a half seven halves
115:42 - soft bracket
115:44 - please pause the video and try the next
115:46 - problem on your own
115:48 - thinking in terms of distance this
115:50 - inequality says that the distance
115:52 - between the expression 3 minus 2t and 0
115:56 - is always bigger than 4.
115:58 - let me draw this on the number line
116:01 - if 3 minus 2t has a distance bigger than
116:04 - 4 from 0 then it can't be in this region
116:08 - that's near zero it has to be on the
116:10 - outside in one of these two regions
116:14 - that is
116:15 - 3 minus 2t is either less than negative
116:19 - 4
116:19 - or
116:20 - 3 minus 2t is bigger than 4.
116:24 - i'll solve these two inequalities
116:25 - separately the first one subtracting 3
116:28 - from both sides i get negative 2t
116:30 - is less than negative 7. dividing by
116:34 - negative 2 i get t is bigger than 7
116:37 - halves
116:38 - and then on the other side i get
116:40 - negative 2t is greater than 1 so t is
116:44 - less than negative one-half
116:48 - i had to flip inequalities in the last
116:50 - step
116:50 - due to dividing by a negative number
116:53 - so let's check this out on the number
116:54 - line again the first piece
116:57 - says that t is greater than seven halves
117:01 - i'll draw that over here
117:04 - and the second piece
117:06 - says that t is less than negative
117:09 - one-half i'll draw that down here
117:14 - because these two statements are joined
117:16 - with an or i'm looking for the t-values
117:19 - that are in this one or in this one that
117:22 - is i want both of these regions put
117:24 - together
117:26 - so in interval notation this reads
117:29 - negative infinity to negative one half
117:31 - soft bracket union
117:33 - soft bracket seven halves to infinity
117:36 - this last example looks more complicated
117:39 - but if i simplify first and isolate the
117:42 - absolute value part it looks pretty much
117:44 - like the previous ones
117:46 - so i'll start by subtracting 7 from both
117:49 - sides
117:50 - and then i'll divide both sides by 2.
117:52 - now i'll draw my number line
117:56 - and i'm looking for
117:57 - this expression 4x plus 5 to always have
118:00 - distance greater than or equal to
118:02 - negative 3 from 0. wait a second
118:06 - distance greater than or equal to
118:07 - negative three well distance is always
118:09 - greater than or equal to negative three
118:10 - it's always greater than or equal to
118:11 - zero
118:12 - so this in fact is always true
118:16 - and so the answer to my inequality is
118:20 - all numbers between negative infinity
118:22 - and infinity
118:24 - in other words all real numbers
118:29 - when solving absolute value inequalities
118:31 - it's good to think about distance
118:34 - an absolute value of something that's
118:36 - less than a number
118:38 - means that
118:40 - whatever is inside the absolute value
118:42 - signs is close to zero
118:46 - on the other hand an absolute value of
118:48 - something being greater than a number
118:51 - means that whatever's inside the
118:53 - absolute value sign
118:55 - is far away from zero
118:58 - because its distance from zero is bigger
119:01 - than a certain number
119:03 - drawing these pictures on the number
119:05 - line is a helpful way to rewrite the
119:07 - absolute value inequality as an
119:10 - inequality that doesn't contain an
119:11 - absolute value sign
119:13 - in this case it would be negative three
119:16 - is less than x plus two is less than
119:18 - three
119:19 - and the other case it would be
119:21 - either x plus two is less than negative
119:24 - three or x plus two is greater than
119:27 - three
119:29 - this video is about solving linear
119:31 - inequalities those are inequalities like
119:33 - this one
119:35 - that involve a variable here x but don't
119:38 - involve any x squared or other higher
119:40 - power terms
119:42 - the good news is we can solve linear
119:45 - inequalities just like we'd solve linear
119:46 - equations by distributing adding and
119:49 - subtracting terms to both sides and
119:51 - multiplying and dividing by numbers on
119:53 - both sides the only thing that's
119:55 - different
119:57 - is that if you
119:58 - multiply or divide by a negative number
120:01 - then you need to reverse the direction
120:04 - of the inequality
120:05 - for example if we had the inequality
120:07 - negative x is less than negative 5 and
120:11 - we wanted to multiply both sides by
120:13 - negative 1 to get rid of the negative
120:15 - signs
120:16 - we'd have to also switch or reverse the
120:19 - inequality
120:21 - with this caution in mind let's look at
120:23 - our first example
120:25 - since our variable x is trapped in
120:27 - parentheses i'll distribute the negative
120:29 - five to free it from the parentheses
120:32 - that gives me negative five x minus ten
120:34 - plus three is greater than eight
120:38 - negative ten plus 3 is negative 7 so
120:40 - i'll rewrite this as negative 5 x minus
120:43 - 7 is greater than 8.
120:46 - now i'll add 7 to both sides to get
120:49 - negative 5x is greater than 15.
120:52 - now i'd like to divide both sides by
120:54 - negative 5 since negative 5 is a
120:57 - negative number that reverses the
120:59 - inequality
121:01 - so i get x is less than 15 divided by
121:04 - negative 5 in other words x is less than
121:07 - negative three
121:09 - if i wanted to graph this on a number
121:11 - line i just need to put down a negative
121:13 - three an open circle around it and shade
121:16 - in to the left
121:19 - i use an open circle because x is
121:21 - strictly less than negative 3 and can't
121:23 - equal negative 3.
121:25 - if i wanted to write this in interval
121:27 - notation i write it as soft bracket
121:29 - negative infinity negative 3 soft
121:31 - bracket
121:32 - again the soft bracket is because the
121:34 - negative 3 is not included
121:37 - this next example is an example of a
121:39 - compound inequality
121:41 - it has two parts
121:43 - either
121:44 - this statement is true or this statement
121:47 - is true i want to find the values of x
121:49 - that satisfy either one
121:51 - i'll solve this by working out each part
121:54 - separately and then combining them at
121:56 - the end
121:57 - for the inequality on the left i'll copy
122:00 - it over here
122:01 - i'm going to add 4 to both sides
122:05 - then subtract x from both sides
122:09 - and then divide both sides by 2.
122:13 - i didn't have to reverse the inequality
122:15 - sign because i divided by a positive
122:17 - number
122:18 - on the right side
122:20 - i'll copy the equation over
122:22 - subtract one from both sides
122:24 - and divide both sides by six
122:28 - nine sixths is the same as three halves
122:31 - now i'm looking for the x values that
122:32 - make this statement true
122:34 - or
122:35 - make this statement true
122:37 - let me graph this on a number line
122:40 - x is less than or equal to negative 2
122:43 - means i put a filled in circle there
122:46 - and graph everything to the left
122:50 - x is greater than three halves
122:53 - means i put an empty circle here and
122:56 - shade in everything to the right
122:58 - my final answer includes both of these
123:01 - pieces which i'll
123:03 - reshade in green
123:05 - because x is allowed to be in either one
123:08 - or the other
123:09 - finally i can write this in interval
123:11 - notation
123:12 - the first piece on the number line can
123:14 - be described as soft bracket negative
123:17 - infinity
123:18 - negative two hard bracket and the second
123:21 - piece can be described as soft bracket
123:24 - three halves infinity soft bracket
123:27 - to indicate that x can be in either one
123:30 - of these pieces i use the union sign
123:33 - which is a u
123:35 - that means that my answer includes
123:37 - all x values in here together with all x
123:40 - values in here
123:43 - this next example is also a compound
123:45 - inequality this time joined by an and
123:48 - the and means i'm looking for all y
123:49 - values that satisfy both this
123:52 - and this at the same time
123:55 - again i can solve each piece separately
123:59 - on the left
124:00 - to isolate the y i need to multiply by
124:04 - negative three halves on both sides
124:07 - so that gives me y is less than negative
124:11 - 12 times negative three halves the
124:13 - greater than flipped to a
124:15 - less than because i was multiplying by
124:18 - negative three halves which is a
124:20 - negative number
124:22 - if i clean up the right side i get y is
124:24 - less than
124:26 - 18.
124:28 - on the right side i'll start by
124:29 - subtracting 2 from both sides
124:33 - and now i'll divide by negative 4
124:36 - again a negative number so that flips
124:39 - the inequality
124:41 - so that's y is less than
124:43 - 3 over negative 4. in other words y is
124:46 - less than negative 3 4.
124:48 - again i'm looking for
124:50 - the y values that make both of these
124:52 - statements true at the same time
124:55 - let me graph this on the number line
125:00 - the
125:01 - y is less than 18
125:03 - i can graph that by drawing the number
125:06 - 18
125:08 - i don't want to include it so i use an
125:10 - empty circle and i shaded everything to
125:12 - the left
125:14 - the
125:15 - statement y is less than negative
125:17 - three-fourths
125:18 - i need to draw a negative 3 4
125:21 - and again i don't include it but i do
125:24 - include everything on the left
125:27 - since i want the y values for which both
125:29 - of these statements are true i need the
125:31 - y values that are in both colored blue
125:34 - and colored red and so that would be
125:37 - this part right here i'll just draw it
125:40 - above so you can see it easily so that
125:42 - would be all the numbers from negative 3
125:45 - 4 and lower
125:46 - not including negative 3 4. since those
125:48 - are the parts the number line that have
125:50 - both red and blue colors on them
125:53 - in interval notation my final answer
125:55 - will be soft bracket negative infinity
125:58 - to negative three-fourths soft bracket
126:03 - as my final example i have an inequality
126:05 - that has two inequality signs in it
126:08 - negative 3 is less than or equal to 6x
126:10 - minus 2 is less than 10.
126:12 - i can think of this as being a compound
126:14 - inequality with two parts negative three
126:17 - x is less than or equal to six x minus
126:20 - two
126:21 - and at the same time
126:23 - six x minus two is less than ten
126:26 - i could solve this in two pieces as
126:28 - before
126:29 - but instead it's a little more efficient
126:31 - to just solve it all at once
126:33 - by doing the same thing to all three
126:35 - sides
126:37 - so as a first step i'll add 2 to all
126:40 - three sides that gives me negative 1 is
126:43 - less than or equal to 6x is less than
126:45 - 12 and now i'm going to divide all three
126:49 - sides by 6 to isolate the x so that
126:52 - gives me negative 1 6 is less than or
126:54 - equal to x is less than 2.
126:57 - if we'd solved it instead in two pieces
127:00 - above we'd end up with the same thing
127:02 - because we'd get
127:03 - negative 1 6 is less than or equal to x
127:05 - from this piece and we'd get
127:08 - x is less than 2 on this piece and
127:11 - because of the and statement that's the
127:12 - same thing as saying negative 1 6 is
127:15 - less or equal to x which is less than 2.
127:18 - either way we do it
127:20 - let's see if what it looks like on the
127:22 - number line
127:23 - so on the number line we're looking for
127:25 - things that are between
127:28 - 2
127:29 - and negative 1 6
127:31 - including the negative 1 6 but not
127:34 - including the 2.
127:35 - in interval notation we can write this
127:37 - as hard bracket negative 1 6
127:40 - to soft bracket
127:42 - in this video we solved linear
127:44 - inequalities including some compound
127:46 - inequalities joined by the conjunctions
127:49 - and
127:50 - and or
127:52 - remember when we're working with and
127:54 - we're looking for places on the number
127:55 - line where both statements are true
127:59 - that is we're looking for the overlap on
128:01 - the number line
128:04 - in this case the points on the number
128:06 - line that are colored both red and blue
128:09 - at the same time
128:11 - when we're working with or statements
128:13 - we're looking for places where either
128:16 - one or the other statement is true or
128:18 - both
128:20 - on the number line
128:22 - this corresponds to points that are
128:24 - colored either red or blue or both
128:27 - and in this picture that would actually
128:29 - correspond to the entire number line
128:32 - in this video we'll solve inequalities
128:34 - involving polynomials like this one
128:37 - and inequalities involving rational
128:39 - expressions like this one
128:42 - let's start with a simple example maybe
128:44 - a deceptively simple example if you see
128:47 - the inequality x squared is less than 4
128:51 - you might be very tempted to take the
128:52 - square root of both sides and get
128:54 - something like x is less than 2 as your
128:57 - answer
128:58 - but in fact that doesn't work
129:02 - to see why it's not correct consider the
129:04 - x value of
129:07 - negative 10.
129:09 - negative 10 satisfies
129:12 - the inequality x is less than 2 since
129:15 - negative 10 is less than two
129:18 - but it doesn't satisfy the inequality x
129:21 - squared is less than four
129:23 - since negative ten
129:25 - squared is a hundred which is not less
129:28 - than four
129:30 - so these two inequalities are not the
129:32 - same
129:33 - and it doesn't work to solve a quadratic
129:36 - inequality just to take the square root
129:37 - of both sides
129:39 - you might be thinking part of why this
129:41 - reasoning is wrong is we've ignored the
129:43 - negative two option right if we had the
129:45 - equation
129:46 - x squared equals 4 then x equals 2 would
129:50 - just be one option x equals negative 2
129:52 - would be another solution
129:54 - so somehow our solution to this
129:56 - inequality should take this into account
130:00 - in fact a good way to solve an
130:02 - inequality involving x squareds or
130:04 - higher power terms is to solve the
130:07 - associated equation first
130:09 - but before we even do that i like to
130:12 - pull everything over to one side so that
130:14 - my inequality has zero on the other side
130:18 - so for our equation i'll subtract four
130:20 - from both sides to get x squared minus
130:22 - four is less than zero
130:25 - now i'm going to actually solve the
130:27 - associated equation x squared minus 4 is
130:31 - equal to 0.
130:33 - i can do this by factoring
130:35 - to x minus 2 times x plus 2 is equal to
130:38 - 0 and
130:40 - i'll set my factors equal to 0 and i get
130:43 - x equals 2 and x equals minus 2.
130:46 - now i'm going to plot the solutions to
130:49 - my equation on the number line so i
130:51 - write down negative 2 and 2.
130:53 - those are the places where my expression
130:55 - x squared minus 4 is equal to 0.
130:59 - since i want to find where x squared
131:01 - minus 4 is less than 0 i want to know
131:04 - where this expression x squared minus 4
131:06 - is positive or negative
131:08 - a good way to find that out is to plug
131:10 - in test values
131:12 - so first i'll plug in a test value
131:15 - in this area of the number line
131:17 - something less than negative 2 say x
131:19 - equals negative 3.
131:21 - if i plug in negative 3 into x squared
131:24 - minus 4 i get negative 3 squared minus 4
131:28 - which is 9 minus 4 which is 5. that's a
131:32 - positive number
131:33 - so at negative 3
131:35 - the expression x squared minus 4 is
131:38 - positive and in fact everywhere on this
131:41 - region of the number line my expression
131:43 - is going to be positive because it can't
131:45 - jump from positive to negative without
131:47 - going through a place where it's zero
131:50 - i can figure out whether x squared minus
131:52 - 4 is positive or negative on this region
131:54 - and on this region of the number line by
131:56 - plugging in test values similarly
131:59 - a value to plug in between negative 2
132:01 - and 2 a nice value is x equals 0.
132:04 - 0 squared minus 4 that's negative 4 a
132:07 - negative number so i know that my
132:09 - expression x squared minus 4 is negative
132:11 - on this whole interval
132:14 - finally i can plug in something like x
132:16 - equals 10 something bigger than 2
132:19 - and i get 10 squared minus 4. without
132:22 - even computing that i can tell that
132:24 - that's going to be a positive number and
132:25 - that's all that's important
132:27 - again since i want x squared minus 4 to
132:29 - be less than 0 i'm looking for the
132:31 - places on this number line where i'm
132:33 - getting negatives
132:34 - so i'll shade that in on my number line
132:37 - it's in here
132:38 - not including the endpoints because the
132:40 - endpoints are where my expression x
132:42 - squared minus 4 is equal to zero and i
132:44 - want it strictly less than zero
132:47 - i can write my answer as an inequality
132:49 - negative 2 is less than x is less than 2
132:53 - or in interval notation as soft bracket
132:56 - negative 2 to soft bracket
132:59 - our next example we can solve similarly
133:03 - first we'll move everything to one side
133:06 - so that our inequality is x cubed minus
133:09 - five x squared minus six x is greater
133:12 - than or equal to zero
133:14 - next we'll solve the associated equation
133:18 - by factoring
133:20 - so first i'll write down the equation
133:22 - now i'll factor out an x
133:25 - and now i'll factor the quadratic
133:28 - so the solutions to my equation are x
133:31 - equals 0 x equals 6 and x equals
133:33 - negative 1.
133:35 - i'll write the solutions to the equation
133:37 - on the number line
133:41 - so that's
133:42 - negative one
133:44 - zero
133:45 - and six
133:47 - that's where my expression x times x
133:49 - minus six times x plus one is equal to
133:53 - zero
133:56 - but i want to find where it's greater
133:59 - than or equal to 0 so again i can use
134:01 - test values
134:03 - i can plug in for example x equals
134:05 - negative 2
134:07 - either to this version of the expression
134:09 - or to this factored version
134:11 - since i only care whether my answer is
134:13 - positive or negative it's sometimes
134:14 - easier to use the factored version for
134:17 - example when x is negative 2
134:19 - this factor is negative
134:22 - but this factor
134:24 - x minus 6 is also negative when i plug
134:27 - in negative 2 for x
134:31 - finally
134:32 - x plus 1 when i plug in negative 2 for x
134:35 - that's negative 1 that's also negative
134:38 - and a negative times a negative times a
134:39 - negative gives me a negative number
134:42 - if i plug in something
134:44 - between negative 1 and 0 say x equals
134:48 - negative 1 half
134:50 - then i'm going to get a negative for
134:52 - this factor a negative for this factor
134:54 - but a positive for this third factor
134:58 - negative times negative times positive
135:00 - gives me a positive
135:03 - for a test value between 0 and 6 let's
135:06 - try x equals 1.
135:09 - now i'll get a positive for this factor
135:12 - a negative for this factor and a
135:14 - positive for this factor
135:17 - a positive times a negative times a
135:19 - positive gives me a negative
135:22 - finally
135:23 - for a test value bigger than six we
135:25 - could use say x equals a hundred
135:28 - that's going to give me positive
135:30 - positive positive
135:32 - so my product will be positive
135:37 - since i want values where my expression
135:39 - is greater than or equal to zero
135:41 - i want the places where it equals zero
135:46 - and the places where it's positive
135:50 - so my final answer will be
135:53 - close bracket negative 1 to 0 close
135:55 - bracket union close bracket 6 to
135:58 - infinity
136:01 - as our final example let's consider the
136:03 - rational inequality
136:05 - x squared plus 6x plus 9 divided by x
136:09 - minus 1 is less than or equal to 0.
136:12 - although it might be tempting to clear
136:14 - the denominator and multiply both sides
136:16 - by x minus 1 it's dangerous to do that
136:19 - because x minus 1 could be a positive
136:21 - number but it could also be a negative
136:24 - number and when you multiply both sides
136:26 - by a negative number you have to reverse
136:28 - the inequality
136:29 - although it's possible to solve the
136:32 - inequality this way by thinking of cases
136:34 - where x minus one is less than zero or
136:36 - bigger than zero i think it's much
136:39 - easier just to solve the same way as we
136:40 - did before
136:42 - so we'll start by rewriting so that we
136:44 - move all terms to the left and have 0 on
136:47 - the right well that's already true
136:49 - so the next step would be to solve the
136:52 - associated equation
136:56 - that is
136:57 - x squared plus 6x plus 9 over x minus 1
137:00 - is equal to 0.
137:03 - that would be where the numerator is 0 x
137:05 - squared plus 6x plus 9 is equal to 0 so
137:08 - where x plus 3
137:10 - squared is 0 or x equals negative 3.
137:14 - there's one extra step we have to do for
137:16 - rational expressions and that's we need
137:19 - to find where
137:20 - the expression does not exist
137:23 - that is let's find where the denominator
137:25 - is 0 and that's at x equals 1.
137:29 - i'll put all those numbers on the number
137:31 - line
137:32 - the places where my rational expression
137:34 - is equal to 0 and the place where my
137:37 - rational expression doesn't exist
137:40 - then i can start in with test values
137:42 - for example x equals minus 4
137:46 - 0 and 2 work
137:49 - if i plug those values into this
137:51 - expression here i get a negative answer
137:54 - a negative answer and a positive answer
137:57 - the reason i need to conclude the values
137:59 - on my number line where my denominator
138:02 - is 0 is because
138:04 - i can my expression can switch from
138:05 - negative to positive by passing through
138:08 - a place where my rational expression
138:10 - doesn't exist
138:12 - as well as passing by passing through
138:14 - through a place where my rational
138:15 - expression is equal to zero
138:17 - now i'm looking for where my original
138:20 - expression was less than or equal to
138:21 - zero so that means i want the places on
138:24 - the number line where my expression is
138:27 - equal to 0
138:29 - and also the places where it's negative
138:33 - so my final answer is
138:35 - x is less than 1 or in interval notation
138:38 - negative infinity to 1.
138:42 - in this video we solved polynomial and
138:44 - rational inequalities by making a number
138:47 - line and using test values to make a
138:50 - sign chart
138:53 - the distance formula can be used to find
138:55 - the distance between two points
138:58 - if we know their coordinates
139:01 - if this first point has coordinates x1
139:04 - y1 and the second point has coordinates
139:08 - x2 y2 then the distance between them is
139:12 - given by the formula the square root
139:15 - of x2 minus x1 squared plus
139:19 - y2 minus y1 squared
139:22 - this formula actually comes from the
139:24 - pythagorean theorem
139:26 - let me draw a right triangle
139:29 - with these two points as two of its
139:31 - vertices
139:34 - then the length of this side
139:37 - is the difference between the two x
139:40 - coordinates
139:41 - similarly the length of this vertical
139:43 - side is the difference between the two y
139:46 - coordinates
139:48 - now the pythagorean theorem says that
139:50 - for any right triangle
139:52 - with sides labeled a and b and
139:54 - hypotenuse labeled c
139:56 - we have that a squared plus b squared
139:59 - equals c squared
140:01 - well if we apply that to this triangle
140:03 - here
140:05 - this hypotenuse is the distance between
140:08 - the two points that we're looking for
140:11 - so pythagorean theorem says the square
140:14 - of this side length
140:16 - that is
140:17 - x2 minus x1 squared
140:20 - plus the square of this side length
140:23 - which is
140:25 - y2 minus y1 squared
140:28 - has to equal the square of the
140:30 - hypotenuse that is
140:32 - d squared
140:35 - taking the square root of both sides of
140:36 - this equation we get the square root of
140:40 - x2 minus x1 squared plus y2 minus y1
140:44 - squared is equal to d
140:47 - we don't have to worry about using plus
140:49 - or minus signs when we take the square
140:50 - root because
140:52 - distance is always positive
140:54 - so we've derived our distance formula
140:57 - now let's use it in an example
141:00 - let's find the distance between the two
141:02 - points
141:03 - negative one five
141:06 - so negative one
141:08 - five maybe over here and four 2.
141:15 - this notation just means that p is the
141:17 - point with coordinates negative 1 5
141:21 - and q
141:22 - is the point with coordinates 4 2.
141:26 - we have the distance formula
141:29 - let's think of p being the point with
141:31 - coordinates x1 y1 and q being the point
141:34 - with coordinates x2 y2
141:38 - but as we'll see it really doesn't
141:40 - matter which one is which
141:42 - plugging into our formula we get d is
141:44 - the square root of
141:47 - x2
141:49 - minus x1
141:51 - so that's
141:53 - 4 minus negative 1 squared
141:57 - and then we add
142:00 - y2
142:02 - minus y1
142:04 - so that's
142:05 - 2
142:06 - minus 5 squared
142:10 - working out the arithmetic a little bit
142:12 - 4 minus negative 1 that's 4 plus 1 or 5
142:15 - squared
142:16 - plus negative 3 squared so that's the
142:20 - square root of 25 plus 9 or the square
142:23 - root of 34.
142:26 - let's see what would have happened if
142:27 - we'd called this first point
142:30 - x2 y2 instead and the second point x1 y1
142:36 - then we would have gotten
142:37 - the same distance formula but we would
142:40 - have taken
142:41 - negative 1 minus 4
142:45 - and added
142:47 - the difference of y's squared so that's
142:50 - y2 5
142:52 - minus 2 squared
142:55 - so that gives us the square root of
142:57 - negative 5 squared plus 3 squared which
143:00 - works out to the same thing
143:04 - in this video we use the distance
143:07 - formula to find the distance between two
143:08 - points
143:10 - when writing down the distance formula
143:12 - sometimes students forget whether this
143:13 - is a plus or minus and whether these are
143:15 - pluses or minuses one way to remember is
143:18 - to think that the distance formula comes
143:20 - from the pythagorean theorem that's why
143:22 - there's a plus in here
143:25 - and then a minus in here because we're
143:28 - getting the difference between the
143:29 - coordinates to find the lengths of the
143:30 - sides
143:32 - the midpoint formula helps us find the
143:35 - coordinates of the midpoint of a line
143:37 - segment
143:39 - as long as we know the coordinates of
143:40 - the endpoints
143:43 - so let's call the coordinates of this
143:45 - endpoint x1 y1 and the coordinates of
143:48 - this other endpoint x2 y2
143:53 - the x-coordinate of the midpoint is
143:55 - going to be exactly halfway in between
143:58 - the x-coordinates of the endpoints
144:01 - to get a number halfway in between two
144:03 - other numbers we just take the average
144:10 - similarly the y-coordinate of this
144:12 - midpoint is going to be exactly halfway
144:14 - in between the y-coordinates of the
144:17 - endpoints
144:18 - so the y-coordinate of the midpoint is
144:20 - going to be the average
144:22 - of those y-coordinates
144:26 - so we see that the coordinates of the
144:28 - midpoint
144:30 - are x1 plus x2 over 2
144:33 - y1 plus y2 over 2.
144:37 - let's use this midpoint formula in an
144:39 - example
144:41 - we want to find the midpoint of the
144:43 - segment between the points
144:46 - negative 1
144:48 - 5
144:51 - and
144:52 - 4
144:54 - 2.
144:57 - let me draw the line segment between
144:59 - them so
145:01 - visually the midpoint is going to be
145:02 - somewhere around here
145:04 - but to find its exact coordinates we're
145:06 - going to use x1 plus x2 over 2 and y1
145:10 - plus y2 over 2
145:12 - where this first point is coordinates
145:16 - x1 y1 and the second point has
145:19 - coordinates x2 y2
145:21 - it doesn't actually matter which point
145:23 - you decide is x1 y1 and which one is x2
145:26 - y2 the formula will still give you the
145:28 - same answer for the midpoint
145:30 - so let's see i take my average of my x
145:33 - coordinates
145:34 - so that's
145:36 - negative 1 plus 4 over 2
145:39 - and the average of my y coordinates so
145:42 - that's 5 plus 2 over 2
145:45 - and i get
145:47 - 3 halves
145:48 - 7 halves
145:50 - as the coordinates of my midpoint
145:53 - in this video we use the midpoint
145:56 - formula to find the midpoint of a line
145:58 - segment just by taking the average of
146:00 - the x coordinates and the average of the
146:02 - y coordinates
146:03 - this video is about graphs and equations
146:06 - of circles
146:08 - suppose we want to find the equation of
146:09 - a circle
146:10 - of radius 5
146:12 - centered at the point 3
146:15 - 2.
146:16 - it'll look something like this
146:21 - for any point
146:22 - x y on the circle
146:25 - we know that
146:26 - the distance of that point x y from the
146:29 - center
146:30 - is equal to the radius that is 5. from
146:34 - the distance formula that distance
146:37 - of 5 is equal to the square root of the
146:40 - difference of the x coordinates
146:43 - that's x minus 3
146:46 - squared plus
146:49 - the difference of the y coordinates
146:51 - that's y
146:53 - minus 2
146:55 - squared
146:57 - and if i square both sides of that
146:59 - equation
147:00 - i get 5 squared
147:02 - is this square root squared
147:05 - in other words
147:06 - 25 is equal to x minus 3 squared plus y
147:11 - minus 2 squared since the square root
147:14 - and the squared undo each other
147:17 - a lot of times people will
147:18 - write the x minus 3 squared plus y minus
147:22 - 2 squared on the left side of the
147:23 - equation and the 25 on the right side of
147:26 - the equation this is the standard form
147:29 - for the equation of this circle
147:31 - this same reasoning can be generalized
147:33 - to find a general equation for a circle
147:36 - with radius r centered at a point h k
147:40 - for any point with coordinates x y
147:44 - on the circle
147:46 - the distance between the point with
147:48 - coordinates x y and the point with
147:50 - coordinates h k
147:51 - is equal to the radius r
147:54 - so we have that the distance is equal to
147:57 - r
147:58 - but by the distance formula that's the
148:00 - square root of the difference between
148:02 - the x coordinates
148:04 - x minus h squared
148:07 - plus
148:08 - the difference in the y coordinates y
148:10 - minus k squared
148:13 - squaring both sides as before we get r
148:16 - squared is the square root squared
148:21 - canceling the square root and the
148:23 - squared and rearranging the equation
148:25 - that gives us x minus h squared plus y
148:29 - minus k squared equals r squared
148:32 - that's the general formula for a circle
148:35 - with radius r
148:37 - and center h k
148:40 - notice that the coordinates h and k are
148:42 - subtracted here
148:44 - the two squares are added because they
148:47 - are in the distance formula and the
148:48 - radius is squared on the other side
148:51 - if you remember this general formula
148:53 - that makes it easy to write down the
148:55 - equation for a circle for example
148:58 - if we want the equation for a circle
149:02 - of radius
149:04 - 6 and center
149:06 - at zero negative three
149:10 - then we have r equals six
149:13 - and h k
149:15 - is our zero negative three so plugging
149:17 - into the formula
149:20 - we get
149:22 - x minus 0 squared plus y minus negative
149:27 - 3 squared equals 6 squared
149:30 - or simplified this is x squared plus y
149:34 - plus 3 squared equals 36.
149:39 - suppose we're given an equation like
149:41 - this one and we want to decide if it's
149:42 - the equation of a circle
149:44 - and if so what's the center and what's
149:46 - the radius
149:48 - well this equation matches the form for
149:50 - a circle x minus h squared plus y minus
149:54 - k squared equals r squared if we let h
149:58 - be 5
149:59 - y be negative 6 since that way
150:03 - subtracting a negative six is like
150:05 - adding a six
150:07 - five
150:08 - must be our r squared so that means that
150:11 - r is the square root of five
150:14 - so this is our radius
150:16 - and our center is the point 5 negative
150:20 - 6.
150:21 - and this is indeed the equation for a
150:23 - circle
150:25 - which we could then graph
150:27 - by putting down the center
150:30 - and estimating the radius which is a
150:32 - little bit more than 2.
150:36 - this equation might not look like the
150:38 - equation of a circle but it actually can
150:40 - be transformed
150:42 - to look like the equation of a circle
150:44 - we're trying to make it look like
150:46 - something of the form x minus h squared
150:49 - plus y minus k squared equals r squared
150:53 - first i'd like to get rid of the
150:55 - coefficients in front of the x squared
150:57 - and the y squared so i'm going to divide
150:58 - everything by 9.
151:00 - this gives me
151:02 - x squared plus y squared plus 8x minus
151:05 - 2y plus 4 equals 0.
151:08 - next i'm going to group the x terms
151:11 - together the x squared and the 8x so
151:14 - i'll write x squared plus 8x i'll group
151:17 - the y terms together the y squared minus
151:19 - 2y
151:22 - and i'll subtract the 4
151:25 - over to the other side
151:28 - this still doesn't look much like the
151:29 - equation of a circle but as the next
151:31 - step i'm going to do something called
151:33 - completing the square
151:35 - i'm going to take this coefficient of x
151:38 - 8 divide it by 2 and then square it
151:41 - in other words 8 over 2
151:44 - squared that's 4 squared which is 16.
151:48 - i'm going to add 16 to both sides of my
151:50 - equation
151:52 - so i'll add the 16 here
151:56 - and on the other side
151:59 - now i'm going to do the same thing to
152:00 - the coefficient of y
152:02 - negative 2
152:04 - divided by 2 is negative 1 square that
152:07 - and i get 1. so now i'm going to add
152:10 - a 1 to both sides but i'll put it near
152:13 - the y terms so i add a 1 there and then
152:16 - to keep things balanced i have to add it
152:18 - to the other side
152:20 - on the right side i have the number 13.
152:23 - on the left side i can wrap up this
152:26 - expression x squared plus 8x plus 16
152:30 - into
152:31 - x plus 4 squared
152:34 - to
152:35 - convince you that's correct
152:37 - if we multiply out x plus 4 times x plus
152:39 - 4 we get x squared plus 4x plus 4x plus
152:44 - 16 or x squared plus 8x plus 16. the
152:48 - same thing we have right here
152:51 - similarly we can wrap up y squared minus
152:54 - 2y plus 1
152:56 - as
152:58 - y
152:59 - minus 1 squared
153:02 - again i'll work out the distribution
153:04 - down here that's y squared minus y minus
153:07 - y plus one or y squared minus two y plus
153:09 - one just like we have up here
153:13 - if you're wondering how i knew to use
153:16 - four and minus one
153:18 - the four came from taking half of 8
153:21 - and the minus 1 came from taking half
153:24 - the negative 2.
153:26 - now we have an equation for a circle in
153:28 - standard form and we can read off the
153:31 - center
153:32 - which is negative 4
153:35 - negative 1
153:36 - and the radius
153:38 - which is the square root of 13.
153:43 - it might seem like magic that this trick
153:45 - of taking half of this coefficient and
153:48 - squaring it and adding it to both sides
153:50 - lets us
153:51 - wrap up
153:52 - this expression into this expression
153:54 - that's perfect square
153:55 - but to see why that works let's take a
153:58 - look at what happens if we expand out
154:01 - x minus h squared the thing that we're
154:03 - trying to get to
154:05 - so if we expand that out
154:07 - x minus h squared which is
154:10 - x minus h times x minus h is
154:14 - which multiplies out to x squared
154:17 - minus hx minus hx plus h squared
154:21 - or x squared minus 2hx plus h squared
154:26 - now if we start out with this part with
154:30 - some x squared term and some coefficient
154:33 - of x and we're trying to decide what to
154:35 - add on in order to wrap it up into x
154:37 - minus h squared the thing to add on
154:41 - is h squared here which comes from half
154:44 - of this coefficient squared right
154:46 - because half of negative 2h is 8
154:48 - negative h square that you get the h
154:50 - squared and then when we do wrap it up
154:54 - it's half of this coefficient of x that
154:57 - appears
154:58 - right here
155:00 - this trick of completing the square is
155:02 - really handy for turning an equation for
155:04 - a circle in disguise into the standard
155:06 - equation for the circle
155:08 - in this video we found the standard
155:10 - equation for a circle x minus h squared
155:14 - plus y minus k squared equals r squared
155:18 - where r is the radius
155:20 - and
155:21 - h k
155:23 - is the center
155:25 - we also showed a method of completing
155:28 - the square
155:30 - when you have an equation for a circle
155:31 - in disguise
155:33 - completing the square will help you
155:35 - rewrite it into the standard form
155:39 - this video is about graphs and equations
155:42 - of lines
155:44 - here we're given the graph of a line we
155:46 - want to find the equation
155:48 - one standard format for the equation of
155:51 - a line is y equals mx plus b
155:55 - here m
155:56 - represents the slope and b
155:59 - represents the y-intercept the y-value
156:03 - where the line crosses the y-axis
156:06 - the slope is equal to the rise over the
156:10 - run or sometimes this is written as the
156:13 - change in y values over the change in x
156:16 - values
156:17 - or in other words y2 minus y1 over x2
156:21 - minus x1
156:22 - where
156:24 - x1 y1
156:26 - and x2 y2 are points on the line
156:30 - while we could use any two points on the
156:32 - line to find the slope it's convenient
156:34 - to use points where the x and y
156:37 - coordinates are integers that is points
156:39 - where the line passes through
156:42 - grid points so here would be one
156:44 - convenient point to use and here's
156:46 - another convenient point to use
156:49 - the coordinates of the first point are 1
156:52 - 2
156:53 - and the next point this is let's see 5
156:56 - negative 1.
156:57 - now i can find the slope by looking at
157:00 - the rise over the run
157:02 - so as i go through a run of this
157:05 - distance i go through a rise of that
157:08 - distance it's actually going to be a
157:09 - negative rise or a fall because my line
157:12 - is pointing down so let's see counting
157:14 - off squares this is a run of 1 2 3 four
157:17 - squares and a rise of
157:19 - one two three so negative three so my
157:22 - slope
157:23 - is going to be
157:25 - negative three
157:27 - over four
157:29 - i got that answer by counting squares
157:31 - but i could have also gotten it by
157:33 - looking at the difference in my y values
157:35 - over the difference of my x values
157:38 - that is i could have done
157:41 - negative 1 minus 2
157:44 - that's from my difference in y values
157:47 - and divide that by my difference in x
157:50 - values
157:51 - which is 5 minus 1 that gives me
157:55 - negative 3 over 4
157:57 - as before
157:59 - so my m
158:00 - is negative three-fourths
158:04 - now i need to figure out
158:05 - the value of b my y-intercept
158:08 - well i could just read it off the graph
158:10 - it looks like approximately 2.75 but if
158:13 - i want to be more accurate i can again
158:15 - use a point that has integer coordinates
158:17 - that i know its exact coordinates
158:20 - so either this point or that point let's
158:22 - try this point
158:24 - and i can start off with my equation y
158:26 - equals mx plus b
158:29 - that is y equals negative 3 4 x plus b
158:33 - and i can plug in
158:35 - the point
158:36 - 1 2
158:38 - for my x and y
158:41 - so that gives me
158:42 - 2
158:43 - equals negative 3 4 times 1 plus b
158:46 - solving for b
158:48 - let's see that's 2 equals negative 3 4
158:51 - plus b
158:52 - so add 3 4 to both sides that's 2 plus 3
158:56 - 4 equals b
158:58 - so b is
159:00 - 8 4 plus 3 4 which is 11 4 which is
159:04 - actually just what i eyeballed it to be
159:07 - so now i can write out my final equation
159:10 - for my line y equals
159:12 - negative 3 4 x plus 11 4 by plugging in
159:17 - for m and b
159:19 - next let's find the equation for this
159:21 - horizontal line
159:24 - horizontal line has slope zero so if we
159:26 - think of it as y equals mx plus b
159:30 - m is going to be zero in other words
159:32 - it's just y equals b y is some constant
159:35 - so if we can figure out what that
159:38 - that constant y value is it looks like
159:41 - it's uh
159:43 - 2 let's see that's 3 3 and a half we can
159:46 - just write down the equation directly y
159:48 - equals 3.5
159:52 - for a vertical line like this one
159:55 - it doesn't really have a slope i mean if
159:58 - you tried to do the rise over the run
160:01 - there's no run so you i guess you'd be
160:03 - dividing by zero and get an infinite
160:05 - slope but but instead we just think of
160:07 - it as an equation of the form
160:10 - x equals something
160:13 - and in this case x equals negative 2
160:16 - notice that all of the points on our
160:18 - line have the same x coordinate of
160:20 - negative 2 and the y coordinate can be
160:22 - anything
160:23 - so this is how we write the equation for
160:25 - a vertical line
160:28 - in this example we're not shown a graph
160:31 - of the line we're just told that it goes
160:32 - through two points but knowing that it
160:35 - goes through two points is enough to
160:37 - find the equation for the line
160:39 - first we can find the slope by taking
160:43 - the difference in y values over the
160:46 - difference in x values so that's
160:49 - negative three minus two
160:51 - over four minus one which is negative
160:54 - five thirds
160:57 - so we can
160:59 - use the
161:00 - standard equation for the line this is
161:02 - called the
161:03 - slope intercept form
161:08 - and we can plug in negative five thirds
161:11 - and we can use one point
161:14 - either one will do we'll still get the
161:16 - same final answer so let's use 1 2 and
161:19 - plug that in to get 2 equals negative 5
161:22 - thirds times 1
161:24 - plus b
161:26 - and so b is
161:28 - 2
161:29 - plus five thirds which is six-thirds
161:32 - plus five-thirds which is eleven-thirds
161:35 - so our equation is y equals negative
161:36 - five-thirds x plus eleven-thirds
161:41 - this is method one
161:44 - method two
161:46 - uses a slightly different form of the
161:48 - equation it's called the point slope
161:50 - form and it goes y minus y naught
161:54 - is equal to m times x minus x naught
161:58 - where x naught y naught is a point on
162:01 - the line
162:02 - and m again is the slope
162:05 - so we calculate the slope the same way
162:08 - by taking a difference in y values over
162:10 - difference in x values
162:12 - but then we can simply plug in
162:15 - any point
162:18 - for example
162:19 - the point 1 2 will work we can plug 1 in
162:24 - for
162:24 - x naught and 2 in for y naught in this
162:28 - point-slope form that gives us y
162:32 - minus 2 is equal to minus 5 thirds x
162:37 - minus 1.
162:40 - notice that these two equations while
162:41 - they may look different are actually
162:43 - equivalent because if i distribute the
162:45 - negative 5 thirds
162:48 - and then add the 2 to both sides
162:58 - i get the same equation as above
163:05 - so we've seen two ways of finding the
163:07 - equation for the line
163:08 - using the slope-intercept form and using
163:11 - the point-slope form
163:15 - in this video we saw that you can find
163:17 - the equation for a line if you know the
163:20 - slope
163:22 - and you know one point
163:25 - you can also find the equation for the
163:27 - line if you know two points
163:30 - because you can use the two points to
163:32 - get the slope
163:33 - and then plug in one of those points to
163:36 - figure out the rest of the equation
163:39 - we saw two standard forms for the
163:41 - equation of a line
163:43 - the slope-intercept form y equals mx
163:46 - plus b
163:47 - where m is the slope and b is the
163:50 - y-intercept
163:52 - and
163:54 - the point-slope form
163:55 - y minus y-naught equals m times x minus
163:59 - x-naught where m again is the slope
164:02 - and naught y naught is a point on the
164:05 - line
164:08 - this video is about finding parallel and
164:11 - perpendicular lines
164:13 - suppose we have a line
164:15 - of slope 3 4 in other words the rise
164:20 - over the run
164:24 - is three over four
164:26 - then any other line that's parallel to
164:29 - this line will have the same slope the
164:32 - same rise over run
164:37 - so that's our first fact to keep in mind
164:40 - parallel lines have the same slopes
164:42 - suppose on the other hand we want to
164:44 - find a line perpendicular to our
164:46 - original line with its original slope of
164:50 - 3 4.
164:52 - a perpendicular line in other words a
164:55 - line at a 90 degree angle to our
164:57 - original line will have a slope
165:00 - that's the negative reciprocal of the
165:03 - opposite reciprocal of our original
165:05 - slope so we take the reciprocal
165:08 - of three-fourths that's four-thirds and
165:10 - we make it its opposite by changing it
165:13 - from positive to negative
165:15 - so i'll write this as a principle that
165:17 - perpendiculars lines
165:20 - have opposite reciprocal slopes
165:23 - to get the hang of what it means to be
165:25 - an opposite reciprocal let's look at a
165:27 - few examples
165:28 - so here's the original slope and this
165:31 - will be the
165:32 - opposite reciprocal which would
165:34 - represent the slope of our perpendicular
165:36 - line so for example if m1 was 2
165:40 - then the opposite reciprocal reciprocal
165:42 - of 2 is one-half opposite means i change
165:44 - the sign
165:46 - if the first slope turned out to be say
165:49 - negative 1 3
165:52 - the reciprocal of 1 3 is 3 over 1 or
165:55 - just 3 and the opposite means i change
165:58 - it from a negative to a positive so my
166:01 - perpendicular slope would be would be 3.
166:05 - one more example if i started off with
166:07 - the slope of say 7 halves then the
166:11 - reciprocal of that would be 2 7 and i
166:14 - change it to an opposite reciprocal by
166:17 - changing the positive to a negative
166:20 - let's use these two principles in some
166:23 - examples
166:25 - in our first example we need to find the
166:28 - equation of a line that's parallel to
166:29 - this lump and goes through the point
166:32 - negative 3 2.
166:34 - well in order to get started
166:36 - i need to figure out the slope of this
166:37 - line so let me put this line into a more
166:40 - standard form the the slope-intercept
166:42 - form so i'll start with 3y minus 4x plus
166:47 - 6 equals 0. i'm going to solve for y to
166:50 - put it in this this more standard form
166:52 - so i'll say 3y equals 4x minus 6 and
166:56 - then divide by 3 to get y equals
167:00 - 4 3x minus 6 thirds i've divided all my
167:03 - terms by 3 i can simplify that a little
167:06 - bit y equals 4 3 x minus 2.
167:09 - now i can read off the slope of my
167:12 - original line and 1 is 4 3. that means
167:16 - my slope of my new line my parallel line
167:20 - will also be four thirds so my new line
167:24 - will have the equation y equals four
167:27 - thirds x plus b for some b of course b
167:30 - will probably not be negative two like
167:32 - it was for the first line it'll be
167:34 - something else determined by the fact
167:36 - that it goes through this point negative
167:38 - 3 2.
167:39 - to figure out what b is i'll plug in the
167:41 - point negative 3 2 for negative 3 for x
167:44 - and 2 for y
167:46 - so that gives me 2 equals 4 3 times
167:49 - negative 3 plus b and i'll solve for b
167:53 - so
167:54 - let's see first let me just simplify so
167:56 - 2 equals
167:58 - this is negative 12 thirds plus b or in
168:02 - other words two is negative four plus b
168:05 - so that means that b is going to be six
168:08 - and my
168:09 - my parallel line will have the equation
168:11 - y equals four thirds x plus
168:14 - six
168:17 - next let's find the equation of a line
168:19 - that's perpendicular to a given line
168:22 - through and go through a given point
168:24 - again in order to get started i need to
168:26 - find what the slope of this given line
168:28 - is
168:29 - so i'll rewrite it well first i'll just
168:31 - copy it over 6x plus 3y equals 4 and
168:35 - then i can put it in the standard
168:38 - slope intercept form by solving for y so
168:41 - 3y is negative six x plus four divide
168:45 - everything by three i get y equals
168:48 - negative six thirds x plus four thirds
168:51 - so y is negative two x plus four thirds
168:55 - so on my original slope of my original
168:57 - line is negative two which means my
169:00 - perpendicular slope is the opposite
169:02 - reciprocal so i take the reciprocal of
169:05 - of negative two that's negative one half
169:07 - and i change the sign so that gives me
169:10 - one half as the slope of my
169:11 - perpendicular line
169:13 - now my new line
169:15 - i know is going to be y equals one-half
169:17 - x plus b for some b
169:20 - and i can plug in
169:22 - my point on my new line
169:24 - so 1 for y
169:26 - and 4
169:28 - for x
169:29 - and solve for b so i get 1 equals 2 plus
169:33 - b so b is negative 1 and so my new line
169:36 - has equation
169:37 - 1 half x minus one
169:42 - these next two examples are a little bit
169:44 - different because now we're looking at a
169:46 - line parallel to
169:48 - a completely horizontal line let me
169:52 - draw this line y equals 3. so the
169:56 - y-coordinate is always 3 which means
169:58 - that my line will be a horizontal line
170:01 - through that height y equals 3. if i
170:04 - want something parallel to this line it
170:07 - will also be
170:08 - a horizontal line since it goes through
170:11 - the point negative 2 1
170:14 - let's see negative 2 1 it has to go
170:16 - through that point there
170:18 - it's going to have
170:20 - always have a y-coordinate of 1 the same
170:23 - as the y-coordinate of the point it goes
170:25 - through so my answer will just be y
170:27 - equals 1.
170:30 - in the next example we want a line
170:32 - that's perpendicular
170:34 - to the line y equals 4 another
170:39 - horizontal line y equals 4.
170:42 - but perpendicular means i'm going to
170:44 - need a vertical line so i need a
170:46 - vertical line that goes through the
170:47 - point
170:49 - 3
170:50 - 4
170:52 - okay
170:54 - and so i'm going to draw a vertical line
170:56 - there now vertical lines have the form
171:01 - x equals something for their equation
171:04 - and to find what x equals i just need to
171:06 - look at the x coordinate of the point
171:08 - i'm going through this point 3 4. so
171:10 - that x coordinate is 3 and all the
171:13 - points on this this perpendicular and
171:16 - vertical line have x coordinate 3 so my
171:19 - answer is x equals 3.
171:27 - in this video we use the fact that
171:29 - parallel lines have the same slope and
171:31 - perpendicular lines have opposite
171:32 - reciprocal slopes to find the equations
171:35 - of parallel and perpendicular lines
171:38 - this video introduces functions and
171:41 - their domains and ranges
171:44 - a function is a correspondence between
171:47 - input numbers usually the x values and
171:50 - output numbers usually the y values that
171:53 - sends each input number to exactly one
171:56 - output number
171:58 - sometimes a function is thought of as a
172:00 - rule or machine
172:03 - in which you can feed in
172:05 - x values as input and get out y values
172:08 - as output
172:10 - so a non-mathematical example of a
172:12 - function might be the biological mother
172:15 - function
172:16 - which takes as input any person
172:19 - and gives us output their biological
172:21 - mother
172:23 - this function satisfies the condition
172:26 - that each input number
172:28 - object person in this case
172:30 - gets sent to exactly one output person
172:34 - because if you take any person they just
172:36 - have one biological mother
172:39 - so that rule does give you a function
172:41 - but if i change things around
172:43 - and just use the
172:45 - the mother function which sends to each
172:48 - person their mother
172:50 - that's no longer going to be a function
172:52 - because there are some people who have
172:53 - more than one mother right they could
172:55 - have a biological mother an adopted
172:57 - mother or or a mother and a stepmother
173:00 - or any number of situations so since
173:02 - there's there's at least some people who
173:05 - you would put it as input and then you'd
173:07 - get like more than one possible output
173:09 - that violates this this rule of
173:11 - functions it would not be a function
173:14 - now most the time we'll work with
173:15 - functions that are described with
173:17 - equations not in terms of mothers so for
173:20 - example we could have the function y
173:21 - equals x squared plus one
173:24 - this can also be written as f of x
173:27 - equals x squared plus one
173:29 - here f of x is function notation that
173:31 - stands for the output value of y
173:35 - notice that this notation is not
173:37 - representing multiplication we're not
173:39 - multiplying f by x instead we're going
173:43 - to be putting in a value for x as input
173:46 - and getting out a value of f x or y
173:49 - for example if we want to evaluate f of
173:52 - 2
173:53 - we're plugging in 2 as input for x
173:56 - either in this equation or in that
173:58 - equation
173:59 - since
174:00 - f of 2 means 2 squared plus 1 f of 2 is
174:05 - going to equal 5.
174:07 - similarly f of 5 means i plug in 5 for x
174:13 - so that's going to be 5 squared plus 1
174:16 - or 26.
174:18 - sometimes it's useful to evaluate a
174:20 - function on a more complicated
174:22 - expression involving other variables in
174:24 - this case remember the function's value
174:27 - on any expression is just when you what
174:28 - you get when you plug in that whole
174:31 - expression for x
174:34 - so f of a plus three is going to be the
174:38 - quantity a plus three squared plus one
174:42 - we could rewrite that as a squared plus
174:46 - six a plus 9 plus 1 or a squared plus 6a
174:50 - plus 10.
174:52 - when evaluating a function on a complex
174:55 - expression it's important to keep the
174:57 - parentheses when you plug in for x
175:00 - that way
175:01 - you evaluate the function on the whole
175:03 - expression
175:05 - for example it would be wrong
175:08 - to write f of a plus 3 equals
175:12 - a plus 3 squared plus 1 without the
175:15 - parentheses because that would imply we
175:17 - were just squaring the 3
175:19 - and not the whole expression
175:21 - a plus 3.
175:25 - sometimes a function is described with a
175:27 - graph instead of an equation
175:29 - in this example
175:31 - this graph is supposed to represent
175:33 - the function g of x
175:36 - not all graphs actually represent
175:38 - functions for example the graph of a
175:40 - circle doesn't represent a function
175:43 - that's because the graph of a circle
175:45 - violates the vertical line test you can
175:47 - draw a vertical line and it'll intersect
175:50 - the graph in more than one point
175:52 - but our graph at left satisfies the
175:54 - vertical line test any vertical line
175:56 - intersects the graph in at most one
175:58 - point that means it's a function because
176:01 - every x value will have at most one y
176:03 - value that corresponds to it
176:06 - let's evaluate g of two
176:09 - note that two is an x value
176:12 - and we'll use the graph to find the
176:13 - corresponding y value
176:16 - so i look for 2 on the x axis
176:19 - and find the point on the graph that has
176:21 - that x value that's right here
176:24 - now i can look at the y value of that
176:27 - point looks like 3 and therefore g of 2
176:31 - is equal to 3.
176:33 - if i try to do the same thing to
176:35 - evaluate g of 5 i run into trouble
176:38 - 5 is an x value i look for it on the x
176:41 - axis but there's no point on the graph
176:44 - that has that x value
176:47 - therefore g of 5 is undefined or we can
176:51 - say it does not exist
176:53 - the question of what x values and y
176:55 - values make sense for a function leads
176:57 - us to a discussion of domain and range
177:01 - the domain of a function is all possible
177:03 - x values that make sense for that
177:05 - function
177:06 - the range is the y values that make
177:08 - sense for the function
177:10 - in this example we saw that the x value
177:12 - of 5 didn't have a corresponding y value
177:15 - for this function
177:17 - so the x value of 5 is not in the domain
177:20 - of our function g to find the x values
177:23 - in the domain we have to look at the x
177:25 - values that correspond to points on the
177:28 - graph
177:29 - one way to do that is to take the shadow
177:31 - or projection of the graph onto the
177:34 - x-axis and see what x values are hit
177:38 - it looks like we're hitting all x values
177:41 - starting at
177:42 - negative 8 and continuing up to 4.
177:46 - so our domain
177:48 - is the x's between negative 8
177:52 - and 4 including those endpoints or we
177:54 - can write this in interval notation as
177:56 - negative 8 comma 4 with square brackets
178:00 - to find the range of the function we
178:02 - look for the y values corresponding to
178:04 - points on this graph
178:06 - we can do that
178:08 - by taking the shadow or projection of
178:11 - the graph onto the y axis
178:16 - we seem to be hitting all y values
178:18 - from
178:19 - negative 5
178:21 - up through
178:22 - 3
178:24 - so our range
178:27 - is y is between negative 5
178:30 - and 3 we're in interval notation
178:32 - negative 5 3 with square brackets
178:36 - if we meet a function that's described
178:37 - as an equation instead of a graph
178:40 - one way to find the domain and range are
178:42 - to graph the function
178:44 - but it's often possible to find the
178:46 - domain at least more quickly by using
178:48 - algebraic considerations
178:50 - we think about what x values it makes
178:52 - sense to plug into this expression and
178:54 - what x values need to be excluded
178:56 - because they make the algebraic
178:58 - expression impossible to evaluate
179:00 - specifically to find the domain of a
179:02 - function
179:04 - we need to exclude
179:07 - x values that make the denominator zero
179:10 - since we can't divide by zero
179:13 - we also need to exclude x values
179:16 - that make an expression inside a square
179:18 - root sign
179:19 - negative since we can't take the square
179:21 - root of a negative number
179:23 - in fact we need to exclude values that
179:25 - make an expression inside any even root
179:29 - negative because we can't take an even
179:31 - root of a negative number even though we
179:32 - can take an odd root like a cube root of
179:35 - a negative number
179:36 - later when we look at logarithmic
179:38 - functions we'll have some additional
179:40 - exclusions that we have to make but for
179:42 - now these two principles should handle
179:44 - all functions we'll see
179:46 - so let's apply them to a couple examples
179:50 - for the function in part a
179:52 - we don't have any square root signs but
179:54 - we do have a denominator
179:56 - so we need to exclude x values that make
179:58 - the denominator zero in other words we
180:01 - need x squared minus four x plus three
180:05 - to not be equal to zero
180:07 - if we solve x squared minus 4x plus 3
180:11 - equal to 0 we can do that by factoring
180:15 - and that gives us x equals 3 or x equals
180:18 - 1. so we need to exclude these values
180:22 - all other x values should be fine so if
180:24 - i draw the number line i can put on 1
180:27 - and 3 and just dig out a hole at both of
180:30 - those and my domain includes everything
180:33 - else on the number line
180:35 - in interval notation this means my
180:38 - domain is everything from negative
180:40 - infinity to 1 together with everything
180:43 - from 1 to 3 together with
180:45 - everything from 3 to infinity
180:49 - in this second example
180:51 - we don't have any denominators to worry
180:52 - about but we do have a square root sign
180:55 - so we need to exclude
180:58 - any x values that make 3 minus 2x less
181:01 - than 0. in other words we can include
181:05 - all x values for which three minus two x
181:08 - is greater than or equal to zero
181:10 - solving that inequality gives us three
181:13 - is greater than or equal to two x
181:15 - in other words x
181:18 - is less than or equal to three halves
181:21 - i can draw this on the number line
181:24 - or write it in interval notation
181:28 - notice that three halves is included and
181:30 - that's because
181:32 - three minus 2x is allowed to be zero i
181:35 - can take the square root of zero it's
181:36 - just zero and that's not a problem
181:39 - finally let's look at a more complicated
181:41 - function that involves both a square
181:43 - root and a denominator
181:45 - now there are two things i need to worry
181:46 - about
181:48 - i need the denominator
181:51 - to not be equal to zero
181:54 - and i need the stuff inside the square
181:56 - root sign
181:57 - to be greater than or equal to zero
181:59 - from our earlier work we know that the
182:01 - first condition
182:02 - means that x is not equal to three and x
182:05 - is not equal to one and the second
182:08 - condition means that x is less than or
182:10 - equal to three halves
182:12 - let's draw both of those conditions on
182:15 - the number line
182:17 - x is not equal to 3 and x is not equal
182:20 - to 1
182:21 - means we've got everything
182:23 - except those two dugout points
182:26 - and the other condition x is less than
182:28 - or equal to three halves means we can
182:30 - have three halves
182:32 - and everything to the left of it
182:35 - now to be in our domain and to be legit
182:37 - for our function we need both of these
182:39 - conditions to be true so i'm going to
182:40 - connect these conditions with an and
182:43 - and that means we're looking for numbers
182:45 - on the number line that are colored both
182:46 - red and blue so i'll draw that above in
182:49 - purple so that's everything from three
182:52 - halves to one i have to dig out one
182:55 - because one was a problem for the
182:56 - denominator
182:57 - and then i can continue for all the
182:59 - things that are colored both both colors
183:01 - red and blue so my final domain is going
183:05 - to be
183:06 - let's see negative infinity
183:08 - up to but not including one together
183:11 - with
183:12 - one but not including it to three halves
183:15 - and i include three halves since that
183:17 - was colored both red and blue also
183:20 - in this video we talked about functions
183:22 - how to evaluate them and how to find
183:24 - domains and ranges
183:26 - this video gives the graphs of some
183:28 - commonly used functions that i call the
183:30 - toolkit functions
183:32 - the first function is the function y
183:34 - equals x
183:36 - let's plot a few points on the graph of
183:37 - this function
183:39 - if x is 0 y 0
183:42 - if x is 1 y is 1
183:44 - and so on y is always equal to x
183:48 - it doesn't have to just be an integer it
183:50 - can be any real number
183:52 - and while connecting the dots we get a
183:54 - straight line through the origin
183:57 - let's look at the graph of y equals x
183:59 - squared
184:00 - if x is zero y is zero so we go through
184:03 - the origin again
184:04 - if x is one
184:06 - y is 1
184:08 - and if x is negative 1 y is also 1.
184:13 - the x value of 2 gives a y value of 4
184:16 - and the x value of negative 2 gives a y
184:18 - value of 4 also
184:21 - connecting the dots we get a parabola
184:25 - notice this this function is an even
184:28 - function
184:30 - that means it has
184:32 - mirror symmetry across the y-axis the
184:34 - left side looks like exactly like the
184:36 - mirror image of the right side
184:39 - that happens because when you square a
184:41 - positive number like 2
184:43 - you get the exact same y value as when
184:45 - you
184:46 - square its mirror image x value of
184:49 - negative two
184:50 - the next function y equals x cubed
184:54 - i'll call that a cubic
184:56 - let's plot a few points when x is zero y
184:58 - is zero when x is one y is one when x is
185:02 - negative 1 y is negative 1.
185:05 - 2 goes with the point 8 way up here and
185:09 - an x value of negative 2 is going to
185:10 - give us negative 8.
185:12 - if i connect the dots
185:14 - i get something that looks kind of like
185:16 - this
185:18 - this function is what's called an odd
185:21 - function
185:22 - because it has
185:24 - 180 degree rotational symmetry acro
185:27 - around the origin if i rotate this whole
185:29 - graph by 180 degrees or in other words
185:31 - turn the paper upside down
185:34 - i'll get exactly the same shape
185:36 - the reason this function has this odd
185:38 - symmetry is because when i cube a
185:41 - positive number and get its y value
185:44 - i get and cube the the corresponding
185:47 - negative number to get its y value the
185:49 - negative number cubed gives us exactly
185:52 - the negative of the the y value we get
185:55 - with cubing the positive number
185:58 - let's look at the next example y equals
186:00 - the square root of x
186:02 - notice that the domain of this function
186:06 - is just
186:08 - x values bigger than or equal to 0
186:10 - because we can't take the square root of
186:11 - a negative number
186:13 - let's plug in a few x values x is zero
186:16 - gives y zero x is one square root of one
186:19 - is one
186:20 - square root of four is two
186:23 - and connecting the dots i get a function
186:25 - that looks like this
186:28 - the absolute value function is next
186:31 - again if we plug in a few points
186:34 - x is zero goes with y equals zero
186:36 - x is one gives us one the absolute value
186:40 - of negative one is 1.
186:43 - 2 2 is on the graph and the absolute
186:45 - value of negative 2 is 2.
186:48 - i'm ending up getting
186:50 - a v-shaped graph
186:52 - it also has
186:54 - even or mirror symmetry
186:57 - y equals 2 to the x is what's known as
187:00 - an exponential function
187:02 - that's because the variable x is in the
187:04 - exponent
187:06 - if i plot a few points
187:11 - two to the zero
187:12 - is one
187:15 - two to the one is two two squared is
187:18 - four
187:19 - two to the minus one is one half
187:22 - i'll plot these on my graph
187:24 - and let me fill in a few more points
187:27 - so let's see
187:28 - 2 cubed is 8 that's way up here
187:31 - and negative 2 gives me 1 4 1 8.
187:35 - connecting the dots i get something
187:37 - that's shaped like this
187:40 - you might have heard the expression
187:42 - exponential growth when talking about
187:44 - for example population growth
187:46 - this is function is represents
187:48 - exponential growth it it grows very very
187:51 - steeply every time we increase the x
187:54 - coordinate by 1 we double the y
187:57 - coordinate
188:00 - we could also look at a function like y
188:02 - equals 3 to the x or sometimes y equals
188:05 - e to the x
188:06 - where e is just a number about 2.7
188:10 - these functions look very similar it's
188:12 - just
188:13 - the bigger base makes us rise a little
188:16 - more steeply
188:19 - now let's look at the function y equals
188:21 - one over x
188:22 - it's not defined when x is zero
188:25 - but i can plug in x equals one half one
188:28 - over one half is two
188:30 - uh one over one is one and one over two
188:35 - is one half if i connect the dots i get
188:38 - this shape
188:40 - in the first quadrant but i haven't
188:41 - looked at negative values of x when x is
188:44 - negative one over negative one is
188:46 - negative one
188:47 - 1 over negative a half is negative 2
188:50 - and i get
188:51 - a similar looking piece in the third
188:54 - quadrant
188:55 - this is an example of a hyperbola
189:00 - and it's also an odd function because it
189:04 - has that 180 degree rotational symmetry
189:08 - if i turn the page upside down it'll
189:09 - look exactly the same
189:11 - finally let's look at y equals one over
189:14 - x squared
189:16 - again it's not defined when x is zero
189:18 - but i can plug in points like
189:20 - one-half for x let's see one over
189:23 - one-half squared is one over one-fourth
189:26 - which is four
189:29 - and
189:30 - one over one squared one over two
189:33 - squared is a fourth
189:35 - it looks pretty much like the previous
189:37 - function is just
189:38 - a little bit more extreme rises a little
189:40 - more steeply falls a little more
189:42 - dramatically
189:43 - but for negative values of x something a
189:45 - little bit different goes on for example
189:47 - 1 over negative 2 squared is just 1 over
189:50 - 4 which is
189:52 - a fourth
189:53 - so i can plot that point there and
189:57 - 1 over negative 1 squared that's just 1.
190:00 - so my curve for negative values of x is
190:03 - going to lie in the second quadrant not
190:05 - the third quadrant
190:07 - this is an example of an even function
190:11 - because it has perfect mirror symmetry
190:14 - across the y-axis
190:16 - these are the toolkit functions and i
190:19 - recommend you memorize the shape of each
190:21 - of them
190:23 - that way you can draw at least a rough
190:25 - sketch very quickly without having to
190:27 - plug in points
190:29 - that's all for the graphs of the toolkit
190:31 - functions
190:34 - if we change the equation of a function
190:36 - then the graph of the function changes
190:39 - or transforms in predictable ways
190:42 - this video gives some rules and examples
190:44 - for transformations of functions
190:47 - to get the most out of this video it's
190:49 - helpful if you're already familiar with
190:50 - the graph of some typical functions i
190:53 - call them toolkit functions like y
190:55 - equals square root of x y equals x
190:57 - squared y equals the absolute value of x
191:00 - and so on
191:01 - if you're not familiar with those graphs
191:03 - i encourage you to watch my video called
191:06 - toolkit functions first before watching
191:08 - this one
191:10 - i want to start by reviewing function
191:11 - notation
191:13 - if g of x represents the function the
191:15 - square root of x
191:17 - then we can rewrite these expressions in
191:19 - terms of square roots for example g of x
191:23 - minus 2
191:24 - is the same thing as the square root of
191:26 - x minus 2.
191:30 - g of quantity x minus 2 means we plug in
191:34 - x minus 2 everywhere we see an x
191:38 - so that would be the same thing as the
191:40 - square root of quantity x minus 2.
191:45 - in this second example i say that we're
191:47 - subtracting 2 on the inside of the
191:49 - function because we're subtracting 2
191:51 - before we apply the square root function
191:54 - whereas on the first example i say that
191:56 - the minus 2 is on the outside of the
191:58 - function we're doing the square root
192:00 - function first and then subtracting 2.
192:03 - in this third example g of 3x we're
192:06 - multiplying by 3 on the inside of the
192:08 - function
192:09 - to evaluate this in terms of square root
192:11 - we plug in the entire 3x for x in the
192:14 - square root function
192:16 - that gives us the square root of 3x
192:20 - in the next example we're multiplying by
192:22 - 3 on the outside of the function
192:24 - this is just 3 times the square root of
192:27 - x
192:28 - finally g of minus x means the square
192:31 - root of minus x
192:34 - this might look a little odd because
192:35 - we're not used to taking the square root
192:37 - of a negative number but remember that
192:39 - if x itself is negative like negative 2
192:42 - then negative x will be negative
192:44 - negative 2 or positive 2 so we'll really
192:46 - be taking the square root of a positive
192:47 - number in that case
192:50 - let me record which of these are inside
192:52 - and which of these are outside of my
192:53 - function
192:54 - in this next set of examples we're using
192:57 - the same function g of x squared of x
192:59 - but this time we're starting with an
193:00 - expression with square roots in it and
193:02 - trying to write it in terms of g of x
193:06 - so the first example
193:08 - the plus 17 is on the outside of my
193:10 - function because i'm taking the square
193:12 - root of x first and then adding 17. so i
193:15 - can write this as g of x plus 17.
193:20 - in the second example
193:22 - i'm taking x and adding 12 first then i
193:25 - take the square root of the whole thing
193:28 - since i'm adding the 12 to x first
193:29 - that's on the inside of my function so i
193:32 - write that as g of the quantity x plus
193:35 - 12.
193:37 - remember that this notation means i plug
193:39 - in the entire x plus 12
193:41 - into the square root sign which gives me
193:43 - exactly square root of x plus 12.
193:46 - in this next example i'm doing the
193:48 - square root first and then multiplying
193:49 - by negative 36. so my minus 36
193:52 - multiplication is outside my function i
193:55 - can rewrite this as minus 36
193:58 - times g of x
194:00 - finally in this last example i take x
194:02 - multiply by a fourth and then apply the
194:04 - square root of x so that's the same
194:06 - thing as g of
194:08 - one-fourth x my one-fourth x is on the
194:12 - inside of my function
194:13 - in other words it's inside the
194:15 - parentheses when i use function notation
194:19 - let's graph the square root of x and two
194:21 - transformations of this function
194:24 - y equals the square root of x goes
194:25 - through the points 0 0 1 1 and 4 2 since
194:29 - the square root of 4 is 2
194:31 - and looks something like this
194:34 - in order to graph y equals the square
194:36 - root of x minus 2 notice that the minus
194:39 - 2 is on the outside of the function
194:41 - that means we're going to take the
194:42 - square root of x first and then subtract
194:44 - 2.
194:46 - so for example
194:47 - if we start with the x value of 0 and
194:49 - compute the square root of 0 that's 0
194:52 - then we subtract 2 to give us a y value
194:54 - of negative 2.
194:56 - an x value of 1
194:58 - which under the square root function had
195:00 - a y value of 1
195:02 - now has a y value that's decreased by 2.
195:05 - one minus two is negative one
195:09 - and finally an x value of four which
195:11 - under the square root function had a y
195:13 - value of two now has a y value of two
195:16 - minus two or zero its y value was also
195:18 - decreased by two
195:20 - if i plot these new points
195:23 - zero goes with negative two one goes
195:25 - with negative one and four goes with
195:28 - zero i have my transformed graph
195:33 - because i subtracted two on the outside
195:35 - of my function my y values were
195:37 - decreased by two which brought my graph
195:40 - down by two units
195:42 - next let's look at y equals the square
195:45 - root of quantity x minus two now we're
195:48 - subtracting 2 on the inside of our
195:49 - function which means we subtract 2 from
195:51 - x first and then take the square root
195:54 - in order to get the same y value of 0 as
195:56 - we had in our blue graph
195:58 - we need our x minus 2 to be 0 so we need
196:01 - our original x to be 2.
196:04 - in order to get the y value of 1 that we
196:07 - had in our blue graph
196:09 - we need to be taking the square root of
196:10 - 1. so we need x minus 2 to be 1 which
196:14 - means that we need to start with an x
196:15 - value of 3.
196:17 - and in order to reproduce our y value of
196:20 - 2 from our original graph
196:22 - we need the square root of x minus 2 to
196:25 - be 2
196:26 - which means we need to start out by
196:28 - taking the square root of 4 which means
196:31 - our x minus 2 is 4 so our x should be up
196:34 - there at 6.
196:37 - if i plot my x values with my
196:40 - corresponding y values of square root of
196:42 - x minus 2 i get the following graph
196:45 - notice that the graph has moved
196:47 - horizontally to the right by two units
196:52 - to me
196:53 - moving down by two units
196:55 - makes sense because we're subtracting
196:57 - two so we're decreasing y's by two units
197:00 - but the minus two on the inside that
197:02 - kind of does the opposite of what i
197:04 - expect i might expect it to to move the
197:06 - graph left i might expect the x values
197:08 - to be going down by two units but
197:11 - instead it moves the graph to the right
197:14 - because the x units have to go up by two
197:16 - units in order to get the right square
197:19 - root when i then subtract two units
197:21 - again
197:22 - the observations we made for these
197:24 - transformations of functions hold in
197:26 - general according to the following rules
197:29 - first of all numbers on the outside of
197:32 - the function like in our example y
197:34 - equals the square root of x minus 2
197:37 - those numbers affect the y values and
197:39 - result in vertical motions like we saw
197:42 - these motions are in the direction you
197:44 - expect so subtracting 2 moves us down by
197:47 - 2
197:48 - if we were adding 2 instead that would
197:50 - move us up by 2.
197:52 - numbers on the inside of the function
197:55 - that's like our example y equals the
197:57 - square root of quantity x minus 2.
198:00 - those affect the x values and result in
198:02 - a horizontal motion
198:04 - these motions go in the opposite
198:06 - direction from what you expect
198:07 - remember the minus 2 on the inside
198:10 - actually shifted our graph to the right
198:12 - if it had a plus 2 on the inside
198:15 - that would actually shift our graph to
198:16 - the left
198:18 - adding results in a shift those are
198:21 - called translations but multiplying like
198:24 - something like y equals
198:26 - 3 times the square root of x that would
198:29 - result in a stretch or shrink
198:32 - in other words if i start with the
198:34 - square root of x
198:36 - and then want to graph y equals 3 times
198:39 - the square root of x that stretches my
198:41 - graph vertically by a factor of 3
198:45 - like this
198:47 - if i want to graph y equals one-third
198:50 - times the square root of x that shrinks
198:52 - my graph vertically by a factor of
198:54 - one-third
198:56 - finally a negative sign results in
198:59 - reflection
199:00 - for example if i start with a graph of y
199:03 - equals the square root of x
199:05 - and then want to graph y equals the
199:07 - square root of negative x
199:09 - that's going to do a reflection in the
199:11 - horizontal direction because the
199:12 - negative is on the inside of the square
199:14 - root sign
199:16 - a reflection in the horizontal direction
199:18 - means a reflection across the y-axis
199:22 - if instead i want to graph y equals
199:24 - negative the square root of x that
199:26 - negative sign on the outside means a
199:28 - vertical reflection a reflection across
199:31 - the x-axis
199:34 - pause the video for a moment and see if
199:36 - you can describe what happens in these
199:38 - four transformations
199:41 - in the first example we're subtracting 4
199:43 - on the outside of the function
199:45 - adding and subtracting means a
199:47 - translation or shift
199:49 - and since we're on the outside of the
199:51 - function it affects the y values that's
199:53 - moving us vertically
199:55 - so this transformation should take the
199:57 - square root of graph
199:58 - and
199:59 - move it down by 4 units
200:02 - that would look something like this
200:06 - in the next example
200:08 - we're adding 12 on the inside
200:10 - that's still a translation but now we're
200:12 - moving horizontally
200:14 - and so since we go the opposite
200:16 - direction we expect we are going to go
200:18 - to the left by 12 units
200:20 - that's going to look something like this
200:24 - in the next example we're multiplying by
200:26 - 3 and introducing a negative sign
200:28 - both on the outside of our function
200:30 - outside our function means we're
200:32 - affecting the y values so and
200:34 - multiplication means we're stretching by
200:36 - a factor of 3. the negative sign means
200:39 - we reflect in the vertical direction
200:43 - here's stretching by a factor of 3
200:45 - vertically before i apply the minus sign
200:48 - and now the minus sign reflects in the
200:50 - vertical direction
200:52 - finally
200:54 - in this last example we're multiplying
200:55 - by one quarter on the inside of our
200:58 - function
200:59 - we know that multiplication means
201:00 - stretch or shrink
201:02 - and since we're on the inside it's a
201:04 - horizontal motion and it does the
201:07 - opposite of what we expect so instead of
201:09 - shrinking by a factor of one-fourth
201:11 - horizontally it's actually going to
201:13 - stretch by the reciprocal a factor of
201:16 - four horizontally
201:18 - that'll look something like this
201:20 - notice that stretching horizontally by a
201:22 - factor of 4 looks kind of like shrinking
201:25 - vertically by a factor of one half
201:28 - and that's actually borne out by the
201:30 - algebra because the square root of 1 4 x
201:33 - is the same thing as the square root of
201:35 - 1 4 times the square root of x which is
201:38 - the same thing as one-half times the
201:40 - square root of x and so now we can see
201:42 - algebraically that a vertical shrink by
201:46 - a factor of one-half is the same as a
201:48 - horizontal stretch by a factor of
201:51 - at least for this function the square
201:53 - root function
201:55 - this video gave some rules for
201:57 - transformations of functions which i'll
201:59 - repeat below
202:00 - numbers on the outside
202:03 - correspond to changes in the y values
202:06 - or
202:07 - vertical motions
202:10 - numbers on the inside of the function
202:12 - affect the x values
202:14 - and result in horizontal motions
202:17 - adding and
202:18 - subtracting
202:20 - corresponds to translations or shifts
202:24 - multiplying and dividing by numbers
202:27 - corresponds to stretches and shrinks
202:30 - and putting in a negative sign
202:34 - corresponds to a reflection
202:37 - a horizontal reflection
202:39 - if the negative sign is on the inside
202:41 - and a vertical reflection if the
202:43 - negative sign is on the outside
202:46 - knowing these basic rules about
202:47 - transformations empowers you to be able
202:50 - to sketch graphs of much more
202:51 - complicated functions
202:53 - like y equals 3 times the square root of
202:56 - x plus 2 by simply considering the
202:58 - transformations
203:00 - one at a time
203:02 - a quadratic function is a function that
203:04 - can be written in the form f of x equals
203:07 - a x squared plus b x plus c
203:11 - where a b and c
203:14 - are real numbers and a
203:17 - is not equal to zero
203:19 - the reason we require that a is not
203:22 - equal to zero is because if a were equal
203:25 - to zero we'd have f of x is equal to b x
203:29 - plus c
203:30 - which is called a linear function
203:33 - so by making sure that a is not zero we
203:36 - make sure there's really an x squared
203:38 - term which is the hallmark of a
203:39 - quadratic function
203:42 - please pause the video for a moment and
203:43 - decide which of these equations
203:46 - represent quadratic functions
203:49 - the first function can definitely be
203:51 - written in the form
203:52 - g of x
203:54 - equals a x squared plus b x plus c in
203:58 - fact it's already written in that form
204:00 - where a is negative 5
204:02 - b is 10 and c is 3.
204:06 - the second equation is also a quadratic
204:09 - function
204:10 - because we can think of it as f of x
204:12 - equals one times x squared plus zero
204:16 - times x plus zero
204:19 - so it is in the right form where a is
204:22 - one b is zero and c is zero
204:26 - it's perfectly fine for the coefficient
204:28 - of x and the constant term to be zero
204:31 - for a quadratic function we just need
204:33 - the coefficient of x squared to be
204:35 - non-zero so the x squared term is
204:37 - preserved
204:39 - the third equation is not a quadratic
204:41 - function it's a linear function
204:44 - because there's no x squared term
204:50 - the fourth function might not look like
204:52 - a quadratic function but if we rewrite
204:54 - it by expanding out the x minus 3
204:57 - squared let's see what happens
204:59 - we get y equals 2 times x minus 3 times
205:03 - x minus 3 plus 4
205:05 - so that's 2 times x squared minus 3x
205:09 - minus 3x plus 9 plus 4.
205:13 - continuing i get 2
205:16 - x squared
205:18 - minus 12 x's
205:20 - plus 18 plus 4 in other words
205:24 - y equals 2x squared minus 12x plus 22
205:28 - so in fact our function can be written
205:30 - in the right form and it is a quadratic
205:32 - function
205:35 - a function that is already written in
205:37 - the form y equals ax squared plus bx
205:40 - plus c
205:41 - is said to be in standard form
205:45 - so our first example g of x is in
205:48 - standard form
205:50 - a function that's written in the format
205:52 - of the last function that is in the form
205:55 - of y equals
205:57 - a times x minus h squared plus k
206:01 - for some numbers
206:02 - a h and k
206:05 - that's said to be in vertex form
206:08 - i'll talk more about standard form and
206:11 - vertex form in another video
206:14 - in this video we identified some
206:16 - quadratic functions and talked about the
206:18 - difference between standard form
206:22 - and vertex form
206:27 - this video is about graphing quadratic
206:29 - functions
206:30 - a quadratic function which is typically
206:32 - written in standard form
206:34 - like this
206:35 - or sometimes in vertex form
206:38 - like this
206:40 - always has the graph that looks like a
206:42 - parabola
206:44 - this video will show how to tell whether
206:46 - the parabola is pointing up or down
206:49 - how to find its x-intercept
206:52 - and how to find its vertex
206:56 - the bare-bones basic quadratic function
206:59 - is f of x equals x squared
207:02 - it goes to the origin since
207:04 - f of zero is zero squared which is zero
207:08 - and it is a parabola pointing upwards
207:11 - like
207:12 - this the vertex of a parabola is its
207:16 - lowest point if it's pointing upwards
207:18 - and its highest point if it's pointing
207:20 - downwards
207:22 - so in this case the vertex is at 0 0.
207:26 - the x-intercepts are where the graph
207:29 - crosses the x-axis in other words where
207:31 - y is zero
207:33 - and in this function
207:34 - y equals zero means that x squared is
207:36 - zero which happens only when x is zero
207:40 - so the x-intercept there's only one of
207:42 - them is also zero
207:44 - this second function y equals negative
207:47 - three x squared
207:48 - also goes through the origin
207:50 - since the function's value when x is
207:52 - zero
207:53 - is y equals zero
207:55 - but in this case
207:57 - the parabola is pointing downwards
208:00 - that's because thinking about
208:02 - transformations of functions a negative
208:04 - sign on the outside
208:06 - reflects the function vertically over
208:08 - the x-axis making the parabola instead
208:11 - of pointing upwards reflecting the point
208:13 - downwards
208:16 - the number three on the outside
208:18 - stretches the graph vertically by a
208:21 - factor of three so it makes it kind of
208:24 - long and skinny like this
208:28 - in general a negative coefficient to the
208:31 - x squared term means the parabola will
208:33 - be pointing down whereas a positive
208:35 - coefficient like here the coefficient's
208:37 - 1 means the parabola is pointing up
208:40 - i'll write that rule over here
208:43 - so if a is bigger than 0 the parabola
208:46 - opens up
208:49 - and if the value of the coefficient a is
208:51 - less than zero then the parabola opens
208:53 - down
208:55 - in this second example we can see again
208:57 - that the vertex is at zero zero and the
209:00 - x intercept is x equals zero
209:03 - let's look at this third example
209:06 - if we multiplied our expression out we'd
209:09 - see that the coefficient of x squared
209:11 - would be 2 a positive number so that
209:14 - means our parabola is going to be
209:15 - opening up
209:17 - but the vertex of this parabola will no
209:19 - longer be at the origin
209:21 - in fact we can find the parabolas vertex
209:24 - by thinking about transformations of
209:26 - functions
209:28 - our function is related to the function
209:30 - y equals 2x squared
209:33 - by moving it to the right by 3 and up by
209:37 - 4.
209:38 - since y equals 2x squared has a vertex
209:43 - at
209:44 - 0 0
209:46 - if we move that whole parabola including
209:48 - the vertex
209:49 - right by three
209:51 - and up by four
209:53 - the vertex will end up at the point
209:56 - three
209:58 - four
210:00 - so a parabola will look something like
210:02 - this
210:05 - notice how easy it was to just read off
210:07 - the vertex when our quadratic function
210:09 - is written in this form
210:11 - in fact
210:12 - any parabola any quadratic function
210:14 - written in the form a times x minus h
210:17 - squared plus k
210:19 - has a vertex
210:21 - at h k
210:23 - by the same reasoning we're moving the
210:26 - parabola with a vertex at the origin to
210:28 - the right by h
210:30 - and by k
210:32 - that's why this form of a quadratic
210:34 - function is called the vertex form
210:39 - notice that this parabola has no
210:41 - x-intercepts because it does not cross
210:43 - the x-axis
210:45 - for our final function we have g of x
210:48 - equals 5x squared plus 10x plus 3.
210:52 - we know the graph of this function will
210:53 - be a parabola pointing upwards because
210:56 - the coefficient of x squared is positive
210:59 - to find the x-intercepts we can set y
211:02 - equals zero
211:04 - since the x-intercepts is where our
211:05 - graph crosses the x-axis and that's
211:08 - where the y-value is zero
211:11 - so 0 equals 5x squared plus 10x plus 3
211:15 - i'm going to use the quadratic formula
211:17 - to solve that so x is negative 10 plus
211:20 - or minus the square root of 10 squared
211:23 - minus 4 times 5 times 3 all over 2 times
211:27 - 5.
211:29 - that simplifies to
211:31 - x equals negative 10 plus or minus the
211:33 - square root of 40 over 10
211:36 - which simplifies further to x equals
211:39 - negative 10 over 10 plus or minus the
211:42 - square root of 40 over 10 which is
211:44 - negative 1 plus or minus
211:46 - 2 square root of 10 over 10
211:49 - or negative 1 plus or minus square root
211:51 - of 10 over 5.
211:54 - since the square root of 10 is just a
211:56 - little bit bigger than 3 this works out
211:58 - to
211:59 - approximately
212:00 - about negative
212:02 - two-fifths and negative eight-fifths so
212:05 - somewhere around right here so our
212:08 - parabola is going to look something like
212:10 - this
212:11 - notice that it goes through crosses the
212:14 - x-axis at y equals 3 that's because when
212:17 - we plug in x equals 0
212:20 - into here we get y equal 3. so the
212:23 - y-intercept is at
212:25 - 3.
212:26 - finally we can find the vertex
212:30 - since this function is written in
212:32 - standard form the
212:34 - y equals ax
212:37 - plus
212:38 - x squared plus bx plus c form and not in
212:41 - vertex form we can't just read off the
212:44 - vertex like we could before but there's
212:46 - a trick called the vertex formula which
212:49 - says that whenever you have
212:51 - a function in a quadratic function in
212:53 - standard form the vertex
212:56 - has an x coordinate
212:58 - of negative b over 2a so in this case
213:02 - that's an x coordinate of
213:05 - negative 10 over 2 times 5 or negative 1
213:10 - which is kind of like where i put it on
213:11 - the graph
213:12 - to find the y coordinate of that vertex
213:14 - i can just plug in negative 1 into my
213:18 - equation
213:20 - for x
213:22 - which gives me y equals 5 times negative
213:25 - 1 squared plus 10 times negative 1 plus
213:28 - 3
213:29 - which is negative 2.
213:32 - so i think i better redraw my graph a
213:34 - little bit to put that vertex down at a
213:37 - y coordinate of negative 2 where it's
213:39 - supposed to be
213:43 - let's summarize the steps we use to
213:45 - graph these quadratic functions first of
213:48 - all the graph of a quadratic function
213:50 - has the shape
213:51 - of a parabola
213:55 - the parabola opens up if the coefficient
213:58 - of x squared which we call a is greater
214:00 - than zero and down if a is less than
214:03 - zero
214:04 - to find the x intercepts we set
214:07 - y equal to zero or in other words f of x
214:10 - equal to zero and solve for x
214:14 - to find the vertex we can
214:17 - either read it off
214:19 - as h k
214:21 - if our function is in vertex form
214:26 - or
214:27 - we can use the vertex formula
214:31 - and get the x coordinate
214:34 - of the vertex
214:36 - to be
214:37 - negative b over 2a
214:39 - if our function is in standard form
214:44 - to find the y-coordinate
214:46 - of the vertex in this case we just plug
214:49 - in
214:49 - the x-coordinate
214:52 - and figure out what y is
214:55 - finally we can always find additional
214:57 - points on the graph by plugging in
215:00 - values of x
215:03 - in this video we learned some tricks for
215:05 - graphing quadratic functions
215:08 - in particular we saw that the vertex
215:11 - can be read off as h k
215:14 - if our function is written in vertex
215:16 - form
215:17 - and the x coordinate of the vertex can
215:19 - be calculated
215:23 - as negative b over 2a if our function is
215:27 - in a standard form
215:29 - for an explanation of why this vertex
215:31 - formula works please see it in my other
215:34 - video
215:36 - a quadratic in standard form looks like
215:38 - y equals a x squared plus b x plus c
215:43 - where a b and c are real numbers and a
215:45 - is not zero
215:47 - a quadratic function in vertex form
215:49 - looks like y equals a times x minus h
215:53 - squared plus k
215:54 - where a h and k are real numbers and a
215:57 - is not zero
215:58 - when a function's in vertex form it's
216:01 - easy to read off the vertex it's just
216:03 - the ordered pair
216:05 - h k
216:07 - this video explains how to get from
216:09 - vertex form to standard form and vice
216:11 - versa
216:13 - let's start by converting this quadratic
216:15 - function from vertex form to standard
216:18 - form
216:19 - that's pretty straightforward we just
216:21 - have to distribute out
216:24 - so if i multiply out
216:27 - the x minus 3 squared
216:31 - i get
216:33 - minus 4 times x squared minus 6x plus 9
216:38 - plus 1. distributing the negative 4 i
216:41 - get negative 4x squared plus
216:44 - 24x minus 36 plus 1 so that works out to
216:49 - minus 4x squared plus 24x minus 35 and i
216:54 - have my
216:55 - quadratic function now in standard form
216:59 - now let's go the other direction and
217:02 - convert a quadratic function that's
217:03 - already in standard form
217:05 - into vertex form that is we want to put
217:09 - it in the form of
217:10 - g of x equals a times x minus h squared
217:16 - plus k
217:17 - where the vertex is at h k
217:21 - to do this it's handy to use the vertex
217:24 - formula
217:26 - the vertex formula says that the x
217:28 - coordinate of the vertex
217:31 - is given by negative b over 2a
217:35 - where
217:36 - a is the coefficient of x squared and b
217:39 - is the coefficient of x
217:41 - so in this case we get an x coordinate
217:44 - of negative 8 over 2 times 2 or negative
217:48 - 2.
217:49 - to find the y-coordinate of the vertex
217:53 - we just plug in the x-coordinate into
217:56 - our formula for g of x so that's g of
218:00 - negative 2 which is 2 times negative 2
218:03 - squared plus 8 times negative 2 plus 6
218:06 - and that works out to be
218:08 - negative 2 by coincidence
218:11 - so the vertex for our quadratic function
218:14 - has coordinates negative 2 negative 2.
218:17 - and if i want to write g of x in vertex
218:19 - form it's going to be a times x minus
218:23 - negative 2 squared
218:25 - plus
218:26 - minus 2 that's because
218:29 - remember we subtract h and we add k
218:33 - so that simplifies to g of x equals a
218:36 - times x plus 2 squared minus 2
218:40 - and finally we just need to figure out
218:42 - what this leading coefficient a is
218:45 - but notice if we were to multiply
218:47 - distribute this out
218:48 - then
218:49 - the coefficient of x squared would end
218:52 - up being a so therefore the coefficient
218:56 - of x squared here which is a has to be
218:58 - the same as the coefficient of x squared
219:00 - here which we can immediately also call
219:02 - a in other words our a down here needs
219:04 - to be 2.
219:06 - so i'm going to write that as g of x
219:08 - equals 2 times x plus 2 squared minus 2
219:12 - lots of twos in this problem and that's
219:15 - our
219:16 - quadratic function in vertex form if i
219:19 - want to check my answer of course i
219:20 - could just distribute out again i'd get
219:24 - 2 times
219:25 - x squared plus 4x plus 2
219:29 - minus 2 in other words
219:31 - 2x squared plus 8x plus 6 which checks
219:35 - out to exactly what i started with
219:38 - this video showed how to get from vertex
219:40 - form to standard form by distributing
219:43 - out and how to get from standard form to
219:45 - vertex form by finding the vertex using
219:48 - the vertex formula
219:51 - suppose you have a quadratic function
219:54 - in the form y equals ax squared plus bx
219:57 - plus c
219:59 - and you want to find where the vertex is
220:01 - when you graph it
220:04 - the vertex formula
220:07 - says that the x-coordinate of this
220:09 - vertex
220:11 - is at
220:12 - negative b over 2a
220:16 - this video gives a justification for
220:18 - where that formula comes from
220:21 - let's start with a specific example
220:23 - suppose i wanted to find the
220:25 - x-intercepts and the vertex for this
220:27 - quadratic function
220:29 - to find the
220:30 - x-intercepts i would set y equal to zero
220:34 - and solve for x so that's zero equals
220:36 - three x squared plus seven x minus five
220:40 - and to solve for x i use the quadratic
220:42 - formula
220:43 - so x is gonna be negative seven plus or
220:45 - minus the square root of seven squared
220:48 - minus four times three times negative
220:51 - five all over two times three
220:55 - that simplifies to
220:57 - negative seven a plus or minus the
220:59 - square root of a hundred and nine over
221:01 - six we could i could also write this as
221:03 - negative seven sixth plus the square
221:06 - root of a hundred and nine over six
221:08 - or x equals negative seven six minus the
221:11 - square root of 109 over six
221:13 - since the square root of a hundred and
221:15 - nine is just a little bit bigger than
221:16 - ten this can be approximated by negative
221:20 - seven sixths plus ten sixths and
221:23 - negative seven sixth minus ten sixths 6.
221:27 - so pretty close to
221:30 - i guess about what half over here and
221:32 - pretty close to about negative 3 over
221:34 - here i'm just going to estimate so that
221:36 - i can draw a picture of the function
221:40 - since the leading coefficient 3 is
221:42 - positive i know my parabola is going to
221:44 - be opening up
221:45 - and
221:46 - the
221:47 - intercepts are somewhere around
221:49 - here and here so roughly speaking it's
221:53 - going to look something like this
221:58 - now the vertex is going to be somewhere
222:00 - in between the two x-intercepts in fact
222:03 - it's going to be by symmetry it'll be
222:04 - exactly halfway in between the two
222:07 - x-intercepts since the x-intercepts are
222:10 - negative 7 6 plus and minus 100 square
222:14 - root of 109 over 6 the number halfway in
222:17 - between those is going to be exactly
222:19 - negative 7 6
222:21 - right because on the one hand i have
222:24 - negative 7 6 plus
222:27 - something
222:28 - and on the other hand i have negative 7
222:30 - 6 minus that same thing
222:33 - so negative 7 6 will be exactly in the
222:36 - middle so my x coordinate
222:39 - of my vertex
222:42 - will be at negative 7 6.
222:45 - notice that i got that number from the
222:47 - quadratic formula
222:52 - more generally if i want to find the
222:54 - x-intercepts for any quadratic function
222:56 - i set y equal to 0
223:00 - and solve for x using the quadratic
223:02 - formula negative b plus or minus the
223:05 - square root of b squared minus 4ac all
223:08 - over 2a
223:10 - the x-intercepts will be at these two
223:12 - values but the x-coordinate of the
223:15 - vertex which is exactly halfway in
223:17 - between the two x-intercepts
223:20 - will be at negative b over 2a
223:23 - that's where the vertex formula comes
223:25 - from
223:26 - and it turns out that this formula works
223:28 - even when there are no x-intercepts even
223:30 - when the the quadratic formula gives us
223:33 - no solutions the vertex still has the x
223:35 - coordinate negative b over 2a
223:39 - and that's the justification of the
223:41 - vertex formula
223:44 - this video is about polynomials and
223:46 - their graphs
223:48 - recall that a polynomial is a function
223:51 - like this one for example
223:54 - whose terms are numbers times powers of
223:57 - x
223:58 - i'll start with some definitions
224:00 - the degree of a polynomial
224:03 - is the largest exponent
224:05 - for example for this polynomial
224:08 - the degree is four
224:10 - the leading term
224:12 - is the term with the largest exponent
224:15 - in the same example
224:16 - the leading term is 5x to the fourth
224:20 - it's conventional to write the
224:21 - polynomial in descending order of powers
224:25 - of x so the leading term is first but
224:28 - the leading term doesn't have to be the
224:29 - first term if i wrote this same
224:31 - polynomial as y equals say
224:34 - 2 minus 17x minus 21x cubed plus 5x4 the
224:40 - leading term would still be the 5x to
224:43 - the fourth even though it was last
224:46 - the leading coefficient is the number in
224:49 - the leading term
224:50 - in this example the leading coefficient
224:53 - is 5.
224:55 - finally the constant term is the term
224:57 - with no x's in it
224:59 - in our same example the constant term is
225:01 - 2.
225:03 - please pause the video for a moment and
225:05 - take a look at this next example of
225:07 - polynomial
225:08 - figure out what's the degree the leading
225:10 - term the leading coefficient and the
225:12 - constant term
225:14 - the degree
225:15 - is again four since that's the highest
225:18 - power we have
225:20 - and the leading term is negative seven x
225:23 - to the fourth
225:24 - the leading coefficient is negative 7
225:27 - and the constant term is 18.
225:31 - in the graph of the polynomial shown
225:33 - here
225:34 - the three marked points are called
225:37 - turning points
225:39 - because the polynomial turns around and
225:41 - changes direction at those three points
225:45 - those same points can also be called
225:48 - local extreme points
225:49 - or they can be called local maximum and
225:52 - minimum points
225:54 - for this polynomial the degree is 4 and
225:58 - the number of turning points is 3.
226:01 - let's compare the degree and the number
226:03 - of turning points for these next three
226:05 - examples
226:06 - for the first one the degree
226:09 - is two and there's one
226:11 - turning point
226:14 - for the second example the degree
226:17 - is three
226:19 - and there's two turning points
226:23 - and for this last example the degree is
226:25 - four and there's one turning point
226:29 - for this first example and the next two
226:32 - the number of turning points is exactly
226:34 - one less than the degree
226:36 - so you might conjecture that this is
226:38 - always true
226:39 - but in fact this is not always true
226:42 - in this last example the degree is four
226:46 - but the number of turning points is one
226:48 - not
226:48 - three in fact it turns out that while
226:51 - the number of turning points is not
226:52 - always equal to the degree minus one it
226:56 - is always less than or equal to the
226:58 - degree minus one
227:00 - that's a useful fact to remember
227:02 - when you're sketching graphs or
227:03 - recognizing graphs of polynomials
227:06 - the end behavior of a function is how
227:09 - the ends of the function look as x gets
227:12 - bigger and bigger heads towards infinity
227:14 - or x gets goes through larger and larger
227:17 - negative numbers towards negative
227:19 - infinity
227:20 - in this first example
227:22 - the graph of the function
227:24 - goes down as x gets towards infinity as
227:27 - x goes towards negative infinity
227:30 - i can draw this with two little arrows
227:32 - pointing down on either side or i can
227:34 - say in words that the function is
227:37 - falling as we head left and falling also
227:40 - as we head right
227:42 - in this second example the graph rises
227:45 - to the left and rises to the right
227:48 - in the third example the graph falls to
227:51 - the left
227:52 - but rises to the right and in the fourth
227:55 - example
227:56 - it rises to the left and falls to the
227:58 - right if you study these examples and
228:01 - others you might notice there's a
228:03 - relationship between
228:05 - the degree of the polynomial
228:07 - the leading coefficients of the
228:09 - polynomials and the end behavior
228:12 - specifically these four types of end
228:15 - behavior are determined by whether the
228:17 - degree is even or odd
228:21 - and by whether the leading coefficient
228:23 - is positive or negative
228:28 - the degree is even
228:30 - and the leading coefficient is positive
228:32 - like in this example where the leading
228:34 - coefficient is one
228:35 - we have this sorts of end behavior
228:38 - rising on both sides
228:41 - when the degree is even and the leading
228:43 - coefficient is negative like in this
228:45 - example
228:46 - we have the end behavior that's falling
228:49 - on both that sides
228:51 - when the degree is odd and the leading
228:53 - coefficient is positive that's like this
228:56 - example with the degree 3 and a leading
228:58 - coefficient 3
228:59 - then we have this sort of end behavior
229:03 - and finally
229:04 - when the degree is odd and the leading
229:06 - coefficient is negative like in this
229:09 - example we have this sort of end
229:11 - behavior
229:14 - i like to remember this chart just by
229:16 - thinking of the most simple examples
229:19 - y equals x squared
229:21 - y equals negative x squared y equals x
229:24 - cubed and y equals negative x cubed
229:27 - because i know by heart
229:29 - what those four examples look like
229:33 - then i just have to remember that any
229:35 - polynomial with a even
229:38 - degree and positive leading coefficient
229:41 - has the same end behavior as x squared
229:44 - and similarly
229:46 - any polynomial with even degree and
229:49 - negative leading coefficient has the
229:50 - same end behavior as negative x squared
229:53 - and similar statements for x cubed and
229:56 - negative x cubed
229:58 - we can use facts about turning points
230:01 - and end behavior to say something about
230:03 - the equation of a polynomial just by
230:05 - looking at its graph
230:08 - in this example because of the end
230:10 - behavior we know that the degree
230:13 - is odd
230:15 - we know that the leading coefficient
230:19 - must be positive
230:22 - and finally since there are one two
230:25 - three four turning points we know
230:28 - that the degree
230:30 - is greater than or equal to
230:32 - five that's because the number of
230:35 - turning points
230:36 - is less than or equal to the degree
230:39 - minus 1 and in this case the number of
230:41 - turning points we said was 4
230:45 - and so solving that inequality we get
230:48 - the degree is big or equal to 5.
230:52 - putting some of that information
230:53 - together we see the degree
230:55 - could be
230:58 - 5 or 7 or 9 or any odd number greater
231:02 - than or equal to 5 but it couldn't be
231:04 - for example 3 or
231:06 - 6
231:08 - because even numbers and and also
231:10 - numbers less than 5 are right out
231:14 - this video gave a lot of definitions
231:16 - including the definition of degree
231:19 - leading coefficients
231:22 - turning points
231:24 - and end behavior
231:28 - we saw that knowing the degree and the
231:30 - leading coefficient can help you make
231:32 - predictions about the number of turning
231:34 - points and the end behavior
231:36 - as well as vice versa
231:39 - this video is about exponential
231:40 - functions and their
231:42 - graphs an exponential function is a
231:45 - function that can be written in the form
231:48 - f of x equals a times b to the x where a
231:52 - and b are any real numbers as long as a
231:55 - is not 0 and b is positive
231:59 - it's important to notice that for an
232:01 - exponential function the variable x is
232:04 - in the exponent
232:06 - this is different from many other
232:07 - functions we've seen for example a
232:10 - quadratic function like f of x equals 3x
232:13 - squared has the variable in the base so
232:15 - it's not an exponential function
232:19 - for exponential functions f of x equals
232:22 - a times b to the x we require that a is
232:25 - not equal to zero because otherwise
232:29 - we would have f of x equals zero times b
232:32 - to the x which just means that f of x
232:35 - equals zero and this is called a
232:36 - constant function not an exponential
232:38 - function because f x is always equal to
232:42 - zero
232:44 - in an exponential function we require
232:46 - that b is bigger than zero because
232:49 - otherwise
232:50 - for example
232:52 - if
232:53 - b is equal to
232:55 - negative 1 say we'd have f of x equals a
232:59 - times negative 1 to the x
233:02 - now this would make sense for a lot of
233:04 - values of x but
233:06 - if we tried to do something like f of
233:08 - one-half
233:09 - with our b's negative one
233:12 - that would be the same thing as a times
233:14 - the square root of negative one which is
233:17 - not a real number
233:19 - we'd get the same problem for other
233:21 - values of b
233:22 - if the values of b were negative
233:25 - and if we tried b equals zero we'd get a
233:28 - kind of
233:29 - ridiculous thing a times zero to the x
233:32 - which again is always zero so that
233:34 - wouldn't count as an exponential either
233:36 - so we can't use any negative bases and
233:38 - we can't use zero bases if we want an
233:40 - exponential function
233:42 - the number a
233:44 - in the expression f of x equals a times
233:46 - b to the x is called
233:48 - the initial value
233:51 - and the number b is called the base
233:55 - the phrase initial value comes from the
233:57 - fact that if we plug in
233:59 - x equals zero we get a times b to the 0
234:03 - well anything to the 0 is just 1 so this
234:06 - is equal to a
234:07 - in other words f of 0 equals a so if we
234:10 - think of starting out
234:13 - when x equals 0
234:16 - we get the y value
234:19 - of a that's why it's called the initial
234:21 - value
234:27 - let's start out with this example
234:29 - where y equals a times b to the x an
234:31 - exponential function and we've set a
234:33 - equal to one and b equals a two
234:36 - notice that the y-intercept
234:38 - the value when x is zero is going to be
234:41 - one
234:43 - if i change my a value
234:46 - my initial value the y-intercept changes
234:50 - the function is stretched out
234:54 - if i make the value of a go to 0
234:58 - and then negative
235:01 - then my
235:02 - initial value becomes negative and my
235:04 - graph flips across the x axis
235:08 - let's go back to an a value of
235:10 - say 1
235:12 - and see what happens when we change b
235:14 - right now the b value the base is two
235:18 - if i
235:19 - increase b
235:21 - my
235:22 - y-intercept sticks at one but my graph
235:25 - becomes steeper and steeper
235:28 - if i put b back down close to 1
235:31 - my graph becomes
235:33 - more flat
235:35 - at exactly 1 my graph is just a constant
235:40 - as b gets into fractional territory
235:43 - point eight point seven point six
235:46 - my graph starts to slope the other way
235:48 - it's decreasing now instead of
235:50 - increasing but notice that the
235:51 - y-intercept still hasn't changed
235:55 - i can get
235:56 - it more and more steep as my b gets
235:58 - farther and farther away from one of
236:00 - course when b goes to negative territory
236:02 - my graph doesn't make any sense
236:07 - so a
236:09 - changes the y-intercept
236:12 - and b
236:13 - changes the steepness of the graph
236:16 - so that it's and whether it's increasing
236:19 - for b values bigger than one
236:21 - and decreasing for values of b less than
236:24 - one
236:28 - we'll summarize all these observations
236:29 - on the next slide
236:31 - we've seen that for an exponential
236:33 - function y equals a times b to the x the
236:36 - parameter or number
236:38 - a
236:40 - gives the y-intercept
236:42 - the parameter b
236:43 - tells us how the graph is increasing or
236:45 - decreasing specifically if b is greater
236:48 - than one the graph is increasing
236:52 - and if b is less than one the graph is
236:55 - decreasing
236:58 - the closer b is to the number one the
237:00 - flatter the graph
237:03 - so for example if i were to graph y
237:06 - equals 0.25 to the x
237:09 - and y equals 0.4 to the x
237:12 - they would both be decreasing graphs
237:15 - since the base for both of them is less
237:17 - than 1
237:18 - but 0.25 is farther away from 1
237:23 - and .4 is closer to 1 so 0.4 is going to
237:26 - be flatter and 0.25 is going to be more
237:30 - steep
237:31 - so in this picture
237:33 - this red graph would correspond to 0.25
237:36 - to the x and the blue graph would
237:39 - correspond to 0.4 to the x
237:43 - for all these exponential functions
237:45 - whether the graphs are decreasing or
237:47 - increasing they all have a horizontal
237:50 - asymptote
237:51 - along the x-axis in other words at the
237:54 - line y equals zero
237:57 - the domain is always from negative
237:59 - infinity to infinity and the range is
238:03 - always
238:05 - from 0 to infinity
238:07 - because the range is always positive y
238:10 - values
238:12 - actually that's true
238:14 - if a is greater than 0.
238:17 - if a is less than 0
238:20 - then our graph flips over the x-axis
238:24 - our domain stays the same but our range
238:26 - becomes
238:28 - negative infinity to zero
238:30 - the most famous exponential function is
238:33 - f of x equals e to the x this function's
238:35 - also sometimes written as f of x equals
238:37 - x of x
238:39 - the number e is euler's number it's
238:41 - approximately 2.7
238:44 - this function has important applications
238:46 - to calculus and to some compound
238:49 - interest problems
238:51 - in this video we looked at exponential
238:53 - functions functions of the form a times
238:56 - b to the x where the variable
238:59 - is in the exponent
239:01 - we saw that they all have the same
239:04 - general shape
239:05 - either
239:07 - increasing like this
239:09 - or decreasing like this
239:12 - unless a is negative in which case they
239:15 - flip over the x-axis
239:18 - they all have a horizontal asymptote
239:21 - at y equals zero
239:23 - the x-axis
239:26 - in this video we'll use exponential
239:28 - functions to model real-world examples
239:32 - let's suppose you're hired for a job
239:35 - the starting salary is forty thousand
239:37 - dollars with a guaranteed annual raise
239:40 - of three percent each year
239:42 - how much will your salary be after one
239:44 - year
239:45 - two years five years and in general
239:48 - after t years
239:50 - let me chart out the information
239:52 - the left column will be the number of
239:54 - years since you're hired
239:56 - and the right column will be your salary
240:00 - when you start work
240:02 - that's zero years after you're hired
240:04 - your salary will be forty thousand
240:06 - dollars
240:09 - after one year you'll have gotten a
240:11 - three percent raise
240:13 - so your salary will be the original
240:16 - forty thousand
240:17 - plus three percent of forty thousand
240:20 - point 0.03 times
240:23 - 40 000.
240:25 - i can think of this first number as one
240:27 - times 40 000
240:29 - and i can factor out the 40 000 from
240:33 - both terms to get forty thousand
240:36 - times
240:37 - one
240:38 - plus zero point zero three
240:41 - let me rewrite this as forty thousand
240:44 - times one point oh three
240:48 - this is your original salary
240:51 - multiplied by a growth factor of 1.03
240:57 - after two years you'll get a three
240:59 - percent raise from your previous year
241:02 - salary
241:03 - your previous year's salary was 40 000
241:06 - times 1.03
241:08 - but you'll add
241:10 - 3 of that
241:12 - again i can think of the first number as
241:14 - 1 times 40 000 times 1.03
241:18 - and i can factor out the common factor
241:21 - of 40 000 times 1.03 from both terms
241:25 - to get 40 000
241:27 - times 1.03
241:29 - times 1 plus 0.03
241:34 - let me rewrite that as 40 000 times 1.03
241:38 - times 1.03 or 40 000 times 1.03 squared
241:44 - we can think of this as your last year's
241:47 - salary
241:50 - multiplied by the same growth factor
241:53 - of 1.03
241:55 - after three years a similar computation
241:59 - will give you that your new salary is
242:01 - your previous year's salary
242:04 - times that growth factor of 1.03
242:09 - that can be written as
242:11 - 40 000 times 1.03 cubed
242:15 - and in general if you're noticing the
242:16 - pattern after t years your salary should
242:19 - be 40 000 times 1.03 to the t power
242:25 - in other words your salary after t years
242:28 - is your original salary
242:32 - multiplied by the growth factor
242:37 - of 1.03
242:38 - taken to the t
242:40 - power let me write this as a formula
242:44 - s of t
242:45 - where s of t is your salary
242:48 - is equal to 40 000 times 1.03 to the t
242:54 - this is an exponential function
242:56 - that is a function of the form a times b
242:59 - to the t
243:01 - where your initial value a
243:03 - is 40 000
243:06 - and your base
243:07 - b
243:08 - is 1.03
243:11 - notice that your base is the amount that
243:14 - your salary gets multiplied by each year
243:17 - given this formula we can easily figure
243:20 - out what your salary will be after for
243:22 - example five years by plugging in five
243:25 - for t
243:26 - i worked that out on my calculator to be
243:28 - forty six thousand
243:30 - three hundred seventy dollars and ninety
243:33 - six cents to the nearest cent
243:37 - exponential functions are also useful in
243:39 - modeling population growth
243:41 - the united nations estimated that the
243:43 - world population in 2010 was 6.79
243:47 - billion growing at a rate of 1.1 percent
243:49 - per year
243:51 - assuming that the growth rate stayed the
243:52 - same and will continue to stay the same
243:55 - we'll write an equation for the
243:56 - population at t years after the year
243:59 - 2010.
244:02 - 1.1 percent written as a decimal is
244:05 - 0.011
244:08 - so if we work out a chart as before
244:11 - we see that after zero years since 2010
244:15 - we have our initial population 6.79
244:18 - billion
244:19 - after one year
244:21 - we'll take that 6.79 billion and add 1.1
244:25 - percent of it that is
244:28 - 0.011 times
244:31 - 6.79
244:32 - this works out to
244:34 - 6.79 times
244:38 - 1 plus
244:39 - 0.011
244:41 - or 6.79 times 1.011
244:47 - here we have our
244:48 - initial population
244:51 - of 6.79 billion
244:53 - and our growth factor
244:56 - of 1.011
244:59 - that's how much the population got
245:02 - multiplied by in one year
245:06 - as before we can work out that after two
245:08 - years
245:09 - our population becomes 6.79
245:12 - times 1.011 squared since it got
245:15 - multiplied by 1.011
245:18 - twice
245:19 - and after t years
245:21 - it'll be 6.79 times 1.011 to the t power
245:28 - so our function that models population
245:32 - is going to be
245:33 - 6.79 times 1.011
245:36 - to the t
245:38 - here
245:39 - t
245:40 - represents time
245:42 - in years
245:44 - since
245:45 - 2010.
245:47 - just for fun i'll plug in
245:49 - t equals 40. that's 40 years since 2010
245:54 - so that's the year
245:56 - 2050 and i get 6.79 times 1.011 to the
246:01 - 40th power which works out to
246:04 - 10.5 billion
246:07 - that's the prediction
246:09 - based on this exponential model
246:13 - the previous two examples were examples
246:15 - of exponential growth this last example
246:18 - is an example of exponential decay
246:21 - the drug seroquel is metabolized and
246:23 - eliminated from the body at a rate of 11
246:26 - percent per hour
246:27 - if 400 milligrams are given how much
246:30 - remains in the body 24 hours later
246:33 - i'll chart out my information
246:35 - where the left column will be
246:38 - time
246:39 - in hours
246:41 - since the dose was given
246:44 - and the right column will be the number
246:46 - of milligrams of seroquel still in the
246:49 - body
246:51 - zero hours after the dose is given we
246:54 - have the full 400 milligrams in the body
246:57 - one hour later we have the 400
246:59 - milligrams minus 11 percent of it that's
247:03 - minus 0.11 times 400.
247:07 - if i factor out the 400 from both terms
247:10 - i get 400 times 1 minus 0.11
247:15 - or 400
247:16 - times 0.89
247:21 - the 400 represents the initial amount
247:25 - the 0.89 i'll call the growth factor
247:28 - even though in this case the quantity is
247:30 - decreasing not growing so really it's
247:32 - kind of a shrink factor
247:38 - let's see what happens after
247:40 - two hours now i'll have 400 times 0.89
247:44 - my previous amount it'll again get
247:46 - multiplied by 0.89 so that's going to be
247:49 - 400 times 0.89 squared and in general
247:53 - after t hours i'll have 400 multiplied
247:57 - by this
247:58 - growth or shrinkage factor of 0.89
248:01 - raised to the t power since each hour
248:04 - the amount of seroquel gets multiplied
248:07 - by .89 that number less than one
248:11 - i'll write my exponential decay function
248:14 - as f of t
248:15 - equals 400 times 0.89 to the t
248:21 - where f of t
248:22 - represents the number of milligrams of
248:25 - seroquel in the body
248:27 - and t represents the number of hours
248:30 - since the dose was given
248:33 - to find out how much is in the body
248:35 - after 24 hours i just plug in 24 for t
248:41 - this works out to about 24.4
248:44 - milligrams i hope you noticed the common
248:47 - form for the functions used to model all
248:49 - three of these examples
248:51 - the functions were always in the form
248:54 - f of t equals a times b to the t
248:59 - where a represented the initial amount
249:02 - and b
249:04 - represented the growth factor
249:08 - to find the growth factor b
249:11 - we started with the percent increase or
249:13 - decrease
249:15 - we wrote it as a decimal
249:18 - and then we either added it or
249:19 - subtracted it from one depending on
249:21 - whether the quantity was increasing or
249:24 - decreasing
249:25 - let me show you that as a couple
249:27 - examples
249:29 - in the first example we had a percent
249:31 - increase of 3 percent on the raise
249:36 - as a decimal i'll call this r this was
249:39 - 0.03
249:41 - and to get the growth factor we added
249:44 - that to 1 to get 1.03
249:47 - in the world population example we had a
249:50 - 1.1 percent increase we wrote this as
249:52 - 0.011
249:54 - and added it to 1
249:59 - to get
250:00 - 1.011
250:02 - in the drug example we had
250:05 - a decrease
250:07 - of 11
250:09 - we wrote that as a decimal
250:12 - and we subtracted
250:15 - the 0.11
250:16 - from 1
250:18 - to get 0.89
250:21 - in fact you can always write the growth
250:23 - factor b
250:24 - as one plus the percent change
250:28 - written as a decimal
250:30 - if you're careful to make that percent
250:32 - change negative when the quantity is
250:35 - decreasing and positive when the
250:37 - quantity is increasing since here 1 plus
250:40 - negative 0.11 gives us the correct
250:43 - growth factor of 0.89 which is less than
250:45 - 1.
250:46 - as a good check
250:48 - remember that if your quantity is
250:50 - increasing
250:52 - the base b
250:54 - should be bigger than 1 and if the
250:56 - quantity is decreasing
250:59 - then b should be less than 1.
251:03 - exponential functions can also be used
251:05 - to model bank accounts and loans with
251:07 - compound interest as we'll see in
251:09 - another video
251:12 - this video is about interpreting
251:13 - exponential functions
251:15 - an antique car is worth fifty thousand
251:17 - dollars now and its value increases by
251:20 - seven percent each year
251:22 - let's write an equation to model its
251:24 - value x years from now
251:27 - after one year
251:29 - its value
251:31 - is the fifty thousand
251:33 - plus
251:34 - 0.07
251:36 - times the 50 000.
251:38 - that's because its value has grown by
251:41 - seven percent or 0.07 times 50 000.
251:45 - this can be written
251:47 - as 50 000
251:48 - times 1 plus 0.07
251:52 - notice that adding 7 percent to the
251:55 - original value is the same as
251:58 - multiplying the original value by 1 plus
252:01 - .07
252:02 - or by 1.07
252:06 - after two years
252:08 - the value will be 50 000
252:11 - times 1 plus
252:14 - 0.07 squared
252:16 - or 50 000
252:18 - times
252:19 - 1.07 squared
252:21 - that's because the previous year's value
252:24 - is multiplied again by 1.07
252:28 - and in general after x years
252:33 - v of x
252:34 - the antique car's value
252:36 - will be 50 000
252:39 - times 1.07 to the x
252:42 - that's because the original value of 50
252:45 - 000 gets multiplied by 1.07
252:48 - x times one time for each year
252:52 - if we dissect this equation we see that
252:54 - the
252:55 - number of 50 000 comes from the original
252:58 - value of the car
253:00 - the 1.07 which i call the growth factor
253:04 - comes from 1 plus
253:07 - 0.707
253:09 - the 0.07 being the
253:12 - the percent increase
253:15 - written as a decimal
253:17 - so the form of this equation is an
253:20 - exponential equation v of x equals a
253:24 - times b to the x where a is the initial
253:27 - value
253:28 - and b is the growth vector
253:31 - but we could also write this as a times
253:34 - 1 plus r to the x
253:37 - where a is still the initial value
253:40 - but r
253:42 - is the percent increase written as a
253:44 - decimal
253:46 - this same equation will come up in the
253:48 - next example
253:49 - here my toyota prius is worth only 3000
253:53 - now and its value is decreasing by five
253:55 - percent each year
253:57 - so after one year
253:59 - its value
254:00 - will be three thousand minus zero point
254:04 - zero five times three thousand
254:07 - that is
254:08 - three thousand
254:10 - times one minus zero point zero five
254:14 - i can also write that as three thousand
254:17 - times zero point nine five
254:20 - decreasing the value by five percent
254:23 - is like multiplying the value by
254:27 - one minus 0.05 or by 0.95
254:32 - after two years
254:35 - the value will be multiplied by 0.95
254:40 - again so the value will be 3000 times
254:43 - 0.95 squared
254:45 - and after x years
254:47 - the value will be 3000 times 0.95 to the
254:52 - x
254:54 - so my equation for the value
254:56 - is 3000
254:58 - times 0.95 to the x
255:01 - this is again
255:02 - an equation of the form v of x equals a
255:06 - times b to the x where here
255:09 - a
255:10 - is 3000 the initial value
255:15 - and b
255:17 - is 0.95 i'll still call that the growth
255:20 - factor even though we're actually
255:23 - declining in value not growing
255:25 - now remember where this .95 came from it
255:28 - came from taking 1 and subtracting
255:32 - 0.05 because of the 5 percent decrease
255:35 - in value
255:37 - so i can again write my equation in the
255:40 - form a times well this time times 1
255:43 - minus r to the x
255:45 - where r
255:46 - is our .05
255:49 - that's our percent decrease
255:52 - written as a decimal
255:54 - please take a moment to study this
255:56 - equation
255:58 - and the previous one
256:00 - these say that when you have an
256:02 - exponential function
256:04 - the number here is the initial value
256:08 - if it's written in this form b is your
256:11 - growth factor but you can think of b as
256:14 - being either one minus r where r is the
256:17 - percent decrease or one plus r where r
256:20 - is the percent increase
256:23 - in this example we're given a function f
256:26 - of x to model the number of bacteria in
256:28 - a petri dish
256:30 - x hours after 12 o'clock noon
256:34 - we want to know what was the number of
256:36 - bacteria at noon and by what percent the
256:38 - number of bacteria is increasing every
256:40 - hour we can see from the equation that
256:43 - the number of bacteria is increasing and
256:45 - not decreasing because the base of the
256:48 - exponential function
256:49 - 1.45 is bigger than 1.
256:53 - notice that our equation f of x equals
256:55 - 12 times 1.45 to the x has the form
257:00 - of a times b to the x or we can think of
257:03 - it as a times 1 plus r to the x
257:07 - here a
257:09 - is 12
257:10 - b is 1.45 and r is 0.45
257:15 - based on this familiar form we can
257:18 - recognize that the initial amount of
257:20 - bacteria is going to be 12.
257:23 - 12 000 since those are our units
257:27 - and this value 1.45 is our growth
257:32 - factor
257:33 - what the number of bacteria is
257:35 - multiplied by
257:36 - each hour while r the 0.45 is the
257:41 - the the rate of increase in other words
257:44 - a 45 percent
257:47 - increase each hour
257:50 - so our answers to the questions are 12
257:53 - 000
257:54 - and 45 percent
257:58 - in this example the population of
258:00 - salamanders is modeled by this
258:02 - exponential function
258:04 - where x is the number of years since
258:05 - 2015.
258:09 - notice that the number of salamanders is
258:11 - decreasing
258:12 - because the base of our exponential
258:14 - function 0.78 is less than 1.
258:18 - so if we recognize the form
258:20 - of our exponential function a times b to
258:23 - the x
258:24 - or we can think of this as a times 1
258:27 - minus r to the x
258:30 - where a is our initial value
258:33 - and r
258:35 - is our
258:36 - percent
258:37 - decrease
258:39 - written as a decimal
258:42 - our initial value is three thousand
258:45 - so that's the number of salamanders 0
258:48 - years after 2015.
258:51 - our growth factor b
258:53 - is 0.78 but if i write that as 1 minus r
258:58 - i see that r has to be 1 minus 0.78
259:03 - or
259:04 - 0.22
259:06 - in other words our population is
259:07 - decreasing by 22 percent each year
259:12 - in this video we saw that exponential
259:15 - functions can be written in the form f
259:17 - of x equals a times b to the x
259:20 - where a is the initial value
259:25 - and b
259:26 - is the growth factor
259:29 - we also saw that they can be written in
259:31 - the form a times 1 plus r to the x
259:35 - when the amount is increasing
259:38 - and as a times 1 minus r to the x when
259:43 - the amount is decreasing
259:46 - in this format
259:47 - r
259:48 - is the percent increase or the percent
259:51 - decrease
259:52 - written as a decimal
259:56 - so a 15
259:58 - increase
259:59 - will be an r value of 0.15
260:04 - and a growth factor b
260:06 - of 1.15
260:08 - whereas a 12
260:11 - decrease
260:13 - will be
260:14 - an r value of 0.12 and a b value
260:19 - of 1 minus 0.12 or 0.7
260:24 - sorry 0.88
260:27 - these observations help us quickly
260:29 - interpret exponential functions
260:32 - for example here we have
260:35 - an initial value of 100 and a 15 percent
260:38 - increase
260:40 - and here
260:41 - we have an initial value of 50
260:44 - and
260:46 - a 40 percent
260:48 - decrease
260:50 - exponential functions can be used to
260:52 - model compound interest for loans and
260:54 - bank accounts
260:56 - suppose you invest two hundred dollars
260:58 - in a bank account that earns three
261:00 - percent interest every year
261:03 - if you make no deposits or withdrawals
261:05 - how much money will you have accumulated
261:07 - after 10 years
261:10 - because 3 percent of the money that's in
261:12 - the bank is getting added each year the
261:14 - money in the bank gets multiplied by
261:18 - 1.03 each year
261:20 - so after one year
261:22 - the amount will be 200 times 1.03 after
261:26 - two years
261:27 - 200 times 1.03 squared and
261:31 - and after t years
261:33 - 200 times 1.03 to the t power
261:38 - so the function modeling the amount of
261:40 - money
261:41 - i'll call it p of t
261:42 - is given by 200 times 1.03 to the t
261:47 - more generally if you invest a dollars
261:53 - at an annual interest rate of r
261:57 - for t years
262:01 - in the end you'll have p of t equals a
262:05 - times 1 plus r to the t
262:09 - here r needs to be written as a decimal
262:12 - so
262:13 - 0.03 in our example for the 3 percent
262:17 - annual interest rate
262:19 - going back to our specific example after
262:22 - 10 years the amount of money is going to
262:24 - be p of 10 which is 200 times 1.03 to
262:29 - the 10
262:31 - which works out to 268 dollars and 78
262:35 - cents to the nearest cent
262:37 - in this problem we've assumed that the
262:40 - interest accumulates once per year
262:42 - but in the next few examples we'll see
262:44 - what happens when the interest rate
262:46 - accumulates more frequently twice a year
262:48 - or every month for example
262:51 - let's deposit three hundred dollars in
262:54 - an account that earns 4.5 percent annual
262:56 - interest compounded semi-annually this
262:59 - means two times a year or every six
263:02 - months
263:04 - a 4.5 percent annual interest rate
263:09 - compounded two times a year
263:12 - means that we're actually getting 4.5
263:15 - over 2
263:16 - percent interest
263:18 - every time the interest is compounded
263:20 - that is every 6 months
263:25 - that's 2.25 percent interest
263:28 - every half a year
263:31 - note that 2.25 percent is the same as
263:36 - 0.0225 as a decimal
263:40 - so every time we earn interest
263:42 - our money gets multiplied
263:45 - by 1.0225
263:49 - let me make a chart of what happens
263:53 - after zero years which is also zero half
263:56 - years we have our original three hundred
263:59 - dollars
264:00 - after half a year that's one half year
264:03 - our money gets
264:05 - earns interest one time so we multiply
264:07 - the 300 by 1.08
264:11 - after one year that's two half years our
264:15 - money earns interest two times so we
264:17 - multiply 300 by 1.0225
264:21 - squared
264:23 - continuing this way
264:25 - after
264:26 - 1.5 years that's three half years
264:30 - we have 300 times 1.0225
264:33 - cubed and after two years or four half
264:36 - years we have 300 times
264:38 - 1.0225 to the fourth
264:41 - in general after t years which is 2t
264:46 - half years
264:47 - our money will grow to 300 times 1.02
264:53 - to the 2t power
264:55 - because we've compounded interest 2t
264:58 - times
265:00 - our formula for our amount of money is p
265:02 - of t equals 300 times 1.02
265:06 - to the 2t
265:08 - where t
265:09 - is the number of years
265:12 - to finish the problem after 7 years
265:15 - we'll have p of 7
265:18 - which is 300 times 1.0225
265:21 - to the 2 times 7 or 14 power
265:27 - and that works out to
265:29 - 409 dollars and 65 cents to the nearest
265:33 - cent
265:35 - in this next example we're gonna take
265:37 - out a loan for a thousand two hundred
265:39 - dollars at an annual interest rate of
265:41 - six percent compounded monthly
265:44 - although loans and bank accounts might
265:47 - feel different they're mathematically
265:49 - the same
265:50 - it's like from the bank's point of view
265:52 - they're investing money in you
265:53 - and getting interest on their money from
265:56 - you
265:57 - so we can work them out with the same
265:58 - kind of math
266:01 - six percent annual interest rate
266:05 - compounded monthly
266:07 - means you're compounding 12 times a year
266:11 - so each time you compound interest
266:12 - you're just going to get 6 over twelve
266:16 - percent interest
266:18 - that's point five percent interest
266:21 - and as a decimal
266:23 - that's zero point zero zero five
266:28 - let's chart out again what happens
266:32 - times zero
266:33 - of course you'll have the original loan
266:36 - amount of 1200
266:39 - after one year
266:40 - that's 12 months
266:43 - your loan
266:44 - has had interest headed to it
266:47 - 12 times so it gets multiplied by 1.005
266:52 - to the 12th
266:55 - after 2 years that's 24 months
266:58 - it's had interest added to it
267:01 - 24 times
267:03 - so it gets multiplied by 1.005 to the
267:05 - 24th power
267:07 - similarly after 3 years or 36 months
267:11 - your loan amount will be
267:14 - 1200 times 1.005 to the 36th power
267:19 - and in general
267:20 - after t years
267:22 - that's 12 t months
267:24 - so the interest will be compounded
267:27 - 12 t times
267:30 - and so we have to raise the 1.005 to the
267:33 - 12 t power
267:35 - this gives us the general formula
267:37 - for the money owed is p of t
267:40 - equals
267:41 - 1 200 times 1.005
267:45 - to the 12 t
267:47 - where t
267:48 - is the number of years
267:51 - in particular
267:52 - after three years
267:54 - we'll have to pay back a total of 1200
267:58 - times
267:58 - 1.005 to the 12 times 3 or 36 power
268:04 - which works out to
268:08 - 1436 dollars and two cents to the
268:12 - nearest cent
268:13 - these last two problems follow a general
268:15 - pattern
268:17 - if a is the initial amount
268:20 - of the loan or bank account
268:22 - and r
268:23 - is the annual interest rate
268:27 - compounded
268:30 - n
268:30 - times per year
268:33 - then our formula for the amount of money
268:36 - is going to be a
268:38 - times 1 plus r over n
268:41 - to the nt
268:44 - this formula exactly matches what we did
268:46 - in this problem
268:48 - first we took the interest rate r which
268:50 - was six percent
268:51 - and divided it by the number of
268:53 - compounding periods each year 12. we
268:56 - wrote that as a decimal and added one to
268:58 - it
268:59 - that's where we got the
269:01 - 1.005 from
269:04 - we raise this
269:05 - to not to the number of years but to 12
269:08 - times the number of years that's the
269:10 - number of compounding periods per year
269:12 - times the number of years
269:15 - and we multiplied all that by the
269:17 - initial amount of money which was 1 200.
269:21 - this formula for compound interest is a
269:23 - good one to memorize but it's also
269:25 - important to be able to reason your way
269:27 - through it like we did in this chart
269:29 - there's one more type of compound
269:31 - interest and that's interest compounded
269:33 - continuously
269:35 - you can think of continuous compounding
269:37 - as the limit of compounding more and
269:40 - more frequently
269:42 - 10 times a year 100 times a year a
269:44 - thousand times a year a million times a
269:45 - year in the limit you get continuous
269:48 - compounding
269:49 - the formula for continuous compounding
269:52 - is p of t equals a times e to the rt
269:57 - where p of t is the amount of money
270:01 - t
270:01 - is the time in years
270:05 - a is the initial amount of money
270:10 - and r
270:11 - is the
270:12 - annual interest rate
270:15 - written as a decimal
270:17 - so
270:18 - 0.025
270:20 - in this problem from the 2.5 percent
270:23 - annual interest rate
270:25 - e
270:26 - represents the famous constant euler's
270:28 - constant which is about 2.718
270:33 - so in this problem
270:35 - we have p of t
270:37 - is 4 000 times e to the 0.025
270:43 - t
270:44 - and after 5 years we'll have p of 5
270:48 - which is 4 000 times e to the 0.025
270:52 - times 5
270:54 - which works out to
270:59 - 4532.59 to the nearest cent
271:02 - to summarize if r represents the annual
271:05 - interest rate
271:07 - written as a decimal
271:09 - that is
271:10 - 2
271:11 - would be 0.02
271:14 - and t represents the number of years
271:18 - and a represents the initial amount of
271:20 - money than for just simple annual
271:23 - interest compounded once a year
271:26 - our formula is p of t is a
271:29 - times 1 plus r to the t
271:32 - for compound interest compounded n times
271:35 - per year
271:36 - our formula is p of t is a
271:39 - times 1 plus r over n to the nt
271:43 - and for compound interest compounded
271:45 - continuously we get p of t is a times e
271:49 - to the rt
271:52 - in this video we looked at three kinds
271:54 - of compound interest problems
271:56 - simple annual interest
271:59 - interest compounded end times per year
272:02 - and continuously compounded interest
272:06 - this video introduces logarithms
272:10 - logarithms are a way of writing
272:12 - exponents
272:14 - the expression log base a of b equals c
272:19 - means that a to the c equals b
272:23 - in other words
272:24 - log base a of b
272:27 - is the exponent that you raise a to to
272:30 - get b
272:32 - the number a is called the base of the
272:34 - logarithm it's also called the base when
272:37 - we write it in this exponential form
272:40 - some students find it helpful to
272:42 - remember this relationship
272:43 - log base a of b equals c
272:46 - means a to the c equals b
272:49 - by drawing arrows a to the c equals b
272:55 - other students like to think of it in
272:56 - terms of asking a question
272:58 - log base a of b
273:01 - asks
273:03 - what power do you raise a to
273:07 - in order to get b
273:11 - let's look at some examples
273:13 - log base 2 of 8 is 3
273:16 - because 2 to the 3 equals 8.
273:20 - in general
273:22 - log base 2 of y is asking you the
273:24 - question
273:26 - what power do you have to raise 2 to to
273:28 - get y so for example
273:32 - log base 2 of 16
273:34 - is 4 because it's asking you the
273:37 - question 2 to what power equals 16 and
273:41 - the answer is 4.
273:43 - please pause the video and try some of
273:45 - these other examples
273:47 - log base 2 of 2 is asking what power do
273:51 - you raise 2 to to get 2
273:53 - and the answer is 1.
273:58 - 2 to the 1 equals 2.
274:02 - log base 2 of one-half is asking 2 to
274:06 - what power gives you one-half
274:08 - well to get one-half you need to raise 2
274:11 - to a negative power so that would be 2
274:14 - to the negative 1.
274:17 - so the answer is negative 1.
274:20 - log base 2 of 1 8 means what power do we
274:23 - raise 2 to
274:24 - in order to get 1 8. again since 1 8 is
274:29 - 1 over 2 cubed
274:31 - we have to raise 2 to the negative 3
274:34 - power to get 1 over 2 cubed
274:38 - so our exponent is negative 3 and that's
274:41 - our answer to our log expression
274:44 - finally
274:46 - log base 2 of 1 is asking
274:48 - 2 to what power equals 1.
274:52 - well anything raised to the zero power
274:54 - gives us one so this log expression
274:57 - evaluates to zero
274:59 - notice that we can get positive negative
275:01 - and zero answers for our logarithm
275:05 - expressions
275:06 - please pause the video and figure out
275:09 - what these logs evaluate to
275:12 - to work out log base 10
275:14 - of a million
275:16 - notice that a million
275:19 - is 10
275:20 - to the sixth power
275:23 - now we're asking the question what power
275:25 - do we raise 10 to to get a million so
275:28 - that is what power do we raise 10 to to
275:30 - get 10 to the sixth well of course the
275:33 - answer is going to be
275:34 - 6.
275:37 - similarly since 0.001
275:41 - is 10 to the minus 3
275:43 - this log expression is the same thing as
275:46 - asking what's log base 10 of 10 to the
275:48 - minus 3.
275:50 - well what power do you have to raise 10
275:52 - to
275:53 - to get 10 to the minus 3 of course the
275:55 - answer is negative 3.
275:59 - log base 10 of 0 is asking
276:02 - what power do we raise 10 to to get zero
276:07 - well if you think about it there's no
276:09 - way to raise 10 to an exponent to get
276:11 - zero raising 10 to a positive exponent
276:13 - gets us really big positive numbers
276:16 - raising 10 to a negative exponent is
276:18 - like 1 over 10 to a power so that's
276:20 - giving us tiny fractions but they're
276:23 - still positive numbers we're never going
276:25 - to get zero
276:27 - even if we raise 10 to the zero power
276:29 - we'll just get one so there's no way to
276:31 - get 0 and the log base 10 of 0 does not
276:34 - exist
276:35 - if you try it on your calculator using
276:37 - the log base 10 button you'll get an
276:39 - error message
276:41 - same thing happens when we do log base
276:43 - 10 of negative 100 we're asking 10 to
276:45 - what power equals negative 100 and
276:48 - there's no exponent that will work
276:51 - and more generally it's possible to take
276:53 - the log of numbers that are greater than
276:56 - zero
276:57 - but not for numbers that are less than
277:00 - or equal to zero
277:02 - in other words the domain of the
277:03 - function log base a of x no matter what
277:06 - base you're using for a
277:08 - the domain is going to be all positive
277:11 - numbers
277:13 - a few notes on notation
277:15 - when you see ln of x that's called
277:17 - natural log and it means the log base e
277:20 - of x where e is that famous number
277:23 - that's about 2.718
277:27 - when you see log of x with no base at
277:29 - all by convention that means log base 10
277:32 - of x and it's called the common log
277:36 - most scientific calculators have buttons
277:38 - for natural log and for common log let's
277:42 - practice rewriting expressions with logs
277:44 - in them
277:46 - log base 3 of 1 9 is negative 2
277:50 - can be rewritten as the expression 3 to
277:53 - the negative 2 equals 1 9.
277:58 - log of 13 is shorthand for log base 10
278:02 - of 13.
278:04 - so that can be rewritten as 10
278:07 - to the 1.11394
278:10 - equals 13.
278:12 - finally in this last expression
278:15 - ln means natural log or log base e so i
278:18 - can rewrite this equation as log base e
278:22 - of 1 over e equals negative one
278:25 - well that means the same thing as e to
278:28 - the negative one
278:29 - equals one over e which is true
278:33 - now let's go the opposite direction
278:35 - we'll start with exponential equations
278:37 - and rewrite them as logs
278:40 - remember that log base a of b equals c
278:44 - means the same thing as a to the c
278:47 - equals b
278:49 - the base stays the same in both
278:51 - expressions
278:53 - so for this example
278:55 - the base of 3 in the exponential
278:57 - equation
278:58 - is going to be the same as the base in
279:00 - our log
279:02 - now i just have to figure out what's in
279:03 - the argument of the log
279:05 - and what goes on the other side of the
279:06 - equal sign
279:08 - remember that the answer to a log is an
279:11 - exponent
279:12 - so the thing that goes in this box
279:14 - should be my exponent for my exponential
279:16 - equation in other words u
279:20 - and i'll put the 9.78
279:23 - as the argument of my log
279:27 - this works because
279:29 - log base 3 of 9.78 equals u
279:33 - means the same thing as 3 to the u
279:36 - equals 9.78 which is just what we
279:39 - started with
279:41 - in the second example the base of my
279:43 - exponential equation is e
279:46 - so the base of my log is going to be e
279:50 - the answer to my log is an exponent
279:53 - in this case the exponent 3x plus 7.
279:58 - and the other expression the 4 minus y
280:02 - becomes my argument of my log
280:06 - let me check
280:08 - log base e of 4 minus y equals 3x plus 7
280:12 - means e to the 3x plus 7 equals 4 minus
280:15 - y which is just what i started with
280:18 - i can also rewrite log base e as natural
280:21 - log
280:24 - this video introduced the idea of logs
280:26 - and the fact that log base a of b equals
280:30 - c
280:31 - means the same thing
280:33 - as a to the c equals b
280:37 - so log base a of b
280:40 - is asking the question
280:41 - what power or exponent do you raise a to
280:45 - in order to get b
280:48 - in this video we'll work out the graphs
280:50 - of some log functions and also talk
280:52 - about their domains
280:55 - for this first example let's graph a log
280:57 - function by hand by plotting some points
281:01 - the function we're working with is y
281:03 - equals log base 2 of x
281:05 - i'll make a chart of x and y values
281:09 - since we're working this out by hand i
281:10 - want to pick x values for which it's
281:13 - easy to compute log base 2 of x
281:16 - so i'll start out with the x value of 1
281:19 - because log base 2 of 1
281:21 - is 0
281:23 - log base anything of 1 is 0.
281:26 - 2 is another x value that's easy to
281:28 - compute log base 2 of 2 that's asking
281:32 - what power do i raise 2 to to get 2
281:35 - well and the answer is 1.
281:39 - other powers of 2 are easy to work with
281:42 - so for example
281:43 - log base 2 of 4 that's saying what power
281:47 - do i raise 2 to get 4 so the answer is 2
281:51 - similarly log base 2 of 8 is 3 and log
281:55 - base 2 of 16 is 4.
281:58 - let me also work with some fractional
282:00 - values for x
282:02 - if x is one-half then log base 2 of
282:05 - one-half that's saying what power do i
282:08 - raise 2 to
282:09 - to get 1 half well that needs a power of
282:12 - negative 1.
282:14 - it's also easy to compute by hand
282:17 - the log base 2 of 1 4 and 1 8.
282:21 - log base 2 of 1 4 is negative 2 since
282:25 - 2
282:26 - to the negative 2 is 1 4
282:29 - and similarly log base 2 of 1 8 is
282:32 - negative 3.
282:34 - i'll put some tick marks on my x and y
282:36 - axes
282:37 - please pause the video and take a moment
282:39 - to plot these points
282:41 - let's see i have the point
282:43 - 1 0
282:45 - that's here
282:46 - 2 1 that's here
282:48 - 4 2 that is here
282:51 - and then 8
282:53 - 3 which is
282:55 - here
282:56 - and the fractional x values one half
282:59 - goes with negative 1
283:01 - and 1 4 with negative 2 1 8 with
283:04 - negative 3.
283:06 - and if i connect the dots
283:08 - i get a graph that looks something like
283:10 - this if i had smaller and smaller
283:12 - fractions i would keep getting more and
283:14 - more negative
283:16 - answers when i took log base two of them
283:18 - so my graph is
283:20 - getting
283:21 - more and more negative my y values are
283:23 - getting more and more negative
283:25 - as x is getting close to zero
283:28 - now i didn't draw any parts of the graph
283:30 - over here with negative x values and i
283:31 - didn't put any negative x values in my
283:33 - chart
283:34 - that omission is is no accident because
283:37 - if you try to take the log
283:40 - base 2 or base anything of a negative
283:42 - number like say negative
283:44 - 4 or something there's no answer
283:48 - this doesn't exist because there's no
283:50 - power that you can raise
283:52 - 2 2
283:53 - to get a negative number
283:57 - so there are no
283:59 - points on the graph for negative x
284:00 - values and similarly there are no points
284:02 - on the graph where x is 0 because you
284:05 - can't take log base 2 of 0 there's no
284:08 - power you can raise 2 to to get 0.
284:13 - i want to observe some key features of
284:15 - this graph
284:16 - first of all the domain
284:18 - is
284:19 - x values greater than zero
284:22 - in interval notation i can write that as
284:25 - a round bracket because i don't want to
284:27 - include 0 to infinity
284:30 - the range
284:32 - is going to be the y values well they go
284:35 - all the way down into the far reach of
284:37 - the negative numbers and the graph
284:40 - gradually increases y value is getting
284:42 - bigger and bigger so the range is
284:44 - actually
284:45 - all real numbers
284:48 - we're in interval notation negative
284:49 - infinity to infinity
284:52 - finally i want to point out that this
284:53 - graph has a vertical asymptote
284:57 - at the y-axis
285:00 - that is at
285:02 - the line
285:03 - x equals zero
285:06 - i'll draw that on my graph with a dotted
285:08 - line
285:09 - a vertical asymptote is a line that our
285:12 - function's graph gets closer and closer
285:14 - to
285:14 - so this is the graph of y equals log
285:17 - base 2 of x but if i wanted to graph say
285:21 - y equals
285:22 - log base 10 of x it would look very
285:26 - similar it would still have a domain of
285:29 - x values greater than zero a range of
285:31 - all real numbers and a vertical
285:33 - asymptote at the y axis it would still
285:35 - go through the point 1 0 but it would go
285:38 - through the point 10 1
285:41 - instead because
285:43 - log base 10 of 10
285:46 - is 1.
285:47 - it would look
285:48 - pretty much the same just a lot flatter
285:50 - over here
285:54 - but even though it doesn't look like it
285:55 - with the way i've drawn it it still
285:57 - gradually goes up
285:59 - to and towards infinity
286:02 - in fact the graph of y equals log base
286:05 - any a of x for a bigger than one
286:09 - looks pretty much the same
286:11 - and has these same three properties
286:14 - now that we know what the basic log
286:16 - graph looks like we can plot at least
286:18 - rough graphs of other log functions
286:20 - without plotting points
286:22 - here we have the graph of
286:24 - natural log of x plus 5. and again i'm
286:27 - just going to draw a rough graph if i
286:29 - did want to do a more accurate graph i
286:30 - probably would want to plot some points
286:32 - but i know that roughly
286:34 - a log graph
286:36 - if it was just like y equals ln of x
286:39 - that would look something like this
286:42 - and it would go through the point one
286:44 - zero
286:45 - with a vertical asymptote along the
286:47 - y-axis
286:49 - now if i want to graph ln of x plus 5
286:52 - that just shifts our graph up by 5 units
286:55 - it'll still have the same vertical
286:57 - asymptote since a vertical line shifted
286:59 - up by 5 units is still a vertical line
287:01 - but instead of going through 1 0 it'll
287:04 - go through the point 1 5.
287:06 - so i'll draw a rough sketch here
287:12 - let's compare our starting function y
287:14 - equals ln x and the transformed version
287:17 - y equals lnx plus 5
287:20 - in terms of the domain
287:22 - the range
287:23 - and the vertical asymptote
287:26 - our original function y equals ln x had
287:29 - a domain
287:30 - of 0 to infinity
287:34 - since adding 5 on the outside affects
287:37 - the y values and the domain is the x
287:40 - values
287:41 - this transformation doesn't change the
287:43 - domain
287:44 - so the domain is still from 0 to
287:46 - infinity
287:49 - now the range of our original y equals
287:51 - ln x
287:52 - was from negative infinity to infinity
287:56 - shifting up by 5 does affect the y
287:58 - values and the range is talking about
288:00 - the y values but since the original
288:02 - range was all real numbers if you add
288:05 - five to all instead of all real numbers
288:06 - you still get the set of all real
288:07 - numbers so in this case
288:10 - the range doesn't change either
288:13 - and finally we already saw that the
288:14 - original vertical asymptote of the
288:16 - y-axis x equals zero when we shift that
288:19 - up by five units it's still the vertical
288:21 - line x equals zero
288:25 - in this next example we're starting with
288:27 - a log base 10 function
288:29 - and since the plus 2 is on the inside
288:32 - that means we shift that graph left by
288:34 - 2.
288:36 - so i'll draw our basic log function
288:39 - here's our basic log function so i'll
288:42 - think of that as y equals log of x going
288:45 - through the point one zero
288:47 - here's its vertical asymptote now i need
288:50 - to shift everything left by two
288:54 - so my vertical asymptote shifts left and
288:57 - now it's at the line x equals negative
289:00 - two instead of at x equals zero
289:03 - and my graph well let's see my point one
289:06 - zero gets shifted to
289:09 - let's see negative 1 0
289:12 - since i'm subtracting 2 from the x's
289:15 - and here's a rough sketch of
289:18 - the resulting graph
289:21 - let's compare the features
289:23 - of the two graphs drawn here
289:26 - we're talking about domains the original
289:29 - had a domain of from 0 to infinity but
289:33 - now i've shifted that left
289:35 - so i've subtracted 2 from all my x
289:37 - values and here's my new domain which i
289:40 - can also verify just by looking at the
289:42 - picture
289:43 - my range
289:45 - was originally
289:47 - from negative infinity to infinity well
289:49 - shifting left only affects the x value
289:51 - so it doesn't even affect the range so
289:53 - my range is still negative infinity to
289:55 - infinity
289:56 - my vertical asymptote was originally at
289:59 - x equals 0 and since i subtract 2 from
290:03 - all my x values that shifts it to x
290:05 - equals negative 2.
290:07 - in this last problem i'm not going to
290:09 - worry about drawing this graph i'll just
290:11 - use algebra to compute its domain
290:14 - so let's think about what's the issue
290:16 - when you're taking the logs of things
290:19 - well you can't take the log of a
290:21 - negative number or zero so whatever's
290:23 - inside
290:25 - the argument of the log function
290:26 - whatever's being fed into log had better
290:29 - be greater than zero so i'll write that
290:32 - down
290:32 - we need 2 minus 3x to be greater than
290:36 - zero
290:37 - now it's a matter of solving an
290:39 - inequality
290:40 - 2 has got to be greater than 3x
290:42 - so 2 3 is greater than x in other words
290:45 - x has to be less than two-thirds so our
290:48 - domain
290:49 - is
290:50 - all the x values from negative infinity
290:53 - to two-thirds not including two-thirds
290:57 - it's a good idea to memorize the basic
290:59 - shape
291:00 - of the graph of a log function
291:04 - it looks something like this
291:05 - goes through the point 1 0 and has a
291:08 - vertical asymptote on the y axis
291:11 - also if you remember that you can't take
291:13 - the log
291:15 - of a negative number
291:17 - or zero then that helps you quickly
291:19 - compute domains for log functions
291:24 - whatever's inside the log function you
291:27 - set that greater than zero and solve
291:33 - this video is about combining functions
291:35 - by adding them subtracting them
291:37 - multiplying them and dividing them
291:40 - suppose we have two functions
291:42 - f of x equals x plus one and g of x
291:45 - equals x squared
291:47 - one way to combine them is by adding
291:49 - them together
291:50 - this notation f plus g
291:53 - of x means the function defined by
291:56 - taking
291:57 - f of x
291:58 - and adding it to g of x
292:01 - so for our functions that means we take
292:04 - x plus 1 and add x squared i can
292:07 - rearrange that as the function x squared
292:10 - plus x plus 1.
292:11 - so
292:12 - so f plus g
292:15 - evaluated on x means x squared plus x
292:19 - plus 1.
292:20 - and if i wanted to evaluate f plus g on
292:24 - the number two that would be two squared
292:27 - plus two plus one
292:29 - or seven
292:31 - similarly the notation f minus g of x
292:35 - means the function we get by taking f of
292:37 - x and subtracting g of x so that would
292:40 - be x plus 1 minus x squared
292:44 - and if i wanted to take
292:45 - f minus g evaluated at 1
292:49 - that would be
292:50 - 1 plus 1 minus 1 squared or
292:54 - 1.
292:55 - the notation f dot g of x which is
292:58 - sometimes also written just as f g
293:01 - of x that means we take f of x times g
293:05 - of x
293:07 - in other words x plus 1
293:09 - times
293:10 - x squared which could be simplified as x
293:13 - cubed plus x squared
293:16 - the notation f divided by g of x
293:20 - means i take
293:22 - f of x
293:24 - and divide it by g of x so that would be
293:26 - x plus 1 divided by x squared
293:30 - in this figure
293:32 - the blue graph represents h of x
293:36 - and the red graph represents the
293:38 - function p of x
293:40 - we're asked to find h minus p of zero
293:45 - we don't have any equations to work with
293:47 - but that's okay
293:49 - we know that for any x
293:51 - h minus p of x is defined as h of x
293:54 - minus p of x
293:56 - so for x equals 0 h minus p of 0 is
294:00 - going to be h of 0 minus p of 0.
294:04 - using the graph we can find h of 0
294:07 - by finding the value of 0 on the x axis
294:11 - and finding the corresponding y value
294:14 - for the function h of x so that's about
294:16 - 1.8
294:20 - now p of zero we can find similarly by
294:23 - looking for zero on the x axis
294:25 - and finding the corresponding y value
294:27 - for the function p of x and that's a y
294:29 - value of 1.
294:31 - 1.8 minus 1 is 0.8 so that's our
294:35 - approximate value for h minus p of 0.
294:40 - if we want to find p times h of negative
294:43 - 3
294:45 - again we can rewrite that as p
294:47 - of negative 3 times h of negative 3.
294:51 - and using the graphs we see that for an
294:53 - x value of negative 3 the y value for p
294:57 - is 2
295:01 - and the x value of negative 3
295:04 - corresponds to a y value of negative 2
295:06 - for h
295:09 - 2 times negative 2 is negative 4 so
295:12 - that's our value for p times h of
295:14 - negative 3.
295:16 - in this video we saw how to add two
295:18 - functions subtract two functions
295:21 - multiply two functions and divide two
295:23 - functions
295:25 - in the following way
295:29 - when you compose two functions
295:31 - you apply the first function
295:34 - and then you apply the second function
295:37 - to the output of the first function for
295:40 - example the first function might compute
295:43 - population size from
295:45 - time in years
295:47 - so its input would be time
295:50 - in years since a certain date its output
295:53 - would be number of people in the
295:55 - population
295:58 - the second function
296:00 - g
296:01 - might compute healthcare costs
296:03 - as a function of population size
296:06 - so it will take population size as input
296:10 - and its output will be healthcare costs
296:14 - if you put these functions together that
296:16 - is compose them then you'll go all the
296:19 - way from time in years to health care
296:22 - costs
296:23 - this is your composition
296:25 - g composed with f
296:28 - the composition of two functions
296:30 - written g
296:32 - with a little circle f of x
296:34 - is defined as follows
296:36 - g composed with f of x
296:39 - is g
296:40 - evaluated
296:42 - on f of x
296:44 - we can think of it schematically in this
296:46 - diagram
296:47 - f acts on a number x and produces a
296:51 - number f of x
296:52 - then g
296:54 - takes that output f of x and produces a
296:56 - new number
296:58 - g of
296:59 - f x
297:01 - our composition of functions g composed
297:04 - with f is the function that goes all the
297:05 - way from x
297:07 - to
297:08 - g of f x
297:10 - let's work out some examples where our
297:12 - functions are defined by tables of
297:14 - values
297:15 - if we want to find g composed with f of
297:18 - 4
297:19 - by definition this means g
297:22 - of
297:24 - f 4.
297:25 - to evaluate this expression we always
297:27 - work from the inside out
297:30 - so we start with the x value of 4
297:33 - and we find f of 4
297:35 - using the table of values for f of x
297:38 - when x equals 4
297:40 - f of x is 7.
297:42 - so we can replace
297:44 - f of 4 with the number 7.
297:48 - now we need to
297:49 - evaluate g of 7
297:51 - 7 becomes our new x value in our table
297:54 - of values for g
297:56 - the x value of 7 corresponds to the g of
297:59 - x value of of 10 so g of 7 is equal to
298:03 - 10.
298:05 - we found that g composed with f of 4 is
298:08 - equal to 10.
298:10 - if instead we want to find f composed
298:12 - with g of 4
298:14 - well we can rewrite that as f of
298:18 - g of 4
298:19 - and again work from the inside out
298:22 - now we're trying to find g of 4 so 4 is
298:25 - our x value and we use our table of
298:27 - values for g to see that g
298:30 - of 4 is 1.
298:33 - so we replace g of 4 by 1 and now we
298:36 - need to evaluate f of 1.
298:39 - using our table for f values f of 1 is
298:42 - 8.
298:45 - notice that when we've computed
298:47 - g of f of 4 we got a different answer
298:50 - then we computed f of g of 4.
298:54 - and in general
298:56 - g composed with f is not the same thing
298:58 - as f composed with g
299:01 - please pause the video and take a moment
299:03 - to compute the next two examples
299:07 - we can replace f composed with f of 2 by
299:09 - the equivalent expression f of f of 2
299:13 - working from the inside out we know that
299:16 - f of 2 is 3
299:19 - and f of 3 is 6.
299:23 - if we want to find f composed with g of
299:25 - 6
299:26 - rewrite that as f of g of 6
299:30 - using the table for g
299:32 - g of 6 is 8
299:35 - but f of 8
299:38 - 8 is not on the table
299:40 - as an x value for the for the f function
299:43 - and so there is no f of 8. this does not
299:46 - exist
299:48 - we can say that 6
299:50 - is not
299:51 - in the domain
299:54 - for f composed with g
299:57 - even though it was in the domain of g
300:01 - we couldn't follow all the way through
300:03 - and get a value for f composed with g of
300:05 - 6.
300:07 - next let's turn our attention to the
300:09 - composition of functions that are given
300:11 - by equations
300:13 - p of x is x squared plus x and q of x is
300:16 - negative 2x
300:18 - we want to find q composed with p of 1.
300:22 - as usual i can rewrite this as q of
300:25 - p of 1 and work from the inside out
300:29 - p of 1
300:32 - is one squared plus one so that's two
300:36 - so this is the same thing as q of two
300:39 - but q of two is negative two times two
300:43 - or negative four so this evaluates to
300:46 - negative
300:47 - in this next example we want to find q
300:50 - composed of p of some arbitrary x
300:53 - i'll rewrite it as usual as q of p of x
300:57 - and work from the inside out
301:00 - well
301:00 - p of x we know the formula for that
301:04 - that's x squared plus x so i can replace
301:07 - my p of x with that expression
301:10 - now
301:11 - i'm stuck with evaluating q on
301:14 - x squared plus x well q of anything is
301:18 - negative 2 times that thing so q of x
301:21 - squared plus x is going to be negative 2
301:25 - times the quantity x squared plus x what
301:28 - i've done is i've substituted in the
301:30 - whole expression x squared plus x where
301:33 - i saw the x in this formula for q of x
301:36 - it's important to use the parentheses
301:38 - here so that we'll be multiplying
301:40 - negative 2 by the whole expression and
301:42 - not just by the first piece
301:44 - i can simplify this a bit
301:46 - as negative 2x squared minus 2x and
301:49 - that's my expression
301:51 - for q composed with p of x
301:54 - notice that if i wanted to compute q
301:56 - compose with p of 1
301:59 - which i already did in the first problem
302:01 - i could just use this expression now
302:03 - negative 2 times 1 squared minus 2 and i
302:07 - get negative 4 just like i did before
302:11 - let's try another one let's try p
302:13 - composed with q of x
302:16 - first i read write this p of q of x
302:20 - working from the inside out i can
302:22 - replace q of x with negative 2x so i
302:25 - need to compute p of negative 2x
302:29 - here's my formula for p
302:32 - to compute p of this expression i need
302:34 - to plug in this expression everywhere i
302:36 - see an x in the formula for p so that
302:40 - means
302:42 - negative 2x squared plus negative 2x
302:46 - again being careful to use parentheses
302:48 - to make sure i plug in the entire
302:50 - expression
302:51 - in for x
302:53 - let me simplify this is 4x squared minus
302:57 - 2x
302:59 - notice that i got different expressions
303:01 - for
303:02 - q of p of x
303:04 - and for
303:05 - p of q of x once again
303:09 - we see that q composed with p is not
303:11 - necessarily equal to p composed with q
303:15 - please pause the video and try this last
303:18 - example yourself
303:20 - rewriting
303:24 - and working from the inside out
303:26 - we can replace p of x with its
303:28 - expression x squared plus x
303:31 - and then we need to evaluate p on x
303:33 - squared plus x
303:35 - that means we plug in
303:38 - x squared plus x
303:40 - everywhere we see an x in this formula
303:42 - so that's x squared plus x quantity
303:44 - squared plus
303:46 - x squared plus x
303:48 - once again i can simplify
303:50 - by distributing out that gives me x to
303:52 - the fourth plus
303:55 - two x cubed plus x squared plus x
303:59 - squared plus x or x to the fourth plus
304:01 - two x cubed plus 2x squared plus x
304:06 - in this last set of examples we're asked
304:08 - to go backwards
304:09 - we're given a formula for a function of
304:12 - h of x but we're supposed to rewrite h
304:14 - of x as a composition of two functions f
304:18 - and g
304:20 - let's think for a minute which of these
304:22 - two functions gets applied first
304:24 - f composed with g of x let's see that
304:27 - means f of
304:30 - g of x and since we evaluate these
304:32 - expressions from the inside out we must
304:35 - be applying g first
304:37 - and then f
304:39 - in order to figure out what what f and g
304:42 - could be i like to draw a box around
304:45 - some thing inside my expression for h so
304:48 - i'm going to draw a box around x squared
304:49 - plus 7.
304:51 - then whatever's inside the box that'll
304:53 - be my function g of x the first function
304:56 - that gets applied
304:57 - whatever happens to the box in this case
304:59 - taking the square root sign
305:02 - that becomes my outside function my
305:04 - second function f
305:06 - so here we're going to say g of x is
305:09 - equal to x squared plus 7
305:11 - and f of x is equal to the square root
305:15 - of x let's just check and make sure that
305:17 - this works
305:19 - so i need to check that when i take the
305:21 - composition
305:23 - f composed with g
305:25 - i need to get the same thing as my
305:27 - original
305:28 - h
305:29 - so let's see if i do
305:33 - f composed with g of x well by
305:35 - definition that's f of g of x
305:38 - working from the inside out i can
305:40 - replace g of x with its formula
305:42 - x squared plus seven so i need to
305:44 - evaluate f of x squared plus seven
305:47 - that means i
305:49 - plug in x squared plus seven
305:51 - into the formula for for f
305:54 - so that becomes the square root of x
305:56 - squared plus 7. ta-da it works because
305:59 - it matches my original equation
306:02 - so we found a correct answer a correct
306:04 - way of breaking h down as a composition
306:06 - of two functions but i do want to point
306:08 - out this is not the only correct answer
306:12 - i'll write down my formula for h of x
306:14 - again and this time i'll put the box in
306:16 - a different place i'll just box the x
306:19 - squared
306:20 - if i did that then my inside function my
306:23 - first function
306:25 - g of x would be x squared
306:29 - and my second function
306:31 - is what happens
306:33 - to the box
306:34 - so my f of x is what happens to the box
306:37 - and the box gets
306:39 - added 7 to it and taking the square root
306:42 - so in other words f of x is going to be
306:46 - the square root of x plus 7.
306:49 - again i can check that this works if i
306:52 - do f compose with g of x that's f of g
306:55 - of x so now g of x is x squared so i'm
306:59 - taking f of x squared when i plug in x
307:02 - squared for x i do in fact get the
307:05 - square root of x squared plus seven so
307:07 - this is it alternative correct solution
307:11 - in this video we learned to evaluate the
307:14 - composition of functions
307:16 - by rewriting it and working from the
307:19 - inside out
307:20 - we also learned to break apart
307:23 - a complicated function
307:25 - into a composition of two functions
307:29 - by boxing one piece of the function
307:32 - and letting the first function applied
307:34 - in the composition
307:35 - let that be the inside of the box and
307:38 - the second function applied in the
307:39 - composition b whatever happens to the
307:41 - box
307:52 - the inverse of a function undoes what
307:54 - the function does
307:56 - so the inverse of tying your shoes
307:58 - would be to untie them
308:01 - and the inverse of the function that
308:03 - adds 2 to a number
308:05 - would be the function that subtracts 2
308:08 - from a number
308:10 - this video introduces inverses and their
308:12 - properties
308:14 - suppose f of x is the function defined
308:16 - by this chart
308:18 - in other words f of 2 is 3
308:20 - f of 3 is 5
308:22 - f of 4 is 6 and f of 5 is 1.
308:27 - the inverse function for f written f
308:30 - superscript negative 1 x undoes what f
308:33 - does
308:35 - since f takes 2 to 3
308:38 - f inverse takes 3 back to 2.
308:42 - so we write this f superscript negative
308:44 - 1 of 3 is 2.
308:48 - similarly since f takes 3 to 5
308:52 - f inverse takes 5 to 3.
308:57 - and since f takes 4 to 6
309:00 - f inverse of 6 is 4
309:03 - and since f takes 5 to 1 f inverse of 1
309:06 - is 5.
309:09 - i'll use these numbers to fill in the
309:10 - chart
309:12 - notice that the chart of values when y
309:14 - equals f of x and the chart of values
309:16 - when y equals f inverse of x are closely
309:19 - related
309:21 - they share the same numbers but the x
309:23 - values for f of x correspond to the y
309:26 - values for f inverse of x and the y
309:29 - values
309:30 - for f of x correspond to the x values
309:33 - for f inverse of x
309:35 - that leads us to the first key fact
309:38 - inverse functions reverse the rules of y
309:40 - and x
309:42 - i'm going to plot the points for y
309:44 - equals f of x in blue
309:47 - next i'll plot the points for y equals f
309:50 - inverse of x in red
309:53 - pause the video for a moment and see
309:54 - what kind of symmetry you observe in
309:56 - this graph how are the blue points
309:58 - related to the red points
310:01 - you might have noticed that the blue
310:02 - points and the red points are mirror
310:03 - images
310:05 - over the mirror line y equals x
310:09 - so our second key fact
310:11 - is that the graph of y equals f inverse
310:14 - of x can be obtained from the graph of y
310:16 - equals f of x by reflecting over the
310:19 - line y equals x
310:22 - this makes sense because inverses
310:25 - reverse the rules of y and x
310:28 - in this same example
310:30 - let's compute f inverse of f of 2. this
310:33 - open circle means composition in other
310:36 - words we're computing
310:38 - f inverse of f of 2.
310:42 - we compute this from the inside out
310:44 - so that's f inverse
310:46 - of
310:47 - 3
310:48 - since f of 2 is 3
310:51 - and f inverse of 3 we see is 2.
310:57 - similarly we can compute
311:00 - f of f inverse of 3
311:02 - and that means we take f of f inverse of
311:06 - 3.
311:07 - since f inverse of 3 is 2
311:10 - that's the same thing as computing f of
311:13 - 2
311:14 - which is 3.
311:17 - please pause the video for a moment and
311:19 - compute
311:20 - these other compositions
311:26 - you should have found that in every case
311:28 - if you take f inverse of f of a number
311:31 - you get back to the very same number you
311:33 - started with and similarly if you take f
311:36 - of f inverse of any number
311:38 - you get back to the same number you
311:39 - started with
311:41 - so in general
311:43 - f inverse of f of x is equal to x
311:46 - and f of f inverse of x is also equal to
311:49 - x
311:50 - this is the mathematical way of saying
311:52 - that f and
311:53 - f inverse undo each other
311:56 - let's look at a different example
311:58 - suppose that f of x is x cubed
312:01 - pause the video for a moment and guess
312:03 - what the inverse of f should be remember
312:06 - f inverse undoes the work that f does
312:11 - you might have guessed that f inverse of
312:13 - x is going to be the cube root function
312:17 - and we can check that this is true by
312:19 - looking at f
312:21 - of f inverse of x that's f
312:24 - of the cube root of function
312:26 - which means the cube root function cubed
312:29 - which gets us back to x
312:31 - similarly if we compute f inverse of f
312:34 - of x that's the cube root of x cubed
312:38 - and we get back to x
312:40 - again
312:41 - so the cube root function really is the
312:43 - inverse of the cubing function when we
312:46 - compose the two functions we get back to
312:48 - the number that we started with
312:53 - it'd be nice to have a more systematic
312:54 - way of finding inverses of functions
312:56 - besides guessing and checking
312:59 - one method uses the fact that inverses
313:02 - reverse the roles of y and x
313:05 - so if we want to find the inverse of the
313:07 - function f of x equals 5 minus x over 3x
313:11 - we can write it as y equals 5 minus x
313:15 - over 3x
313:17 - reverse the rules of y and x
313:20 - to get x equals 5 minus y over 3y
313:24 - and then solve for y
313:27 - to solve for y let's multiply both sides
313:30 - by 3y
313:33 - bring all terms with y's in them to the
313:36 - left side and all terms without y's in
313:39 - them to the right side
313:41 - factor out the y
313:45 - and divide to isolate y
313:50 - this gives us f inverse of x
313:53 - as five over three x plus one
313:57 - notice that our original function
313:59 - f and our inverse function f inverse are
314:03 - both rational functions but they're not
314:05 - the reciprocals of each other
314:07 - and in general
314:09 - f inverse of x is not usually equal to 1
314:12 - over f of x
314:15 - this can be confusing because when we
314:17 - write 2 to the minus 1 that does mean 1
314:20 - over 2
314:22 - but f to the minus 1 of x means the
314:24 - inverse function
314:26 - and not the reciprocal
314:30 - it's natural to ask if all functions
314:32 - have inverse functions that is for any
314:34 - function you might encounter is there
314:36 - always a function that is its inverse
314:40 - in fact the answer is no
314:45 - see if you can come up with an example
314:46 - of a function that does not have an
314:48 - inverse function
314:51 - the word function here is key
314:54 - remember that a function is a
314:56 - relationship between x values and y
314:57 - values
314:59 - such that for each x value in the domain
315:04 - there's only one
315:05 - corresponding y value
315:10 - one example of a function that does not
315:12 - have an inverse function
315:14 - is
315:14 - the function f of x equals x squared
315:20 - to see that
315:21 - the inverse of this function is not a
315:23 - function
315:24 - note that
315:25 - for the x squared function
315:28 - the number two and the number negative
315:31 - two
315:32 - both go to the number four
315:35 - so if i had an inverse
315:37 - it would have to send four
315:39 - to both two and negative two
315:42 - the inverse would not be a function
315:45 - it might be easier to understand the
315:47 - problem
315:48 - when you look at a graph of y equals x
315:50 - squared
315:53 - recall that inverse functions reverse
315:55 - the rules of y and x and flip the graph
315:59 - over the line y equals x
316:02 - but when i flip the green graph over the
316:04 - line y equals x i get this red graph
316:08 - this red graph is not the graph of a
316:10 - function
316:11 - because it violates the vertical line
316:13 - test
316:14 - the reason it violates the vertical line
316:16 - test is because the original green
316:18 - function
316:18 - violates the horizontal line test
316:21 - and has
316:23 - two x values with the same y value
316:27 - in general
316:28 - a function f has an inverse function if
316:31 - and only if the graph of f satisfies the
316:33 - horizontal line test i.e every
316:35 - horizontal line intersects the graph in
316:38 - at most one point pause the video for a
316:41 - moment and see which of these four
316:43 - graphs satisfy the horizontal line test
316:45 - in other words
316:47 - which of the four corresponding
316:49 - functions would have an inverse function
316:53 - you may have found that graphs a
316:56 - and b
316:57 - violate the horizontal line test
317:00 - so their functions would not have
317:01 - inverse functions
317:03 - but graph c and d
317:05 - satisfy the horizontal line test so
317:08 - these graphs represent functions that do
317:10 - have inverses
317:12 - functions that satisfy the horizontal
317:14 - line test are sometimes called
317:16 - one-to-one functions
317:20 - equivalently a function is one to one if
317:22 - for any two different x values
317:26 - x one and x two
317:28 - the y values f of x one and f of x two
317:31 - are different numbers
317:33 - sometimes as i said
317:35 - f is one to one if
317:37 - whenever
317:38 - f of x one is equal to f of x two
317:42 - then x one has to equal x two
317:45 - as our last example let's try to find p
317:48 - inverse of x where p of x is the square
317:51 - root of x minus 2 drawn here
317:54 - if we graph p inverse on the same axis
317:57 - as p of x
317:58 - we get the following graph
318:00 - simply by flipping over the line y
318:03 - equals x
318:05 - if we try to solve the problem
318:06 - algebraically
318:08 - we can write y equal to square root of x
318:11 - minus 2
318:12 - reverse the roles of y and x
318:15 - and solve for y
318:16 - by squaring both sides
318:19 - and adding 2.
318:24 - now if we were to graph y equals x
318:26 - squared plus 2 that would look like a
318:28 - parabola
318:29 - it would look like the red graph we've
318:31 - already drawn
318:32 - together
318:33 - with
318:35 - another arm on the left side
318:39 - but we know that our actual inverse
318:40 - function consists only of this right arm
318:46 - we can specify this algebraically by
318:49 - making the restriction
318:50 - that x has to be bigger than or equal to
318:54 - zero
318:56 - this corresponds to the fact that on the
318:59 - original graph for the square root of x
319:02 - y was only greater than or equal to zero
319:06 - looking more closely at the domain and
319:08 - range of p and p inverse
319:10 - we know that the domain of p
319:14 - is all values
319:16 - of x such that x minus two is greater
319:18 - than or equal to zero since we can't
319:20 - take the square root of a negative
319:21 - number
319:23 - this corresponds to x values being
319:25 - greater than or equal to two or in
319:27 - interval notation the interval from 2 to
319:30 - infinity
319:32 - the range of p we can see from the graph
319:35 - is all y values greater than or equal to
319:37 - 0 or the interval from 0 to infinity
319:42 - similarly
319:44 - based on the graph we see the domain of
319:46 - p inverse
319:48 - is x values greater than or equal to 0
319:50 - the interval from 0 to infinity and the
319:53 - range of p inverse
319:55 - is y values greater than or equal to 2
319:58 - or the interval from 2 to infinity
320:02 - if you look closely at these domains and
320:03 - ranges you'll notice that the domain of
320:05 - p
320:07 - corresponds exactly to the range of p
320:09 - inverse
320:10 - and the range of p
320:12 - corresponds to the domain of p inverse
320:16 - this makes sense because inverse
320:18 - functions reverse the rules of y and x
320:22 - the domain of f inverse of x is the x
320:25 - values for f inverse which corresponds
320:27 - to the y values or the range of f
320:31 - the range of f inverse is the y values
320:34 - for f inverse which correspond to the x
320:37 - values or the domain of f
320:41 - in this video
320:42 - we discussed five key properties of
320:44 - inverse functions
320:47 - inverse functions reverse the roles of y
320:50 - and x
320:52 - the graph of
320:54 - y equals f inverse of x
320:57 - is the graph of y equals f of x
321:01 - reflected over the line y equals x
321:05 - when we compose f with f inverse
321:08 - we get the identity function y equals x
321:12 - and similarly
321:14 - when we compose f inverse with f
321:17 - that brings x to x in other words f and
321:19 - f inverse undo each other
321:22 - the function f of x
321:25 - has an inverse function
321:29 - if and only if
321:31 - the graph
321:33 - of y equals f of x
321:36 - satisfies the horizontal line test
321:40 - and finally
321:42 - the domain of f
321:45 - is the range
321:47 - of f inverse
321:49 - and the range of f
321:52 - is the domain of f inverse
321:55 - these properties of inverse functions
321:57 - will be important when we study
322:00 - exponential functions and their inverses
322:03 - logarithmic functions

Cleaned transcript:

this video is about the exponent rules rules that govern expressions like two to the fifth or x to the n two to the fifth is just shorthand for two times two times two times two times 2 written 5 times and similarly x to the n is just x multiplied by itself n times when we write these expressions the number on the bottom that's being multiplied by itself is called the base and the number at the top telling us how many times we're multiplying the base by itself is called the exponent sometimes the exponent is also called the power the product rule says that if i have x to the power of n times x to the power of m that's the same thing as x to the n plus m power in other words when i multiply two expressions with the same base then i can add their exponents for example if i have 2 cubed times 2 to the 4th that's equal to 2 to the 7th and that makes sense because 2 cubed times 2 to the 4th means i multiply 2 by itself 3 times and then i multiply that by 2 multiplied by itself 4 times and in the end i have 2 multiplied by itself 7 times which is 2 to the 7th i'm just adding up the number of times that's multiplied in each piece to get the number of times that's multiplied total the quotient rule says that if i have x to the n power divided by x to the m power that's equal to x to the n minus m power in other words if i divide two expressions with the same base then i can subtract their exponents for example 3 to the 6th divided by 3 squared is going to be 3 to the 6 minus 2 or 3 to the 4th and this makes sense because 3 to the 6 means i multiply 3 by itself 6 times and then i divide that by 3 multiplied by itself twice so when i cancel out 3s i have 4 3s left notice that i have to subtract the number of threes on the bottom from the number of threes at the top to get my number of threes remaining that's why i subtract my exponents the power rule tells us if i have x to the n power raised to the m power that's the same thing as x to the n times m power in other words when i raise a power to a power i get to multiply the exponents for example 5 to the 4th cubed is equal to 5 to the 4 times 3 or 5 to the 12th and this makes sense because 5 to the 4th cubed can be thought of as five to the fourth times five to the fourth times five to the fourth expanding this out some more that's five times five times five times five times the same thing times the same thing again so i have three groups of four fives which is a total of three times four or twelve fives the next rule involves what happens when i raise a number or a variable to the zeroth power it turns out that anything to the zeroth power is equal to one usually this is just taken as a definition but here's why it makes sense to me if you have something like 2 cubed divided by 2 cubed well certainly that has to equal 1 anything divided by itself is just one but using the quotient rule we know that this is the same thing as 2 to the 3 minus 3 because when we divide two things with the same base we get to subtract their exponents therefore this is the same thing as 2 to the 0 so 2 to the 0 has to equal 1 in order to make it work with the quotient rule and the same argument shows that anything to the zero power has to be equal to one what happens when we take something to a negative power x to the n is equal to one over x to the n again most people just take this as a definition of a negative exponent but here's why it makes sense if i take something like 5 to the 7th times 5 to the negative 7th then by the product rule this has to equal 5 to the 7 plus negative 7 which is 5 to the 0 and we just said that that is equal to 1. now i have the equation of 5 to the seventh times five to the negative seventh equals one if i divide both sides by five to the seventh i get that five to the negative seventh has to equal one over five to the seventh so that's where this rule about negative exponents comes from it has to be true in order to be consistent with the product rule finally let's look at fractional exponents what does an expression like x to the 1 over n really mean well it means the nth root of x for example 64 to the onethird power means the cube root of 64 which happens to be 4. and 9 to the onehalf means the square root of 9 which is usually written without that little superscript up there now the square root of 9 is just 3. fractional exponents also make sense for example if i have five to the one third and i cube that then by the power rule that's equal to five to the onethird times three which is just five to the one or five so in other words five to the one third is the number that when you cube it you get five and that's exactly what's meant by the cube root of five the cube root of five is also a number that when you cube it you get 5. the next rule tells us we can distribute an exponent over a product in other words if we have a product x times y all raised to the nth power that's equal to x to the n times y to the n for example 5 times 7 all raised to the third power is equal to 5 cubed times 7 cubed and this makes sense because 5 times 7 all raised to the cubed power can be expanded as 5 times 7 times 5 times 7 times 5 times 7 but if i rearrange the order of multiplication this is the same thing as five times five times five times seven times seven times seven or five cubed times seven cubed similarly we could distribute an exponent of our quotient if we have the quotient x over y all raised to the n power that's the same as x to the n over y to the n for example 2 7 raised to the fifth power is the same thing as two to the fifth over seven to the fifth this makes sense because twosevenths to the fifth can be expanded as twosevenths multiply by itself five times which can be written rewritten as two multiplied by itself five times divided by seven multiplied by itself five times and that's two to the fifth over seven to the fifth as wanted we've seen that we can distribute an exponent over multiplication and division but be careful because we cannot distribute an exponent over addition or subtraction for example a plus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n plus b to the n a minus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n minus b to the n and if you're not sure just try an example with numbers for example 2 plus 3 squared is not the same thing as 2 squared plus 3 squared and 2 minus 3 squared is definitely not equal to 2 squared minus 3 squared in this video i gave eight exponent rules which i'll list again here there's the product rule the quotient rule the power rule the zero exponent the negative exponent the fractional exponent and the the two rules involving distributing exponents across multiplication and division in another video i'll use these exponent rules to rewrite and simplify expressions involving exponents in this video i'll work out some examples of simplifying expressions using exponent rules i'll start by reviewing the exponent rules the product rule says that when you multiply two expressions with the same base you add the exponents the quotient rule says that when you divide two expressions with the same base you subtract the exponents the power rule says that when you take a power to a power you multiply the exponents the power of zero rule says that anything to the zero power is one as long as the base is not zero since zero to the zero is undefined it doesn't make sense negative exponents to evaluate x to the minus n we take the reciprocal one over x to the n to evaluate a fractional exponent like x to the one over n we take the nth root of x we can distribute an exponent over a product a times b to the n is equal to a to the n times b to the n and we can distribute an exponent over a quotient a over b to the n is a to the n over b to the n in the rest of this video we'll use these exponent rules to simplify expressions for our first example we want to simplify 3 times x to the minus 2 divided by x to the fourth there's several possible ways to proceed for example we could use the negative exponent rule to write x to the minus 2 as 1 over x squared all that gets divided by x to the fourth still notice that we only take the reciprocal of the x squared the 3 stays where it is and that's because the exponent of negative 2 only applies to the x not to the 3. now if we think of 3 as 3 over 1 we have a product of two fractions in our numerator and so we evaluate that by taking the product of the numerators times the product of the denominators which is 3 over x squared all divided by x to the fourth i can think of x to the fourth as x to the fourth over one so now i have a fraction over a fraction which i can evaluate by multiplying by the reciprocal that simplifies to three times 1 divided by x squared times x to the 4th which is 3 over x to the 6th using the product rule since x squared times x to the 4th is equal to x to the 2 plus 4 or x to the 6th an alternate way of solving this problem is to start by using the quotient rule i can rewrite this as 3 times x to the minus 2 over x to the 4th and by the quotient rule that's 3 times x to the minus 2 minus 4 or 3 times x to the minus 6. now using the negative exponent rule x to the minus six is one over x to the sixth and this product of fractions simplifies to three over x to the sixth the same answer i got before the second problem can be solved in similar ways please pause the video and try it before going on one way to simplify would be to use the negative exponent rule first and rewrite y to the minus 5 as one over y to the fifth thinking of this as a fraction divided by a fraction i can multiply by the reciprocal and get 4 y cubed y to the fifth over 1 by the product rule the numerator here is for y to the 8th and so my final answer is just 4y to the 8th alternatively i could decide to use the quotient rule first as in the previous problem i can write this as 4 y cubed minus negative 5 by the quotient rule and so that's 4 y to the 8th as before i'd like to show you one more method to solve these two problems kind of a shortcut method before we go on that shortcut relies on the principle that a negative exponent in the numerator corresponds to a positive exponent in the denominator for example the x to the negative 2 in the numerator here after some manipulations became an x to the positive 2 in the denominator furthermore a negative exponent in the denominator is equivalent to a positive exponent in the numerator that's what happened when we had the y to the negative 5 in the denominator and translated into a y to the positive 5 in the numerator sometimes people like to talk about this principle by saying that you can pass a factor across the fraction bar by switching the sign of the exponent that is making a positive exponent negative or a negative exponent positive let's see how this principle gives us a shortcut for solving these two problems in the first problem 3x to the minus 2 over x to the 4 we can move the negative exponent in the numerator and make it a positive exponent of the denominator so we get 3 over x to the 4 plus 2 or x to the 6th in the second example 4y cubed over y to the minus 5 we can change the y to the minus 5 in the denominator into a y to the 5 in the numerator and get our final answer of 4 y to the 3 plus 5 or 8. we'll use this principle again in the next problems in this example notice that i have i have y's in the numerator and in the denominator and also z's in the numerator and in the denominator in order to simplify i'm going to try to get all my y's either in the numerator or the denominator and similarly for the z's since i have more y's in the denominator let me move this y to the 3 downstairs and make it a y to the negative 3. i'm using the principle here that a positive exponent in the numerator corresponds to a negative exponent in the denominator now since i have a positive exponent on z in the numerator and a negative exponent of the denominator and i want to get rid of negative exponents i'm going to pass the z's to the numerator as e to the minus 2 in the denominator becomes a z to the plus 2 in the numerator notice that my number 7 doesn't move and when i do any of these manipulations because it doesn't have an exponent and the exponent of negative 2 for example only applies to the z not to the 7. now that i've got all my z's in the numerator and all my y's in the denominator it's easy to clean this up using the product rule and i have my simplified expression in this last example we have a complicated expression raised to a fractional power i'm going to start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses i can bring all my y's downstairs and all my x's upstairs and get rid of negative exponents at the same time in other words i can rewrite this as 25 x to the fourth i'll bring the y to the minus 5 downstairs and make it y to the fifth on the denominator bring the x to the minus 6 upstairs and make it x to the 6th the numerator and then i still have the y cubed on the denominator all that's raised to the three halves power using the product rule i can rewrite the expression on the inside of the parentheses as 25x to the tenth over y to the eighth recall that we're allowed to distribute an exponent across a product or across a quotient when i distribute my threehalves power i get 25 to the threehalves times x to the tenth to the threehalves divided by y to the eighth to the threehalves the power rule tells me when i have a power to a power i get to multiply the exponents so i can rewrite this as 25 to the three halves times x to the 10 times three halves over y to the eighth times three halves in other words twenty five to the three halves times x to the fifteenth over y to the twelfth finally i need to rewrite twenty five to the three halves since three halves can be thought of as three times onehalf or as onehalf times three i can write 25 to the threehalves as 25 to the 3 times onehalf or as 25 to the onehalf times three well using the power rule in reverse i can think of this as 25 cubed to the onehalf or as 25 to the onehalf cubed since when i take a power to a power i multiply the exponents 25 cubed to the onehalf might be hard to evaluate since 25 cubed is a huge number but 25 to the onehalf is just the square root of 25 so i have the square root of 25 cubed or 5 cubed which is 125. therefore my original expression is going to be 125 x to the 15 over y to the 12th in this video we use the exponent rules to simplify complicated expressions this video goes through a few tricks for simplifying expressions with radicals in them recall that this notation means the nth root of x so this notation here means the cube root of eight the number that when you cube it you get eight that number would be two when we write the root sign without a little number that just means the square root so the two is implied in this case the square root of 25 is 5 since 5 squared is 25. let's start by reviewing some rules for radical expressions first if we have the radical of a product we can rewrite that as the product of two radicals for example the square root of 9 times 16 is the same thing as the square root of 9 times the square root of 16. you can check that both of these evaluate to 12. similarly it's possible to distribute a radical sign across division the radical of a divided by b is the same thing as the radical of a divided by the radical of b for example the cube root of 64 over eight is the same thing as the cube root of 64 over the cube root of 8 and you can check that both of these evaluate to 2. you have to be a little bit careful though because it's not ok to distribute a radical sign across addition in general the nth root of a plus b is not equal to the nth root of a plus the nth root of b and similarly it's not okay to distribute a radical across subtraction if you're ever in doubt you can always check with simple examples for example the square root of 1 plus 1 is not the same thing as a square root of one plus a squared of one the right side evaluates to one plus one or two and the left side is square root of two and the irrational number the second expression to show that that fails i don't think it will work to use the square root of one minus one it'll actually hold in that case but i can show it's false by using say the square root of two minus one which does not equal the square root of two minus the square root of one you might notice that these rules for radicals the ones that hold and the ones that don't hold remind you of rules for exponents and that's no coincidence because radicals can be written in terms of exponents for example if we look at the first rule we could rewrite this the nth root of a times b is the same thing as the one over nth power and by exponent rules i can distribute an exponent across multiplication and so this radical rule can be restated completely in terms of an exponent rule similarly the second rule can be restated in terms of exponents as a over b to the one over n is equal to a to the one over n divided by b to the one over n we can use the relationship between radicals and exponents to rewrite a to the m over n a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m with the nth root taken it's also the same thing as the nth root of a all taken to the nth power to see why that's true think about exponent rules so a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m taken to the one over nth power that's because when we take a power to a power we multiply exponents and m times one over n is equal to m over n but a one over nth power is the same thing as an nth root and therefore this expression is the same thing as this expression and that proves the first equivalence the second equivalence can be proved similarly by writing a to the m over n as a to the 1 over n times m again this is works because when i take the power to the power i multiply exponents 1 over n times m is the same thing as m over n but now these two expressions are the same because the one over nth power is the same as the nth root one mnemonic for remembering these relationships is flower over root so flower is like power and root is like root so that tells us we can write a fractional exponent the m becomes the power and the n becomes the root in either of these two orders now let's use these rules and some examples if we want to compute 25 to the negative threehalves power well first i'll use my exponent rule to rewrite that negative exponent as 1 over 25 to the 3 half's power next i'll use the power over root mnemonic to rewrite this as 25 to the third power square rooted or as 25 square rooted to the third power i wrote the twos there for the square root for emphasis but most of the time people will omit this and just write the square root without a little number there now i could use either of these two equivalent expressions to continue but i'd rather use this one because it's easier to compute without a calculator the square root of 25 is just 5. five cubed is a hundred twentyfive so my answer is one over a hundred twentyfive if i tried to compute the cube of twentyfive first i'd get a huge number in general it's usually easier to compute the root before the power when you're working without a calculator now let's do an example simplifying a more complicated expression with with exponents in it i'm going to take the square root of all this stuff and since i don't really like negative exponents i'm first going to rewrite this as the square root of 60x squared y to the sixth over z to the 11th so i'll i'll change that negative exponent to a positive exponent by moving this this factor to the denominator now when you're asked to simplify a radical expression that generally means to pull as much as possible out of the radical sign to pull things out of the square root sign i'm going to factor my numbers and try to rewrite everything in terms of squares as much as possible since the square root of a square those two operations undo each other so i'll show you what i mean first i'll factor 60 so 60 is going to be 2 squared times 3 times 5 and i'll just copy everything over for now now i'll break things up into squares as much as possible so i've got a 2 squared times 3 times 5. i've already got an x squared i'll write the y to the 6 as y squared times y squared times y squared and i'll write the z to the 11th as z squared times z squared i guess 5 times 1 2 3 4 5 times 1 extra z that should add up to z to the 11th if i add all those exponents together now i know that i can distribute my radical sign across multiplication and division so i'll write this with a zillion different radicals here and every time i see the square root of something squared i can just cancel those square roots and the squares out and get what's what's left here so so after doing that cancellation i get 2 times the square root of 3 times 5 times x times y times y times y over z times itself i guess 5 times times the square root of z and now i can clean that up with exponents i'll write that as the square root of 15 i guess 2 times the square root of 15 times x times y cubed over z to the fifth the square root of z i'm going to leave this example as is but sometimes people prefer to rewrite radical expressions without radical signs in the denominator that's called rationalizing the denominator i won't do it here but i'll show you how to do it in the next example this example asks us to rationalize the denominator that means to rewrite as an equivalent expression without radical signs in the denominator to get rid of the radical sign in the denominator i want to multiply my denominator by square root of x but i can't just multiply the denominator willynilly by something unless i multiply the numerator by the same thing so that i'm just multiplying my expression by 1 in a fancy form and i don't change the value of my expression now if i just multiply together numerators 3x squared of x and multiply denominators square root of x times square root of x is the square root of x squared square root of x squared is just x now i can cancel my x's from the numerator and denominator and my final answer is 3 times the square root of x i rationalized my denominator and the process got a nicer looking expression in this video we went over the rules for radicals and we simplified some radical expressions by working with fractional exponents pulling things out of the radical sign and rationalizing the denominator hi class happy snow day since class is cancelled i'm putting together this video with some additional examples on simplifying radicals that i would have done in class i hope this will help you complete your assignment that's due tonight let's start with this example asking us to simplify the product of two radicals i could simplify each radical separately and then multiply things together but i think it'll save me trouble if i multiply first and then simplify so i'm going to multiply these together since the product of two radicals is the radical of the product assuming everything's positive i can rewrite my expression as the square root of let's see 5 times 15 that's going to be 75 x times x cubed that's x to the fourth because when i multiply two expressions i add the exponents and y to the seventh times y cubed that's going to be y to the tenth since 7 plus 3 is 10. now i want to simplify by pulling as much out of the square root sign as i can if 75 were a perfect square i could just take the square root of it but since it's not i'm going to factor it so 75 let's see that's 25 times 3 and 25 is 5 times 5 so i can write that as 5 squared times 3. now i can write my square root let's see so that's 5 squared times 3 times x to the 4th times y to the 10th now since i know that the square root of anything squared is just that original thing assuming variables are positive uh i can maybe rewrite this as by breaking everything up into a bunch of squares so let's see i already have a square here there's no hope for the 3. the x to the 4th i can write that as x squared times x squared right that makes four x's and y to the tenth i'm going to need five y squareds to get 10 y's out of that one two three y squared y squared now splitting up the square root back into a product of a bunch of square roots every time i see the square root of something squared i just replace it with the thing so that's five i still have the square root of three that gives me x x y y y y y and i can rewrite that as 5 square root of 3 times x squared y to the 5th so that's one way to simplify this expression alternatively i could complete this problem a little bit faster the following way i could go ahead and break up my 5 squared times 3 times x to the fourth times y to the 10th i'm going to break that up go ahead and break that out as a product of square roots now the square root of 5 squared is certainly 5 square root of 3 stays the same square root of x to the fourth is going to be x squared there are a couple ways to see that one way is the square root of x fourth that's x to the fourth to the one half power since square roots are the same as half powers and now i can multiply my exponents to get my x squared or alternatively i can think of that because the square root of x to the fourth that's the square root of x squared squared since i take a power to a power i multiply my exponents square root of something squared is just the thing so that's x squared similarly the square root of y to the tenth that's going to be y to the fifth notice i'm just taking half of the exponent and you can see that the same way that's because if i do the square root of y to the tenth that's the same thing as y to the tenth to the onehalf which is y to the 10 times onehalf or y to the fifth or alternatively you can think of this as the square root of y to the tenth is the square root of y to the fifth squared which is y to the fifth so if it weren't for all that little side work i did that would have this would have been a faster way to get to the same answer as before the next few examples have to do with rewriting expressions by rationalizing denominators please pause the video for a moment and see if you can decide if these two expressions represent the same thing or different things in fact they represent the same thing and we can see that that we can transform a to look like b by doing something called rationalizing the denominator trying to get all the square roots out of the denominator at the expense of maybe putting some more squares in the numerator so to rationalize the denominator in this case since there's just that one that one piece with square roots in it i'm going to multiply both the top and the bottom by the square root of y the thing that has the square root around it if i multiply the bottom by the square root of y i have to multiply the top also so i won't change the value of my expression this way i'm just multiplying by 1 in a fancy form now when i multiply fractions i multiply the numerator and i multiply the denominator well let's see the square root of y times the square root of y that's the square root of y squared which is the same thing as just y so i can bring my square roots together and get 3 square root of xy over 5y which is exactly the second expression here are two even crazier expressions the last one is especially crazy again try to decide if these two represent the same thing or represent a different thing kind of surprisingly they actually represent the same thing still and we can transform one to two by again rationalizing the denominator this time we're going to use something called the conjugate and that's because we have a difference in this case of two expressions one of which has a square root in it so when i have the difference of two expressions one of which with a square root in it i find the conjugate by taking the sum of those two expressions if instead i had had the sum of two expressions then the conjugate would be the difference okay so i'm going to multiply the top and the bottom by this conjugate of of the denominator so let me move down here and rewrite with more space once again i have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same thing so that i'm not changing the value of my expression i'm just multiplying by 1 in a fancy form now let's look at what happens in the denominator first i have to multiply 3 by 3 3 by the square root of a negative square root of a by 3 and negative square root of a by square root of a so that's going to give me 3 times 3 is 9 plus 3 squared of a minus 3 squared of a minus square root of a squared so in a moment that i'll simplify to these things cancel so that'll be 9 minus square root of a squared is a notice how i've gotten rid of the square roots of the denominator which is why it's called rationalizing the denominator we get rid of the the i don't know the irrational numbers um the radical signs okay let's look at the numerator so again we have to we're going to have four terms this times this this times that b times 3 b times square root of a that gives us 15 a plus 5 a squared of a plus 3b plus b squared of a now that's starting to look similar to this expression here and in fact it we can see that it's exactly the same thing by turning our radicals into exponents so let's see we still have the 15a uh this is the same thing as 5a times a to the onehalf we've still got the 3b and we've got b times a to the onehalf and now let's see a times a to the onehalf here that's really i can add my exponents so that's going to be 5 a to the 1 plus onehalf is threehalves three b b a to the onehalf and that's exactly what i have in this expression just in a slightly different order so these really are the same kind of weird please pause the video and try your hand at rationalizing the denominator of this expression since we have a sum of two expressions in the denominator we want to multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator so that's square root of a minus 1. now when i multiply out the numerator we'll get four terms square root of a squared let's see minus the square root of a and now we have 7 times the square root of a and finally 7 times minus 1 that's minus 7. on the denominator we get the square root of a squared minus the square root of a plus the square root of a minus 1. notice how the square root things cancel just like before that's the whole magic of using the conjugate it makes those square roots cancel out so now on the numerator square root of a squared is a minus the square root of a plus seven squared of a that's a net of six squared of a's minus seven and then on the denominator we have a minus 1. we've gotten rid of the square roots on the denominator rationalize the denominator i'm happy leaving the square root in the numerator but if you want to you can change it to an exponent instead it's really up to you that's all the examples i have today i hope you enjoy the snow which hasn't started yet for me and um please do spend some time to finish your alex objective if you haven't done it already goodbye this video goes over some common methods of factoring recall that factoring an expression means to write it as a product so we could factor the number 30 by writing it as 6 times 5 or we could factor it more completely by writing it as 2 times three times five as another example we could factor the expression x squared plus five x plus six by writing it as x plus two times x plus 3. in this video i'll go over how i get from here to here how i know how to do the factoring but for right now i just want to review how i can go backwards how i can check that the factoring is correct and that's just by multiplying out or distributing if i distribute x plus 2 times x plus 3 then i multiply x by x that gives me x squared x times 3 gives me 3x 2 times x gives me 2x and 2 times 3 gives me 6. so that simplifies to x squared plus 5x plus 6 which checks out with what i started with so you can think of factoring as the opposite of distributing out and you can always check your factoring by distributing or multiplying out a bit of terminology when i think of an expression as a sum of a bunch of things then the things i sum up are called the terms but if i think of the same expression as a product of things then the things that i multiply together are called factors now let's get started on techniques of factoring when i have to factor something i always like to start by pulling out the greatest common factor the greatest common factor means the largest thing that divides each of the terms in this first example the largest thing that divides both 15 and 25x is 5. so the gcf is 5. so i pull the 5 out and then i divide each of the terms by that number and so i get 3 plus 5x pause the video for a moment and see if you can find the greatest common factor of x squared y and y squared x cubed the biggest thing that divides both x squared y and y squared x cubed is going to be x squared times y one way to find this is to look for the power of x that's smallest in each of these terms so that's x squared and the power of y that's smallest in each of these terms is just y to the 1 or y now if i factor out the x squared y from each of the terms that's like dividing each term by x squared y if i divide the first term by x squared y i just get 1. if i divide the second term by x squared y i'm going to be left with an x and a y i'll write this out on the side just to make it more clear y squared x cubed over x squared y that's like two y's on the and three x's on the top and two x's and a y on the bottom so i'm left with just an x and a y so i'll write the x y here and i factored my expression as always i can check my answer by multiplying out so if i multiply out my factored expression i get x squared y as the first term and the second term i get x they're now let's see three x's multiplied together and two y's multiplied together and that checks out with what i started with the next technique of factoring i'd like to go over is factoring by grouping in this example notice that we have four terms factoring by grouping is a handy method to look at if you have four terms in your expression you need to factor in order to factor by grouping i'm first going to factor out the greatest common factor of the first two terms and then separately factor out the greatest common factor of the last two terms the greatest common factor of x cubed and 3x squared is x squared so i factor out the x squared and i get x plus 3 and now the greatest common factor of 4x and 12 is just 4 so i factor out the 4 from those two terms notice that the factor of x plus 3 now appears in both pieces so i can factor out the greatest common factor of x plus 3 i think i'll factor it out on the left side instead of the right and now i have an x squared from this first piece and i have a 4 from this second piece and that completes my factoring by grouping you might wonder if we could factor further by factoring the expression x squared plus 4. but in fact as we'll see later this expression which is a sum of two squares x squared plus two squared does not factor any further over the integers next we'll do some factoring of quadratics a quadratic is an expression with a squared term just a term with x in it and a constant term with no x's in it i'd like to factor this expression as a product of x plus or minus some number times x plus or minus some other number the key idea is that if i can find those two numbers then if i were to distribute out this expression those two numbers would have to multiply to give me my constant term of 8 and these two numbers would end up having to add to give me my negative 6 because when i multiply out this number will be a coefficient of x and this number will be also another coefficient of x they'll add together to the negative 6. so if i look at all the pairs of numbers that multiply together to give me 8 so that could be one and eight two and four four and two but that's really the same things i had before and that's sort of the same thing i had before i i shouldn't forget the negatives i could have negative one negative eight or i could have negative 2 negative 4 those also multiply together to give me 8. now i just have to find see if there's a a pair of these numbers that add to negative 6 and it's not hard to see that these ones will work so now i can write out my factoring as that would be x minus 2 times x minus 4. and it's always a good idea to check by multiplying out i'm going to get x squared minus 4x minus 2x plus 8 and that works out to just what i want now this second example's a bit more complicated because now my leading coefficient my coefficient of x squared is not just one it's it's the number 10. now there are lots of different methods for approaching a problem like this and i'm just going to show you one method my favorite method that uses factoring by grouping but but to start out i'm going to multiply my coefficient of x squared by my constant term so i'm multiplying 10 by negative 6. that gives me negative 60. and i'll also take my coefficient of x the number 11 and write that down here now i'm going to look for two numbers that multiply to give me negative 60 and add to give me 11. you might notice that this is exactly what we were doing in the previous problem it's just here we didn't have to multiply the coefficient of x squared by 8 because the coefficient of x squared was just 1. so to find the two numbers that multiply to negative 60 and add to 11 you might just be able to come up with them in your head thinking about it but if not you can figure it out pretty systematically by writing out all the factors pairs of factors that multiply to negative 60. so i can start with negative 1 and 60 negative 2 and 30 negative 3 and 20 and keep going like this until i have found factors that actually add together to give me the number 11 and and now that i look at it i've already found them 5 15 minus 4 gives me 11. so i don't have to continue with my chart of factors now once i've found those factors i write out my expression 10x squared but instead of writing 11x i write negative 4x plus 15x now i copy down the negative 6. notice that negative 4x plus 15x equals 11x that's how i chose those numbers and so this expression is evaluates is the same as as this expression i haven't changed my expression but i have turned it into something that i can apply factoring by grouping on look i've got four terms here and so if i factor out my greatest common factor of my first two terms that's let's see i think it's 2x so i factor out the 2x i get 5x minus 2 and then i factor out the greatest common factor of 15x and negative 6. that would be 3 and i get a 5x minus 2 again this is working beautifully so i have a 5x minus 2 in each part and so i put the 5x minus 2 on the right and i put what's left from these terms in here so that's 2x plus 3 and i have factored my expression there are a couple special kinds of expressions that appear frequently that it's handy to just memorize the formula for so the first one is the difference of squares if you see something of the form a squared minus b squared then you can factor that as a plus b times a minus b and let's just check that that works if i do a plus b times a minus b and multiply that out i get a squared minus a b plus b a minus b squared and those middle two terms cancel out so it gives me back the difference of squares just like i want it so for this first example i if i think of x squared minus 16 as x squared minus four squared then i can see that's a difference of squares and i can immediately write it as x plus 4 times x minus 4. and the second example 9p squared minus 1 that's the same thing as 3p squared minus 1 squared so that's 3p plus 1 times 3p minus 1. notice that if i have a sum of squares for example x squared plus 4 which is x squared plus 2 squared then that does not factor the difference of squares formula doesn't apply and there is no formula that applies for a sum of squares there is however a formula for both a difference of cubes and a sum of cubes the difference of cubes formula a cubed minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b squared the formula for the sum of cubes is pretty much the same you just switch the negative and positive sign here and here so that gives us a plus b times a squared minus a b plus b squared as usual you can check these formulas by multiplying out let's look at one example of using these formulas y cubed plus 27 is actually a sum of two cubes because it's y cubed plus three cubed so i can factor it using the sum of cubes formula by plugging in y for a and three for b that gives me y plus 3 times y squared minus y times 3 plus 3 squared and i can clean that up a little bit to read y plus 3 times y squared minus 3y plus 9. so in this video we went over several methods of factoring we did factoring out the greatest common factor we did factoring by grouping we did factoring quadratics and we did a difference of squares and we did a difference and a sum of cubes in more complicated problems you may need to apply several of these techniques in order to get through a single problem for example you might need to start by pulling out a greatest common factor and then do a factoring of quadratics or something similar now go forth and factor this video gives some additional examples of factoring please pause the video and decide which of these first five expressions factor and which one does not the first expression can be factored by pulling out a common factor of x from each term so that becomes x times x plus one the second example can be factored as a difference of two squares since x squared minus 25 is something squared minus something else squared and we know that anytime we have something like a squared minus b squared that's a plus b times a minus b so we can factor this as x plus five times x minus five the third one is a sum of two squares there's no way to factor a sum of two squares over real numbers so this is the one that does not factor just for completeness let's look at the next two this next one does factor by grouping when we factor by grouping we pull a the biggest common factor out of the first two terms that would be an x squared that becomes x squared times x plus two and then we factor as much as we can out of the next two terms that would be a 3 times x plus 2. notice that the x plus 2 factor now occurs in both of the resulting terms so we can pull that x plus 2 out and get x plus 2 times x squared plus 3. we can't factor any further because x squared plus 3 doesn't factor finally we have a quadratic this also factors and i like to factor these also using a factoring by grouping trick so first what i do is i multiply the coefficient of x squared and the constant term 5 times 8 is 40. i'll write that on the top of my x now i take the coefficient of the x term that's negative 14 and i write that on the bottom part of the x now i'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 40 and add to negative 14. sometimes i can just guess numbers like this but if not i start writing out factors of 40. so factors of 40 i could do 1 times 40. well now i just noticed i'm trying to add to a negative number so if i use two positive factors there's no way this is going to add to a negative number it's better for me to use negative numbers that factor 40. a negative times a negative still multiplies to 40 but they have a chance of adding to a negative number so but negative 1 and negative 40 of course don't work they don't add to negative 14 they add to negative 41. so let me try some other factors the next biggest number that divides 40 besides 1 is 2 so i'll try negative 2 and negative 20. those add to negative 22. that doesn't work next one that divides 40 would be 4 so i'll try negative 4 and negative 10. we have a winner so negative 4 plus negative 10 is negative 14 negative 4 times negative 10 is positive 40. we've got it all right so the next step is to use factoring by grouping we're going to first split up this negative 14x as negative 4x minus 10x and carry down the 8 and the 5x squared notice that this works because i picked negative 4 and negative 10 to add up to negative 14. so so negative 4x minus 10x will add up to negative 14x so i've got the same expression just just expand it out a little bit now i have four terms i can do factoring by grouping so i can group the first two terms and factor out the biggest thing i can that would be an x times five x minus four and now i'll factor the biggest thing i can out of these two numbers including the the negative so that becomes let's see i can factor out a negative 2 and that becomes 5 x minus 4 since negative 2 times minus 4 is 8. all right i've got the same 5x plus 4 in both my terms so factoring by grouping is going swimmingly i can factor out the 5x minus 4 from both those terms and i get the x minus 2. and i've factored this quadratic if i want to of course i can always check my work by distributing out by multiplying out so a check here would be multiplying 5x times x is 5x squared 5x minus times minus 2 is minus 10x minus 4 times x is minus 4x and minus 4 times 2 is plus 8. so let's see this does check out to exactly what it should be so that was the method of factoring a quadratic and all of these factor except for the sum of squares so we saw that factoring by grouping is handy for factoring this expression here it was also handy for factoring the quadratic indirectly after splitting up the middle term into two terms so how can you tell when a an expression is is appropriate to factor by grouping there's a there's an easy way to to tell that it might be a candidate and that's that it has four terms so if you see four terms or in the case of quadratic you can split it up into four terms then that's a good candidate for factoring by grouping because you can group the first two terms group the second two terms factoring by grouping all won't always work on on expressions with four terms but but that's like the first thing to look for so let's just review what are the same main techniques of factoring we saw these on the previous page we saw there was pull out common factors there's difference of squares there's factoring by grouping there's factoring quadratics and one more that i didn't mention is factoring sums and differences of cubes that uses the formulas a cubed minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b squared and a cubed plus b cubed is a plus b times a squared minus a b plus b squared one important tip when factoring i always recommend doing this first pull out the common factors first that'll simplify things in making the rest of factoring easier one more tip is that you might need to do several of these factoring techniques in one problem for example you might have to first pull out a common factor then factor a difference of squares and then you might notice that one of your factors is itself a difference of squares and you have to apply a difference of squares again so don't stop when you factor a little bit keep factoring as far as you can go here are some extra examples of factoring quadratics for you to practice please pause the video and give these a try for the first one let's multiply 2 times negative 14 that gives us negative 28 and then we'll bring the 3 down in the bottom of the x now we're looking for two numbers that multiply to negative 28 and add to 3. well to multiply two numbers to get a negative 28 we'll need one of them to be negative and one of them to be positive so let's see 1 negative 1 28 or 1 negative 28 those don't work let's see negative 2 14 or 2 negative 14. those don't work hey i just noticed the positive number had better be bigger than the negative number so that they add to a positive number let's see what comes next how about negative 4 times 7 4 times negative 7 i think 4 negative 4 times 7 will work so i'll write those here negative 4 7. i'll copy down the 2 z squared and i'll split up the 3z into negative 4z plus 7z and then minus 14. now factoring by grouping pull out a 2z that becomes z minus 2 pull out a 7 and that becomes z minus 2 again looking good i've got 2 z plus 7 times z minus 2 as my factored expression my second expression i could work it the same way drawing my x and factoring by grouping that kind of thing but it's actually going to be easier if i notice first that i can pull out a common factor from all of my terms that'll make things a lot simpler to deal with so notice that a 5 divides each of these terms in fact i'm going to go ahead and pull out the negative 5 because i don't like having negatives in front of my squared terms so i'm going to pull out a common factor of negative 5. again it would work if i forgot to do this but it would be a lot more complicated so negative 5 v squared this becomes minus now this becomes plus 9v since 9 times negative 5 is negative 45 and this becomes minus 10 since negative 10 times negative 5 is positive 50. now i can start my x and my factoring by grouping or i can use kind of a shortcut method which you may have seen before so i can just put v's here and then i know that whatever numbers go here they're going to have to multiply to the negative 10 and they're gonna have to add to the nine so that would be a plus 10 and a minus one will do the trick those are all my factoring examples for today i hope you enjoy your snow morning and have a chance to spend some time working in alex bye this video is about working with rational expressions a rational expression is a fraction usually with variables in it something like x plus 2 over x squared minus 3 is a rational expression in this video we'll practice adding subtracting multiplying and dividing rational expressions and simplifying them to lowest terms we'll start with simplifying to lowest terms recall that if you have a fraction with just numbers in it something like 21 over 45 we can reduce it to lowest terms by factoring the numerator and factoring the denominator and then canceling common factors so in this example the threes can't solve and our fraction reduces to 7 over 15. if we want to reduce a rational expression with variables in it to lowest terms we proceed the same way first we'll factor the numerator that's 3 times x plus 2 and then factor the denominator in this case it factors to x plus 2 times x plus 2 we could also write that as x plus 2 squared now we cancel the common factors and we're left with 3 over x plus 2. definitely a simpler way of writing that rational expression next let's practice multiplying and dividing recall that if we multiply two fractions with just numbers in them we simply multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators so in this case we would get 4 times 2 over 3 times 5 or 8 15. if we want to divide two fractions like in the second example then we can rewrite it as multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction on the denominator so here we get fourfifths times threehalves and that gives us twelve tenths but actually we could reduce that fraction to sixfifths we use the same rules when we compute the product or quotient of two rational expressions with variables in them here we're trying to divide two rational expressions so instead we can multiply by the reciprocal i call this flipping and multiplying and now we just multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators it might be tempting at this point to multiply out to distribute out the numerator and the denominator but actually it's better to leave it in this factored form and factor it even more completely that way we'll be able to reduce the rational expression to cancel the common factors so let's factor it even more the x squared plus x factors as x times x plus one and x squared minus 16 that's a difference of two squares that's x plus 4 times x minus 4. the denominator is already fully factored so we'll just copy it over and now we can cancel common factors here and here and we're left with x times x minus 4. this is our final answer adding and subtracting fractions is a little more complicated because we first have to find a common denominator a common denominator is an expression that both denominators divide into it's usually best in the long run to use the least common denominator which is the smallest expression that both denominators divide into in this example if we just want a common denominator we could use 6 times 15 which is 90 because both 6 and 15 divide evenly into 90. but if we want the least common denominator the best way to do that is to factor the two denominators so 6 is 2 times 3 15 is 3 times 5 and then put together only the factors we need for both 6 and 15 to divide our number so if we just use 2 times 3 times 5 which is 30 we know that 2 times 3 will divide it and 3 times 5 will also divide it and we won't be able to get a denominator any smaller because we need the factors 2 3 and 5 in order to ensure both these numbers divide it once we have our least common denominator we can rewrite each of our fractions in terms of that denominator so 7 6 i need to get a 30 in the denominator so i'm going to multiply that by 5 over 5. i multiply by the factors that are missing from the current denominator in order to get my least common denominator of 30. for the second fraction 4 15 15 times 2 is 30 so i'm going to multiply by 2 over 2. now i can rewrite this as 35 30 minus 8 30 and now that i have a common denominator i can just subtract my two numerators and i get 27 thirtieths if i factor i can reduce this to three squared over two times five which is nine tenths the process for finding the sum of two rational expressions with variables in them follows the exact same process first we have to find the least common denominator i'll do that by factoring the two denominators so 2x plus 2 factors as 2 times x plus 1 x squared minus 1 that's a difference of 2 squared so that's x plus 1 times x minus 1. now for the least common denominator i'm going to take all the factors i need to get an expression that each of these divides into so i need the factor 2 i need the factor x plus 1 and i need the factor x minus 1. i don't have to repeat the factor x plus 1. i just need to have it one time and so i will get my least common denominator 2 times x plus 1 times x minus 1. i'm not going to bother multiplying this out it's actually better to leave it in factored form to help me simplify later now i can rewrite each of my two rational expressions by multiplying by whatever's missing from the denominator in terms of the least common denominator so what i mean is i can rewrite 3 over 2x plus 2. i'll write the 2x plus 2 as 2 times x plus 1 i'll write it in factored form and then i notice that compared to the least common denominator i'm missing the factor of x minus 1. so i multiply the numerator and the denominator by x minus 1. i just need it in the denominator but i can't get away with just multiplying by the denominator without changing my expression i have to multiply by it on the numerator and the denominator so i'm just multiplying by 1 in a fancy form and not changing the value here so now i do the same thing for the second rational expression i'll i'll write the denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what's missing from the denominator what's missing in this denominator compared to my least common denominator is just the factor 2. so i'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2. now i can rewrite everything so the first rational expression becomes 3 times x minus 1 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 and the second one becomes 5 times 2 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. notice that i now have a common denominator so i can just add together my numerators so i get 3 times x minus 1 plus 10 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. i'd like to simplify this and the best way to do that is to leave the denominator in factored form but i do have to multiply out the numerator so that i can add things together so i get 3x minus 3 plus 10 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 or 3x plus 7 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. now 3x plus 7 doesn't factor and there's therefore no factors that i can cancel out so this is already reduced as much as it can be this is my final answer in this video we saw how to simplify rational expressions to lowest terms by factoring and canceling common factors we also saw how to multiply rational expressions by multiplying the numerator and multiplying the denominator how to divide rational expressions by flipping and multiplying and how to add and subtract rational expressions by writing them in terms of the least common denominator this video is about solving quadratic equations a quadratic equation is an equation that contains the square of the variable say x squared but no higher powers of x the standard form for our quadratic equation is the form a x squared plus b x plus c equals 0 where a b and c represent real numbers and a is not zero so that we actually have an x squared term let me give you an example three x squared plus seven x minus two equals 0 is a quadratic equation in standard form here a is 3 b is 7 and c is minus 2. the equation 3x squared equals minus 7x plus 2 is also a quadratic equation it's just not in standard form the key steps to solving quadratic equations are usually to write the equation in standard form and then either factor it or use the quadratic formula which i'll show you later in this video let's start with the example y squared equals 18 minus 7y here our variable is y and we need to rewrite this quadratic equation in standard form we can do this by subtracting 18 from both sides and adding 7y to both sides that gives us the equation y squared minus eighteen plus seven y equals zero and i can rearrange a little bit to get y squared plus seven y minus eighteen equals zero now i've got my equation in standard form next i'm going to try to factor it so i need to look for two numbers that multiply to negative 18 and add to seven two numbers that work are nine and negative two so i can factor my expression on the left as y plus nine times y minus two equals zero now anytime you have two quantities that multiply together to give you zero either the first quantity has to be zero or the second quantity has to be zero or i suppose they both could be zero in some situations this is really handy because that means that i know that either y plus nine equals zero or y minus two equals zero so i can as my next step set my factors equal to 0. so y plus 9 equals 0 or y minus 2 equals 0 which means that y equals negative 9 or y equals 2. it's not a bad idea to check that those answers actually work by plugging them into the original equation negative 9 squared does that equal 18 minus 7 times negative 9 and you can work out that it does and similarly 2 squared equals 18 minus 7 times 2. in the next example let's find solutions of the equation w squared equals 121. this is a quadratic equation because it's got a square of my variable w i can rewrite it in standard form by subtracting 121 from both sides notice that a is equal to 1 b is equal to zero because there's no w term and c is equal to negative 121 in the standard form a w squared plus b w plus c equals zero next step i'm going to try to factor this expression so since 121 is 11 squared this is a difference of two squares and it factors as w plus 11 times w minus 11 is equal to zero if i set the factors equal to zero i get w plus 11 equals zero or w minus 11 equals zero so w equals minus 11 or w equals 11. in this example i could have solved the equation more simply i could have instead said that if w squared is 121 then w has to equal plus or minus the square root of 121 in other words w is plus or minus 11. if you solve the equation this way it's important to remember the plus or minus since minus 11 squared equals 121 just like 11 squared does now let's find the solutions for the equation x times x plus 2 equals 7. some people might be tempted to say that oh if two numbers multiply to equal seven then one of them better equal one and the other equals seven or maybe negative 1 and negative 7 but that's faulty reasoning in this case because x and x plus 2 don't have to be whole numbers they could be crazy fractions or even irrational numbers so instead let's rewrite this equation in standard form to do that i'm first going to multiply out so x times x is x squared x times 2 is 2x that equals 7 and i'll subtract the 7 from both sides to get x squared plus 2x minus 7 is 0. now i'm looking to factor it so i need two numbers that multiply to negative 7 and add to 2. since the only way to factor negative 7 is as negative 1 times 7 or 7 times negative 1 it's easy to see that there are no whole numbers that will will work so there's no way to factor this expression over the integers instead let's use the quadratic equation so we have our leading coefficient of x squared is one so a is one b is two and c is minus seven and we're going to plug that into the equation quadratic equation which goes x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a different people have different ways of remembering this formula i'd like to remember it by singing it x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a but you can use any mnemonic you like anyway plugging in here we have x equals negative 2 plus or minus the square root of 2 squared minus 4 times 1 times negative 7. it's important to remember the negative 7 there all over 2 times 1. now 2 squared is 4 and 4 times 1 times negative 7 is negative 28 so this whole quantity under the square root sign becomes 4 minus negative 28 or 32. so i can rewrite this as x equals negative 2 plus or minus the square root of 32 all over 2. since 32 is 16 times 2 and 16 is a perfect square i can rewrite this as negative 2 plus or minus the square root of 16 times the square root of 2 over 2 which is negative 2 plus or minus 4 times the square root of 2 over 2. next i'm going to split up my fraction as negative 2 over 2 plus or minus 4 square root of 2 over 2 and then simplify those fractions this becomes negative 1 plus or minus 2 square root of 2. so my answers are negative 1 plus 2 square root of 2 and negative 1 minus 2 square root of 2. and if i need a decimal answer for any reason i could work those out on my calculator as our final example let's find all real solutions for the equation one half y squared equals one third y minus two i'll start as usual by putting it in standard form so that gives me one half y squared minus one third y plus two equals zero i could go ahead and start trying to factor or use the quadratic formula right now but i find fractional coefficients kind of annoying so i'd like to get rid of them by doing what i call clearing the denominator that means i'm going to multiply the whole entire equation by the least common denominator in this case the least common denominator is 2 times 3 or 6. so i'll multiply the whole equation by 6. i have to make sure i multiplied both sides of the equation but in this case 6 times 0 is just 0. and when i distribute the 6 i get 3y squared minus 2y plus 12 equals 0. now i could try to factor this but i think it's easier probably just to plunge in and use the quadratic formula so i get x equals negative b that's negative negative 2 or 2 plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4 times a times c all over 2 a working out the stuff on the square root sign negative 2 squared is 4 and here we have let's see 144 so this simplifies to x equals 2 plus or minus the square root of 4 minus 144 that's negative 140 all over six well if you're concerned about the negative number under the square root sign you should be we can't take the square root of a negative number and get an and get a real number as our answer there's no real number whose square is a negative number and therefore our conclusion is we have no real solutions to this quadratic equation in this video we solved some quadratic equations by first writing them in standard form and then either factoring or using the quadratic formula in some examples factoring doesn't work it's not possible to factor the equation but in fact using the quadratic formula will always work even if it's also possible to solve it by factoring so you can't really lose by using the quadratic formula it's just sometimes it'll be faster to factor instead this video is about solving equations with absolute values in them recall that the absolute value of a positive number is just the number but the absolute value of a negative number is its opposite in general i think of the absolute value of a number as representing its distance from 0 on the number line the number 4 and the number negative 4 are both at distance 4 from 0 and so the absolute value of both of them is 4. similarly if i write the equation the absolute value of x is 3 that means that x has to be 3 units away from zero on the number line and so x would have to be either negative three or three let's start with the equation three times the absolute value of x plus two equals four i'd like to isolate the absolute value part of the equation i can do this by starting with my original equation subtracting 2 from both sides and dividing both sides by 3. now i'll think in terms of distance on a number line the absolute value of x is twothirds means that x is twothirds away from zero so x could be here or here at negative twothirds or at twothirds and the answer to my equation is x is negative twothirds or twothirds i can check my answers by plugging in three times the absolute value of negative twothirds plus two i need to check if that equals four well the absolute value of negative twothirds is just twothirds so this is three times twothirds plus two which works out to four similarly if i plug in positive twothirds it also works out to give me a correct answer this second example is a little different because the absolute value sign is around a more complicated expression not just around the x i would start by isolating the absolute value part but it's already isolated so i'll just go ahead and jump to thinking about distance on the number line so on my number line the whole expression 3x plus 2 is supposed to be at a distance of 4 from 0. so that means that three x plus two is here at four or three x plus two is at negative four i'll write those as equations three x plus 2 equals 4 or 3x plus 2 is minus 4 and then i can solve so this becomes 3x equals 2 or x equals 2 thirds and over here i get 3x equals minus 6 or x equals minus 2. finally i'll check my answers i'll leave it to you to verify that they both work a common mistake on absolute value equations is to get rid of the absolute value signs like we did here and then just solve for one answer instead of solving for both answers another mistake sometimes people make is once they get the first answer they just assume that the negative of that works also but that doesn't always work in the first example our two answers were both the negatives of each other but in our second examples our two answers were not just the opposites of each other one was twothirds and the other was negative two in this third example let's again isolate the absolute value part of the equation so starting with our original equation we can subtract 16 from both sides and divide both sides by five or equivalently multiply by onefifth now let's think about distance on the number line we have an absolute value needs to equal negative 3. so that means whatever is inside the absolute value sign needs to be at distance negative three from zero well you can't be at distance negative three from zero another way of thinking about this is you can't have the absolute value of something and end up with a negative number absolute value is always positive or zero so this equation doesn't actually make sense and there are no solutions to this equation in this video we solved absolute value equations in many cases an absolute value equation will have two solutions but in some cases it'll have no solutions and occasionally it'll have just one solution this video is about solving rational equations a rational equation like this one is an equation that has rational expressions in it in other words an equation that has some variables in the denominator there are several different approaches for solving a rational equation but they all start by finding the least common denominator in this example the denominators are x plus 3 and x we can think of 1 as just having a denominator of 1. since the denominators don't have any factors in common i can find the least common denominator just by multiplying them together my next step is going to be clearing the denominator by this i mean that i multiply both sides of my equation by this least common denominator x plus 3 times x so i multiply it on the left side of the equation and i multiply by the same thing on the right side of the equation since i'm doing the same thing to both sides of the equation i don't change the the value of the equation multiplying the least common denominator on both sides of the equation is equivalent to multiplying it by all three terms in the equation i can see this when i multiply out i'll rewrite the left side the same as before pretty much and then i'll distribute the right side to get x plus 3 times x times 1 plus x plus 3 times x times 1 over x so i've actually multiplied the least common denominator by all three terms of my equation now i can have a blast cancelling things the x plus 3 cancels with the x plus 3 on the denominator the here nothing cancels out because there's no denominator and here the x in the numerator cancels with the x in the denominator so i can rewrite my expression as x squared equals x plus 3 times x times 1 plus x plus 3. now i'm going to simplify so i'll leave the x squared alone on this side i'll distribute out x squared plus 3x plus x plus 3. hey look the x squares cancel on both sides and so i get 0 equals 4x plus 3 so 4x is negative 3 and x is negative 3 4. finally i'm going to plug in my answer to check this is a good idea for any kind of equation but it's especially important for a rational equation because occasionally for rational equations you'll get what's called extraneous solutions solutions that don't actually work in your original equation because they make the denominator zero now in this example i don't think we're going to get any extraneous equations because negative 3 4 is not going to make any of these denominators 0. so it should work out fine when i plug in if i plug in i get this i can simplify the denominator here negative 3 4 plus 3. 3 is 12 4. so that becomes 9 4. and this is 1 i'll flip and multiply to get minus 4 thirds so here i can simplify my complex fraction it ends up being negative three ninths and one minus four thirds is negative one third so that all seems to check out and so my final answer is x equals negative threefourths this next example looks a little trickier and it is but the same approach will work first i'll find the least common denominator so here my denominators are c minus five c plus one and c squared minus four c minus five i'm gonna factor that as c minus five times c plus 1. now my least common denominator needs to have just enough factors to that each of these denominators divide into it so i need the factor c minus 5 i need the factor c plus 1 and now i've already got all the factors i need for this denominator so here is my least common denominator next step is to clear the denominators so i do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by my least common denominator in fact i can just multiply each of the three terms by this least common denominator i went ahead and wrote my third denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what cancels now canceling time not dies this dies and both of those factors die canceling out the denominator is the whole point of multiplying by the least common denominator you're multiplying by something that's big enough to kill every single denominator so you don't have to deal with denominators anymore now i'm going to simplify by multiplying out so i get let's see c plus 1 times 4c that's 4c squared plus 4c now i get minus just c minus 5. and then over here i get 3c squared plus 3. i can rewrite the minus quantity c minus 5 as minus c plus 5. and now i can subtract the 3c squared from both sides to get just a c squared over here and the 4c minus c that becomes a 3c and finally i can subtract the 3 from both sides to get c squared plus 3c plus 2 equals 0. i've got myself a quadratic equation that looks like a nice one that factors so this factors to c plus one times c plus two equals zero so either c plus one is zero or c plus two is zero so c equals negative one or c equals negative two now let's see we need to still check our answers without even going to the trouble of calculating anything i can see that c equals negative 1 is not going to work because if i plug it in to this denominator here i get a denominator of zero which doesn't make sense so c equals minus one is an extraneous solution it doesn't actually satisfy my original equation and so i can just cross it right out c equals negative 2 i can go if i go ahead that doesn't make any of my denominators zero so if i haven't made any mistakes it should satisfy my original equation but but i'll just plug it in to be sure and after some simplifying i get a true statement so my final answer is c equals negative 2. in this video we solved a couple of rational equations using the method of finding the least common denominator and then clearing the denominator we cleared the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator or equivalently multiplying each of the terms by that denominator there's another equivalent method that some people prefer it still starts out the same we find the least common denominator but then we write all the fractions over that least common denominator so in this example we'd still use the least common denominator of x plus 3 times x but our next step would be to write each of these rational expressions over that common denominator by multiplying the top and the bottom by the appropriate things so 1 in order to get the common denominator of x plus 3 x i need to multiply the top and the bottom by x plus 3 times x 1 over x i need to multiply the top and the bottom just by x plus 3 since that's what's missing from the denominator x now if i simplify a little bit uh let's see this is x squared over that common denominator and here i have just x plus 3 times x over that denominator and here i have x plus 3 over that common denominator now i'll add together my fractions on the right side so they have a common denominator so this is x plus 3 times x plus x plus 3. and now i have two fractions that have that are equal that have the same denominator therefore their numerators have to be equal also so the next step is to set the numerators equal so i get x squared is x plus 3 times x plus x plus three and if you look back at the previous way we solve this equation you'll recognize this equation and so from here on we just continue as before when choosing between these two methods i personally tend to prefer the clear the denominators method because it's a little bit less writing you don't have to you get rid of those denominators earlier you don't have to write them as many times but some people find this one a little bit easier to remember a little easier to understand either of these methods is fine one last caution don't forget at the end to check your solutions and eliminate any extraneous solutions these will be solutions that make the denominators of your original equations go to zero this video is about solving radical equations that is equations like this one that have square root signs in them or cube roots or any other kind of radical when i see an equation with a square root in it i really want to get rid of the square root but it'll be easiest to get rid of the square root if i first isolate the square root in other words i want to get the term with the square root in it on one side of the equation by itself and everything else on the other side of the equation if i start with my original equation x plus the square root of x equals 12 and i subtract x from both sides then that does isolate the square root term on the left side with everything else on the right once i've isolated the term with the square root i'm going to get rid of the square root and i'll do that by squaring both sides of my equation so i'll take the square root of x equals 12 minus x and square both sides now the square root of x squared is just x taking the square root and then squaring those operations undo each other to work out 12 minus x squared i'll write it out and distribute 12 times 12 is 144 12 times minus x is minus 12x i get another minus 12x from here and finally minus x times minus x is positive x squared so i can combine my minus 12 x's that's minus 24x and now i can subtract x from both sides to get 0 equals 144 minus 25x plus x squared that's a quadratic equation i'll rewrite it in a little bit more standard form here so now i've got a familiar quadratic equation with no radical signs left in my equation i'll just proceed to solve it like i usually do for a quadratic i'll try to factor it so i'm going to look for two numbers that multiply to 144 and add to minus 25. well i know i'm going to need negative numbers to get to negative 25 and in fact i'll need two negative numbers so they still multiply to a positive number so i'll start listing some factors of 144. i could have negative 1 and a negative 144 negative 2 and negative 72 negative 4 negative 36 and so on once i've listed out the possible factors it's not hard to find the two that add to negative 25 so that's negative 9 and negative 16. so now i can factor my quadratic equation as x minus 9 times x minus 16 equals 0. that means that x minus 9 is 0 or x minus 16 is 0. so x equals 9 or x equals 16. i'm almost done but there's one last very important step and that's to check the solutions so that we can eliminate any extraneous solutions an extraneous solution is a solution that we get that does not actually satisfy our original equation and extraneous solutions can happen when you're solving equations with radicals in them so let's first check x equals 9 if we plug in to our original equation we get 9 plus the square root of 9 and we want that to equal 12. well the square root of 9 is 3 and 9 plus 3 it does indeed equal 12 so that solution checks out now let's try x equals 16 plugging in we get 16 plus the square root of 16 and that's supposed to equal 12. well that says 16 plus 4 is supposed to equal 12 but that most definitely is not true and so x equals 16 turns out to be extraneous solution and our only solution is x equals 9. this next equation might not look like an equation involving radicals but in fact we can think of a fractional exponent as being a radical in disguise let's start by doing the same thing we did on the previous problem by isolating this time we'll isolate the part of the equation that involves the fractional exponent so i'll start with the original equation 2 times p to the 4 5 equals 1 oneeighth and i'll divide both sides by two or equivalently i can multiply both sides by onehalf that gives me p to the fourfifths equals onesixteenth and i've effectively isolated the part of the equation with the fractional exponent as much as possible now in the previous example the next step was to get rid of the radical in this example we're going to get rid of the fractional exponent and i'm going to actually do this in two stages first i'm going to raise both sides to the fifth power that's because when i take an exponent to an exponent i multiply my exponents and so that becomes just p to the fourth equals 1 16 to the fifth power now i'm going to get rid of the fourth power by raising both sides to the onefourth power or by taking the fourth root there's something that you need to be careful about though when taking an even root or the one over an even number power you always have to consider plus or minus your answer it's kind of like when you write x squared equals 4 and you take the square root of both sides x could equal plus or minus the square root of 4 right x could equal plus or minus 2 since minus 2 squared is 4 just as well as 2 squared so that's why when you take an even root or a 1 over an even power of both sides you always need to include the plus or minus sign when it's an odd root or one over an odd power you don't need to do that if you had something like x cubed equals negative 8 then x equals the cube root of negative 8 which is negative 2 would be your only solution you don't need to do the plus or minus because positive 2 wouldn't work so that aside explains why we need this plus or minus power and now p to the 4 to the 1 4 when i raise a power to a power i multiply by exponents so that's just p to the 1 which is equal to plus or minus 1 16 to the fifth power to the onefourth power now i just need to simplify this expression i don't really want to raise 1 16 to the fifth power because 16 to the fifth power is like a really huge number so i think i'm actually going to rewrite this first as p equals plus or minus 1 16. i'll write it back as the 5 4 power again and as i continue to solve using my exponent rules i'm going to prefer to write this as 1 16 to the 4th root to the 5th power because it's going to be easier to take the 4th root let's see the 4th root of 1 16 is the same thing as the 4th root of 1 over the fourth root of sixteen raise all that to the fifth power fourth root of one is just one and the fourth root of sixteen is two raise that to the fifth power that's just gonna be one to the fifth over two to the fifth which is plus or minus 1 32nd the last step is to check answers so i have the two answers p equals 132nd and p equals minus one thirty seconds and if i plug those both in one thirty second to the fourth fifth power that gives me two times one to the four fifth power over 32 to the fourfifth power which is two times one over thirtytwo fifth rooted to the fourth power fifth root of 32 is two raise that to the fourth power i get 16 so this is 2 times 1 16 which is 1 8 just as we wanted in the original equation up here similarly we can check that the p equals negative 1 32nd actually does satisfy the equation i'll leave that step to the viewer so our two solutions are p equals 1 over 32 and p equals minus 1 over 32. i do want to point out an alternate approach to getting rid of the fractional exponent we could have gotten rid of it all in one fell swoop by raising both sides of our equation to the fivefourths power 5 4 is the reciprocal of fourfifths so when i use my exponent rules and say that when i raise the power to the power i multiply my exponents that gives me p to the fourfifths times fivefourths is plus or minus onesixteenth to the fivefourths in other words p to the one power which is just p is plus or minus onesixteenth to the fivefourths so that's an alternate and possibly faster way to get to the solution once again the plus or minus comes from the fact that when we take the 5 4 power we're really taking an even root a fourth root and so we need to consider both positive and negative answers this video is about solving radical equations that is equations like this one that have square root signs in them or cube roots or any other kind of radical in this video we solved radical equations by first isolating the radical sign or the fractional exponent and then removing the radical sign or the fractional exponent by either squaring both sides or taking the reciprocal power of both sides this video is about solving inequalities that have absolute value signs in them let's look at the inequality absolute value of x is less than five on the number line thinking of absolute value as distance this means that the distance between x and zero is less than five units so x has to live somewhere in between negative five and five we can express this as an inequality without absolute value signs by saying negative five is less than x which is less than five or we can use interval notation soft bracket negative 5 5 soft bracket both of these formulations are equivalent to the original one but don't involve the absolute value signs in the second example we're looking for the values of x for which the absolute value of x is greater than or equal to five on the number line this means that the distance of x from the zero has got to be bigger than or equal to five units a distance bigger than five units means that x has to live somewhere over here or somewhere over here where it's farther than five units away from zero of course x could also have a distance equal to five units so i'll fill in that dot and shade in the other parts of the number line that satisfy my inequality now i can rewrite the inequality without the absolute value symbols by saying that x is less than or equal to negative 5 or x is greater than or equal to 5. i could also write this in interval notation soft bracket negative infinity negative five hard bracket and the second part is hard bracket five infinity soft bracket i combine these with a u for union because i'm trying to describe all these points on the number line together with all these other points let's take this analysis a step further with a slightly more complicated problem now i want the absolute value of 3 minus 2t to be less than 4. an absolute value less than 4 means a distance less than 4 on the number line but it's not the variable t that lives in here at a distance of less than 4 from 0 it's the whole expression 3 minus 2t so 3 minus 2t lives somewhere in here and i can rewrite this as an inequality without absolute value signs by saying negative 4 is less than 3 minus 2t is less than 4. now i have a compound inequality that i can solve the usual way first i'll subtract 3 from all three sides to get negative seven is less than negative two t is less than one and now i'll divide all three sides by negative two since negative two is a negative number this reverses the directions of the inequalities simplifying i get 7 halves is greater than t is greater than negative onehalf so my final answer on the number line looks like all the stuff between negative a half and seven halves but not including the end points and in interval notation i can write this soft bracket negative a half seven halves soft bracket please pause the video and try the next problem on your own thinking in terms of distance this inequality says that the distance between the expression 3 minus 2t and 0 is always bigger than 4. let me draw this on the number line if 3 minus 2t has a distance bigger than 4 from 0 then it can't be in this region that's near zero it has to be on the outside in one of these two regions that is 3 minus 2t is either less than negative 4 or 3 minus 2t is bigger than 4. i'll solve these two inequalities separately the first one subtracting 3 from both sides i get negative 2t is less than negative 7. dividing by negative 2 i get t is bigger than 7 halves and then on the other side i get negative 2t is greater than 1 so t is less than negative onehalf i had to flip inequalities in the last step due to dividing by a negative number so let's check this out on the number line again the first piece says that t is greater than seven halves i'll draw that over here and the second piece says that t is less than negative onehalf i'll draw that down here because these two statements are joined with an or i'm looking for the tvalues that are in this one or in this one that is i want both of these regions put together so in interval notation this reads negative infinity to negative one half soft bracket union soft bracket seven halves to infinity this last example looks more complicated but if i simplify first and isolate the absolute value part it looks pretty much like the previous ones so i'll start by subtracting 7 from both sides and then i'll divide both sides by 2. now i'll draw my number line and i'm looking for this expression 4x plus 5 to always have distance greater than or equal to negative 3 from 0. wait a second distance greater than or equal to negative three well distance is always greater than or equal to negative three it's always greater than or equal to zero so this in fact is always true and so the answer to my inequality is all numbers between negative infinity and infinity in other words all real numbers when solving absolute value inequalities it's good to think about distance an absolute value of something that's less than a number means that whatever is inside the absolute value signs is close to zero on the other hand an absolute value of something being greater than a number means that whatever's inside the absolute value sign is far away from zero because its distance from zero is bigger than a certain number drawing these pictures on the number line is a helpful way to rewrite the absolute value inequality as an inequality that doesn't contain an absolute value sign in this case it would be negative three is less than x plus two is less than three and the other case it would be either x plus two is less than negative three or x plus two is greater than three this video is about solving linear inequalities those are inequalities like this one that involve a variable here x but don't involve any x squared or other higher power terms the good news is we can solve linear inequalities just like we'd solve linear equations by distributing adding and subtracting terms to both sides and multiplying and dividing by numbers on both sides the only thing that's different is that if you multiply or divide by a negative number then you need to reverse the direction of the inequality for example if we had the inequality negative x is less than negative 5 and we wanted to multiply both sides by negative 1 to get rid of the negative signs we'd have to also switch or reverse the inequality with this caution in mind let's look at our first example since our variable x is trapped in parentheses i'll distribute the negative five to free it from the parentheses that gives me negative five x minus ten plus three is greater than eight negative ten plus 3 is negative 7 so i'll rewrite this as negative 5 x minus 7 is greater than 8. now i'll add 7 to both sides to get negative 5x is greater than 15. now i'd like to divide both sides by negative 5 since negative 5 is a negative number that reverses the inequality so i get x is less than 15 divided by negative 5 in other words x is less than negative three if i wanted to graph this on a number line i just need to put down a negative three an open circle around it and shade in to the left i use an open circle because x is strictly less than negative 3 and can't equal negative 3. if i wanted to write this in interval notation i write it as soft bracket negative infinity negative 3 soft bracket again the soft bracket is because the negative 3 is not included this next example is an example of a compound inequality it has two parts either this statement is true or this statement is true i want to find the values of x that satisfy either one i'll solve this by working out each part separately and then combining them at the end for the inequality on the left i'll copy it over here i'm going to add 4 to both sides then subtract x from both sides and then divide both sides by 2. i didn't have to reverse the inequality sign because i divided by a positive number on the right side i'll copy the equation over subtract one from both sides and divide both sides by six nine sixths is the same as three halves now i'm looking for the x values that make this statement true or make this statement true let me graph this on a number line x is less than or equal to negative 2 means i put a filled in circle there and graph everything to the left x is greater than three halves means i put an empty circle here and shade in everything to the right my final answer includes both of these pieces which i'll reshade in green because x is allowed to be in either one or the other finally i can write this in interval notation the first piece on the number line can be described as soft bracket negative infinity negative two hard bracket and the second piece can be described as soft bracket three halves infinity soft bracket to indicate that x can be in either one of these pieces i use the union sign which is a u that means that my answer includes all x values in here together with all x values in here this next example is also a compound inequality this time joined by an and the and means i'm looking for all y values that satisfy both this and this at the same time again i can solve each piece separately on the left to isolate the y i need to multiply by negative three halves on both sides so that gives me y is less than negative 12 times negative three halves the greater than flipped to a less than because i was multiplying by negative three halves which is a negative number if i clean up the right side i get y is less than 18. on the right side i'll start by subtracting 2 from both sides and now i'll divide by negative 4 again a negative number so that flips the inequality so that's y is less than 3 over negative 4. in other words y is less than negative 3 4. again i'm looking for the y values that make both of these statements true at the same time let me graph this on the number line the y is less than 18 i can graph that by drawing the number 18 i don't want to include it so i use an empty circle and i shaded everything to the left the statement y is less than negative threefourths i need to draw a negative 3 4 and again i don't include it but i do include everything on the left since i want the y values for which both of these statements are true i need the y values that are in both colored blue and colored red and so that would be this part right here i'll just draw it above so you can see it easily so that would be all the numbers from negative 3 4 and lower not including negative 3 4. since those are the parts the number line that have both red and blue colors on them in interval notation my final answer will be soft bracket negative infinity to negative threefourths soft bracket as my final example i have an inequality that has two inequality signs in it negative 3 is less than or equal to 6x minus 2 is less than 10. i can think of this as being a compound inequality with two parts negative three x is less than or equal to six x minus two and at the same time six x minus two is less than ten i could solve this in two pieces as before but instead it's a little more efficient to just solve it all at once by doing the same thing to all three sides so as a first step i'll add 2 to all three sides that gives me negative 1 is less than or equal to 6x is less than 12 and now i'm going to divide all three sides by 6 to isolate the x so that gives me negative 1 6 is less than or equal to x is less than 2. if we'd solved it instead in two pieces above we'd end up with the same thing because we'd get negative 1 6 is less than or equal to x from this piece and we'd get x is less than 2 on this piece and because of the and statement that's the same thing as saying negative 1 6 is less or equal to x which is less than 2. either way we do it let's see if what it looks like on the number line so on the number line we're looking for things that are between 2 and negative 1 6 including the negative 1 6 but not including the 2. in interval notation we can write this as hard bracket negative 1 6 to soft bracket in this video we solved linear inequalities including some compound inequalities joined by the conjunctions and and or remember when we're working with and we're looking for places on the number line where both statements are true that is we're looking for the overlap on the number line in this case the points on the number line that are colored both red and blue at the same time when we're working with or statements we're looking for places where either one or the other statement is true or both on the number line this corresponds to points that are colored either red or blue or both and in this picture that would actually correspond to the entire number line in this video we'll solve inequalities involving polynomials like this one and inequalities involving rational expressions like this one let's start with a simple example maybe a deceptively simple example if you see the inequality x squared is less than 4 you might be very tempted to take the square root of both sides and get something like x is less than 2 as your answer but in fact that doesn't work to see why it's not correct consider the x value of negative 10. negative 10 satisfies the inequality x is less than 2 since negative 10 is less than two but it doesn't satisfy the inequality x squared is less than four since negative ten squared is a hundred which is not less than four so these two inequalities are not the same and it doesn't work to solve a quadratic inequality just to take the square root of both sides you might be thinking part of why this reasoning is wrong is we've ignored the negative two option right if we had the equation x squared equals 4 then x equals 2 would just be one option x equals negative 2 would be another solution so somehow our solution to this inequality should take this into account in fact a good way to solve an inequality involving x squareds or higher power terms is to solve the associated equation first but before we even do that i like to pull everything over to one side so that my inequality has zero on the other side so for our equation i'll subtract four from both sides to get x squared minus four is less than zero now i'm going to actually solve the associated equation x squared minus 4 is equal to 0. i can do this by factoring to x minus 2 times x plus 2 is equal to 0 and i'll set my factors equal to 0 and i get x equals 2 and x equals minus 2. now i'm going to plot the solutions to my equation on the number line so i write down negative 2 and 2. those are the places where my expression x squared minus 4 is equal to 0. since i want to find where x squared minus 4 is less than 0 i want to know where this expression x squared minus 4 is positive or negative a good way to find that out is to plug in test values so first i'll plug in a test value in this area of the number line something less than negative 2 say x equals negative 3. if i plug in negative 3 into x squared minus 4 i get negative 3 squared minus 4 which is 9 minus 4 which is 5. that's a positive number so at negative 3 the expression x squared minus 4 is positive and in fact everywhere on this region of the number line my expression is going to be positive because it can't jump from positive to negative without going through a place where it's zero i can figure out whether x squared minus 4 is positive or negative on this region and on this region of the number line by plugging in test values similarly a value to plug in between negative 2 and 2 a nice value is x equals 0. 0 squared minus 4 that's negative 4 a negative number so i know that my expression x squared minus 4 is negative on this whole interval finally i can plug in something like x equals 10 something bigger than 2 and i get 10 squared minus 4. without even computing that i can tell that that's going to be a positive number and that's all that's important again since i want x squared minus 4 to be less than 0 i'm looking for the places on this number line where i'm getting negatives so i'll shade that in on my number line it's in here not including the endpoints because the endpoints are where my expression x squared minus 4 is equal to zero and i want it strictly less than zero i can write my answer as an inequality negative 2 is less than x is less than 2 or in interval notation as soft bracket negative 2 to soft bracket our next example we can solve similarly first we'll move everything to one side so that our inequality is x cubed minus five x squared minus six x is greater than or equal to zero next we'll solve the associated equation by factoring so first i'll write down the equation now i'll factor out an x and now i'll factor the quadratic so the solutions to my equation are x equals 0 x equals 6 and x equals negative 1. i'll write the solutions to the equation on the number line so that's negative one zero and six that's where my expression x times x minus six times x plus one is equal to zero but i want to find where it's greater than or equal to 0 so again i can use test values i can plug in for example x equals negative 2 either to this version of the expression or to this factored version since i only care whether my answer is positive or negative it's sometimes easier to use the factored version for example when x is negative 2 this factor is negative but this factor x minus 6 is also negative when i plug in negative 2 for x finally x plus 1 when i plug in negative 2 for x that's negative 1 that's also negative and a negative times a negative times a negative gives me a negative number if i plug in something between negative 1 and 0 say x equals negative 1 half then i'm going to get a negative for this factor a negative for this factor but a positive for this third factor negative times negative times positive gives me a positive for a test value between 0 and 6 let's try x equals 1. now i'll get a positive for this factor a negative for this factor and a positive for this factor a positive times a negative times a positive gives me a negative finally for a test value bigger than six we could use say x equals a hundred that's going to give me positive positive positive so my product will be positive since i want values where my expression is greater than or equal to zero i want the places where it equals zero and the places where it's positive so my final answer will be close bracket negative 1 to 0 close bracket union close bracket 6 to infinity as our final example let's consider the rational inequality x squared plus 6x plus 9 divided by x minus 1 is less than or equal to 0. although it might be tempting to clear the denominator and multiply both sides by x minus 1 it's dangerous to do that because x minus 1 could be a positive number but it could also be a negative number and when you multiply both sides by a negative number you have to reverse the inequality although it's possible to solve the inequality this way by thinking of cases where x minus one is less than zero or bigger than zero i think it's much easier just to solve the same way as we did before so we'll start by rewriting so that we move all terms to the left and have 0 on the right well that's already true so the next step would be to solve the associated equation that is x squared plus 6x plus 9 over x minus 1 is equal to 0. that would be where the numerator is 0 x squared plus 6x plus 9 is equal to 0 so where x plus 3 squared is 0 or x equals negative 3. there's one extra step we have to do for rational expressions and that's we need to find where the expression does not exist that is let's find where the denominator is 0 and that's at x equals 1. i'll put all those numbers on the number line the places where my rational expression is equal to 0 and the place where my rational expression doesn't exist then i can start in with test values for example x equals minus 4 0 and 2 work if i plug those values into this expression here i get a negative answer a negative answer and a positive answer the reason i need to conclude the values on my number line where my denominator is 0 is because i can my expression can switch from negative to positive by passing through a place where my rational expression doesn't exist as well as passing by passing through through a place where my rational expression is equal to zero now i'm looking for where my original expression was less than or equal to zero so that means i want the places on the number line where my expression is equal to 0 and also the places where it's negative so my final answer is x is less than 1 or in interval notation negative infinity to 1. in this video we solved polynomial and rational inequalities by making a number line and using test values to make a sign chart the distance formula can be used to find the distance between two points if we know their coordinates if this first point has coordinates x1 y1 and the second point has coordinates x2 y2 then the distance between them is given by the formula the square root of x2 minus x1 squared plus y2 minus y1 squared this formula actually comes from the pythagorean theorem let me draw a right triangle with these two points as two of its vertices then the length of this side is the difference between the two x coordinates similarly the length of this vertical side is the difference between the two y coordinates now the pythagorean theorem says that for any right triangle with sides labeled a and b and hypotenuse labeled c we have that a squared plus b squared equals c squared well if we apply that to this triangle here this hypotenuse is the distance between the two points that we're looking for so pythagorean theorem says the square of this side length that is x2 minus x1 squared plus the square of this side length which is y2 minus y1 squared has to equal the square of the hypotenuse that is d squared taking the square root of both sides of this equation we get the square root of x2 minus x1 squared plus y2 minus y1 squared is equal to d we don't have to worry about using plus or minus signs when we take the square root because distance is always positive so we've derived our distance formula now let's use it in an example let's find the distance between the two points negative one five so negative one five maybe over here and four 2. this notation just means that p is the point with coordinates negative 1 5 and q is the point with coordinates 4 2. we have the distance formula let's think of p being the point with coordinates x1 y1 and q being the point with coordinates x2 y2 but as we'll see it really doesn't matter which one is which plugging into our formula we get d is the square root of x2 minus x1 so that's 4 minus negative 1 squared and then we add y2 minus y1 so that's 2 minus 5 squared working out the arithmetic a little bit 4 minus negative 1 that's 4 plus 1 or 5 squared plus negative 3 squared so that's the square root of 25 plus 9 or the square root of 34. let's see what would have happened if we'd called this first point x2 y2 instead and the second point x1 y1 then we would have gotten the same distance formula but we would have taken negative 1 minus 4 and added the difference of y's squared so that's y2 5 minus 2 squared so that gives us the square root of negative 5 squared plus 3 squared which works out to the same thing in this video we use the distance formula to find the distance between two points when writing down the distance formula sometimes students forget whether this is a plus or minus and whether these are pluses or minuses one way to remember is to think that the distance formula comes from the pythagorean theorem that's why there's a plus in here and then a minus in here because we're getting the difference between the coordinates to find the lengths of the sides the midpoint formula helps us find the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment as long as we know the coordinates of the endpoints so let's call the coordinates of this endpoint x1 y1 and the coordinates of this other endpoint x2 y2 the xcoordinate of the midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between the xcoordinates of the endpoints to get a number halfway in between two other numbers we just take the average similarly the ycoordinate of this midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between the ycoordinates of the endpoints so the ycoordinate of the midpoint is going to be the average of those ycoordinates so we see that the coordinates of the midpoint are x1 plus x2 over 2 y1 plus y2 over 2. let's use this midpoint formula in an example we want to find the midpoint of the segment between the points negative 1 5 and 4 2. let me draw the line segment between them so visually the midpoint is going to be somewhere around here but to find its exact coordinates we're going to use x1 plus x2 over 2 and y1 plus y2 over 2 where this first point is coordinates x1 y1 and the second point has coordinates x2 y2 it doesn't actually matter which point you decide is x1 y1 and which one is x2 y2 the formula will still give you the same answer for the midpoint so let's see i take my average of my x coordinates so that's negative 1 plus 4 over 2 and the average of my y coordinates so that's 5 plus 2 over 2 and i get 3 halves 7 halves as the coordinates of my midpoint in this video we use the midpoint formula to find the midpoint of a line segment just by taking the average of the x coordinates and the average of the y coordinates this video is about graphs and equations of circles suppose we want to find the equation of a circle of radius 5 centered at the point 3 2. it'll look something like this for any point x y on the circle we know that the distance of that point x y from the center is equal to the radius that is 5. from the distance formula that distance of 5 is equal to the square root of the difference of the x coordinates that's x minus 3 squared plus the difference of the y coordinates that's y minus 2 squared and if i square both sides of that equation i get 5 squared is this square root squared in other words 25 is equal to x minus 3 squared plus y minus 2 squared since the square root and the squared undo each other a lot of times people will write the x minus 3 squared plus y minus 2 squared on the left side of the equation and the 25 on the right side of the equation this is the standard form for the equation of this circle this same reasoning can be generalized to find a general equation for a circle with radius r centered at a point h k for any point with coordinates x y on the circle the distance between the point with coordinates x y and the point with coordinates h k is equal to the radius r so we have that the distance is equal to r but by the distance formula that's the square root of the difference between the x coordinates x minus h squared plus the difference in the y coordinates y minus k squared squaring both sides as before we get r squared is the square root squared canceling the square root and the squared and rearranging the equation that gives us x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared that's the general formula for a circle with radius r and center h k notice that the coordinates h and k are subtracted here the two squares are added because they are in the distance formula and the radius is squared on the other side if you remember this general formula that makes it easy to write down the equation for a circle for example if we want the equation for a circle of radius 6 and center at zero negative three then we have r equals six and h k is our zero negative three so plugging into the formula we get x minus 0 squared plus y minus negative 3 squared equals 6 squared or simplified this is x squared plus y plus 3 squared equals 36. suppose we're given an equation like this one and we want to decide if it's the equation of a circle and if so what's the center and what's the radius well this equation matches the form for a circle x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared if we let h be 5 y be negative 6 since that way subtracting a negative six is like adding a six five must be our r squared so that means that r is the square root of five so this is our radius and our center is the point 5 negative 6. and this is indeed the equation for a circle which we could then graph by putting down the center and estimating the radius which is a little bit more than 2. this equation might not look like the equation of a circle but it actually can be transformed to look like the equation of a circle we're trying to make it look like something of the form x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared first i'd like to get rid of the coefficients in front of the x squared and the y squared so i'm going to divide everything by 9. this gives me x squared plus y squared plus 8x minus 2y plus 4 equals 0. next i'm going to group the x terms together the x squared and the 8x so i'll write x squared plus 8x i'll group the y terms together the y squared minus 2y and i'll subtract the 4 over to the other side this still doesn't look much like the equation of a circle but as the next step i'm going to do something called completing the square i'm going to take this coefficient of x 8 divide it by 2 and then square it in other words 8 over 2 squared that's 4 squared which is 16. i'm going to add 16 to both sides of my equation so i'll add the 16 here and on the other side now i'm going to do the same thing to the coefficient of y negative 2 divided by 2 is negative 1 square that and i get 1. so now i'm going to add a 1 to both sides but i'll put it near the y terms so i add a 1 there and then to keep things balanced i have to add it to the other side on the right side i have the number 13. on the left side i can wrap up this expression x squared plus 8x plus 16 into x plus 4 squared to convince you that's correct if we multiply out x plus 4 times x plus 4 we get x squared plus 4x plus 4x plus 16 or x squared plus 8x plus 16. the same thing we have right here similarly we can wrap up y squared minus 2y plus 1 as y minus 1 squared again i'll work out the distribution down here that's y squared minus y minus y plus one or y squared minus two y plus one just like we have up here if you're wondering how i knew to use four and minus one the four came from taking half of 8 and the minus 1 came from taking half the negative 2. now we have an equation for a circle in standard form and we can read off the center which is negative 4 negative 1 and the radius which is the square root of 13. it might seem like magic that this trick of taking half of this coefficient and squaring it and adding it to both sides lets us wrap up this expression into this expression that's perfect square but to see why that works let's take a look at what happens if we expand out x minus h squared the thing that we're trying to get to so if we expand that out x minus h squared which is x minus h times x minus h is which multiplies out to x squared minus hx minus hx plus h squared or x squared minus 2hx plus h squared now if we start out with this part with some x squared term and some coefficient of x and we're trying to decide what to add on in order to wrap it up into x minus h squared the thing to add on is h squared here which comes from half of this coefficient squared right because half of negative 2h is 8 negative h square that you get the h squared and then when we do wrap it up it's half of this coefficient of x that appears right here this trick of completing the square is really handy for turning an equation for a circle in disguise into the standard equation for the circle in this video we found the standard equation for a circle x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared where r is the radius and h k is the center we also showed a method of completing the square when you have an equation for a circle in disguise completing the square will help you rewrite it into the standard form this video is about graphs and equations of lines here we're given the graph of a line we want to find the equation one standard format for the equation of a line is y equals mx plus b here m represents the slope and b represents the yintercept the yvalue where the line crosses the yaxis the slope is equal to the rise over the run or sometimes this is written as the change in y values over the change in x values or in other words y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1 where x1 y1 and x2 y2 are points on the line while we could use any two points on the line to find the slope it's convenient to use points where the x and y coordinates are integers that is points where the line passes through grid points so here would be one convenient point to use and here's another convenient point to use the coordinates of the first point are 1 2 and the next point this is let's see 5 negative 1. now i can find the slope by looking at the rise over the run so as i go through a run of this distance i go through a rise of that distance it's actually going to be a negative rise or a fall because my line is pointing down so let's see counting off squares this is a run of 1 2 3 four squares and a rise of one two three so negative three so my slope is going to be negative three over four i got that answer by counting squares but i could have also gotten it by looking at the difference in my y values over the difference of my x values that is i could have done negative 1 minus 2 that's from my difference in y values and divide that by my difference in x values which is 5 minus 1 that gives me negative 3 over 4 as before so my m is negative threefourths now i need to figure out the value of b my yintercept well i could just read it off the graph it looks like approximately 2.75 but if i want to be more accurate i can again use a point that has integer coordinates that i know its exact coordinates so either this point or that point let's try this point and i can start off with my equation y equals mx plus b that is y equals negative 3 4 x plus b and i can plug in the point 1 2 for my x and y so that gives me 2 equals negative 3 4 times 1 plus b solving for b let's see that's 2 equals negative 3 4 plus b so add 3 4 to both sides that's 2 plus 3 4 equals b so b is 8 4 plus 3 4 which is 11 4 which is actually just what i eyeballed it to be so now i can write out my final equation for my line y equals negative 3 4 x plus 11 4 by plugging in for m and b next let's find the equation for this horizontal line horizontal line has slope zero so if we think of it as y equals mx plus b m is going to be zero in other words it's just y equals b y is some constant so if we can figure out what that that constant y value is it looks like it's uh 2 let's see that's 3 3 and a half we can just write down the equation directly y equals 3.5 for a vertical line like this one it doesn't really have a slope i mean if you tried to do the rise over the run there's no run so you i guess you'd be dividing by zero and get an infinite slope but but instead we just think of it as an equation of the form x equals something and in this case x equals negative 2 notice that all of the points on our line have the same x coordinate of negative 2 and the y coordinate can be anything so this is how we write the equation for a vertical line in this example we're not shown a graph of the line we're just told that it goes through two points but knowing that it goes through two points is enough to find the equation for the line first we can find the slope by taking the difference in y values over the difference in x values so that's negative three minus two over four minus one which is negative five thirds so we can use the standard equation for the line this is called the slope intercept form and we can plug in negative five thirds and we can use one point either one will do we'll still get the same final answer so let's use 1 2 and plug that in to get 2 equals negative 5 thirds times 1 plus b and so b is 2 plus five thirds which is sixthirds plus fivethirds which is eleventhirds so our equation is y equals negative fivethirds x plus eleventhirds this is method one method two uses a slightly different form of the equation it's called the point slope form and it goes y minus y naught is equal to m times x minus x naught where x naught y naught is a point on the line and m again is the slope so we calculate the slope the same way by taking a difference in y values over difference in x values but then we can simply plug in any point for example the point 1 2 will work we can plug 1 in for x naught and 2 in for y naught in this pointslope form that gives us y minus 2 is equal to minus 5 thirds x minus 1. notice that these two equations while they may look different are actually equivalent because if i distribute the negative 5 thirds and then add the 2 to both sides i get the same equation as above so we've seen two ways of finding the equation for the line using the slopeintercept form and using the pointslope form in this video we saw that you can find the equation for a line if you know the slope and you know one point you can also find the equation for the line if you know two points because you can use the two points to get the slope and then plug in one of those points to figure out the rest of the equation we saw two standard forms for the equation of a line the slopeintercept form y equals mx plus b where m is the slope and b is the yintercept and the pointslope form y minus ynaught equals m times x minus xnaught where m again is the slope and naught y naught is a point on the line this video is about finding parallel and perpendicular lines suppose we have a line of slope 3 4 in other words the rise over the run is three over four then any other line that's parallel to this line will have the same slope the same rise over run so that's our first fact to keep in mind parallel lines have the same slopes suppose on the other hand we want to find a line perpendicular to our original line with its original slope of 3 4. a perpendicular line in other words a line at a 90 degree angle to our original line will have a slope that's the negative reciprocal of the opposite reciprocal of our original slope so we take the reciprocal of threefourths that's fourthirds and we make it its opposite by changing it from positive to negative so i'll write this as a principle that perpendiculars lines have opposite reciprocal slopes to get the hang of what it means to be an opposite reciprocal let's look at a few examples so here's the original slope and this will be the opposite reciprocal which would represent the slope of our perpendicular line so for example if m1 was 2 then the opposite reciprocal reciprocal of 2 is onehalf opposite means i change the sign if the first slope turned out to be say negative 1 3 the reciprocal of 1 3 is 3 over 1 or just 3 and the opposite means i change it from a negative to a positive so my perpendicular slope would be would be 3. one more example if i started off with the slope of say 7 halves then the reciprocal of that would be 2 7 and i change it to an opposite reciprocal by changing the positive to a negative let's use these two principles in some examples in our first example we need to find the equation of a line that's parallel to this lump and goes through the point negative 3 2. well in order to get started i need to figure out the slope of this line so let me put this line into a more standard form the the slopeintercept form so i'll start with 3y minus 4x plus 6 equals 0. i'm going to solve for y to put it in this this more standard form so i'll say 3y equals 4x minus 6 and then divide by 3 to get y equals 4 3x minus 6 thirds i've divided all my terms by 3 i can simplify that a little bit y equals 4 3 x minus 2. now i can read off the slope of my original line and 1 is 4 3. that means my slope of my new line my parallel line will also be four thirds so my new line will have the equation y equals four thirds x plus b for some b of course b will probably not be negative two like it was for the first line it'll be something else determined by the fact that it goes through this point negative 3 2. to figure out what b is i'll plug in the point negative 3 2 for negative 3 for x and 2 for y so that gives me 2 equals 4 3 times negative 3 plus b and i'll solve for b so let's see first let me just simplify so 2 equals this is negative 12 thirds plus b or in other words two is negative four plus b so that means that b is going to be six and my my parallel line will have the equation y equals four thirds x plus six next let's find the equation of a line that's perpendicular to a given line through and go through a given point again in order to get started i need to find what the slope of this given line is so i'll rewrite it well first i'll just copy it over 6x plus 3y equals 4 and then i can put it in the standard slope intercept form by solving for y so 3y is negative six x plus four divide everything by three i get y equals negative six thirds x plus four thirds so y is negative two x plus four thirds so on my original slope of my original line is negative two which means my perpendicular slope is the opposite reciprocal so i take the reciprocal of of negative two that's negative one half and i change the sign so that gives me one half as the slope of my perpendicular line now my new line i know is going to be y equals onehalf x plus b for some b and i can plug in my point on my new line so 1 for y and 4 for x and solve for b so i get 1 equals 2 plus b so b is negative 1 and so my new line has equation 1 half x minus one these next two examples are a little bit different because now we're looking at a line parallel to a completely horizontal line let me draw this line y equals 3. so the ycoordinate is always 3 which means that my line will be a horizontal line through that height y equals 3. if i want something parallel to this line it will also be a horizontal line since it goes through the point negative 2 1 let's see negative 2 1 it has to go through that point there it's going to have always have a ycoordinate of 1 the same as the ycoordinate of the point it goes through so my answer will just be y equals 1. in the next example we want a line that's perpendicular to the line y equals 4 another horizontal line y equals 4. but perpendicular means i'm going to need a vertical line so i need a vertical line that goes through the point 3 4 okay and so i'm going to draw a vertical line there now vertical lines have the form x equals something for their equation and to find what x equals i just need to look at the x coordinate of the point i'm going through this point 3 4. so that x coordinate is 3 and all the points on this this perpendicular and vertical line have x coordinate 3 so my answer is x equals 3. in this video we use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope and perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes to find the equations of parallel and perpendicular lines this video introduces functions and their domains and ranges a function is a correspondence between input numbers usually the x values and output numbers usually the y values that sends each input number to exactly one output number sometimes a function is thought of as a rule or machine in which you can feed in x values as input and get out y values as output so a nonmathematical example of a function might be the biological mother function which takes as input any person and gives us output their biological mother this function satisfies the condition that each input number object person in this case gets sent to exactly one output person because if you take any person they just have one biological mother so that rule does give you a function but if i change things around and just use the the mother function which sends to each person their mother that's no longer going to be a function because there are some people who have more than one mother right they could have a biological mother an adopted mother or or a mother and a stepmother or any number of situations so since there's there's at least some people who you would put it as input and then you'd get like more than one possible output that violates this this rule of functions it would not be a function now most the time we'll work with functions that are described with equations not in terms of mothers so for example we could have the function y equals x squared plus one this can also be written as f of x equals x squared plus one here f of x is function notation that stands for the output value of y notice that this notation is not representing multiplication we're not multiplying f by x instead we're going to be putting in a value for x as input and getting out a value of f x or y for example if we want to evaluate f of 2 we're plugging in 2 as input for x either in this equation or in that equation since f of 2 means 2 squared plus 1 f of 2 is going to equal 5. similarly f of 5 means i plug in 5 for x so that's going to be 5 squared plus 1 or 26. sometimes it's useful to evaluate a function on a more complicated expression involving other variables in this case remember the function's value on any expression is just when you what you get when you plug in that whole expression for x so f of a plus three is going to be the quantity a plus three squared plus one we could rewrite that as a squared plus six a plus 9 plus 1 or a squared plus 6a plus 10. when evaluating a function on a complex expression it's important to keep the parentheses when you plug in for x that way you evaluate the function on the whole expression for example it would be wrong to write f of a plus 3 equals a plus 3 squared plus 1 without the parentheses because that would imply we were just squaring the 3 and not the whole expression a plus 3. sometimes a function is described with a graph instead of an equation in this example this graph is supposed to represent the function g of x not all graphs actually represent functions for example the graph of a circle doesn't represent a function that's because the graph of a circle violates the vertical line test you can draw a vertical line and it'll intersect the graph in more than one point but our graph at left satisfies the vertical line test any vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point that means it's a function because every x value will have at most one y value that corresponds to it let's evaluate g of two note that two is an x value and we'll use the graph to find the corresponding y value so i look for 2 on the x axis and find the point on the graph that has that x value that's right here now i can look at the y value of that point looks like 3 and therefore g of 2 is equal to 3. if i try to do the same thing to evaluate g of 5 i run into trouble 5 is an x value i look for it on the x axis but there's no point on the graph that has that x value therefore g of 5 is undefined or we can say it does not exist the question of what x values and y values make sense for a function leads us to a discussion of domain and range the domain of a function is all possible x values that make sense for that function the range is the y values that make sense for the function in this example we saw that the x value of 5 didn't have a corresponding y value for this function so the x value of 5 is not in the domain of our function g to find the x values in the domain we have to look at the x values that correspond to points on the graph one way to do that is to take the shadow or projection of the graph onto the xaxis and see what x values are hit it looks like we're hitting all x values starting at negative 8 and continuing up to 4. so our domain is the x's between negative 8 and 4 including those endpoints or we can write this in interval notation as negative 8 comma 4 with square brackets to find the range of the function we look for the y values corresponding to points on this graph we can do that by taking the shadow or projection of the graph onto the y axis we seem to be hitting all y values from negative 5 up through 3 so our range is y is between negative 5 and 3 we're in interval notation negative 5 3 with square brackets if we meet a function that's described as an equation instead of a graph one way to find the domain and range are to graph the function but it's often possible to find the domain at least more quickly by using algebraic considerations we think about what x values it makes sense to plug into this expression and what x values need to be excluded because they make the algebraic expression impossible to evaluate specifically to find the domain of a function we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero since we can't divide by zero we also need to exclude x values that make an expression inside a square root sign negative since we can't take the square root of a negative number in fact we need to exclude values that make an expression inside any even root negative because we can't take an even root of a negative number even though we can take an odd root like a cube root of a negative number later when we look at logarithmic functions we'll have some additional exclusions that we have to make but for now these two principles should handle all functions we'll see so let's apply them to a couple examples for the function in part a we don't have any square root signs but we do have a denominator so we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero in other words we need x squared minus four x plus three to not be equal to zero if we solve x squared minus 4x plus 3 equal to 0 we can do that by factoring and that gives us x equals 3 or x equals 1. so we need to exclude these values all other x values should be fine so if i draw the number line i can put on 1 and 3 and just dig out a hole at both of those and my domain includes everything else on the number line in interval notation this means my domain is everything from negative infinity to 1 together with everything from 1 to 3 together with everything from 3 to infinity in this second example we don't have any denominators to worry about but we do have a square root sign so we need to exclude any x values that make 3 minus 2x less than 0. in other words we can include all x values for which three minus two x is greater than or equal to zero solving that inequality gives us three is greater than or equal to two x in other words x is less than or equal to three halves i can draw this on the number line or write it in interval notation notice that three halves is included and that's because three minus 2x is allowed to be zero i can take the square root of zero it's just zero and that's not a problem finally let's look at a more complicated function that involves both a square root and a denominator now there are two things i need to worry about i need the denominator to not be equal to zero and i need the stuff inside the square root sign to be greater than or equal to zero from our earlier work we know that the first condition means that x is not equal to three and x is not equal to one and the second condition means that x is less than or equal to three halves let's draw both of those conditions on the number line x is not equal to 3 and x is not equal to 1 means we've got everything except those two dugout points and the other condition x is less than or equal to three halves means we can have three halves and everything to the left of it now to be in our domain and to be legit for our function we need both of these conditions to be true so i'm going to connect these conditions with an and and that means we're looking for numbers on the number line that are colored both red and blue so i'll draw that above in purple so that's everything from three halves to one i have to dig out one because one was a problem for the denominator and then i can continue for all the things that are colored both both colors red and blue so my final domain is going to be let's see negative infinity up to but not including one together with one but not including it to three halves and i include three halves since that was colored both red and blue also in this video we talked about functions how to evaluate them and how to find domains and ranges this video gives the graphs of some commonly used functions that i call the toolkit functions the first function is the function y equals x let's plot a few points on the graph of this function if x is 0 y 0 if x is 1 y is 1 and so on y is always equal to x it doesn't have to just be an integer it can be any real number and while connecting the dots we get a straight line through the origin let's look at the graph of y equals x squared if x is zero y is zero so we go through the origin again if x is one y is 1 and if x is negative 1 y is also 1. the x value of 2 gives a y value of 4 and the x value of negative 2 gives a y value of 4 also connecting the dots we get a parabola notice this this function is an even function that means it has mirror symmetry across the yaxis the left side looks like exactly like the mirror image of the right side that happens because when you square a positive number like 2 you get the exact same y value as when you square its mirror image x value of negative two the next function y equals x cubed i'll call that a cubic let's plot a few points when x is zero y is zero when x is one y is one when x is negative 1 y is negative 1. 2 goes with the point 8 way up here and an x value of negative 2 is going to give us negative 8. if i connect the dots i get something that looks kind of like this this function is what's called an odd function because it has 180 degree rotational symmetry acro around the origin if i rotate this whole graph by 180 degrees or in other words turn the paper upside down i'll get exactly the same shape the reason this function has this odd symmetry is because when i cube a positive number and get its y value i get and cube the the corresponding negative number to get its y value the negative number cubed gives us exactly the negative of the the y value we get with cubing the positive number let's look at the next example y equals the square root of x notice that the domain of this function is just x values bigger than or equal to 0 because we can't take the square root of a negative number let's plug in a few x values x is zero gives y zero x is one square root of one is one square root of four is two and connecting the dots i get a function that looks like this the absolute value function is next again if we plug in a few points x is zero goes with y equals zero x is one gives us one the absolute value of negative one is 1. 2 2 is on the graph and the absolute value of negative 2 is 2. i'm ending up getting a vshaped graph it also has even or mirror symmetry y equals 2 to the x is what's known as an exponential function that's because the variable x is in the exponent if i plot a few points two to the zero is one two to the one is two two squared is four two to the minus one is one half i'll plot these on my graph and let me fill in a few more points so let's see 2 cubed is 8 that's way up here and negative 2 gives me 1 4 1 8. connecting the dots i get something that's shaped like this you might have heard the expression exponential growth when talking about for example population growth this is function is represents exponential growth it it grows very very steeply every time we increase the x coordinate by 1 we double the y coordinate we could also look at a function like y equals 3 to the x or sometimes y equals e to the x where e is just a number about 2.7 these functions look very similar it's just the bigger base makes us rise a little more steeply now let's look at the function y equals one over x it's not defined when x is zero but i can plug in x equals one half one over one half is two uh one over one is one and one over two is one half if i connect the dots i get this shape in the first quadrant but i haven't looked at negative values of x when x is negative one over negative one is negative one 1 over negative a half is negative 2 and i get a similar looking piece in the third quadrant this is an example of a hyperbola and it's also an odd function because it has that 180 degree rotational symmetry if i turn the page upside down it'll look exactly the same finally let's look at y equals one over x squared again it's not defined when x is zero but i can plug in points like onehalf for x let's see one over onehalf squared is one over onefourth which is four and one over one squared one over two squared is a fourth it looks pretty much like the previous function is just a little bit more extreme rises a little more steeply falls a little more dramatically but for negative values of x something a little bit different goes on for example 1 over negative 2 squared is just 1 over 4 which is a fourth so i can plot that point there and 1 over negative 1 squared that's just 1. so my curve for negative values of x is going to lie in the second quadrant not the third quadrant this is an example of an even function because it has perfect mirror symmetry across the yaxis these are the toolkit functions and i recommend you memorize the shape of each of them that way you can draw at least a rough sketch very quickly without having to plug in points that's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions if we change the equation of a function then the graph of the function changes or transforms in predictable ways this video gives some rules and examples for transformations of functions to get the most out of this video it's helpful if you're already familiar with the graph of some typical functions i call them toolkit functions like y equals square root of x y equals x squared y equals the absolute value of x and so on if you're not familiar with those graphs i encourage you to watch my video called toolkit functions first before watching this one i want to start by reviewing function notation if g of x represents the function the square root of x then we can rewrite these expressions in terms of square roots for example g of x minus 2 is the same thing as the square root of x minus 2. g of quantity x minus 2 means we plug in x minus 2 everywhere we see an x so that would be the same thing as the square root of quantity x minus 2. in this second example i say that we're subtracting 2 on the inside of the function because we're subtracting 2 before we apply the square root function whereas on the first example i say that the minus 2 is on the outside of the function we're doing the square root function first and then subtracting 2. in this third example g of 3x we're multiplying by 3 on the inside of the function to evaluate this in terms of square root we plug in the entire 3x for x in the square root function that gives us the square root of 3x in the next example we're multiplying by 3 on the outside of the function this is just 3 times the square root of x finally g of minus x means the square root of minus x this might look a little odd because we're not used to taking the square root of a negative number but remember that if x itself is negative like negative 2 then negative x will be negative negative 2 or positive 2 so we'll really be taking the square root of a positive number in that case let me record which of these are inside and which of these are outside of my function in this next set of examples we're using the same function g of x squared of x but this time we're starting with an expression with square roots in it and trying to write it in terms of g of x so the first example the plus 17 is on the outside of my function because i'm taking the square root of x first and then adding 17. so i can write this as g of x plus 17. in the second example i'm taking x and adding 12 first then i take the square root of the whole thing since i'm adding the 12 to x first that's on the inside of my function so i write that as g of the quantity x plus 12. remember that this notation means i plug in the entire x plus 12 into the square root sign which gives me exactly square root of x plus 12. in this next example i'm doing the square root first and then multiplying by negative 36. so my minus 36 multiplication is outside my function i can rewrite this as minus 36 times g of x finally in this last example i take x multiply by a fourth and then apply the square root of x so that's the same thing as g of onefourth x my onefourth x is on the inside of my function in other words it's inside the parentheses when i use function notation let's graph the square root of x and two transformations of this function y equals the square root of x goes through the points 0 0 1 1 and 4 2 since the square root of 4 is 2 and looks something like this in order to graph y equals the square root of x minus 2 notice that the minus 2 is on the outside of the function that means we're going to take the square root of x first and then subtract 2. so for example if we start with the x value of 0 and compute the square root of 0 that's 0 then we subtract 2 to give us a y value of negative 2. an x value of 1 which under the square root function had a y value of 1 now has a y value that's decreased by 2. one minus two is negative one and finally an x value of four which under the square root function had a y value of two now has a y value of two minus two or zero its y value was also decreased by two if i plot these new points zero goes with negative two one goes with negative one and four goes with zero i have my transformed graph because i subtracted two on the outside of my function my y values were decreased by two which brought my graph down by two units next let's look at y equals the square root of quantity x minus two now we're subtracting 2 on the inside of our function which means we subtract 2 from x first and then take the square root in order to get the same y value of 0 as we had in our blue graph we need our x minus 2 to be 0 so we need our original x to be 2. in order to get the y value of 1 that we had in our blue graph we need to be taking the square root of 1. so we need x minus 2 to be 1 which means that we need to start with an x value of 3. and in order to reproduce our y value of 2 from our original graph we need the square root of x minus 2 to be 2 which means we need to start out by taking the square root of 4 which means our x minus 2 is 4 so our x should be up there at 6. if i plot my x values with my corresponding y values of square root of x minus 2 i get the following graph notice that the graph has moved horizontally to the right by two units to me moving down by two units makes sense because we're subtracting two so we're decreasing y's by two units but the minus two on the inside that kind of does the opposite of what i expect i might expect it to to move the graph left i might expect the x values to be going down by two units but instead it moves the graph to the right because the x units have to go up by two units in order to get the right square root when i then subtract two units again the observations we made for these transformations of functions hold in general according to the following rules first of all numbers on the outside of the function like in our example y equals the square root of x minus 2 those numbers affect the y values and result in vertical motions like we saw these motions are in the direction you expect so subtracting 2 moves us down by 2 if we were adding 2 instead that would move us up by 2. numbers on the inside of the function that's like our example y equals the square root of quantity x minus 2. those affect the x values and result in a horizontal motion these motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect remember the minus 2 on the inside actually shifted our graph to the right if it had a plus 2 on the inside that would actually shift our graph to the left adding results in a shift those are called translations but multiplying like something like y equals 3 times the square root of x that would result in a stretch or shrink in other words if i start with the square root of x and then want to graph y equals 3 times the square root of x that stretches my graph vertically by a factor of 3 like this if i want to graph y equals onethird times the square root of x that shrinks my graph vertically by a factor of onethird finally a negative sign results in reflection for example if i start with a graph of y equals the square root of x and then want to graph y equals the square root of negative x that's going to do a reflection in the horizontal direction because the negative is on the inside of the square root sign a reflection in the horizontal direction means a reflection across the yaxis if instead i want to graph y equals negative the square root of x that negative sign on the outside means a vertical reflection a reflection across the xaxis pause the video for a moment and see if you can describe what happens in these four transformations in the first example we're subtracting 4 on the outside of the function adding and subtracting means a translation or shift and since we're on the outside of the function it affects the y values that's moving us vertically so this transformation should take the square root of graph and move it down by 4 units that would look something like this in the next example we're adding 12 on the inside that's still a translation but now we're moving horizontally and so since we go the opposite direction we expect we are going to go to the left by 12 units that's going to look something like this in the next example we're multiplying by 3 and introducing a negative sign both on the outside of our function outside our function means we're affecting the y values so and multiplication means we're stretching by a factor of 3. the negative sign means we reflect in the vertical direction here's stretching by a factor of 3 vertically before i apply the minus sign and now the minus sign reflects in the vertical direction finally in this last example we're multiplying by one quarter on the inside of our function we know that multiplication means stretch or shrink and since we're on the inside it's a horizontal motion and it does the opposite of what we expect so instead of shrinking by a factor of onefourth horizontally it's actually going to stretch by the reciprocal a factor of four horizontally that'll look something like this notice that stretching horizontally by a factor of 4 looks kind of like shrinking vertically by a factor of one half and that's actually borne out by the algebra because the square root of 1 4 x is the same thing as the square root of 1 4 times the square root of x which is the same thing as onehalf times the square root of x and so now we can see algebraically that a vertical shrink by a factor of onehalf is the same as a horizontal stretch by a factor of at least for this function the square root function this video gave some rules for transformations of functions which i'll repeat below numbers on the outside correspond to changes in the y values or vertical motions numbers on the inside of the function affect the x values and result in horizontal motions adding and subtracting corresponds to translations or shifts multiplying and dividing by numbers corresponds to stretches and shrinks and putting in a negative sign corresponds to a reflection a horizontal reflection if the negative sign is on the inside and a vertical reflection if the negative sign is on the outside knowing these basic rules about transformations empowers you to be able to sketch graphs of much more complicated functions like y equals 3 times the square root of x plus 2 by simply considering the transformations one at a time a quadratic function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals a x squared plus b x plus c where a b and c are real numbers and a is not equal to zero the reason we require that a is not equal to zero is because if a were equal to zero we'd have f of x is equal to b x plus c which is called a linear function so by making sure that a is not zero we make sure there's really an x squared term which is the hallmark of a quadratic function please pause the video for a moment and decide which of these equations represent quadratic functions the first function can definitely be written in the form g of x equals a x squared plus b x plus c in fact it's already written in that form where a is negative 5 b is 10 and c is 3. the second equation is also a quadratic function because we can think of it as f of x equals one times x squared plus zero times x plus zero so it is in the right form where a is one b is zero and c is zero it's perfectly fine for the coefficient of x and the constant term to be zero for a quadratic function we just need the coefficient of x squared to be nonzero so the x squared term is preserved the third equation is not a quadratic function it's a linear function because there's no x squared term the fourth function might not look like a quadratic function but if we rewrite it by expanding out the x minus 3 squared let's see what happens we get y equals 2 times x minus 3 times x minus 3 plus 4 so that's 2 times x squared minus 3x minus 3x plus 9 plus 4. continuing i get 2 x squared minus 12 x's plus 18 plus 4 in other words y equals 2x squared minus 12x plus 22 so in fact our function can be written in the right form and it is a quadratic function a function that is already written in the form y equals ax squared plus bx plus c is said to be in standard form so our first example g of x is in standard form a function that's written in the format of the last function that is in the form of y equals a times x minus h squared plus k for some numbers a h and k that's said to be in vertex form i'll talk more about standard form and vertex form in another video in this video we identified some quadratic functions and talked about the difference between standard form and vertex form this video is about graphing quadratic functions a quadratic function which is typically written in standard form like this or sometimes in vertex form like this always has the graph that looks like a parabola this video will show how to tell whether the parabola is pointing up or down how to find its xintercept and how to find its vertex the barebones basic quadratic function is f of x equals x squared it goes to the origin since f of zero is zero squared which is zero and it is a parabola pointing upwards like this the vertex of a parabola is its lowest point if it's pointing upwards and its highest point if it's pointing downwards so in this case the vertex is at 0 0. the xintercepts are where the graph crosses the xaxis in other words where y is zero and in this function y equals zero means that x squared is zero which happens only when x is zero so the xintercept there's only one of them is also zero this second function y equals negative three x squared also goes through the origin since the function's value when x is zero is y equals zero but in this case the parabola is pointing downwards that's because thinking about transformations of functions a negative sign on the outside reflects the function vertically over the xaxis making the parabola instead of pointing upwards reflecting the point downwards the number three on the outside stretches the graph vertically by a factor of three so it makes it kind of long and skinny like this in general a negative coefficient to the x squared term means the parabola will be pointing down whereas a positive coefficient like here the coefficient's 1 means the parabola is pointing up i'll write that rule over here so if a is bigger than 0 the parabola opens up and if the value of the coefficient a is less than zero then the parabola opens down in this second example we can see again that the vertex is at zero zero and the x intercept is x equals zero let's look at this third example if we multiplied our expression out we'd see that the coefficient of x squared would be 2 a positive number so that means our parabola is going to be opening up but the vertex of this parabola will no longer be at the origin in fact we can find the parabolas vertex by thinking about transformations of functions our function is related to the function y equals 2x squared by moving it to the right by 3 and up by 4. since y equals 2x squared has a vertex at 0 0 if we move that whole parabola including the vertex right by three and up by four the vertex will end up at the point three four so a parabola will look something like this notice how easy it was to just read off the vertex when our quadratic function is written in this form in fact any parabola any quadratic function written in the form a times x minus h squared plus k has a vertex at h k by the same reasoning we're moving the parabola with a vertex at the origin to the right by h and by k that's why this form of a quadratic function is called the vertex form notice that this parabola has no xintercepts because it does not cross the xaxis for our final function we have g of x equals 5x squared plus 10x plus 3. we know the graph of this function will be a parabola pointing upwards because the coefficient of x squared is positive to find the xintercepts we can set y equals zero since the xintercepts is where our graph crosses the xaxis and that's where the yvalue is zero so 0 equals 5x squared plus 10x plus 3 i'm going to use the quadratic formula to solve that so x is negative 10 plus or minus the square root of 10 squared minus 4 times 5 times 3 all over 2 times 5. that simplifies to x equals negative 10 plus or minus the square root of 40 over 10 which simplifies further to x equals negative 10 over 10 plus or minus the square root of 40 over 10 which is negative 1 plus or minus 2 square root of 10 over 10 or negative 1 plus or minus square root of 10 over 5. since the square root of 10 is just a little bit bigger than 3 this works out to approximately about negative twofifths and negative eightfifths so somewhere around right here so our parabola is going to look something like this notice that it goes through crosses the xaxis at y equals 3 that's because when we plug in x equals 0 into here we get y equal 3. so the yintercept is at 3. finally we can find the vertex since this function is written in standard form the y equals ax plus x squared plus bx plus c form and not in vertex form we can't just read off the vertex like we could before but there's a trick called the vertex formula which says that whenever you have a function in a quadratic function in standard form the vertex has an x coordinate of negative b over 2a so in this case that's an x coordinate of negative 10 over 2 times 5 or negative 1 which is kind of like where i put it on the graph to find the y coordinate of that vertex i can just plug in negative 1 into my equation for x which gives me y equals 5 times negative 1 squared plus 10 times negative 1 plus 3 which is negative 2. so i think i better redraw my graph a little bit to put that vertex down at a y coordinate of negative 2 where it's supposed to be let's summarize the steps we use to graph these quadratic functions first of all the graph of a quadratic function has the shape of a parabola the parabola opens up if the coefficient of x squared which we call a is greater than zero and down if a is less than zero to find the x intercepts we set y equal to zero or in other words f of x equal to zero and solve for x to find the vertex we can either read it off as h k if our function is in vertex form or we can use the vertex formula and get the x coordinate of the vertex to be negative b over 2a if our function is in standard form to find the ycoordinate of the vertex in this case we just plug in the xcoordinate and figure out what y is finally we can always find additional points on the graph by plugging in values of x in this video we learned some tricks for graphing quadratic functions in particular we saw that the vertex can be read off as h k if our function is written in vertex form and the x coordinate of the vertex can be calculated as negative b over 2a if our function is in a standard form for an explanation of why this vertex formula works please see it in my other video a quadratic in standard form looks like y equals a x squared plus b x plus c where a b and c are real numbers and a is not zero a quadratic function in vertex form looks like y equals a times x minus h squared plus k where a h and k are real numbers and a is not zero when a function's in vertex form it's easy to read off the vertex it's just the ordered pair h k this video explains how to get from vertex form to standard form and vice versa let's start by converting this quadratic function from vertex form to standard form that's pretty straightforward we just have to distribute out so if i multiply out the x minus 3 squared i get minus 4 times x squared minus 6x plus 9 plus 1. distributing the negative 4 i get negative 4x squared plus 24x minus 36 plus 1 so that works out to minus 4x squared plus 24x minus 35 and i have my quadratic function now in standard form now let's go the other direction and convert a quadratic function that's already in standard form into vertex form that is we want to put it in the form of g of x equals a times x minus h squared plus k where the vertex is at h k to do this it's handy to use the vertex formula the vertex formula says that the x coordinate of the vertex is given by negative b over 2a where a is the coefficient of x squared and b is the coefficient of x so in this case we get an x coordinate of negative 8 over 2 times 2 or negative 2. to find the ycoordinate of the vertex we just plug in the xcoordinate into our formula for g of x so that's g of negative 2 which is 2 times negative 2 squared plus 8 times negative 2 plus 6 and that works out to be negative 2 by coincidence so the vertex for our quadratic function has coordinates negative 2 negative 2. and if i want to write g of x in vertex form it's going to be a times x minus negative 2 squared plus minus 2 that's because remember we subtract h and we add k so that simplifies to g of x equals a times x plus 2 squared minus 2 and finally we just need to figure out what this leading coefficient a is but notice if we were to multiply distribute this out then the coefficient of x squared would end up being a so therefore the coefficient of x squared here which is a has to be the same as the coefficient of x squared here which we can immediately also call a in other words our a down here needs to be 2. so i'm going to write that as g of x equals 2 times x plus 2 squared minus 2 lots of twos in this problem and that's our quadratic function in vertex form if i want to check my answer of course i could just distribute out again i'd get 2 times x squared plus 4x plus 2 minus 2 in other words 2x squared plus 8x plus 6 which checks out to exactly what i started with this video showed how to get from vertex form to standard form by distributing out and how to get from standard form to vertex form by finding the vertex using the vertex formula suppose you have a quadratic function in the form y equals ax squared plus bx plus c and you want to find where the vertex is when you graph it the vertex formula says that the xcoordinate of this vertex is at negative b over 2a this video gives a justification for where that formula comes from let's start with a specific example suppose i wanted to find the xintercepts and the vertex for this quadratic function to find the xintercepts i would set y equal to zero and solve for x so that's zero equals three x squared plus seven x minus five and to solve for x i use the quadratic formula so x is gonna be negative seven plus or minus the square root of seven squared minus four times three times negative five all over two times three that simplifies to negative seven a plus or minus the square root of a hundred and nine over six we could i could also write this as negative seven sixth plus the square root of a hundred and nine over six or x equals negative seven six minus the square root of 109 over six since the square root of a hundred and nine is just a little bit bigger than ten this can be approximated by negative seven sixths plus ten sixths and negative seven sixth minus ten sixths 6. so pretty close to i guess about what half over here and pretty close to about negative 3 over here i'm just going to estimate so that i can draw a picture of the function since the leading coefficient 3 is positive i know my parabola is going to be opening up and the intercepts are somewhere around here and here so roughly speaking it's going to look something like this now the vertex is going to be somewhere in between the two xintercepts in fact it's going to be by symmetry it'll be exactly halfway in between the two xintercepts since the xintercepts are negative 7 6 plus and minus 100 square root of 109 over 6 the number halfway in between those is going to be exactly negative 7 6 right because on the one hand i have negative 7 6 plus something and on the other hand i have negative 7 6 minus that same thing so negative 7 6 will be exactly in the middle so my x coordinate of my vertex will be at negative 7 6. notice that i got that number from the quadratic formula more generally if i want to find the xintercepts for any quadratic function i set y equal to 0 and solve for x using the quadratic formula negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a the xintercepts will be at these two values but the xcoordinate of the vertex which is exactly halfway in between the two xintercepts will be at negative b over 2a that's where the vertex formula comes from and it turns out that this formula works even when there are no xintercepts even when the the quadratic formula gives us no solutions the vertex still has the x coordinate negative b over 2a and that's the justification of the vertex formula this video is about polynomials and their graphs recall that a polynomial is a function like this one for example whose terms are numbers times powers of x i'll start with some definitions the degree of a polynomial is the largest exponent for example for this polynomial the degree is four the leading term is the term with the largest exponent in the same example the leading term is 5x to the fourth it's conventional to write the polynomial in descending order of powers of x so the leading term is first but the leading term doesn't have to be the first term if i wrote this same polynomial as y equals say 2 minus 17x minus 21x cubed plus 5x4 the leading term would still be the 5x to the fourth even though it was last the leading coefficient is the number in the leading term in this example the leading coefficient is 5. finally the constant term is the term with no x's in it in our same example the constant term is 2. please pause the video for a moment and take a look at this next example of polynomial figure out what's the degree the leading term the leading coefficient and the constant term the degree is again four since that's the highest power we have and the leading term is negative seven x to the fourth the leading coefficient is negative 7 and the constant term is 18. in the graph of the polynomial shown here the three marked points are called turning points because the polynomial turns around and changes direction at those three points those same points can also be called local extreme points or they can be called local maximum and minimum points for this polynomial the degree is 4 and the number of turning points is 3. let's compare the degree and the number of turning points for these next three examples for the first one the degree is two and there's one turning point for the second example the degree is three and there's two turning points and for this last example the degree is four and there's one turning point for this first example and the next two the number of turning points is exactly one less than the degree so you might conjecture that this is always true but in fact this is not always true in this last example the degree is four but the number of turning points is one not three in fact it turns out that while the number of turning points is not always equal to the degree minus one it is always less than or equal to the degree minus one that's a useful fact to remember when you're sketching graphs or recognizing graphs of polynomials the end behavior of a function is how the ends of the function look as x gets bigger and bigger heads towards infinity or x gets goes through larger and larger negative numbers towards negative infinity in this first example the graph of the function goes down as x gets towards infinity as x goes towards negative infinity i can draw this with two little arrows pointing down on either side or i can say in words that the function is falling as we head left and falling also as we head right in this second example the graph rises to the left and rises to the right in the third example the graph falls to the left but rises to the right and in the fourth example it rises to the left and falls to the right if you study these examples and others you might notice there's a relationship between the degree of the polynomial the leading coefficients of the polynomials and the end behavior specifically these four types of end behavior are determined by whether the degree is even or odd and by whether the leading coefficient is positive or negative the degree is even and the leading coefficient is positive like in this example where the leading coefficient is one we have this sorts of end behavior rising on both sides when the degree is even and the leading coefficient is negative like in this example we have the end behavior that's falling on both that sides when the degree is odd and the leading coefficient is positive that's like this example with the degree 3 and a leading coefficient 3 then we have this sort of end behavior and finally when the degree is odd and the leading coefficient is negative like in this example we have this sort of end behavior i like to remember this chart just by thinking of the most simple examples y equals x squared y equals negative x squared y equals x cubed and y equals negative x cubed because i know by heart what those four examples look like then i just have to remember that any polynomial with a even degree and positive leading coefficient has the same end behavior as x squared and similarly any polynomial with even degree and negative leading coefficient has the same end behavior as negative x squared and similar statements for x cubed and negative x cubed we can use facts about turning points and end behavior to say something about the equation of a polynomial just by looking at its graph in this example because of the end behavior we know that the degree is odd we know that the leading coefficient must be positive and finally since there are one two three four turning points we know that the degree is greater than or equal to five that's because the number of turning points is less than or equal to the degree minus 1 and in this case the number of turning points we said was 4 and so solving that inequality we get the degree is big or equal to 5. putting some of that information together we see the degree could be 5 or 7 or 9 or any odd number greater than or equal to 5 but it couldn't be for example 3 or 6 because even numbers and and also numbers less than 5 are right out this video gave a lot of definitions including the definition of degree leading coefficients turning points and end behavior we saw that knowing the degree and the leading coefficient can help you make predictions about the number of turning points and the end behavior as well as vice versa this video is about exponential functions and their graphs an exponential function is a function that can be written in the form f of x equals a times b to the x where a and b are any real numbers as long as a is not 0 and b is positive it's important to notice that for an exponential function the variable x is in the exponent this is different from many other functions we've seen for example a quadratic function like f of x equals 3x squared has the variable in the base so it's not an exponential function for exponential functions f of x equals a times b to the x we require that a is not equal to zero because otherwise we would have f of x equals zero times b to the x which just means that f of x equals zero and this is called a constant function not an exponential function because f x is always equal to zero in an exponential function we require that b is bigger than zero because otherwise for example if b is equal to negative 1 say we'd have f of x equals a times negative 1 to the x now this would make sense for a lot of values of x but if we tried to do something like f of onehalf with our b's negative one that would be the same thing as a times the square root of negative one which is not a real number we'd get the same problem for other values of b if the values of b were negative and if we tried b equals zero we'd get a kind of ridiculous thing a times zero to the x which again is always zero so that wouldn't count as an exponential either so we can't use any negative bases and we can't use zero bases if we want an exponential function the number a in the expression f of x equals a times b to the x is called the initial value and the number b is called the base the phrase initial value comes from the fact that if we plug in x equals zero we get a times b to the 0 well anything to the 0 is just 1 so this is equal to a in other words f of 0 equals a so if we think of starting out when x equals 0 we get the y value of a that's why it's called the initial value let's start out with this example where y equals a times b to the x an exponential function and we've set a equal to one and b equals a two notice that the yintercept the value when x is zero is going to be one if i change my a value my initial value the yintercept changes the function is stretched out if i make the value of a go to 0 and then negative then my initial value becomes negative and my graph flips across the x axis let's go back to an a value of say 1 and see what happens when we change b right now the b value the base is two if i increase b my yintercept sticks at one but my graph becomes steeper and steeper if i put b back down close to 1 my graph becomes more flat at exactly 1 my graph is just a constant as b gets into fractional territory point eight point seven point six my graph starts to slope the other way it's decreasing now instead of increasing but notice that the yintercept still hasn't changed i can get it more and more steep as my b gets farther and farther away from one of course when b goes to negative territory my graph doesn't make any sense so a changes the yintercept and b changes the steepness of the graph so that it's and whether it's increasing for b values bigger than one and decreasing for values of b less than one we'll summarize all these observations on the next slide we've seen that for an exponential function y equals a times b to the x the parameter or number a gives the yintercept the parameter b tells us how the graph is increasing or decreasing specifically if b is greater than one the graph is increasing and if b is less than one the graph is decreasing the closer b is to the number one the flatter the graph so for example if i were to graph y equals 0.25 to the x and y equals 0.4 to the x they would both be decreasing graphs since the base for both of them is less than 1 but 0.25 is farther away from 1 and .4 is closer to 1 so 0.4 is going to be flatter and 0.25 is going to be more steep so in this picture this red graph would correspond to 0.25 to the x and the blue graph would correspond to 0.4 to the x for all these exponential functions whether the graphs are decreasing or increasing they all have a horizontal asymptote along the xaxis in other words at the line y equals zero the domain is always from negative infinity to infinity and the range is always from 0 to infinity because the range is always positive y values actually that's true if a is greater than 0. if a is less than 0 then our graph flips over the xaxis our domain stays the same but our range becomes negative infinity to zero the most famous exponential function is f of x equals e to the x this function's also sometimes written as f of x equals x of x the number e is euler's number it's approximately 2.7 this function has important applications to calculus and to some compound interest problems in this video we looked at exponential functions functions of the form a times b to the x where the variable is in the exponent we saw that they all have the same general shape either increasing like this or decreasing like this unless a is negative in which case they flip over the xaxis they all have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero the xaxis in this video we'll use exponential functions to model realworld examples let's suppose you're hired for a job the starting salary is forty thousand dollars with a guaranteed annual raise of three percent each year how much will your salary be after one year two years five years and in general after t years let me chart out the information the left column will be the number of years since you're hired and the right column will be your salary when you start work that's zero years after you're hired your salary will be forty thousand dollars after one year you'll have gotten a three percent raise so your salary will be the original forty thousand plus three percent of forty thousand point 0.03 times 40 000. i can think of this first number as one times 40 000 and i can factor out the 40 000 from both terms to get forty thousand times one plus zero point zero three let me rewrite this as forty thousand times one point oh three this is your original salary multiplied by a growth factor of 1.03 after two years you'll get a three percent raise from your previous year salary your previous year's salary was 40 000 times 1.03 but you'll add 3 of that again i can think of the first number as 1 times 40 000 times 1.03 and i can factor out the common factor of 40 000 times 1.03 from both terms to get 40 000 times 1.03 times 1 plus 0.03 let me rewrite that as 40 000 times 1.03 times 1.03 or 40 000 times 1.03 squared we can think of this as your last year's salary multiplied by the same growth factor of 1.03 after three years a similar computation will give you that your new salary is your previous year's salary times that growth factor of 1.03 that can be written as 40 000 times 1.03 cubed and in general if you're noticing the pattern after t years your salary should be 40 000 times 1.03 to the t power in other words your salary after t years is your original salary multiplied by the growth factor of 1.03 taken to the t power let me write this as a formula s of t where s of t is your salary is equal to 40 000 times 1.03 to the t this is an exponential function that is a function of the form a times b to the t where your initial value a is 40 000 and your base b is 1.03 notice that your base is the amount that your salary gets multiplied by each year given this formula we can easily figure out what your salary will be after for example five years by plugging in five for t i worked that out on my calculator to be forty six thousand three hundred seventy dollars and ninety six cents to the nearest cent exponential functions are also useful in modeling population growth the united nations estimated that the world population in 2010 was 6.79 billion growing at a rate of 1.1 percent per year assuming that the growth rate stayed the same and will continue to stay the same we'll write an equation for the population at t years after the year 2010. 1.1 percent written as a decimal is 0.011 so if we work out a chart as before we see that after zero years since 2010 we have our initial population 6.79 billion after one year we'll take that 6.79 billion and add 1.1 percent of it that is 0.011 times 6.79 this works out to 6.79 times 1 plus 0.011 or 6.79 times 1.011 here we have our initial population of 6.79 billion and our growth factor of 1.011 that's how much the population got multiplied by in one year as before we can work out that after two years our population becomes 6.79 times 1.011 squared since it got multiplied by 1.011 twice and after t years it'll be 6.79 times 1.011 to the t power so our function that models population is going to be 6.79 times 1.011 to the t here t represents time in years since 2010. just for fun i'll plug in t equals 40. that's 40 years since 2010 so that's the year 2050 and i get 6.79 times 1.011 to the 40th power which works out to 10.5 billion that's the prediction based on this exponential model the previous two examples were examples of exponential growth this last example is an example of exponential decay the drug seroquel is metabolized and eliminated from the body at a rate of 11 percent per hour if 400 milligrams are given how much remains in the body 24 hours later i'll chart out my information where the left column will be time in hours since the dose was given and the right column will be the number of milligrams of seroquel still in the body zero hours after the dose is given we have the full 400 milligrams in the body one hour later we have the 400 milligrams minus 11 percent of it that's minus 0.11 times 400. if i factor out the 400 from both terms i get 400 times 1 minus 0.11 or 400 times 0.89 the 400 represents the initial amount the 0.89 i'll call the growth factor even though in this case the quantity is decreasing not growing so really it's kind of a shrink factor let's see what happens after two hours now i'll have 400 times 0.89 my previous amount it'll again get multiplied by 0.89 so that's going to be 400 times 0.89 squared and in general after t hours i'll have 400 multiplied by this growth or shrinkage factor of 0.89 raised to the t power since each hour the amount of seroquel gets multiplied by .89 that number less than one i'll write my exponential decay function as f of t equals 400 times 0.89 to the t where f of t represents the number of milligrams of seroquel in the body and t represents the number of hours since the dose was given to find out how much is in the body after 24 hours i just plug in 24 for t this works out to about 24.4 milligrams i hope you noticed the common form for the functions used to model all three of these examples the functions were always in the form f of t equals a times b to the t where a represented the initial amount and b represented the growth factor to find the growth factor b we started with the percent increase or decrease we wrote it as a decimal and then we either added it or subtracted it from one depending on whether the quantity was increasing or decreasing let me show you that as a couple examples in the first example we had a percent increase of 3 percent on the raise as a decimal i'll call this r this was 0.03 and to get the growth factor we added that to 1 to get 1.03 in the world population example we had a 1.1 percent increase we wrote this as 0.011 and added it to 1 to get 1.011 in the drug example we had a decrease of 11 we wrote that as a decimal and we subtracted the 0.11 from 1 to get 0.89 in fact you can always write the growth factor b as one plus the percent change written as a decimal if you're careful to make that percent change negative when the quantity is decreasing and positive when the quantity is increasing since here 1 plus negative 0.11 gives us the correct growth factor of 0.89 which is less than 1. as a good check remember that if your quantity is increasing the base b should be bigger than 1 and if the quantity is decreasing then b should be less than 1. exponential functions can also be used to model bank accounts and loans with compound interest as we'll see in another video this video is about interpreting exponential functions an antique car is worth fifty thousand dollars now and its value increases by seven percent each year let's write an equation to model its value x years from now after one year its value is the fifty thousand plus 0.07 times the 50 000. that's because its value has grown by seven percent or 0.07 times 50 000. this can be written as 50 000 times 1 plus 0.07 notice that adding 7 percent to the original value is the same as multiplying the original value by 1 plus .07 or by 1.07 after two years the value will be 50 000 times 1 plus 0.07 squared or 50 000 times 1.07 squared that's because the previous year's value is multiplied again by 1.07 and in general after x years v of x the antique car's value will be 50 000 times 1.07 to the x that's because the original value of 50 000 gets multiplied by 1.07 x times one time for each year if we dissect this equation we see that the number of 50 000 comes from the original value of the car the 1.07 which i call the growth factor comes from 1 plus 0.707 the 0.07 being the the percent increase written as a decimal so the form of this equation is an exponential equation v of x equals a times b to the x where a is the initial value and b is the growth vector but we could also write this as a times 1 plus r to the x where a is still the initial value but r is the percent increase written as a decimal this same equation will come up in the next example here my toyota prius is worth only 3000 now and its value is decreasing by five percent each year so after one year its value will be three thousand minus zero point zero five times three thousand that is three thousand times one minus zero point zero five i can also write that as three thousand times zero point nine five decreasing the value by five percent is like multiplying the value by one minus 0.05 or by 0.95 after two years the value will be multiplied by 0.95 again so the value will be 3000 times 0.95 squared and after x years the value will be 3000 times 0.95 to the x so my equation for the value is 3000 times 0.95 to the x this is again an equation of the form v of x equals a times b to the x where here a is 3000 the initial value and b is 0.95 i'll still call that the growth factor even though we're actually declining in value not growing now remember where this .95 came from it came from taking 1 and subtracting 0.05 because of the 5 percent decrease in value so i can again write my equation in the form a times well this time times 1 minus r to the x where r is our .05 that's our percent decrease written as a decimal please take a moment to study this equation and the previous one these say that when you have an exponential function the number here is the initial value if it's written in this form b is your growth factor but you can think of b as being either one minus r where r is the percent decrease or one plus r where r is the percent increase in this example we're given a function f of x to model the number of bacteria in a petri dish x hours after 12 o'clock noon we want to know what was the number of bacteria at noon and by what percent the number of bacteria is increasing every hour we can see from the equation that the number of bacteria is increasing and not decreasing because the base of the exponential function 1.45 is bigger than 1. notice that our equation f of x equals 12 times 1.45 to the x has the form of a times b to the x or we can think of it as a times 1 plus r to the x here a is 12 b is 1.45 and r is 0.45 based on this familiar form we can recognize that the initial amount of bacteria is going to be 12. 12 000 since those are our units and this value 1.45 is our growth factor what the number of bacteria is multiplied by each hour while r the 0.45 is the the the rate of increase in other words a 45 percent increase each hour so our answers to the questions are 12 000 and 45 percent in this example the population of salamanders is modeled by this exponential function where x is the number of years since 2015. notice that the number of salamanders is decreasing because the base of our exponential function 0.78 is less than 1. so if we recognize the form of our exponential function a times b to the x or we can think of this as a times 1 minus r to the x where a is our initial value and r is our percent decrease written as a decimal our initial value is three thousand so that's the number of salamanders 0 years after 2015. our growth factor b is 0.78 but if i write that as 1 minus r i see that r has to be 1 minus 0.78 or 0.22 in other words our population is decreasing by 22 percent each year in this video we saw that exponential functions can be written in the form f of x equals a times b to the x where a is the initial value and b is the growth factor we also saw that they can be written in the form a times 1 plus r to the x when the amount is increasing and as a times 1 minus r to the x when the amount is decreasing in this format r is the percent increase or the percent decrease written as a decimal so a 15 increase will be an r value of 0.15 and a growth factor b of 1.15 whereas a 12 decrease will be an r value of 0.12 and a b value of 1 minus 0.12 or 0.7 sorry 0.88 these observations help us quickly interpret exponential functions for example here we have an initial value of 100 and a 15 percent increase and here we have an initial value of 50 and a 40 percent decrease exponential functions can be used to model compound interest for loans and bank accounts suppose you invest two hundred dollars in a bank account that earns three percent interest every year if you make no deposits or withdrawals how much money will you have accumulated after 10 years because 3 percent of the money that's in the bank is getting added each year the money in the bank gets multiplied by 1.03 each year so after one year the amount will be 200 times 1.03 after two years 200 times 1.03 squared and and after t years 200 times 1.03 to the t power so the function modeling the amount of money i'll call it p of t is given by 200 times 1.03 to the t more generally if you invest a dollars at an annual interest rate of r for t years in the end you'll have p of t equals a times 1 plus r to the t here r needs to be written as a decimal so 0.03 in our example for the 3 percent annual interest rate going back to our specific example after 10 years the amount of money is going to be p of 10 which is 200 times 1.03 to the 10 which works out to 268 dollars and 78 cents to the nearest cent in this problem we've assumed that the interest accumulates once per year but in the next few examples we'll see what happens when the interest rate accumulates more frequently twice a year or every month for example let's deposit three hundred dollars in an account that earns 4.5 percent annual interest compounded semiannually this means two times a year or every six months a 4.5 percent annual interest rate compounded two times a year means that we're actually getting 4.5 over 2 percent interest every time the interest is compounded that is every 6 months that's 2.25 percent interest every half a year note that 2.25 percent is the same as 0.0225 as a decimal so every time we earn interest our money gets multiplied by 1.0225 let me make a chart of what happens after zero years which is also zero half years we have our original three hundred dollars after half a year that's one half year our money gets earns interest one time so we multiply the 300 by 1.08 after one year that's two half years our money earns interest two times so we multiply 300 by 1.0225 squared continuing this way after 1.5 years that's three half years we have 300 times 1.0225 cubed and after two years or four half years we have 300 times 1.0225 to the fourth in general after t years which is 2t half years our money will grow to 300 times 1.02 to the 2t power because we've compounded interest 2t times our formula for our amount of money is p of t equals 300 times 1.02 to the 2t where t is the number of years to finish the problem after 7 years we'll have p of 7 which is 300 times 1.0225 to the 2 times 7 or 14 power and that works out to 409 dollars and 65 cents to the nearest cent in this next example we're gonna take out a loan for a thousand two hundred dollars at an annual interest rate of six percent compounded monthly although loans and bank accounts might feel different they're mathematically the same it's like from the bank's point of view they're investing money in you and getting interest on their money from you so we can work them out with the same kind of math six percent annual interest rate compounded monthly means you're compounding 12 times a year so each time you compound interest you're just going to get 6 over twelve percent interest that's point five percent interest and as a decimal that's zero point zero zero five let's chart out again what happens times zero of course you'll have the original loan amount of 1200 after one year that's 12 months your loan has had interest headed to it 12 times so it gets multiplied by 1.005 to the 12th after 2 years that's 24 months it's had interest added to it 24 times so it gets multiplied by 1.005 to the 24th power similarly after 3 years or 36 months your loan amount will be 1200 times 1.005 to the 36th power and in general after t years that's 12 t months so the interest will be compounded 12 t times and so we have to raise the 1.005 to the 12 t power this gives us the general formula for the money owed is p of t equals 1 200 times 1.005 to the 12 t where t is the number of years in particular after three years we'll have to pay back a total of 1200 times 1.005 to the 12 times 3 or 36 power which works out to 1436 dollars and two cents to the nearest cent these last two problems follow a general pattern if a is the initial amount of the loan or bank account and r is the annual interest rate compounded n times per year then our formula for the amount of money is going to be a times 1 plus r over n to the nt this formula exactly matches what we did in this problem first we took the interest rate r which was six percent and divided it by the number of compounding periods each year 12. we wrote that as a decimal and added one to it that's where we got the 1.005 from we raise this to not to the number of years but to 12 times the number of years that's the number of compounding periods per year times the number of years and we multiplied all that by the initial amount of money which was 1 200. this formula for compound interest is a good one to memorize but it's also important to be able to reason your way through it like we did in this chart there's one more type of compound interest and that's interest compounded continuously you can think of continuous compounding as the limit of compounding more and more frequently 10 times a year 100 times a year a thousand times a year a million times a year in the limit you get continuous compounding the formula for continuous compounding is p of t equals a times e to the rt where p of t is the amount of money t is the time in years a is the initial amount of money and r is the annual interest rate written as a decimal so 0.025 in this problem from the 2.5 percent annual interest rate e represents the famous constant euler's constant which is about 2.718 so in this problem we have p of t is 4 000 times e to the 0.025 t and after 5 years we'll have p of 5 which is 4 000 times e to the 0.025 times 5 which works out to 4532.59 to the nearest cent to summarize if r represents the annual interest rate written as a decimal that is 2 would be 0.02 and t represents the number of years and a represents the initial amount of money than for just simple annual interest compounded once a year our formula is p of t is a times 1 plus r to the t for compound interest compounded n times per year our formula is p of t is a times 1 plus r over n to the nt and for compound interest compounded continuously we get p of t is a times e to the rt in this video we looked at three kinds of compound interest problems simple annual interest interest compounded end times per year and continuously compounded interest this video introduces logarithms logarithms are a way of writing exponents the expression log base a of b equals c means that a to the c equals b in other words log base a of b is the exponent that you raise a to to get b the number a is called the base of the logarithm it's also called the base when we write it in this exponential form some students find it helpful to remember this relationship log base a of b equals c means a to the c equals b by drawing arrows a to the c equals b other students like to think of it in terms of asking a question log base a of b asks what power do you raise a to in order to get b let's look at some examples log base 2 of 8 is 3 because 2 to the 3 equals 8. in general log base 2 of y is asking you the question what power do you have to raise 2 to to get y so for example log base 2 of 16 is 4 because it's asking you the question 2 to what power equals 16 and the answer is 4. please pause the video and try some of these other examples log base 2 of 2 is asking what power do you raise 2 to to get 2 and the answer is 1. 2 to the 1 equals 2. log base 2 of onehalf is asking 2 to what power gives you onehalf well to get onehalf you need to raise 2 to a negative power so that would be 2 to the negative 1. so the answer is negative 1. log base 2 of 1 8 means what power do we raise 2 to in order to get 1 8. again since 1 8 is 1 over 2 cubed we have to raise 2 to the negative 3 power to get 1 over 2 cubed so our exponent is negative 3 and that's our answer to our log expression finally log base 2 of 1 is asking 2 to what power equals 1. well anything raised to the zero power gives us one so this log expression evaluates to zero notice that we can get positive negative and zero answers for our logarithm expressions please pause the video and figure out what these logs evaluate to to work out log base 10 of a million notice that a million is 10 to the sixth power now we're asking the question what power do we raise 10 to to get a million so that is what power do we raise 10 to to get 10 to the sixth well of course the answer is going to be 6. similarly since 0.001 is 10 to the minus 3 this log expression is the same thing as asking what's log base 10 of 10 to the minus 3. well what power do you have to raise 10 to to get 10 to the minus 3 of course the answer is negative 3. log base 10 of 0 is asking what power do we raise 10 to to get zero well if you think about it there's no way to raise 10 to an exponent to get zero raising 10 to a positive exponent gets us really big positive numbers raising 10 to a negative exponent is like 1 over 10 to a power so that's giving us tiny fractions but they're still positive numbers we're never going to get zero even if we raise 10 to the zero power we'll just get one so there's no way to get 0 and the log base 10 of 0 does not exist if you try it on your calculator using the log base 10 button you'll get an error message same thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative 100 we're asking 10 to what power equals negative 100 and there's no exponent that will work and more generally it's possible to take the log of numbers that are greater than zero but not for numbers that are less than or equal to zero in other words the domain of the function log base a of x no matter what base you're using for a the domain is going to be all positive numbers a few notes on notation when you see ln of x that's called natural log and it means the log base e of x where e is that famous number that's about 2.718 when you see log of x with no base at all by convention that means log base 10 of x and it's called the common log most scientific calculators have buttons for natural log and for common log let's practice rewriting expressions with logs in them log base 3 of 1 9 is negative 2 can be rewritten as the expression 3 to the negative 2 equals 1 9. log of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of 13. so that can be rewritten as 10 to the 1.11394 equals 13. finally in this last expression ln means natural log or log base e so i can rewrite this equation as log base e of 1 over e equals negative one well that means the same thing as e to the negative one equals one over e which is true now let's go the opposite direction we'll start with exponential equations and rewrite them as logs remember that log base a of b equals c means the same thing as a to the c equals b the base stays the same in both expressions so for this example the base of 3 in the exponential equation is going to be the same as the base in our log now i just have to figure out what's in the argument of the log and what goes on the other side of the equal sign remember that the answer to a log is an exponent so the thing that goes in this box should be my exponent for my exponential equation in other words u and i'll put the 9.78 as the argument of my log this works because log base 3 of 9.78 equals u means the same thing as 3 to the u equals 9.78 which is just what we started with in the second example the base of my exponential equation is e so the base of my log is going to be e the answer to my log is an exponent in this case the exponent 3x plus 7. and the other expression the 4 minus y becomes my argument of my log let me check log base e of 4 minus y equals 3x plus 7 means e to the 3x plus 7 equals 4 minus y which is just what i started with i can also rewrite log base e as natural log this video introduced the idea of logs and the fact that log base a of b equals c means the same thing as a to the c equals b so log base a of b is asking the question what power or exponent do you raise a to in order to get b in this video we'll work out the graphs of some log functions and also talk about their domains for this first example let's graph a log function by hand by plotting some points the function we're working with is y equals log base 2 of x i'll make a chart of x and y values since we're working this out by hand i want to pick x values for which it's easy to compute log base 2 of x so i'll start out with the x value of 1 because log base 2 of 1 is 0 log base anything of 1 is 0. 2 is another x value that's easy to compute log base 2 of 2 that's asking what power do i raise 2 to to get 2 well and the answer is 1. other powers of 2 are easy to work with so for example log base 2 of 4 that's saying what power do i raise 2 to get 4 so the answer is 2 similarly log base 2 of 8 is 3 and log base 2 of 16 is 4. let me also work with some fractional values for x if x is onehalf then log base 2 of onehalf that's saying what power do i raise 2 to to get 1 half well that needs a power of negative 1. it's also easy to compute by hand the log base 2 of 1 4 and 1 8. log base 2 of 1 4 is negative 2 since 2 to the negative 2 is 1 4 and similarly log base 2 of 1 8 is negative 3. i'll put some tick marks on my x and y axes please pause the video and take a moment to plot these points let's see i have the point 1 0 that's here 2 1 that's here 4 2 that is here and then 8 3 which is here and the fractional x values one half goes with negative 1 and 1 4 with negative 2 1 8 with negative 3. and if i connect the dots i get a graph that looks something like this if i had smaller and smaller fractions i would keep getting more and more negative answers when i took log base two of them so my graph is getting more and more negative my y values are getting more and more negative as x is getting close to zero now i didn't draw any parts of the graph over here with negative x values and i didn't put any negative x values in my chart that omission is is no accident because if you try to take the log base 2 or base anything of a negative number like say negative 4 or something there's no answer this doesn't exist because there's no power that you can raise 2 2 to get a negative number so there are no points on the graph for negative x values and similarly there are no points on the graph where x is 0 because you can't take log base 2 of 0 there's no power you can raise 2 to to get 0. i want to observe some key features of this graph first of all the domain is x values greater than zero in interval notation i can write that as a round bracket because i don't want to include 0 to infinity the range is going to be the y values well they go all the way down into the far reach of the negative numbers and the graph gradually increases y value is getting bigger and bigger so the range is actually all real numbers we're in interval notation negative infinity to infinity finally i want to point out that this graph has a vertical asymptote at the yaxis that is at the line x equals zero i'll draw that on my graph with a dotted line a vertical asymptote is a line that our function's graph gets closer and closer to so this is the graph of y equals log base 2 of x but if i wanted to graph say y equals log base 10 of x it would look very similar it would still have a domain of x values greater than zero a range of all real numbers and a vertical asymptote at the y axis it would still go through the point 1 0 but it would go through the point 10 1 instead because log base 10 of 10 is 1. it would look pretty much the same just a lot flatter over here but even though it doesn't look like it with the way i've drawn it it still gradually goes up to and towards infinity in fact the graph of y equals log base any a of x for a bigger than one looks pretty much the same and has these same three properties now that we know what the basic log graph looks like we can plot at least rough graphs of other log functions without plotting points here we have the graph of natural log of x plus 5. and again i'm just going to draw a rough graph if i did want to do a more accurate graph i probably would want to plot some points but i know that roughly a log graph if it was just like y equals ln of x that would look something like this and it would go through the point one zero with a vertical asymptote along the yaxis now if i want to graph ln of x plus 5 that just shifts our graph up by 5 units it'll still have the same vertical asymptote since a vertical line shifted up by 5 units is still a vertical line but instead of going through 1 0 it'll go through the point 1 5. so i'll draw a rough sketch here let's compare our starting function y equals ln x and the transformed version y equals lnx plus 5 in terms of the domain the range and the vertical asymptote our original function y equals ln x had a domain of 0 to infinity since adding 5 on the outside affects the y values and the domain is the x values this transformation doesn't change the domain so the domain is still from 0 to infinity now the range of our original y equals ln x was from negative infinity to infinity shifting up by 5 does affect the y values and the range is talking about the y values but since the original range was all real numbers if you add five to all instead of all real numbers you still get the set of all real numbers so in this case the range doesn't change either and finally we already saw that the original vertical asymptote of the yaxis x equals zero when we shift that up by five units it's still the vertical line x equals zero in this next example we're starting with a log base 10 function and since the plus 2 is on the inside that means we shift that graph left by 2. so i'll draw our basic log function here's our basic log function so i'll think of that as y equals log of x going through the point one zero here's its vertical asymptote now i need to shift everything left by two so my vertical asymptote shifts left and now it's at the line x equals negative two instead of at x equals zero and my graph well let's see my point one zero gets shifted to let's see negative 1 0 since i'm subtracting 2 from the x's and here's a rough sketch of the resulting graph let's compare the features of the two graphs drawn here we're talking about domains the original had a domain of from 0 to infinity but now i've shifted that left so i've subtracted 2 from all my x values and here's my new domain which i can also verify just by looking at the picture my range was originally from negative infinity to infinity well shifting left only affects the x value so it doesn't even affect the range so my range is still negative infinity to infinity my vertical asymptote was originally at x equals 0 and since i subtract 2 from all my x values that shifts it to x equals negative 2. in this last problem i'm not going to worry about drawing this graph i'll just use algebra to compute its domain so let's think about what's the issue when you're taking the logs of things well you can't take the log of a negative number or zero so whatever's inside the argument of the log function whatever's being fed into log had better be greater than zero so i'll write that down we need 2 minus 3x to be greater than zero now it's a matter of solving an inequality 2 has got to be greater than 3x so 2 3 is greater than x in other words x has to be less than twothirds so our domain is all the x values from negative infinity to twothirds not including twothirds it's a good idea to memorize the basic shape of the graph of a log function it looks something like this goes through the point 1 0 and has a vertical asymptote on the y axis also if you remember that you can't take the log of a negative number or zero then that helps you quickly compute domains for log functions whatever's inside the log function you set that greater than zero and solve this video is about combining functions by adding them subtracting them multiplying them and dividing them suppose we have two functions f of x equals x plus one and g of x equals x squared one way to combine them is by adding them together this notation f plus g of x means the function defined by taking f of x and adding it to g of x so for our functions that means we take x plus 1 and add x squared i can rearrange that as the function x squared plus x plus 1. so so f plus g evaluated on x means x squared plus x plus 1. and if i wanted to evaluate f plus g on the number two that would be two squared plus two plus one or seven similarly the notation f minus g of x means the function we get by taking f of x and subtracting g of x so that would be x plus 1 minus x squared and if i wanted to take f minus g evaluated at 1 that would be 1 plus 1 minus 1 squared or 1. the notation f dot g of x which is sometimes also written just as f g of x that means we take f of x times g of x in other words x plus 1 times x squared which could be simplified as x cubed plus x squared the notation f divided by g of x means i take f of x and divide it by g of x so that would be x plus 1 divided by x squared in this figure the blue graph represents h of x and the red graph represents the function p of x we're asked to find h minus p of zero we don't have any equations to work with but that's okay we know that for any x h minus p of x is defined as h of x minus p of x so for x equals 0 h minus p of 0 is going to be h of 0 minus p of 0. using the graph we can find h of 0 by finding the value of 0 on the x axis and finding the corresponding y value for the function h of x so that's about 1.8 now p of zero we can find similarly by looking for zero on the x axis and finding the corresponding y value for the function p of x and that's a y value of 1. 1.8 minus 1 is 0.8 so that's our approximate value for h minus p of 0. if we want to find p times h of negative 3 again we can rewrite that as p of negative 3 times h of negative 3. and using the graphs we see that for an x value of negative 3 the y value for p is 2 and the x value of negative 3 corresponds to a y value of negative 2 for h 2 times negative 2 is negative 4 so that's our value for p times h of negative 3. in this video we saw how to add two functions subtract two functions multiply two functions and divide two functions in the following way when you compose two functions you apply the first function and then you apply the second function to the output of the first function for example the first function might compute population size from time in years so its input would be time in years since a certain date its output would be number of people in the population the second function g might compute healthcare costs as a function of population size so it will take population size as input and its output will be healthcare costs if you put these functions together that is compose them then you'll go all the way from time in years to health care costs this is your composition g composed with f the composition of two functions written g with a little circle f of x is defined as follows g composed with f of x is g evaluated on f of x we can think of it schematically in this diagram f acts on a number x and produces a number f of x then g takes that output f of x and produces a new number g of f x our composition of functions g composed with f is the function that goes all the way from x to g of f x let's work out some examples where our functions are defined by tables of values if we want to find g composed with f of 4 by definition this means g of f 4. to evaluate this expression we always work from the inside out so we start with the x value of 4 and we find f of 4 using the table of values for f of x when x equals 4 f of x is 7. so we can replace f of 4 with the number 7. now we need to evaluate g of 7 7 becomes our new x value in our table of values for g the x value of 7 corresponds to the g of x value of of 10 so g of 7 is equal to 10. we found that g composed with f of 4 is equal to 10. if instead we want to find f composed with g of 4 well we can rewrite that as f of g of 4 and again work from the inside out now we're trying to find g of 4 so 4 is our x value and we use our table of values for g to see that g of 4 is 1. so we replace g of 4 by 1 and now we need to evaluate f of 1. using our table for f values f of 1 is 8. notice that when we've computed g of f of 4 we got a different answer then we computed f of g of 4. and in general g composed with f is not the same thing as f composed with g please pause the video and take a moment to compute the next two examples we can replace f composed with f of 2 by the equivalent expression f of f of 2 working from the inside out we know that f of 2 is 3 and f of 3 is 6. if we want to find f composed with g of 6 rewrite that as f of g of 6 using the table for g g of 6 is 8 but f of 8 8 is not on the table as an x value for the for the f function and so there is no f of 8. this does not exist we can say that 6 is not in the domain for f composed with g even though it was in the domain of g we couldn't follow all the way through and get a value for f composed with g of 6. next let's turn our attention to the composition of functions that are given by equations p of x is x squared plus x and q of x is negative 2x we want to find q composed with p of 1. as usual i can rewrite this as q of p of 1 and work from the inside out p of 1 is one squared plus one so that's two so this is the same thing as q of two but q of two is negative two times two or negative four so this evaluates to negative in this next example we want to find q composed of p of some arbitrary x i'll rewrite it as usual as q of p of x and work from the inside out well p of x we know the formula for that that's x squared plus x so i can replace my p of x with that expression now i'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus x well q of anything is negative 2 times that thing so q of x squared plus x is going to be negative 2 times the quantity x squared plus x what i've done is i've substituted in the whole expression x squared plus x where i saw the x in this formula for q of x it's important to use the parentheses here so that we'll be multiplying negative 2 by the whole expression and not just by the first piece i can simplify this a bit as negative 2x squared minus 2x and that's my expression for q composed with p of x notice that if i wanted to compute q compose with p of 1 which i already did in the first problem i could just use this expression now negative 2 times 1 squared minus 2 and i get negative 4 just like i did before let's try another one let's try p composed with q of x first i read write this p of q of x working from the inside out i can replace q of x with negative 2x so i need to compute p of negative 2x here's my formula for p to compute p of this expression i need to plug in this expression everywhere i see an x in the formula for p so that means negative 2x squared plus negative 2x again being careful to use parentheses to make sure i plug in the entire expression in for x let me simplify this is 4x squared minus 2x notice that i got different expressions for q of p of x and for p of q of x once again we see that q composed with p is not necessarily equal to p composed with q please pause the video and try this last example yourself rewriting and working from the inside out we can replace p of x with its expression x squared plus x and then we need to evaluate p on x squared plus x that means we plug in x squared plus x everywhere we see an x in this formula so that's x squared plus x quantity squared plus x squared plus x once again i can simplify by distributing out that gives me x to the fourth plus two x cubed plus x squared plus x squared plus x or x to the fourth plus two x cubed plus 2x squared plus x in this last set of examples we're asked to go backwards we're given a formula for a function of h of x but we're supposed to rewrite h of x as a composition of two functions f and g let's think for a minute which of these two functions gets applied first f composed with g of x let's see that means f of g of x and since we evaluate these expressions from the inside out we must be applying g first and then f in order to figure out what what f and g could be i like to draw a box around some thing inside my expression for h so i'm going to draw a box around x squared plus 7. then whatever's inside the box that'll be my function g of x the first function that gets applied whatever happens to the box in this case taking the square root sign that becomes my outside function my second function f so here we're going to say g of x is equal to x squared plus 7 and f of x is equal to the square root of x let's just check and make sure that this works so i need to check that when i take the composition f composed with g i need to get the same thing as my original h so let's see if i do f composed with g of x well by definition that's f of g of x working from the inside out i can replace g of x with its formula x squared plus seven so i need to evaluate f of x squared plus seven that means i plug in x squared plus seven into the formula for for f so that becomes the square root of x squared plus 7. tada it works because it matches my original equation so we found a correct answer a correct way of breaking h down as a composition of two functions but i do want to point out this is not the only correct answer i'll write down my formula for h of x again and this time i'll put the box in a different place i'll just box the x squared if i did that then my inside function my first function g of x would be x squared and my second function is what happens to the box so my f of x is what happens to the box and the box gets added 7 to it and taking the square root so in other words f of x is going to be the square root of x plus 7. again i can check that this works if i do f compose with g of x that's f of g of x so now g of x is x squared so i'm taking f of x squared when i plug in x squared for x i do in fact get the square root of x squared plus seven so this is it alternative correct solution in this video we learned to evaluate the composition of functions by rewriting it and working from the inside out we also learned to break apart a complicated function into a composition of two functions by boxing one piece of the function and letting the first function applied in the composition let that be the inside of the box and the second function applied in the composition b whatever happens to the box the inverse of a function undoes what the function does so the inverse of tying your shoes would be to untie them and the inverse of the function that adds 2 to a number would be the function that subtracts 2 from a number this video introduces inverses and their properties suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart in other words f of 2 is 3 f of 3 is 5 f of 4 is 6 and f of 5 is 1. the inverse function for f written f superscript negative 1 x undoes what f does since f takes 2 to 3 f inverse takes 3 back to 2. so we write this f superscript negative 1 of 3 is 2. similarly since f takes 3 to 5 f inverse takes 5 to 3. and since f takes 4 to 6 f inverse of 6 is 4 and since f takes 5 to 1 f inverse of 1 is 5. i'll use these numbers to fill in the chart notice that the chart of values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse of x are closely related they share the same numbers but the x values for f of x correspond to the y values for f inverse of x and the y values for f of x correspond to the x values for f inverse of x that leads us to the first key fact inverse functions reverse the rules of y and x i'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue next i'll plot the points for y equals f inverse of x in red pause the video for a moment and see what kind of symmetry you observe in this graph how are the blue points related to the red points you might have noticed that the blue points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror line y equals x so our second key fact is that the graph of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained from the graph of y equals f of x by reflecting over the line y equals x this makes sense because inverses reverse the rules of y and x in this same example let's compute f inverse of f of 2. this open circle means composition in other words we're computing f inverse of f of 2. we compute this from the inside out so that's f inverse of 3 since f of 2 is 3 and f inverse of 3 we see is 2. similarly we can compute f of f inverse of 3 and that means we take f of f inverse of 3. since f inverse of 3 is 2 that's the same thing as computing f of 2 which is 3. please pause the video for a moment and compute these other compositions you should have found that in every case if you take f inverse of f of a number you get back to the very same number you started with and similarly if you take f of f inverse of any number you get back to the same number you started with so in general f inverse of f of x is equal to x and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x this is the mathematical way of saying that f and f inverse undo each other let's look at a different example suppose that f of x is x cubed pause the video for a moment and guess what the inverse of f should be remember f inverse undoes the work that f does you might have guessed that f inverse of x is going to be the cube root function and we can check that this is true by looking at f of f inverse of x that's f of the cube root of function which means the cube root function cubed which gets us back to x similarly if we compute f inverse of f of x that's the cube root of x cubed and we get back to x again so the cube root function really is the inverse of the cubing function when we compose the two functions we get back to the number that we started with it'd be nice to have a more systematic way of finding inverses of functions besides guessing and checking one method uses the fact that inverses reverse the roles of y and x so if we want to find the inverse of the function f of x equals 5 minus x over 3x we can write it as y equals 5 minus x over 3x reverse the rules of y and x to get x equals 5 minus y over 3y and then solve for y to solve for y let's multiply both sides by 3y bring all terms with y's in them to the left side and all terms without y's in them to the right side factor out the y and divide to isolate y this gives us f inverse of x as five over three x plus one notice that our original function f and our inverse function f inverse are both rational functions but they're not the reciprocals of each other and in general f inverse of x is not usually equal to 1 over f of x this can be confusing because when we write 2 to the minus 1 that does mean 1 over 2 but f to the minus 1 of x means the inverse function and not the reciprocal it's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions that is for any function you might encounter is there always a function that is its inverse in fact the answer is no see if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function the word function here is key remember that a function is a relationship between x values and y values such that for each x value in the domain there's only one corresponding y value one example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x equals x squared to see that the inverse of this function is not a function note that for the x squared function the number two and the number negative two both go to the number four so if i had an inverse it would have to send four to both two and negative two the inverse would not be a function it might be easier to understand the problem when you look at a graph of y equals x squared recall that inverse functions reverse the rules of y and x and flip the graph over the line y equals x but when i flip the green graph over the line y equals x i get this red graph this red graph is not the graph of a function because it violates the vertical line test the reason it violates the vertical line test is because the original green function violates the horizontal line test and has two x values with the same y value in general a function f has an inverse function if and only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal line test i.e every horizontal line intersects the graph in at most one point pause the video for a moment and see which of these four graphs satisfy the horizontal line test in other words which of the four corresponding functions would have an inverse function you may have found that graphs a and b violate the horizontal line test so their functions would not have inverse functions but graph c and d satisfy the horizontal line test so these graphs represent functions that do have inverses functions that satisfy the horizontal line test are sometimes called onetoone functions equivalently a function is one to one if for any two different x values x one and x two the y values f of x one and f of x two are different numbers sometimes as i said f is one to one if whenever f of x one is equal to f of x two then x one has to equal x two as our last example let's try to find p inverse of x where p of x is the square root of x minus 2 drawn here if we graph p inverse on the same axis as p of x we get the following graph simply by flipping over the line y equals x if we try to solve the problem algebraically we can write y equal to square root of x minus 2 reverse the roles of y and x and solve for y by squaring both sides and adding 2. now if we were to graph y equals x squared plus 2 that would look like a parabola it would look like the red graph we've already drawn together with another arm on the left side but we know that our actual inverse function consists only of this right arm we can specify this algebraically by making the restriction that x has to be bigger than or equal to zero this corresponds to the fact that on the original graph for the square root of x y was only greater than or equal to zero looking more closely at the domain and range of p and p inverse we know that the domain of p is all values of x such that x minus two is greater than or equal to zero since we can't take the square root of a negative number this corresponds to x values being greater than or equal to two or in interval notation the interval from 2 to infinity the range of p we can see from the graph is all y values greater than or equal to 0 or the interval from 0 to infinity similarly based on the graph we see the domain of p inverse is x values greater than or equal to 0 the interval from 0 to infinity and the range of p inverse is y values greater than or equal to 2 or the interval from 2 to infinity if you look closely at these domains and ranges you'll notice that the domain of p corresponds exactly to the range of p inverse and the range of p corresponds to the domain of p inverse this makes sense because inverse functions reverse the rules of y and x the domain of f inverse of x is the x values for f inverse which corresponds to the y values or the range of f the range of f inverse is the y values for f inverse which correspond to the x values or the domain of f in this video we discussed five key properties of inverse functions inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x the graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph of y equals f of x reflected over the line y equals x when we compose f with f inverse we get the identity function y equals x and similarly when we compose f inverse with f that brings x to x in other words f and f inverse undo each other the function f of x has an inverse function if and only if the graph of y equals f of x satisfies the horizontal line test and finally the domain of f is the range of f inverse and the range of f is the domain of f inverse these properties of inverse functions will be important when we study exponential functions and their inverses logarithmic functions
