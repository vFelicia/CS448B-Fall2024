00:00 - [Music]
00:02 - our hospitals patient data is leaked a
00:05 - power system is hacked a comment
00:08 - insulting a political leader is posted
00:10 - on a social media network these
00:12 - scenarios might seem different but they
00:14 - could all come under the banner of
00:15 - cybersecurity but this meaning of this
00:18 - word is contested and it's lack of a
00:20 - firm definition means it can be easily
00:22 - politicized and molded to suit different
00:24 - agendas governments and businesses in
00:27 - particular tend to frame cyber security
00:29 - as the mitigation of risk for the state
00:31 - and its systems rather than the
00:33 - empowerment and well-being of people
00:35 - this can help justify repressive
00:37 - measures like internet shutdowns and
00:39 - restrictions on encryption to resist
00:41 - this human rights defenders need to
00:43 - understand the different definitions at
00:45 - play and be active in shaping a common
00:47 - definition of cybersecurity which is
00:49 - positive and rights respecting at the
00:51 - end of this video you should have a
00:53 - better understanding of the current
00:55 - range of possible cybersecurity
00:56 - definitions the motivations for using
00:58 - them and how we can advocate for more
01:01 - rights respecting framing for
01:02 - cybersecurity
01:07 - the term cyber security is disputed it's
01:10 - definition can vary even from one
01:12 - government department to the next and
01:14 - this vagueness means it can cover an
01:16 - almost endless range of different issues
01:19 - this is illustrated by a new America
01:22 - Foundation study from 2014 which found
01:25 - over 400 different cyber related
01:27 - definitions the dominant framing of
01:29 - cybersecurity developed over the years
01:31 - by technical business intelligence and
01:33 - military actors focuses on the security
01:36 - of digital information and the network
01:38 - infrastructure that stores and transmits
01:40 - this information for example the
01:42 - International Telecommunications Union
01:44 - definition focuses on the protection of
01:47 - the cyber environment organization and
01:49 - users assets similarly many ICT
01:53 - businesses see cyber security mainly as
01:55 - protection against threats to
01:57 - information and networks like malware
01:59 - unauthorized access and malicious code
02:03 - military organizations tend to see cyber
02:06 - security in terms of warfare a good
02:08 - example is NATO's 2016 agreement that
02:11 - cyberspace should be considered the
02:13 - fifth operational domain of warfare
02:15 - alongside sea land air and space here
02:19 - the focus is on ensuring the protection
02:21 - of networks owned and operated by NATO
02:23 - another framing of cyber security also
02:26 - focuses on information and systems but
02:29 - has a broader content related mandate
02:31 - China for example defines cyber security
02:34 - as information security a term whose
02:37 - remit goes beyond security of systems to
02:39 - include control over an exchange of
02:41 - information online what these
02:44 - definitions have in common is that their
02:45 - conception of security is all about the
02:47 - mitigation of risk the range of risks
02:50 - they acknowledge may be broad but their
02:52 - focus on protecting systems rather than
02:55 - people is narrow and limiting
02:59 - you might ask why we're spending so much
03:01 - time talking about definitions it's just
03:04 - words isn't it but small differences in
03:06 - the emphasis of cybersecurity
03:08 - definitions can have big implications
03:10 - for human rights definitions create the
03:13 - norms on which policies are based and
03:15 - the narratives which justify them if
03:17 - they're too broad or focused on systems
03:20 - they can be used to justify a wide range
03:22 - of measures both legitimate and
03:24 - illegitimate when we add securitization
03:26 - into the mix definitions become all the
03:29 - more important
03:30 - securitization as we discussed in our
03:32 - first video is the process by which
03:34 - actors make issues into security
03:36 - concerns this can then enable the
03:39 - passage of extraordinary measures like
03:41 - emergency laws without adequate debate
03:44 - securitize narratives around cyberspace
03:47 - often presented as a battlefield or a
03:49 - den of criminals in the absence of an
03:51 - internationally codified definition this
03:54 - can be used to justify curbs on our
03:56 - fundamental rights in the context of
03:58 - cybersecurity this might mean more
04:00 - restrictions on content and freedom of
04:02 - expression more disproportionate
04:04 - measures like mass surveillance and more
04:06 - measures to undermine anonymity these
04:09 - narratives may create the impression
04:11 - that security and human rights are
04:12 - somehow contradictory but this isn't
04:14 - true
04:15 - in fact they depend on one another
04:17 - security isn't just something that is
04:20 - enacted on things in a narrow negative
04:22 - sense of mitigating harm security is a
04:25 - positive concept referring to a person's
04:28 - freedom and capacity to act this is even
04:30 - recognized in human rights law without
04:33 - security we can't fully exercise our
04:35 - rights if we're browsing on a vulnerable
04:37 - network our personal information is at
04:39 - risk with implications for a range of
04:42 - Rights but it goes the other way too
04:44 - unless we respect human rights we can't
04:47 - have security either take South Korea's
04:49 - effort to ban anonymous speech on
04:51 - certain websites in 2007 this not only
04:55 - impeded free expression and privacy but
04:57 - also put the data of 35 million users at
05:00 - risk when two popular websites were
05:02 - hacked in 2011 in this slide it's clear
05:05 - that cyber security policy shouldn't
05:07 - just be about risk mitigation they
05:10 - should also empower people by
05:11 - facilitating the fuller access
05:13 - their human rights without protected
05:15 - information and networks people's
05:17 - quality of life diminishes policies
05:19 - start with definitions human rights
05:22 - offenders therefore need to be active in
05:24 - shaping the norms and narratives which
05:26 - would underpin a rights respecting
05:28 - positive definition of cybersecurity
05:32 - perhaps unsurprisingly security actors
05:35 - play a big part in defining
05:36 - cybersecurity from law-enforcement
05:38 - bodies and intelligence agencies to
05:41 - military entities and computer emergency
05:43 - response teams the forum's they meet in
05:45 - can seem uninviting but there is an
05:47 - increasing awareness of the benefit of
05:49 - multi stakeholder exchange technical
05:52 - bodies the internet Engineering Task
05:54 - Force the Internet Corporation for
05:56 - Assigned Names and numbers and the
05:58 - International Telecommunications Union
06:00 - are also active in developing their own
06:03 - definitions of cybersecurity and many
06:05 - countries and regional organizations are
06:07 - now adopting cybersecurity strategies
06:10 - here human rights defenders can usefully
06:12 - contribute by outlining best practices
06:15 - and rights respecting models policy
06:17 - forums and conferences can help create
06:19 - momentum to put a rights focused
06:21 - understanding of cybersecurity on the
06:23 - international agenda and don't forget
06:25 - businesses they handle huge amounts of
06:28 - our data and fund some of the main
06:30 - studies in forming the dominant
06:31 - narratives around cybersecurity their
06:34 - support will be crucial if we're ever
06:36 - going to create consensus for a positive
06:38 - rights respecting definition
06:41 - you
06:43 - let's look at two examples of real-life
06:45 - attempts to shape the definitions of
06:47 - cybersecurity and their implications the
06:49 - Russian government's definition of
06:51 - cybersecurity or information security as
06:54 - it calls it emphasizes among other
06:56 - things the unconditional maintenance of
06:58 - law and order and the promotion of equal
07:01 - and mutually advantageous international
07:04 - cooperation the first part of this
07:06 - clause has already facilitated
07:08 - surveillance measures like data
07:09 - localization and data retention in
07:12 - Russia itself now alongside China
07:14 - they're trying to realize the second
07:16 - part internationally with their proposal
07:19 - for an international code of conduct for
07:21 - information security the proposal calls
07:24 - for international cooperation to curb
07:26 - the dissemination of information that
07:28 - incites terrorism secessionism or
07:31 - extremism or that undermines other
07:33 - countries political economic and social
07:35 - stability as well as their spiritual and
07:38 - cultural environment this example shows
07:41 - how a negatively framed definition can
07:44 - provide cover for actions which threaten
07:46 - human rights both nationally and
07:47 - internationally but there are also
07:50 - examples of initiatives working to
07:52 - promote rights respecting conceptions of
07:54 - cybersecurity in 2015 the
07:57 - multi-stakeholder working group one of
07:59 - the freedom online coalition published a
08:02 - new definition of cybersecurity in an
08:04 - attempt to challenge current dominant
08:06 - narratives in a balanced way starting
08:09 - from the principle that human rights
08:10 - apply online as well as offline it says
08:13 - that cybersecurity is the preservation
08:15 - through policy technology and education
08:18 - of the availability confidentiality and
08:21 - integrity of information and its
08:23 - underlying infrastructure so as to
08:26 - enhance the security of persons both
08:28 - online and offline note the focus on
08:31 - people rather than systems and how it
08:33 - bridges policy technical and human
08:35 - rights perspectives this creates the
08:38 - basis for shift towards a more positive
08:40 - framing of cybersecurity centered on
08:42 - individual rights rather than threats to
08:45 - systems
08:47 - you
08:49 - because cybersecurity is such a young
08:52 - policy area there's still a chance for
08:54 - human rights defenders to shape how it's
08:56 - framed to do this they need to engage
08:59 - wherever it's being discussed by coming
09:02 - prepared understanding different
09:03 - motivations and being able to convince
09:05 - stakeholders with well evidenced
09:07 - arguments its possible to counter the
09:09 - dominant framings which pits human
09:11 - rights against security and by
09:14 - championing a rights respecting
09:16 - definition in the right places human
09:18 - rights defenders can help ensure any
09:20 - measures taken in the name of
09:21 - cybersecurity which restrict human
09:23 - rights face proper scrutiny
09:26 - [Music]
09:29 - you can't talk about cybersecurity
09:32 - without talking about technology and
09:34 - when engaging with policy makers it's
09:36 - helpful for human rights defenders to
09:38 - understand the basic concepts of this
09:40 - domain but from a technical perspective
09:43 - what does security actually mean popular
09:46 - conceptions of cybersecurity often focus
09:48 - on securing information and it
09:50 - underlying infrastructure information is
09:53 - the lifeblood of cyberspace from
09:55 - personal data to high-level state
09:57 - communication it flows through networks
09:59 - in huge quantities and is stored on
10:01 - devices and data centers it is subject
10:04 - to voluntary standards but without a
10:06 - central authority and in a rapidly
10:08 - changing environment these can be
10:10 - subject to change in cyberspace
10:12 - information is digital and intangible
10:15 - but it relies on an infrastructure which
10:18 - is physical from cables to servers
10:20 - reuters to satellite connections data
10:23 - and metadata in cyberspace can be
10:25 - vulnerable at different points and be
10:27 - undermined in different ways it can be
10:30 - copied modified or made inaccessible or
10:33 - its origin could be faked a violation of
10:35 - authenticity violations of
10:38 - confidentiality integrity availability
10:40 - and authenticity can have different
10:43 - culprits it might be criminal activity a
10:46 - deliberate shutdown by government or
10:48 - even an accident these violations can
10:51 - undermine security in cyberspace but
10:54 - they also impact a range of human rights
10:56 - including privacy freedom of expression
10:59 - and freedom of information the border
11:02 - gateway protocol or
11:03 - bgp illustrates this well this refers to
11:06 - the set of rules which enables
11:08 - communications between large networks
11:10 - despite its central role in the
11:12 - functioning of the Internet
11:14 - it remains vulnerable to misuse or
11:16 - attack for example in 2008 Pakistan's
11:20 - government ordered a local internet
11:22 - service provider to block YouTube in the
11:24 - country its attempts to do so resulted
11:27 - in a global outage of the video sharing
11:29 - website for two hours the ISP did this
11:33 - by exploiting a weakness in the border
11:35 - gateway protocol so that all traffic
11:38 - trying to get to YouTube went to the ISP
11:41 - instead as a result YouTube became
11:44 - unavailable vulnerabilities in the BGP
11:46 - routes can also be manipulated to
11:49 - intercept Internet traffic
11:50 - man-in-the-middle attacks work by
11:53 - redirecting large quantities of traffic
11:55 - to an unauthorized router if the data is
11:59 - unencrypted those controlling the router
12:01 - can then monitor or tamper with it
12:03 - before sending it on its way without the
12:06 - owner of the data knowing anything has
12:08 - happened this undermines the principles
12:10 - of integrity and confidentiality but
12:13 - just as you can undermine these
12:14 - principles you can also preserve and
12:16 - strengthen them at the internet
12:18 - Engineering Task Force measures are
12:21 - under discussion to address weaknesses
12:22 - in BGP if finalized they could help make
12:26 - sure data goes to and originates in the
12:29 - right places and identify whether data
12:32 - is travelling on the right routes this
12:34 - makes it less likely that traffic will
12:36 - be inadvertently intercepted or blocked
12:38 - and will help make sure confidentiality
12:40 - integrity and availability and the human
12:44 - rights which depend on them are
12:45 - respected on a technical level security
12:48 - can also be built into products and
12:50 - services by design Apple and whatsapp's
12:54 - adoption of default end-to-end
12:55 - encryption is a good example other tools
12:58 - include SSL TLS encryption of emails and
13:02 - certificate pinning in browsers the
13:05 - stakes couldn't be higher today the
13:08 - internet isn't just a communications
13:09 - network it's a network for industrial
13:12 - control systems health care and in some
13:14 - countries even voting
13:17 - our alliance on network systems and
13:19 - technology increases the risks
13:21 - associated with insecure networks also
13:23 - increase the Internet of Things is about
13:26 - to usher in a whole new universe of
13:28 - connected objects this will pose huge
13:31 - challenges for both security and human
13:33 - rights a big part of the solution is
13:35 - technical as we've seen but it's not the
13:38 - whole picture let's look again at the
13:40 - incident in Pakistan after a few hours
13:42 - YouTube was restored at the global level
13:45 - by a technical fix but in Pakistan
13:47 - itself the censorship order didn't go
13:50 - away and YouTube remain blocked there
13:53 - until the offending content was removed
13:55 - this shows that technical solutions are
13:57 - not enough security in cyberspace will
14:00 - only be possible with a holistic
14:02 - approach which means robust technical
14:04 - measures and standards bolstered by
14:06 - rights respecting policies and laws
14:08 - responsible business practices and
14:10 - education the digital world has
14:16 - transformed our lives creating new ways
14:18 - of communicating organizing and
14:20 - accessing information it has also
14:22 - created new threats popularly known as
14:24 - cyber threats in response cyberspace is
14:28 - increasingly being framed as something
14:29 - inherently dangerous which requires more
14:32 - scrutiny management and control in this
14:34 - video we'll explore why this framing is
14:37 - itself a threat to both human rights and
14:39 - the security of the digital environment
14:41 - by the end you'll understand the
14:43 - dominant ways threats in cyberspace are
14:45 - being framed why this framing can be
14:47 - problematic and how to get involved in
14:49 - these debates
14:52 - in 2016 US Director of National
14:56 - Intelligence James clapper delivered a
14:58 - talk to a Naval Academy in his speech he
15:00 - said the cyber threat is here it's upon
15:03 - us now and we need the people here today
15:05 - to help us defend our systems and our
15:07 - nation this statement neatly captures
15:09 - the two dominant perspectives on threats
15:11 - in cyberspace the political military
15:13 - perspective focused on threats to public
15:15 - safety in the security of the state and
15:17 - the economic perspective focused on
15:20 - threats to commercial systems and assets
15:21 - both understand cyber threats as
15:24 - malicious activity that seeks to
15:26 - undermine computer networks or systems
15:28 - and the information accessible through
15:29 - them in media and policy spaces these
15:32 - threats are discussed under many names
15:34 - data breaches hacks cyber incidents and
15:37 - cyberattacks
15:38 - are just a few examples but what do
15:40 - these threats actually constitute you
15:42 - may recall incidents like the 2015 Sony
15:45 - Pictures hack a major data breach which
15:47 - attracted extensive media coverage and
15:49 - political responses and was estimated to
15:52 - across the company millions of dollars
15:53 - or the 2007 wave of attacks on Estonian
15:57 - public service websites in major news
15:59 - outlets which was characterized as an
16:01 - act of cyber war these fit in with the
16:04 - systems focused perspectives we've
16:06 - discussed but some activities
16:08 - characterized as cyber threats stretch
16:10 - the boundaries of this framing in Turkey
16:12 - for example hundreds of people have been
16:14 - investigated by the cyber crime unit for
16:17 - insulting the president here a cyber
16:20 - threat can be taken to mean activities
16:22 - which simply involve the use of an
16:23 - information technology this blurs the
16:25 - line between activities which affect the
16:27 - integrity of online systems and networks
16:29 - and activities which simply involve the
16:32 - internet as a medium it means an art
16:34 - thief who uses Google Maps to escape and
16:37 - someone who hacks into a banking website
16:39 - could both be considered cyber criminals
16:41 - and with cyber crime increasingly
16:43 - overlapping with a range of policy
16:45 - debates from internet governments to
16:47 - child safety and counterterrorism
16:49 - defining where these boundaries sit is
16:51 - only going to become more important
16:54 - you
16:56 - we've established that there are
16:57 - ambiguities around how a cyber threat is
16:59 - defined but why does this matter some
17:02 - argue that the looseness of the term
17:04 - feeds into securitized narratives which
17:06 - present cyberspace is inherently
17:08 - threatening this can then justify
17:10 - disproportionate measures which
17:11 - undermine human rights in other words
17:13 - when everything is deemed a potential
17:15 - cyber threat proportionality and due
17:17 - process can often be forgotten let's be
17:20 - clear there are real threats in
17:21 - cyberspace and unless we're protected
17:24 - against them our everyday lives will
17:25 - suffer major public services and
17:27 - businesses now depend on the security of
17:30 - networks and systems and without proper
17:32 - measures in place the huge amounts of
17:34 - sensitive information we share about
17:35 - ourselves like a sexual orientation
17:37 - political activity or location is
17:40 - vulnerable to misuse but a securitized
17:42 - reading of cyber threats can create new
17:44 - threats for both people and systems for
17:47 - example a ban on encryption in the name
17:49 - of terrorism and cyber crime doesn't
17:51 - just damage human rights like privacy
17:53 - and freedom of expression it weakens
17:55 - security too by creating more
17:57 - vulnerabilities in systems a backdoor
17:59 - after all is a backdoor to anyone
18:01 - whether that's a policeman or a criminal
18:03 - so many of our rights depend on our
18:05 - networked information infrastructure
18:07 - it's what enables us to communicate
18:09 - organize associate create and distribute
18:12 - content if we want to retain these
18:14 - benefits we need to fight for a more
18:15 - balanced understanding of cyberspace and
18:17 - the things which threaten it without
18:19 - considering rights there can be no real
18:21 - security
18:23 - you
18:25 - threats in cyberspace are discussed in a
18:27 - range of forums dealing with issues
18:29 - related to cybersecurity cyber crime and
18:32 - cyber warfare among others
18:34 - apart from national cybersecurity
18:35 - strategies governments developing norms
18:38 - of responsible state behavior in a
18:40 - number of global forums notably the UN
18:43 - group of governmental experts in the
18:45 - first committee of the UN General
18:46 - Assembly similar efforts are being
18:48 - discussed and developed in regional
18:50 - bodies like the European Union the
18:53 - African Union the Organization of
18:55 - American States and the Association of
18:57 - Southeast Asian Nations bilateral
18:59 - agreements like the one signed between
19:01 - the US and China attempt to find rules
19:03 - of procedure and mutual notification
19:06 - systems in case of an attack
19:07 - consultations on the Tallinn manual 2.0
19:10 - are also ongoing this initiative often
19:12 - associated with NATO is actually an
19:15 - independent academia led effort seeking
19:17 - to adapt international law for peace in
19:19 - wartime to the digital age most
19:22 - countries have established computer
19:23 - emergency response teams which help
19:25 - identify isolate and safeguard against
19:27 - viruses hacking or DDoS attacks these
19:30 - certs cooperate across borders through
19:33 - the first network which focuses on
19:35 - information sharing and threat
19:36 - notification in addition there are
19:39 - several discussions taking place on
19:40 - so-called responsible disclosure this
19:43 - means allowing detected vulnerabilities
19:45 - in systems and networks to be safely
19:47 - disclosed without legal persecution this
19:49 - happens both at the national and
19:51 - regional levels finally threats are
19:53 - often discussed at conferences and
19:55 - policy forums like the global conference
19:57 - on cyberspace DEFCON blackhat the
19:59 - cybercrime conference is hosted by
20:01 - Europol and Interpol and pets
20:05 - the u.s. personnel department was hacked
20:08 - in 2015 exposing the sensitive personal
20:11 - information of 22 million people
20:13 - including mental health records and
20:15 - details of drug and alcohol abuse in
20:17 - both human rights and security terms
20:19 - this was a catastrophe
20:21 - demanding urgent action to strengthen
20:23 - protections this didn't happen instead
20:25 - the incident was framed in a securitized
20:28 - way with US officials looking for states
20:30 - to blame and weighing options for

Cleaned transcript:

our hospitals patient data is leaked a power system is hacked a comment insulting a political leader is posted on a social media network these scenarios might seem different but they could all come under the banner of cybersecurity but this meaning of this word is contested and it's lack of a firm definition means it can be easily politicized and molded to suit different agendas governments and businesses in particular tend to frame cyber security as the mitigation of risk for the state and its systems rather than the empowerment and wellbeing of people this can help justify repressive measures like internet shutdowns and restrictions on encryption to resist this human rights defenders need to understand the different definitions at play and be active in shaping a common definition of cybersecurity which is positive and rights respecting at the end of this video you should have a better understanding of the current range of possible cybersecurity definitions the motivations for using them and how we can advocate for more rights respecting framing for cybersecurity the term cyber security is disputed it's definition can vary even from one government department to the next and this vagueness means it can cover an almost endless range of different issues this is illustrated by a new America Foundation study from 2014 which found over 400 different cyber related definitions the dominant framing of cybersecurity developed over the years by technical business intelligence and military actors focuses on the security of digital information and the network infrastructure that stores and transmits this information for example the International Telecommunications Union definition focuses on the protection of the cyber environment organization and users assets similarly many ICT businesses see cyber security mainly as protection against threats to information and networks like malware unauthorized access and malicious code military organizations tend to see cyber security in terms of warfare a good example is NATO's 2016 agreement that cyberspace should be considered the fifth operational domain of warfare alongside sea land air and space here the focus is on ensuring the protection of networks owned and operated by NATO another framing of cyber security also focuses on information and systems but has a broader content related mandate China for example defines cyber security as information security a term whose remit goes beyond security of systems to include control over an exchange of information online what these definitions have in common is that their conception of security is all about the mitigation of risk the range of risks they acknowledge may be broad but their focus on protecting systems rather than people is narrow and limiting you might ask why we're spending so much time talking about definitions it's just words isn't it but small differences in the emphasis of cybersecurity definitions can have big implications for human rights definitions create the norms on which policies are based and the narratives which justify them if they're too broad or focused on systems they can be used to justify a wide range of measures both legitimate and illegitimate when we add securitization into the mix definitions become all the more important securitization as we discussed in our first video is the process by which actors make issues into security concerns this can then enable the passage of extraordinary measures like emergency laws without adequate debate securitize narratives around cyberspace often presented as a battlefield or a den of criminals in the absence of an internationally codified definition this can be used to justify curbs on our fundamental rights in the context of cybersecurity this might mean more restrictions on content and freedom of expression more disproportionate measures like mass surveillance and more measures to undermine anonymity these narratives may create the impression that security and human rights are somehow contradictory but this isn't true in fact they depend on one another security isn't just something that is enacted on things in a narrow negative sense of mitigating harm security is a positive concept referring to a person's freedom and capacity to act this is even recognized in human rights law without security we can't fully exercise our rights if we're browsing on a vulnerable network our personal information is at risk with implications for a range of Rights but it goes the other way too unless we respect human rights we can't have security either take South Korea's effort to ban anonymous speech on certain websites in 2007 this not only impeded free expression and privacy but also put the data of 35 million users at risk when two popular websites were hacked in 2011 in this slide it's clear that cyber security policy shouldn't just be about risk mitigation they should also empower people by facilitating the fuller access their human rights without protected information and networks people's quality of life diminishes policies start with definitions human rights offenders therefore need to be active in shaping the norms and narratives which would underpin a rights respecting positive definition of cybersecurity perhaps unsurprisingly security actors play a big part in defining cybersecurity from lawenforcement bodies and intelligence agencies to military entities and computer emergency response teams the forum's they meet in can seem uninviting but there is an increasing awareness of the benefit of multi stakeholder exchange technical bodies the internet Engineering Task Force the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and numbers and the International Telecommunications Union are also active in developing their own definitions of cybersecurity and many countries and regional organizations are now adopting cybersecurity strategies here human rights defenders can usefully contribute by outlining best practices and rights respecting models policy forums and conferences can help create momentum to put a rights focused understanding of cybersecurity on the international agenda and don't forget businesses they handle huge amounts of our data and fund some of the main studies in forming the dominant narratives around cybersecurity their support will be crucial if we're ever going to create consensus for a positive rights respecting definition you let's look at two examples of reallife attempts to shape the definitions of cybersecurity and their implications the Russian government's definition of cybersecurity or information security as it calls it emphasizes among other things the unconditional maintenance of law and order and the promotion of equal and mutually advantageous international cooperation the first part of this clause has already facilitated surveillance measures like data localization and data retention in Russia itself now alongside China they're trying to realize the second part internationally with their proposal for an international code of conduct for information security the proposal calls for international cooperation to curb the dissemination of information that incites terrorism secessionism or extremism or that undermines other countries political economic and social stability as well as their spiritual and cultural environment this example shows how a negatively framed definition can provide cover for actions which threaten human rights both nationally and internationally but there are also examples of initiatives working to promote rights respecting conceptions of cybersecurity in 2015 the multistakeholder working group one of the freedom online coalition published a new definition of cybersecurity in an attempt to challenge current dominant narratives in a balanced way starting from the principle that human rights apply online as well as offline it says that cybersecurity is the preservation through policy technology and education of the availability confidentiality and integrity of information and its underlying infrastructure so as to enhance the security of persons both online and offline note the focus on people rather than systems and how it bridges policy technical and human rights perspectives this creates the basis for shift towards a more positive framing of cybersecurity centered on individual rights rather than threats to systems you because cybersecurity is such a young policy area there's still a chance for human rights defenders to shape how it's framed to do this they need to engage wherever it's being discussed by coming prepared understanding different motivations and being able to convince stakeholders with well evidenced arguments its possible to counter the dominant framings which pits human rights against security and by championing a rights respecting definition in the right places human rights defenders can help ensure any measures taken in the name of cybersecurity which restrict human rights face proper scrutiny you can't talk about cybersecurity without talking about technology and when engaging with policy makers it's helpful for human rights defenders to understand the basic concepts of this domain but from a technical perspective what does security actually mean popular conceptions of cybersecurity often focus on securing information and it underlying infrastructure information is the lifeblood of cyberspace from personal data to highlevel state communication it flows through networks in huge quantities and is stored on devices and data centers it is subject to voluntary standards but without a central authority and in a rapidly changing environment these can be subject to change in cyberspace information is digital and intangible but it relies on an infrastructure which is physical from cables to servers reuters to satellite connections data and metadata in cyberspace can be vulnerable at different points and be undermined in different ways it can be copied modified or made inaccessible or its origin could be faked a violation of authenticity violations of confidentiality integrity availability and authenticity can have different culprits it might be criminal activity a deliberate shutdown by government or even an accident these violations can undermine security in cyberspace but they also impact a range of human rights including privacy freedom of expression and freedom of information the border gateway protocol or bgp illustrates this well this refers to the set of rules which enables communications between large networks despite its central role in the functioning of the Internet it remains vulnerable to misuse or attack for example in 2008 Pakistan's government ordered a local internet service provider to block YouTube in the country its attempts to do so resulted in a global outage of the video sharing website for two hours the ISP did this by exploiting a weakness in the border gateway protocol so that all traffic trying to get to YouTube went to the ISP instead as a result YouTube became unavailable vulnerabilities in the BGP routes can also be manipulated to intercept Internet traffic maninthemiddle attacks work by redirecting large quantities of traffic to an unauthorized router if the data is unencrypted those controlling the router can then monitor or tamper with it before sending it on its way without the owner of the data knowing anything has happened this undermines the principles of integrity and confidentiality but just as you can undermine these principles you can also preserve and strengthen them at the internet Engineering Task Force measures are under discussion to address weaknesses in BGP if finalized they could help make sure data goes to and originates in the right places and identify whether data is travelling on the right routes this makes it less likely that traffic will be inadvertently intercepted or blocked and will help make sure confidentiality integrity and availability and the human rights which depend on them are respected on a technical level security can also be built into products and services by design Apple and whatsapp's adoption of default endtoend encryption is a good example other tools include SSL TLS encryption of emails and certificate pinning in browsers the stakes couldn't be higher today the internet isn't just a communications network it's a network for industrial control systems health care and in some countries even voting our alliance on network systems and technology increases the risks associated with insecure networks also increase the Internet of Things is about to usher in a whole new universe of connected objects this will pose huge challenges for both security and human rights a big part of the solution is technical as we've seen but it's not the whole picture let's look again at the incident in Pakistan after a few hours YouTube was restored at the global level by a technical fix but in Pakistan itself the censorship order didn't go away and YouTube remain blocked there until the offending content was removed this shows that technical solutions are not enough security in cyberspace will only be possible with a holistic approach which means robust technical measures and standards bolstered by rights respecting policies and laws responsible business practices and education the digital world has transformed our lives creating new ways of communicating organizing and accessing information it has also created new threats popularly known as cyber threats in response cyberspace is increasingly being framed as something inherently dangerous which requires more scrutiny management and control in this video we'll explore why this framing is itself a threat to both human rights and the security of the digital environment by the end you'll understand the dominant ways threats in cyberspace are being framed why this framing can be problematic and how to get involved in these debates in 2016 US Director of National Intelligence James clapper delivered a talk to a Naval Academy in his speech he said the cyber threat is here it's upon us now and we need the people here today to help us defend our systems and our nation this statement neatly captures the two dominant perspectives on threats in cyberspace the political military perspective focused on threats to public safety in the security of the state and the economic perspective focused on threats to commercial systems and assets both understand cyber threats as malicious activity that seeks to undermine computer networks or systems and the information accessible through them in media and policy spaces these threats are discussed under many names data breaches hacks cyber incidents and cyberattacks are just a few examples but what do these threats actually constitute you may recall incidents like the 2015 Sony Pictures hack a major data breach which attracted extensive media coverage and political responses and was estimated to across the company millions of dollars or the 2007 wave of attacks on Estonian public service websites in major news outlets which was characterized as an act of cyber war these fit in with the systems focused perspectives we've discussed but some activities characterized as cyber threats stretch the boundaries of this framing in Turkey for example hundreds of people have been investigated by the cyber crime unit for insulting the president here a cyber threat can be taken to mean activities which simply involve the use of an information technology this blurs the line between activities which affect the integrity of online systems and networks and activities which simply involve the internet as a medium it means an art thief who uses Google Maps to escape and someone who hacks into a banking website could both be considered cyber criminals and with cyber crime increasingly overlapping with a range of policy debates from internet governments to child safety and counterterrorism defining where these boundaries sit is only going to become more important you we've established that there are ambiguities around how a cyber threat is defined but why does this matter some argue that the looseness of the term feeds into securitized narratives which present cyberspace is inherently threatening this can then justify disproportionate measures which undermine human rights in other words when everything is deemed a potential cyber threat proportionality and due process can often be forgotten let's be clear there are real threats in cyberspace and unless we're protected against them our everyday lives will suffer major public services and businesses now depend on the security of networks and systems and without proper measures in place the huge amounts of sensitive information we share about ourselves like a sexual orientation political activity or location is vulnerable to misuse but a securitized reading of cyber threats can create new threats for both people and systems for example a ban on encryption in the name of terrorism and cyber crime doesn't just damage human rights like privacy and freedom of expression it weakens security too by creating more vulnerabilities in systems a backdoor after all is a backdoor to anyone whether that's a policeman or a criminal so many of our rights depend on our networked information infrastructure it's what enables us to communicate organize associate create and distribute content if we want to retain these benefits we need to fight for a more balanced understanding of cyberspace and the things which threaten it without considering rights there can be no real security you threats in cyberspace are discussed in a range of forums dealing with issues related to cybersecurity cyber crime and cyber warfare among others apart from national cybersecurity strategies governments developing norms of responsible state behavior in a number of global forums notably the UN group of governmental experts in the first committee of the UN General Assembly similar efforts are being discussed and developed in regional bodies like the European Union the African Union the Organization of American States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations bilateral agreements like the one signed between the US and China attempt to find rules of procedure and mutual notification systems in case of an attack consultations on the Tallinn manual 2.0 are also ongoing this initiative often associated with NATO is actually an independent academia led effort seeking to adapt international law for peace in wartime to the digital age most countries have established computer emergency response teams which help identify isolate and safeguard against viruses hacking or DDoS attacks these certs cooperate across borders through the first network which focuses on information sharing and threat notification in addition there are several discussions taking place on socalled responsible disclosure this means allowing detected vulnerabilities in systems and networks to be safely disclosed without legal persecution this happens both at the national and regional levels finally threats are often discussed at conferences and policy forums like the global conference on cyberspace DEFCON blackhat the cybercrime conference is hosted by Europol and Interpol and pets the u.s. personnel department was hacked in 2015 exposing the sensitive personal information of 22 million people including mental health records and details of drug and alcohol abuse in both human rights and security terms this was a catastrophe demanding urgent action to strengthen protections this didn't happen instead the incident was framed in a securitized way with US officials looking for states to blame and weighing options for retaliation this prevented any real debate on an appropriate response which might have included a discussion on whether so much data should have been collected in the first place this is an example of what can happen when policy discussions are led by security agenda a narrow debate makes a constructive holistic approach less likely pakistan's prevention of electronic crimes bill has been under negotiation since 2015 it aims to fight crime and terrorism by restricting the ability of these actors to organize and communicate online to do this the bill seeks to criminalize the production distribution and use of encryption tools this is a good example of a disproportionate measure in response to a securitized framing of a threat the bill makes no distinction between the tiny number of users who might use anonymity for criminal purpose and the vast majority of users who simply wish to protect their right to privacy it also threatens free speech by criminalizing content deemed to praise those accused of a crime the bill is not only an ineffective approach to fighting crime it also threatens online security and data protection and undermines free expression online you human rights defenders can engage with these issues on several levels as individuals we can step up efforts to strengthen our own digital security and help raise awareness of the dangers that come with digitization we can encourage and support businesses in bringing their internal capacities up to speed and make sure they're following human rights and data protection standards we can intervene in the spaces where threats are discussed to make sure a more proportionate rights respecting definition of cyber threats takes hold and we can push governments to put in place adequate legislation and policies which put responsible limits on the power of intelligence and law enforcement agencies
