00:06 - hi and welcome to opmt 1110 introduction
00:09 - to business math today we're going to
00:11 - start at the very beginning what is the
00:14 - point
00:15 - of business
00:20 - the point of business
00:28 - is profit
00:34 - of course there's other reasons to be in
00:37 - business lots of other reasons but in
00:39 - the context of a business math class
00:42 - this is what we care about
00:44 - mathematically
00:55 - profit is defined as sales minus costs
00:58 - sometimes instead of sales
01:01 - we say revenue and instead of costs we
01:04 - say expenses
01:05 - in the context of this class those are
01:08 - going to be interchangeable terms
01:10 - revenue and sales
01:11 - we also sometimes talk about this as
01:14 - money in
01:15 - money out
01:17 - and that's going to come up a lot
01:19 - throughout this course what do we know
01:21 - about profit
01:27 - when profit is a positive number that
01:30 - means bigger than zero
01:38 - that is a good thing
01:44 - on the other hand when profit
01:49 - is less than zero
01:53 - that's a negative number
01:56 - i'm going to write that that is less
01:58 - than
02:00 - that
02:01 - is going to be
02:02 - bad
02:04 - finally when profit is exactly zero that
02:08 - is what we're going to call the
02:09 - break-even point and we'll get back to
02:11 - that in a couple of weeks
02:14 - but the word for a profit of exactly
02:17 - zero when sales equals cost is break
02:20 - even
02:25 - to understand the different types of
02:27 - expenses
02:28 - and the different types of
02:30 - profits we're going to go over an
02:32 - example example number one
02:34 - to run a lemonade stand charlie and sam
02:37 - spent 20 dollars in building a booth
02:41 - and 100 on lemons and sugar
02:44 - they brought in 300 in sales find their
02:47 - cost net profit and gross profit
02:51 - here
02:52 - we have two types of costs
02:58 - we've got fixed costs
03:05 - this is also called operating expenses
03:10 - and some books call this op for
03:13 - operating
03:15 - or fc
03:16 - for fixed costs we also have variable
03:19 - costs
03:24 - and those are also called costs of goods
03:27 - sold
03:32 - sometimes
03:33 - cogs and sometimes vc for variable costs
03:38 - in this case we have both types of
03:40 - expenses our operating expenses here are
03:43 - the 20
03:44 - on the booth
03:46 - we spend that once
03:50 - no matter how much lemonade we make
03:56 - so that's a one-time expense that's what
03:58 - makes it an operating expense as opposed
04:00 - to
04:02 - our lemons and sugar which is a hundred
04:05 - dollars
04:11 - so every time we make a batch of that
04:13 - much lemonade we're going to have to
04:15 - spend an equal amount of money on lemon
04:17 - and sugars
04:18 - so what's our total costs
04:27 - 120 or 100 plus 20.
04:32 - that is our two types of expenses so now
04:35 - what we can do is
04:38 - look at what we call an income statement
04:41 - we write down our sales
04:44 - then we subtract
04:48 - the cost of goods solds and at the end
04:50 - what we get is called a gross profit
04:56 - so in this case we have
04:59 - three hundred dollars in sales
05:01 - minus one hundred dollars
05:04 - which gives us a gross profit of two
05:07 - hundred dollars
05:14 - that's the gross profit and it is sales
05:17 - minus cost of goods sold
05:21 - now we're going to subtract those
05:23 - operating costs
05:29 - so we spent twenty dollars
05:34 - on that booth
05:36 - and at the end what we're going to get
05:38 - is
05:39 - 180
05:42 - and that is our net profit
05:50 - net profit
05:51 - is going to be
05:54 - all of our sales
05:58 - minus
05:59 - all of our expenses
06:05 - and eighty dollars is how much money we
06:07 - end up with in this
06:10 - this
06:12 - scan this up
06:13 - is the bottom line
06:22 - net profit
06:23 - so in the end
06:25 - we have
06:27 - a hundred and eighty dollars in profit
06:35 - let's sum up just the different
06:38 - equations that we went over
06:42 - we've got sales
06:48 - is
06:50 - money in
06:53 - is revenue
06:56 - we have costs
06:58 - that's money out
07:03 - is expenses
07:07 - we have profit
07:10 - that is sales minus cost
07:17 - we have
07:19 - net profit
07:21 - sorry we have two types of costs
07:24 - we have cost of goods sold
07:39 - and we have operating costs
07:45 - op
07:48 - or
07:49 - fixed cost
07:50 - and that is the cost of things that we
07:53 - are spending one time
07:57 - finally we've got gross profit
08:02 - is going to be sales minus cost of goods
08:06 - sold
08:07 - and then we have net profit
08:11 - which is going to be
08:13 - gross profit
08:17 - minus operating expenses
08:22 - hi
08:23 - now we're going to talk about ratios
08:26 - fractions and percent
08:31 - proportions and percent
08:36 - let's write that all down these are
08:39 - different ways of looking at the same
08:41 - problem
08:42 - a fraction
08:45 - is given as an amount
08:48 - over
08:49 - a base
08:51 - mathematically you might have heard this
08:53 - as the numerator
08:56 - over the denominator
08:59 - it's a hard word to spell
09:02 - a over c
09:04 - i'm going to give the example of 3 over
09:07 - 25
09:08 - that's a fraction
09:12 - a ratio
09:16 - in a ratio we're going to express that
09:18 - in two parts
09:20 - 3 to 22
09:27 - or
09:28 - a to b
09:34 - this is a way of comparing the two parts
09:36 - i've broken my fraction that has 25
09:39 - pieces
09:41 - into two bits three
09:44 - and 22. when i add those together i get
09:47 - 25 so a ratio is a way of breaking our
09:50 - fraction up
09:53 - let's look at the same thing in decimal
09:56 - in decimal
09:58 - 3 over 25
10:00 - is equal to
10:02 - 0.12 that's the same
10:05 - as 12
10:12 - which means we have many ways of saying
10:14 - the same thing
10:16 - 3 twenty-fifths three to twenty-two
10:20 - zero point one two
10:22 - twelve percent
10:25 - those are all the same
10:27 - but we use them in different ways
10:30 - often the one we like best is percent
10:41 - we use percent a lot in business
10:44 - because it's easy to understand 12 just
10:47 - makes a lot of sense however ratios do
10:50 - come in handy when we have lots of
10:53 - things to compare
10:59 - so i might say
11:03 - a to b
11:04 - to c
11:06 - equals one to three
11:08 - to two that means i've broken
11:11 - my hole
11:12 - into six parts
11:14 - one two three
11:16 - four five six
11:20 - i am going to color
11:25 - one of them
11:26 - a
11:28 - i'm going to color
11:30 - three of them
11:35 - b
11:36 - and i'm going to
11:39 - color
11:45 - let's uh sorry make this green
11:52 - the rest of it
11:53 - c
11:54 - two parts are c
11:57 - one part
11:58 - is a
11:59 - three parts are b
12:04 - question two
12:06 - detailed information about the minute
12:07 - made lemonade company is supplied below
12:10 - they have sales of 20 million dollars
12:14 - cost of goods sold that's things like
12:16 - lemons and sugar
12:17 - and cans or 12 million dollars giving
12:20 - them a gross profit of 20 minus 12
12:22 - equals 8 million dollars their operating
12:25 - expenses that's things like salaries and
12:28 - factory costs are 5 million dollars
12:30 - leaving them with a net product
12:32 - profit of 3 million dollars this is an
12:35 - income statement and this is how we
12:37 - often write our
12:41 - expenses sales minus cost of good is
12:44 - gross profit minus operating expenses
12:46 - equals net profit the net profit is the
12:48 - bottom line
12:50 - what we're going to do is create a
12:51 - common size income statement that means
12:54 - that each line
12:56 - is as a percent of sales
13:01 - so we take each line and we divide it by
13:04 - sales so our sales line is going to be
13:07 - 20 million dollars i'm gonna write
13:09 - million
13:10 - that's okay because i can cancel it out
13:13 - 20 million over 20 million equals
13:16 - 100 percent so i write one hundred
13:20 - percent
13:21 - our sales line is always a hundred
13:23 - percent
13:24 - next we do our cost of goods sold and
13:26 - that's going to be 12 million dollars
13:29 - divided by 20 million dollars
13:32 - cancel out those millions and we end up
13:34 - with 60 percent
13:39 - we have two choices for the gross profit
13:42 - we can observe that gross profit is 100
13:46 - minus 60 equals 40 percent but we can
13:50 - also
13:51 - observe that 8 million dollars
13:55 - divided by 20 million dollars
13:58 - equals 40 percent
14:02 - so either way works
14:04 - next we're going to do our operating
14:07 - expenses
14:09 - operating expenses is 5 million
14:13 - divided by 20 million dollars
14:16 - is 25
14:21 - subtract again and we end up with 15
14:24 - percent
14:26 - the important things are these two
14:28 - numbers
14:30 - gross profit divided by sales
14:34 - is called something special it is the
14:36 - percent gross margin
14:44 - that's going to be the gross profit
14:47 - divided by sales
14:50 - the one at the bottom here this is
14:52 - called the percent net margin
15:00 - and that's going to be the net profit
15:02 - divided by sales sometimes we call this
15:04 - pgm and sometimes we call this pnm
15:09 - and these are both examples of profit
15:11 - margins
15:15 - important thing when you hear margin we
15:17 - always divide by the sales
15:24 - question three finally we're going to
15:27 - use the concept of percent net margin or
15:30 - profit margin
15:31 - to be able to compare our two lemonade
15:34 - stands so let's remember back to the
15:36 - last video when we had sam and charlie
15:44 - sam and charlie had sales of 300
15:51 - and they had a net profit
15:54 - of 180
15:57 - that gives them a percent net margin of
16:01 - i'm gonna write
16:02 - the formula
16:03 - again net profit divided by sales is 180
16:09 - divided by 300. this gives us 60 percent
16:15 - minute maid
16:18 - has a p
16:20 - n m
16:22 - as we already calculated before of 15
16:27 - so we've got
16:29 - 15 percent
16:30 - and we've got 60 percent
16:33 - which one is better
16:36 - i'm going to go with sam and charlie
16:46 - so sam and charlie have a much smaller
16:48 - business but they have higher profit
16:51 - margins
16:53 - because they're keeping more of their
16:56 - money
16:59 - for every dollar in sales
17:06 - sam and charlie
17:10 - keep
17:11 - 60 cents
17:15 - for every dollar in sales
17:23 - minute maid
17:26 - keeps
17:28 - only 15 cents
17:31 - keep less of their money 85 cents goes
17:34 - to expenses
17:39 - now
17:40 - which one is the better business that's
17:42 - harder to compare sam and charlie with
17:44 - their small stand probably can't compete
17:46 - with minute maid on an international
17:48 - basis but just based on margins they're
17:52 - keeping more of their money
17:57 - hi now we're going to do a more
17:59 - complicated example
18:01 - sarah likes to keep the investments in
18:03 - her rrsp that's a registered retirement
18:06 - savings program in a ratio of 1 to 3 to
18:10 - 2 in cash bonds and stocks last year she
18:13 - invested twelve thousand dollars in
18:15 - total how did she invest her initial
18:17 - twelve thousand dollars
18:20 - first this is a ratio problem we have
18:24 - cash
18:25 - let's switch colors to bonds
18:30 - to stocks
18:33 - is equal to the ratio of one to three
18:37 - to two
18:39 - that means that our total
18:43 - is twelve thousand dollars
18:47 - which is going to be in how many parts
18:49 - it's going to be six parts one plus
18:52 - three plus two
18:55 - we add those together to get the total
18:57 - number of parts
18:59 - so each part
19:03 - is going to be two thousand dollars
19:06 - because two thousand dollars times six
19:09 - equals twelve thousand dollars so we
19:11 - start
19:13 - with twelve thousand dollars
19:15 - i'm going to do our initial percentage
19:18 - as a fraction instead of as a percent
19:22 - cash is going to be one over six
19:25 - bonds are going to be three over six and
19:28 - stocks are going to be two over six when
19:31 - we add those up together they add up to
19:34 - six over six or a hundred percent
19:37 - i've already said that one part
19:40 - is two thousand dollars so i'm going to
19:42 - fill that in here
19:46 - three parts then
19:50 - is going to be three times two thousand
19:53 - dollars
19:54 - which is six thousand dollars
19:58 - and finally two
20:01 - parts
20:03 - is going to be two times two thousand
20:05 - dollars is four thousand dollars
20:08 - when i add those up together and try
20:10 - them they do add up to twelve thousand
20:13 - dollars
20:16 - over the year her cash investments rose
20:19 - by three percent her bonds by eight
20:21 - percent and her stocks lowered by two
20:23 - percent that means she lost money what
20:25 - was her profit or loss over the year
20:28 - for part b we're going to look at
20:30 - percent change so start with three
20:34 - percent so percent change
20:39 - is always done by the old value
20:43 - times one plus the change
20:45 - i'm going to call that r equals the new
20:48 - value
20:49 - so for cash
20:51 - we end up with two thousand dollars
20:55 - one plus 0.03
20:59 - equals
21:01 - 2000 times
21:03 - 1.03
21:05 - which is 2060.
21:12 - that's today's value
21:15 - another way to do that would be to find
21:17 - the interest
21:20 - that would just be that two thousand
21:22 - dollars
21:23 - times
21:24 - 0.03 which is 60 dollars so we would put
21:29 - sixty dollars in here
21:32 - for bonds let's do the interest instead
21:34 - of the total
21:35 - we'll end up with six thousand dollars
21:39 - times
21:40 - 0.08 that's eight percent
21:43 - and that gives us four hundred and
21:45 - eighty dollars
21:48 - so i put that in there
21:50 - which means that i have a total of six
21:52 - thousand four hundred and eighty dollars
21:56 - finally stocks is a loss
21:58 - that's okay
22:00 - we can just still multiply four thousand
22:02 - dollars
22:03 - times
22:04 - negative 0.02
22:07 - which gives us a negative number that
22:10 - negative number is 80.
22:12 - so she lost 80 dollars
22:17 - to show how the stocks would look like
22:19 - when we do the total
22:22 - or the new value we would say 4 thousand
22:25 - dollars
22:26 - times one minus 0.02
22:30 - which is going to be
22:34 - 3920
22:38 - or
22:39 - four thousand dollars
22:41 - minus eighty dollars
22:43 - giving us
22:44 - a total
22:46 - of four hundred and sixty dollars worth
22:48 - of interest 60 plus 480 minus 80
22:52 - giving us now a total of 12
22:55 - 460 or 12 000 plus 460.
23:01 - now we get to part c the final and more
23:05 - difficult part the problem with this is
23:08 - that now we have more money but her
23:11 - money is no longer evenly balanced
23:15 - because sarah lost money in stocks she
23:18 - doesn't have a ratio of 132 anymore
23:21 - when she invests
23:26 - her 25
23:28 - 40
23:29 - she's going to add that to the 12
23:32 - 460 dollars she already has giving her a
23:36 - total of fifteen thousand dollars so her
23:39 - new total
23:41 - is fifteen thousand dollars that's how
23:44 - much money she
23:45 - has in total with last year's twelve
23:48 - thousand four hundred and
23:49 - plus her this year's 2
23:52 - 540.
23:53 - so what we're going to do now is do the
23:55 - same thing we did before and break that
23:57 - into parts
23:59 - so this is six parts is 15 000. that
24:04 - means that one part
24:11 - is going to be
24:14 - equal to twenty five hundred dollars and
24:18 - i'm going to do that math so one part
24:22 - over six parts
24:24 - is equal to something
24:27 - over fifteen thousand dollars when we
24:29 - cross multiply
24:31 - we get x equals
24:35 - fifteen thousand dollars
24:37 - divided by six
24:39 - and then we get that it is twenty five
24:42 - hundred dollars that means
24:45 - that
24:46 - sarah wants to have 2500
24:50 - in cash
24:52 - meaning she needs to invest an
24:54 - additional 440 which is 2500 minus
25:00 - 20 60.
25:02 - she's going to invest an extra 440
25:05 - in cash
25:07 - for bonds
25:09 - we have three parts
25:12 - is going to be
25:15 - 2500
25:16 - times 3
25:18 - or
25:19 - if you prefer this it's going to be 15
25:22 - 000
25:23 - times that ratio of 3 6. it doesn't
25:26 - matter which way we do it we still get
25:29 - seventy five hundred dollars
25:33 - and stocks we're going to take that 2500
25:36 - times two and end up with five thousand
25:40 - dollars we check when we add those
25:42 - together
25:45 - 2500
25:47 - plus
25:48 - 7500
25:50 - plus 5 000
25:53 - it actually does equal 15 dollars
25:57 - let's finish our differences
25:59 - subtraction tells us we need to invest
26:02 - one thousand and twenty dollars in bonds
26:05 - and more money one thousand and eighty
26:07 - dollars in stocks
26:09 - i'm actually going to check and add
26:11 - those together
26:12 - and
26:14 - not surprisingly it still adds up to
26:16 - 2540.
26:19 - so once sarah invests her money
26:22 - this way
26:23 - she will end up with an evenly balanced
26:26 - portfolio
26:29 - let's talk about markups and markdowns
26:33 - goods travel through many outlets
26:43 - before they reach the consumer
26:55 - i'm going to draw a graph of one item
26:58 - let's say this is a watch we've got the
27:00 - manufacturer
27:06 - have the wholesaler
27:09 - we have a retailer
27:12 - and we have me i'm the consumer
27:17 - what happens with this watch as we go
27:20 - through
27:21 - the watch costs the manufacturer
27:24 - 100
27:26 - in materials and in operating costs
27:29 - let's just go with materials cost of
27:30 - goods sold
27:32 - then
27:34 - the wholesaler is going to pay more for
27:37 - that they're going to pay 145
27:41 - that means that the manufacturer used a
27:43 - markup of 45. they
27:47 - bought it at a hundred dollars and they
27:50 - marked it up or have a profit of forty
27:53 - five dollars and here we're going to
27:55 - continue to just talk about gross
27:57 - profits
27:58 - so forty five dollars happened there
28:01 - the retailer well the retailer is not
28:03 - going to pay 145 the retailer paid
28:07 - 175 dollars meaning we have a markup
28:13 - of 30 dollars
28:17 - finally i pay
28:19 - more than 175 i'm actually going to pay
28:22 - 200
28:24 - for this watch meaning the retailer
28:26 - marks it up by 25
28:29 - so markup in dollars
28:37 - and i'm going to explain why i keep on
28:39 - saying in dollars in a moment
28:42 - is actually equal to the gross profit
28:48 - per item
28:51 - so for one watch the manufacturer
28:55 - makes 45 that's their profit
28:58 - the retailer their profit is 25
29:07 - here the total markup
29:09 - from start to finish
29:15 - on this watch on this item is
29:17 - one hundred dollars
29:22 - that one hundred dollars is divided up
29:24 - forty five dollars goes to the
29:26 - manufacturer
29:32 - next thirty dollars
29:35 - goes to
29:36 - the wholesaler something like costco
29:39 - where the retailer shops
29:41 - or a person
29:42 - who buys from factories and sells just
29:44 - to store the retailer makes 25
29:48 - and that's the store at the mall where i
29:50 - bought my watch i make no money because
29:53 - i'm now wearing the watch so that's our
29:56 - total markup when i add those together
29:58 - it adds to 100
30:00 - total and the profits are divided
30:05 - like we talked about before with margins
30:07 - it makes sense to talk about
30:12 - percent
30:18 - percent
30:20 - markup
30:22 - is equal to markup over cost
30:28 - and we sometimes call that the gross
30:30 - profit per item over the cost
30:34 - or cost of the goods sold so that's the
30:37 - markup here
30:40 - our percent markup
30:42 - and sometimes we just call that markup
30:45 - is
30:47 - 100 in profit
30:49 - over one hundred dollars in cost is one
30:53 - hundred percent
30:55 - or one but let's look at each individual
30:58 - one
30:59 - so we have the manufacturer
31:04 - remember the manufacturer made 45
31:08 - over 100
31:10 - that was the cost is going to be a 45
31:13 - markup
31:18 - when we go to the wholesaler
31:22 - let's just change colors there because
31:24 - why not
31:27 - the wholesaler made thirty dollars right
31:31 - 30 dollars
31:33 - but they also paid more they paid 145
31:37 - because their cost was more
31:40 - that's going to be 20.69
31:44 - markup
31:48 - and finally let's go to the retailer
31:53 - well their profit that was 25
31:57 - but they paid more they actually ended
32:00 - up paying
32:02 - 175 dollars
32:04 - which gives us a markup of
32:07 - 14.29 percent
32:11 - the denominator here changes because it
32:14 - was the cost at each step
32:16 - what happens when i add these things
32:18 - together
32:19 - i end up with
32:21 - a round that means around 80 percent
32:28 - i'm going to cross that out don't add
32:30 - these when you add them together
32:35 - with
32:36 - you end up with nonsense something that
32:38 - doesn't make a lot of sense and that's
32:41 - because those bases were different the
32:43 - denominators of those fractions were
32:45 - different and that's what's giving us a
32:48 - problem the total markup as we know
32:51 - is a hundred percent even if those
32:53 - numbers don't add that way and that was
32:56 - because a hundred dollars profit over a
32:58 - hundred dollars cost equals one hundred
33:01 - percent
33:04 - okay
33:05 - let's talk about margins and markups
33:16 - percent margin versus percent markup
33:21 - margin is based on sales
33:27 - markup is cost as a base
33:30 - those are different
33:32 - margin
33:37 - is equal to
33:39 - gross profit over sales and this is the
33:42 - percent gross margin which is the one
33:44 - we're normally worrying about right now
33:47 - and here percent markup
33:50 - is the same
33:52 - amount or numerator but a different base
33:58 - try to figure out a way to remember this
34:00 - i tend to use markup has a co sound cost
34:04 - has a co sound
34:05 - margin no ku sound sales no cosound
34:12 - that's my mnemonic for remembering why
34:16 - margin goes with sales
34:18 - and markup goes with costs
34:22 - that may or may not be helpful to you
34:26 - let's go through one example of this
34:30 - a different example
34:33 - so let's pretend
34:37 - an item costs
34:39 - one hundred dollars to buy in a store
34:42 - the store
34:44 - paid forty dollars
34:48 - the gross profit is going to be sixty
34:51 - dollars
34:53 - so
34:56 - i bought
34:57 - uh groceries for a hundred dollars it
34:59 - cost the store
35:03 - and then we have stores profit
35:08 - using this basic we can do both the
35:11 - percent margin
35:13 - and the percent markup percent margin
35:17 - is profit over sales
35:21 - here that's going to be sixty dollars
35:24 - over one hundred dollars and that equals
35:26 - to sixty percent
35:31 - percent markup on the other hand
35:34 - well that's equal to profit over cost
35:39 - which is still 60
35:42 - the cost is only forty dollars which
35:46 - gives us
35:47 - 150 percent
35:49 - that's okay
35:52 - i'm gonna note that markup
35:56 - can be very big
36:01 - however margin
36:04 - is always going to be less than a
36:06 - hundred
36:10 - percent let's do an example this is
36:13 - question one
36:15 - arizona computers marks up merchandise
36:17 - by 25
36:19 - part a if a laptop costs 500
36:22 - how much would it sell for now write
36:24 - down some formulas to start
36:27 - let's remember
36:29 - that percent
36:31 - markup
36:32 - equals profit over cost
36:38 - i like to start all these questions by
36:40 - writing down an abbreviated income
36:43 - statement sales minus costs equals
36:46 - profit here we're talking about gross
36:50 - profit
36:51 - but in essence it doesn't matter overly
36:53 - we're just going to say sales minus cost
36:55 - equals profit
36:56 - now i'm going to fill in the things i
36:58 - know from the problem i know
37:00 - that markup
37:02 - is 25
37:05 - or 0.25
37:08 - i know that sales
37:12 - is what i'm looking for the sales price
37:14 - i know that cost to the store is 500
37:19 - and i know that profit is well i don't
37:23 - know that yet so i'm going to have to
37:25 - find that out
37:27 - let's look at this expression
37:32 - i've got
37:36 - profit
37:39 - equals cost
37:42 - times 0.25
37:45 - this is formula
37:49 - in fact
37:52 - i can write here that
37:55 - profit
37:57 - equals cost
37:59 - times the percent markup
38:04 - remember that one
38:06 - i can also write this
38:18 - sales equals costs plus one percent
38:21 - story sales equals cost
38:24 - times one plus the percent markup
38:27 - here i'm gonna fill in what i know the
38:29 - cost is five 500
38:32 - and the markup is
38:35 - 0.25
38:37 - that means that the sales
38:40 - is going to be
38:42 - 625 dollars
38:46 - i can write that in here
38:49 - if we needed to how much would the
38:50 - profit be
38:52 - the profit would be 625 minus 500 equals
38:56 - 125
38:58 - dollars
38:59 - also note
39:02 - if i use this equation
39:07 - 500
39:08 - times 0.25
39:10 - i'm going to come up with exactly 125
39:14 - that's the profit
39:19 - let's continue on with part b
39:21 - now we're talking about a different
39:23 - object a desktop that sells for 750 and
39:26 - we're going to find the cost
39:29 - i'm going to remember
39:33 - that percent markup
39:37 - equals 0.25
39:41 - and i'm going to write that same
39:42 - expression down sales minus cost equals
39:46 - profit
39:48 - this time
39:49 - i know
39:50 - just the sales price
39:54 - and i'm trying to find the cost
39:59 - so what we are going to do now
40:02 - is solve this problem
40:06 - using the
40:08 - expression earlier i said that sales
40:12 - equals cost
40:14 - times 1 plus the percent markup
40:19 - if i divide both sides
40:23 - by one plus the markup
40:26 - i'm just gonna say
40:29 - percent m for now
40:32 - this will cancel out as long as it's not
40:35 - equal to zero and i end up with this
40:36 - expression cost equals sales
40:40 - over one plus the percent markup
40:47 - that's another good formula that we can
40:50 - use anytime we need all i have to do is
40:53 - plug in the numbers that i know sales is
40:56 - 750
40:58 - and markup
41:00 - is
41:01 - 0.25 so i get 750
41:05 - over 1.25 which equals 600 dollars i put
41:10 - that in here
41:11 - so now we know the cost and if i need to
41:13 - know
41:14 - 150 dollars was the profit let's do a
41:18 - check
41:21 - profit
41:22 - over cost
41:24 - equals 150
41:26 - over 600 dollars
41:29 - which is exactly 25 percent
41:33 - that's always a good thing to do check
41:36 - to make sure that our work is correct
41:38 - now let's go on to part c
41:41 - the company had total sales of a hundred
41:43 - and fifty thousand dollars for the month
41:46 - calculate the cost of goods sold and
41:48 - gross profit and percent margin so now
41:51 - we have a lot more information about
41:53 - this company i'm going to scroll this up
41:56 - but i'm still going to remember
41:58 - percent markup for this entire problem
42:01 - was 25
42:04 - that's important to know
42:05 - and as usual let's just start with the
42:08 - same co income statement sales minus
42:12 - cost
42:13 - equals profit instead of one item now
42:16 - i'm talking about many items but it
42:18 - doesn't matter because the math is
42:20 - exactly the same i know i have sales of
42:23 - a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
42:26 - so what is my cost of good sold one
42:30 - there
42:31 - it is
42:36 - i'm correcting that
42:38 - okay
42:39 - so cogs is the same as cost
42:44 - and we're just going to say that's sales
42:46 - over 1 plus the percent markup
42:51 - in other words we have 150 000
42:56 - over 1.25
42:58 - which is 120 000
43:03 - so
43:05 - 120 000
43:07 - and that gives us a gross profit of 30
43:11 - dollars
43:14 - we also needed the percent margin
43:18 - and that's going to be percent gross
43:19 - margin because we don't have any
43:21 - information about operating expenses
43:25 - so the margin is always going to be
43:27 - equal to
43:29 - profit over sales
43:33 - so here we have thirty thousand dollars
43:37 - over a hundred and fifty thousand
43:39 - dollars
43:40 - same numerator as the markup but a
43:44 - different denominator or base
43:47 - this gives us twenty percent
43:50 - so
43:51 - that is our percent margin
43:58 - let's go back to that finding a percent
44:00 - margin i'm going to go based on my
44:03 - laptop remember the laptop that we
44:05 - worked on in part a
44:08 - so our laptop
44:10 - had sales
44:12 - minus cost
44:14 - equals profit
44:16 - and in that case it was
44:20 - 625
44:23 - our cost was 500
44:26 - leaving us with a profit of 125.
44:29 - here the percent margin
44:35 - would be
44:36 - 125
44:38 - over
44:39 - 625 which equals 20
44:44 - let's do it one more time
44:48 - change colors because i enjoy that
44:51 - desktop we've got sales
44:54 - cost
44:56 - profit
44:59 - here the sales price of a desktop was
45:01 - 750 dollars and the cost was 600 giving
45:06 - us a profit of 150
45:09 - so our percent margin
45:12 - is 150
45:14 - over 750 which equals 20 percent
45:19 - no matter how we do this these are all
45:22 - the same 20
45:24 - 20 20
45:26 - that's because the markup and margin are
45:29 - always travel together scroll down here
45:33 - and just say
45:35 - a markup of 25
45:40 - is always
45:43 - equal to
45:46 - a margin
45:49 - of 20
45:52 - those things travel together
45:56 - continuing with question one we're going
45:58 - to start talking about markdowns or
46:00 - discounts remember arizona computers
46:03 - marks up its merchandise by 25 percent
46:06 - that means the percent markup which
46:09 - equals profit over cost
46:13 - equals 0.25
46:16 - now we're going to talk about a discount
46:18 - the company is having a sale where all
46:20 - goods are marked down by 10
46:24 - of their selling price if a tablet is on
46:26 - sale for 200
46:28 - how much did it cost
46:30 - so
46:30 - let's talk about this problem again
46:34 - we've got a markup of 25
46:36 - which means that we have a margin
46:40 - of 20
46:42 - which is what we found out in part
46:45 - c
46:47 - i'm going to use the following formula
46:50 - and that is going to be
46:52 - new price
46:55 - equals old price
46:59 - times 1 minus the discount we usually
47:02 - call that d
47:05 - when i divide both sides by 1 minus the
47:07 - discount or move it around i end up with
47:12 - old price
47:14 - equals new price
47:17 - over one minus the discount
47:23 - okay this is a two-step problem
47:31 - so step one
47:33 - is
47:34 - find the old price
47:39 - once we have that we can start working
47:41 - on the cost so we know that new price
47:48 - equals
47:51 - hundred dollars
47:53 - and we know that the discount
47:58 - is ten percent
48:00 - 0.10 or 10 percent
48:03 - that means that the old price
48:07 - equals new price
48:10 - instead of writing new i'm just going to
48:12 - put in 200
48:14 - over 1 minus 0.1
48:18 - which is the same as 200
48:21 - over 0.9
48:25 - here when i run that through i'm going
48:27 - to come up with
48:32 - 222 dollars and 22 cents
48:37 - i'm gonna round this originally there
48:40 - was a bunch of twos
48:43 - rounding that could be a video all on
48:45 - its own
48:46 - i can't sell something for a fraction of
48:49 - a cent that's against the law a cent or
48:51 - one hundredth of a dollar is the
48:53 - smallest proportion i can use i'm going
48:55 - to round that
48:57 - so now
48:58 - i've got part two
49:02 - going to find the cost
49:04 - so i've got
49:06 - sales
49:07 - minus cost
49:09 - equals profit
49:12 - the original price
49:15 - was 222 dollars and 22 cents and i know
49:20 - that the markup was 25
49:23 - which means that cost
49:25 - equals
49:28 - sales over
49:31 - the markup
49:32 - one plus the markup
49:40 - run that through my calculator and i'm
49:42 - going to end up with 177.78
49:48 - that was the original cost
49:50 - i'm going to write a sentence to finish
49:51 - that one off
49:59 - okay
50:01 - [Music]
50:03 - let's talk a little bit more of markups
50:05 - and markdowns i'm going to go through an
50:07 - example scroll this up
50:11 - i'm gonna buy
50:13 - a pair of apple
50:15 - brand air pods
50:18 - for 200.
50:23 - so i get those into my store
50:27 - now my store is going to have
50:32 - a 15
50:33 - markup
50:37 - today only
50:42 - there is
50:44 - a 15
50:45 - off sale
50:47 - sale is the same as a discount or
50:50 - markdown
50:56 - what's our profit on a pair of air pods
51:03 - well let's run through using our
51:06 - formulas the original price
51:15 - is actually
51:18 - two hundred dollars
51:20 - times one plus the markup
51:30 - i'm going to write down the formula
51:31 - underneath and that gives me a normal
51:34 - sales price of 230 dollars
51:38 - but now i've got a discount
51:44 - so new price
51:45 - equals old price
51:49 - times 1 minus the discount let's write
51:52 - down that formula and then let's put in
51:55 - our old price is 230
51:58 - and our discount is 15
52:03 - when i run that one through my
52:04 - calculator i'm just going to note
52:07 - that 1 minus 15
52:10 - is 0.85
52:12 - i end up with
52:14 - 195 dollars and 50 cents so what was my
52:18 - profit
52:20 - well it's not a profit it's a loss
52:26 - i lost 400 400 4.50
52:31 - for every set of airpods i sold
52:37 - that's not good for my business as soon
52:39 - as i'm having a loss or a negative
52:41 - profit we're in trouble i'm going to
52:43 - write the moral of the story and that is
52:46 - 15 markup
52:49 - plus 15 mark down
52:55 - is not zero
52:58 - why isn't it and that has to do with the
53:00 - same reason when we were adding before
53:02 - when we talked about markups our base is
53:05 - different the base being 230 is
53:08 - different than the base being
53:10 - 200.
53:14 - let's do one more question to learn more
53:16 - about markups and margins
53:19 - artco fine handbags prices its products
53:21 - to give a 40 margin what rate of markup
53:24 - do they use
53:27 - let's remind ourselves first of what our
53:29 - formulas are percent margin
53:32 - no cosound is profit over sales
53:38 - percent markup
53:40 - with that
53:41 - sound hard k
53:43 - is profit over cost
53:47 - those are the two formulas we're going
53:49 - to use
53:51 - i'm going to
53:52 - put in something that we're going to use
53:54 - throughout this course and also in math
54:01 - when there are no numbers and there's no
54:03 - cost sales or profit
54:06 - just make something up
54:14 - we can do that because as we saw in our
54:16 - last example
54:18 - proportionately the markup and margin
54:20 - are always the same so it doesn't matter
54:22 - what we do when we know the margin
54:27 - i like to set sales to be a hundred
54:30 - dollars
54:31 - because 100
54:32 - is easy to use
54:38 - so let's pretend
54:40 - we have sales of a hundred dollars
54:43 - so we've got sales
54:45 - of 100
54:47 - minus some sort of cost
54:49 - over profit
54:52 - well
54:53 - what's our profit
54:55 - profit is 40 percent of sales
55:06 - or 0.40
55:09 - times sales and that comes from this
55:12 - formula percent margin equals profit
55:14 - over sales multiply both sides by sales
55:17 - and we come up with profit equals
55:18 - percent margin times sales so our profit
55:22 - here is going to be 0.4
55:25 - times 100
55:27 - which is 40 dollars okay fill that one
55:31 - in
55:34 - i made a hundred dollars in sales my
55:37 - profit was 40 all i need to do is
55:40 - subtract to come up with a cost of 60
55:43 - so my percent markup
55:48 - is going to be 40 over
55:51 - 60
55:52 - or two-thirds and i'm going to
55:56 - round that
55:57 - to 66.66666
56:00 - or sixty six
56:03 - point six seven percent
56:05 - when in doubt two decimal places after
56:08 - the percent sign
56:11 - here we could have set sales to be
56:13 - anything we wanted had i set sales to be
56:17 - one dollar
56:18 - i would have
56:20 - 60 cents
56:22 - worth of cost and 40 cents worth of
56:26 - sales i also could have sorry worth of
56:28 - profit i also could have set sales to be
56:31 - 237 but that makes the arithmetic harder
56:34 - one a hundred ten a thousand those are
56:37 - easier numbers to work with
56:40 - i'm going to do parts b and c together
56:43 - because they really travel together our
56:45 - company had profits of six hundred
56:47 - thousand so what was their cost of goods
56:49 - sold
56:50 - well let's go back to our percent markup
56:54 - percent
56:55 - markup is profit over cost
57:02 - so 0.6667
57:05 - is equal to the profit 600 000
57:09 - over
57:10 - cost or we end up with cost
57:14 - equals
57:16 - six hundred thousand dollars
57:20 - divided by zero point six six six seven
57:24 - i wanna make a note if this algebra is
57:27 - tough for you that's a good reason to go
57:30 - back into the homeworks and look at the
57:32 - introductory lesson 0 homeworks there's
57:35 - lots of good algebra there i'm going to
57:37 - go back to this question
57:39 - all we have to do
57:41 - is say that this is actually nine
57:42 - hundred thousand dollars
57:45 - let's go into part c right away i wanted
57:48 - to do these together because what i
57:50 - really want to do is an income statement
57:53 - sales minus cost of goods sold equals
57:56 - gross profit minus operating expenses
57:59 - equals net profit
58:02 - this is always a good way to start okay
58:04 - they had profits of
58:07 - thousand dollars and here i'm going to
58:10 - note it doesn't say so but this must be
58:13 - gross profit or it doesn't make sense
58:16 - so under gross profit i'm going to write
58:19 - 600
58:21 - thousand dollars i'm gonna write in my
58:24 - costs of nine hundred thousand dollars
58:27 - and then i'm gonna go upwards and note
58:30 - that sales must be
58:32 - nine hundred thousand dollars i'm gonna
58:34 - use k for thousand plus six hundred
58:36 - thousand dollars
58:37 - and that ends up with one point five
58:40 - million
58:42 - let's write that in
58:44 - okay
58:46 - operating cost net profit
58:50 - right now right next to this i'm going
58:52 - to draw a common line income statement
58:55 - 100 percent
58:59 - i know the gross profit is 40
59:02 - because that's the margin
59:06 - we've already done that one and we know
59:08 - here then
59:10 - that the cost of goods sold is sixty
59:12 - percent what do i know the operating
59:15 - expenses are five percent of sales
59:19 - five percent that means that op is going
59:22 - to be
59:24 - take that sales
59:26 - and multiply it by five percent
59:29 - that gives us 75 000
59:34 - i put that into here
59:38 - now i have two options i can do just
59:41 - subtraction that gives me a net profit
59:44 - of hundred and twenty five thousand
59:46 - dollars
59:47 - but i can also subtract these together
59:50 - forty percent minus five percent equals
59:52 - thirty five percent percent
59:55 - net margin
59:58 - it's difficult to know whether people
59:59 - are talking about gross margins and net
60:01 - margins when in doubt always try to
60:04 - clarify
60:08 - in case we want to check our work we can
60:10 - note
60:11 - that
60:12 - 35
60:14 - of 1.5 million
60:20 - is equal to
60:21 - 525 000 so we get the same answer either
60:25 - way
60:26 - finally let's do part d
60:29 - the most recent shipment of bags had a
60:31 - cost of 270 000
60:34 - what is the selling price well this is
60:37 - back to the basics and we have sales
60:40 - equals cost times 1 plus the percent
60:44 - markup
60:46 - when i put this together i end up with
60:49 - 270 000
60:52 - and i know my markup it's one plus 0.6
60:59 - in general it's better not to round but
61:02 - rounding in this case won't come up with
61:04 - a really big problem because we end up
61:06 - with sales of 450 000. hi today we're
61:10 - going to talk about trade and cash
61:12 - discounts
61:14 - a trade discount
61:19 - is a different way
61:21 - of looking at markups instead of looking
61:25 - at it as marking up we're going to look
61:27 - at it backwards
61:32 - so let's look again at some sort of
61:36 - item going through the chain the supply
61:39 - chain let's start with the manufacturer
61:43 - this time we're going to go straight to
61:45 - the retailer and skip the wholesaler
61:47 - step
61:48 - and then the consumer so we have a good
61:51 - it travels from the manufacturer to the
61:53 - retailer to the consumer at each step
61:57 - someone is paying money
61:59 - let's look at the retailer the retailer
62:02 - purchases it for 200
62:05 - from the manufacturer and they're going
62:07 - to go ahead and sell that item to me
62:10 - for 250
62:15 - so the retailer
62:19 - makes 250
62:21 - every time they sell an item
62:25 - each item costs them 200
62:28 - and then we have that gross profit per
62:30 - item or markup in dollars which is fifty
62:33 - dollars and that is
62:36 - let's call that markup
62:38 - in dollars
62:40 - or gross profit
62:42 - when we look at this as a percent
62:45 - we can see
62:49 - that markup
62:51 - is going to be gross profit or markup in
62:54 - dollars over cost which is 50
62:58 - over 200 and that is 25
63:02 - so the markup is 50 or 25
63:06 - that's one model of looking at how the
63:09 - retailer buys it when the retailer sets
63:11 - the price
63:12 - we have another model
63:14 - i'm going to call this the apple model
63:16 - because it's the way that apple sells
63:18 - their products
63:20 - in this model the manufacturer sets the
63:23 - price not the retailer
63:29 - let's write that down they set the price
63:31 - not
63:36 - the retailer
63:38 - the store then
63:39 - bought an item
63:42 - let's say those airpod earbuds or some
63:44 - sort of apple produm
63:48 - they bought a 250 item
63:53 - with a discount
63:56 - and i'm going to call this a trade
63:57 - discount
63:59 - because
64:00 - that's a
64:01 - discount for being a retailer
64:04 - of 50
64:05 - so they had a 50
64:06 - discount
64:08 - and that's going to be
64:11 - at what percent
64:13 - or that would be 50
64:16 - over 250
64:19 - that's a 20
64:21 - discount so
64:24 - they bought that 250 dollar item at a
64:27 - discount
64:31 - let's look at the supply chain from the
64:33 - way the retailer buys at
64:36 - we're going to say the retailer they buy
64:38 - from their manufacturer and then they
64:40 - sell it the consumer
64:43 - and on the way they mark it up
64:46 - by 25
64:48 - from 200 to 250 or
64:51 - they mark it down by 20
64:55 - and that is going the opposite direction
65:02 - so
65:02 - moral of this story is
65:05 - a 25 markup
65:10 - is the same
65:13 - as a 20
65:16 - discount
65:19 - that's how that trade discount works
65:24 - now let's talk about chained discounts
65:27 - that's going to be when we have more
65:29 - than one discount and we're going to see
65:31 - in our examples this happens all the
65:34 - time
65:39 - so
65:40 - let's say you go to a store and they
65:42 - have a sale 25
65:44 - off
65:45 - plus today only
65:50 - an additional
65:51 - five percent
65:55 - that's a good sale
65:57 - what we do is we
65:59 - apply one discount
66:03 - than the other one
66:09 - so let's look at
66:11 - pretending that we have something that's
66:14 - worth a hundred dollars
66:16 - so if we have
66:20 - our original price
66:23 - is 100
66:25 - then our new price
66:28 - is going to be 100
66:30 - times 1 minus 0.25
66:33 - or 75
66:37 - then we apply the next one
66:40 - today only
66:42 - so today's price is going to be 75
66:47 - minus 5
66:51 - that is
66:52 - 71
66:54 - and 25 cents
66:57 - that's the price we're paying today
67:00 - but wait a second
67:03 - twenty five percent plus five percent
67:06 - equals thirty percent
67:11 - seventy five
67:12 - a hundred dollars
67:15 - times one minus thirty percent is
67:18 - seventy dollars so this
67:21 - is not the same
67:24 - and we've seen this before the moral of
67:26 - the story is never add
67:31 - because we're really using proportions
67:33 - with different bases this doesn't make
67:36 - sense
67:37 - what we're really going to end up doing
67:39 - is multiplying them together we could do
67:41 - this all
67:43 - in one
67:45 - stage
67:50 - question one a company makes snowboards
67:53 - that retail at
67:55 - thousand two hundred and fifty dollars
67:57 - the company offers chain discounts of
67:59 - thirty percent five percent with
68:00 - retailers calculate the price a retailer
68:03 - would pay for the snowboards
68:05 - why are there multiple
68:07 - discounts sometimes that's everybody
68:09 - gets 30 and 5 is for clients who pay on
68:13 - time or clients who have a long
68:14 - relationship there's many reasons to
68:17 - have a chained discount
68:19 - the price that we
68:21 - the consumer would pay is called the
68:23 - list price here it's one thousand two
68:25 - hundred and fifty dollars
68:27 - our cost is going to be our list
68:32 - times one minus the discount one
68:35 - one minus discount two
68:38 - and all we have to do is put our numbers
68:40 - in there our list price is one thousand
68:43 - two hundred and fifty
68:45 - one minus zero point three oh and one
68:48 - minus zero point oh five let's simplify
68:51 - that before i put that in a calculator
68:55 - just because it's easier to put in a
68:57 - calculator
68:58 - when we simplify it a little bit
69:01 - running that through
69:02 - we end up with
69:04 - 831
69:07 - cents
69:11 - that's what a retailer is going to pay
69:14 - even though the consumers are going to
69:15 - pay a lot more for their snowboard
69:19 - a good question to ask is what single
69:21 - discount
69:23 - or single equivalent discount is
69:25 - equivalent to these two discounts that's
69:27 - a lot of words
69:29 - what that means is instead of saying
69:31 - thirty percent and five percent we could
69:33 - just say one number like 38
69:37 - or 40 percent
69:39 - one thing to remember from before
69:43 - we know it isn't
69:46 - 30 plus five percent
69:49 - equals thirty five percent that's
69:51 - definitely not going to be the answer
69:53 - let's put an x right through that
69:56 - but we're gonna still use two different
69:57 - methods so method one
70:01 - we're going to take the old price
70:04 - and the new price as a proportion so we
70:06 - take the new price
70:08 - or the cost
70:10 - over the old price or the list
70:13 - and
70:13 - look at them as a proportion so i've got
70:16 - 831.25
70:19 - divided by the list price of 12.50 and
70:22 - when i put those together i have 0.665
70:26 - that means that we paid
70:30 - 66 and a half percent of lists
70:35 - or we had a discount
70:40 - of 1 minus 0.665
70:43 - equals
70:45 - 34.5 33 sorry 0.5 percent
70:52 - let's just scroll down a little bit more
70:54 - now let's try another
70:56 - method either of these works there's
71:00 - more methods even than i'm saying that's
71:02 - one of the things with the algebra but
71:03 - whatever method you're using you want it
71:05 - to work
71:08 - i'm going to take the price
71:10 - and i'm going to put it on both sides of
71:12 - my equation then i'm going to use a
71:14 - different color and you'll see why
71:16 - price times 1 minus
71:21 - 1 minus our discount i'm going to call
71:23 - our single discount x because x often
71:26 - stands for unknown it's the same as
71:28 - price 1 minus 0.301
71:32 - minus
71:34 - minus 0.05
71:36 - let's just erase that
71:40 - because we have price on both sides and
71:42 - our price is non-zero
71:45 - we can just cancel those numbers out so
71:47 - now i have one minus x
71:49 - equals zero point seven
71:52 - zero 0.05
71:56 - sorry nine five
71:59 - i multiply this through and i get
72:05 - one minus x equals 0.665
72:10 - that's familiar which means x equals
72:13 - 0.335
72:16 - or 33.5
72:20 - notice that both methods are giving us
72:22 - the same answer this one is more algebra
72:25 - and this one uses the numbers you
72:27 - already know
72:30 - now let's look at what the percent
72:32 - markup is to the retailers well this is
72:35 - something that we know how to do percent
72:38 - markup equals profit over cost
72:45 - i know that the sales price or list
72:49 - price is 12.50
72:52 - the cost
72:54 - is going to be 835
72:58 - 831.25
73:02 - which means that my gross profit per
73:04 - item
73:06 - must be
73:08 - 418
73:11 - dollars and 75 cents
73:15 - when i put this together
73:18 - let's change colors because why not i
73:21 - end up with 418
73:23 - 75 over
73:26 - 831.25
73:30 - which gives me
73:32 - 50.38 percent markup
73:35 - a nice healthy
73:37 - markup
73:41 - now part d due to a slowdown in sales
73:44 - the manufacturer would like to increase
73:45 - the total discount given to its
73:47 - retailers to 40 percent what additional
73:50 - discount must they offer
73:55 - this is asking us to find one more
73:58 - discount
73:59 - d so that i can come up with this
74:02 - equation i'm going to say
74:04 - 1250
74:08 - 1 minus 0.30
74:12 - 1 minus 0.05
74:15 - 1 minus d and i don't know what d is
74:19 - is equal to
74:20 - right in that 1250 again
74:25 - 1 minus
74:26 - 0.5
74:29 - once we have it written out this way
74:31 - there's lots of ways we can solve it
74:34 - i like to observe that that 1250 is the
74:36 - same on both sides so i don't actually
74:38 - need to know what that is
74:39 - i also know what one minus 0.3 and 1
74:42 - minus 0.05 is
74:44 - that is the same as 1 minus
74:49 - 0.335 because we've done that 1 minus d
74:53 - equals 1 minus 0.4 is 0.60
74:58 - so now
75:00 - i can divide both sides by 1 minus 0.335
75:09 - and that's just 0.665
75:13 - we know that and we end up with
75:21 - d equals 1 minus 0.9023
75:26 - or the discount is 9.77
75:30 - percent
75:33 - three discounts
75:39 - thirty percent
75:40 - five percent
75:42 - nine point seven seven percent when i
75:44 - add them together and chain them
75:46 - properly that is the same as forty
75:49 - percent
75:51 - just one note on these videos
75:54 - i'm not as amazing as a at arithmetic as
75:56 - it looks like i pause these videos to
75:58 - use my calculator and i encourage you to
76:00 - do the same get out your calculator and
76:03 - use it to compute as you go along
76:07 - okay now we're going to talk about cash
76:10 - discounts and payment terms
76:12 - these are things
76:14 - that are going to incentivize us to pay
76:17 - erla early
76:21 - or to pay in cash
76:23 - instead of credit
76:25 - you might have seen this before you go
76:27 - to a restaurant and there's a cash
76:29 - discount of five percent if you pay in
76:31 - cash and don't use a credit card
76:36 - so let's put not credit
76:38 - this is good because it incentivizes our
76:40 - customers to do the things we want when
76:42 - we write down payment terms that include
76:45 - our discounts it looks kind of like this
76:50 - 3-10
76:52 - i'm going to write some more things here
76:57 - and
76:58 - 45
77:00 - and there's some other stuff here
77:03 - this means
77:06 - there is a three percent discount
77:12 - if you pay within 10 days
77:19 - otherwise
77:23 - the net
77:24 - that's where the n comes from
77:27 - the net or
77:28 - everything all the money
77:31 - is due in 45 days
77:38 - 3 10 and 45 3 discount 10 days net
77:43 - everything due in 45 days then we put
77:46 - some extra terms here if we need it
77:49 - there's other abbreviations that you can
77:51 - always look up
77:53 - so this bill is due in 45 days i'm just
77:56 - going to put a little
77:57 - asterisks here
77:59 - any discount is for goods only
78:06 - not
78:07 - on your tax
78:09 - or your delivery etc that goes to a
78:12 - third party so you don't get a discount
78:14 - from the post office for paying early
78:20 - let's look at a sample invoice here we
78:23 - have an invoice
78:25 - it's dated it looks like
78:28 - it is dated may 12 2020 that's right
78:32 - around the time that i'm recording this
78:33 - video coincidentally
78:36 - and it is from bcit
78:41 - and it's to
78:43 - me
78:44 - amy gold list
78:46 - it has some important things like
78:48 - addresses bcit's logo
78:51 - importantly my customer id
78:55 - and over here we've got our shipping
78:56 - method and our terms and our delivery
78:59 - date this should not say 2016. let's
79:02 - change that
79:04 - to 2020.
79:07 - first let's look at these terms
79:10 - 115 and 30. so let's interpret that over
79:15 - here actually let's just write over here
79:19 - 115
79:20 - and 30 rog
79:24 - one percent discount
79:26 - if paid within
79:30 - 15 days
79:35 - or
79:37 - the whole thing is due
79:43 - in 30 days
79:47 - the 30 days
79:49 - is from the receipt of goods
79:53 - rog stands for receipt of goods
79:57 - you can look up different abbreviations
79:59 - that's not super important for this
80:01 - class it just means that if we don't get
80:04 - it until september even though we
80:06 - ordered it in may it's going to take us
80:08 - we don't have to start paying until 30
80:11 - days after september 16th even if it
80:13 - took
80:14 - six months to ship and it looks like
80:16 - we've got two calculators and five sets
80:19 - of course notes
80:21 - looking at this you can see how much it
80:23 - costs forty one dollars per calculator
80:26 - multiply that by two because there's two
80:28 - of those
80:29 - and uh of course notes thirty 31 dollars
80:31 - we multiply that by five because there's
80:33 - five of those we end up with 237 dollars
80:36 - we add in our tax we add in our delivery
80:39 - on top of that and we end up with 30
80:41 - dollars and 44 cents
80:45 - authorized by and date i could sign this
80:47 - one myself even though it's shipped to
80:50 - me
80:51 - the important thing is this starts
80:55 - on september 16th
80:59 - 2020 so it's due
81:02 - on october 16 2020
81:04 - 30 days later
81:11 - now let's do a long question that has
81:14 - all the discounts and payments that
81:16 - we've done so far
81:18 - on november the 3rd the springfield
81:20 - power plant receives 10 fuel rods the
81:22 - rods have a list price of 20 000 each
81:25 - with discounts of 5 and 10 percent and
81:27 - payment terms of 210 115 net 30. what's
81:30 - the last day the invoice can be paid how
81:32 - much must be paid
81:35 - so first let's talk about how much we
81:37 - owe
81:38 - well it starts on november the 3rd and
81:42 - we've said net 30 and that is the same
81:44 - as saying n 30 but often we do just
81:47 - write net
81:48 - the last day that we can pay is december
81:51 - 3rd
81:53 - 30 days after november the 3rd if you're
81:56 - interested in date counting
81:58 - we will be looking at that in the ba 2
82:00 - plus so look forward to a video about
82:03 - counting dates with your ba 2 plus
82:05 - calculator
82:06 - well how much are we going to
82:08 - pay well we have ten fuel rods
82:13 - each fuel rod costs twenty thousand
82:16 - dollars
82:17 - and we also have some discounts one
82:20 - is five percent and one is ten percent
82:24 - we put all of this together
82:27 - dump it into a calculator and we end up
82:29 - with a hundred and seventy one thousand
82:31 - dollars even
82:35 - so we have two discounts here what's the
82:38 - last day the two percent discount may be
82:39 - taken and how much must be paid
82:42 - let me just say we have two discounts we
82:45 - actually don't get them both
82:48 - we get two percent if we pay
82:52 - within 10 days
82:57 - or
82:58 - one percent
83:00 - within
83:01 - 15.
83:05 - we never get both discounts
83:12 - so three percent
83:14 - not gonna happen
83:15 - we only get a one percent on a two
83:17 - percent depending on how much we pay and
83:20 - when so if we add 10 days we end up with
83:24 - november the 3rd plus 10 days
83:29 - equals
83:30 - november the 13th
83:33 - easy how much do we pay
83:39 - well it's a hundred and seventy one
83:41 - thousand dollars is what we're supposed
83:42 - to pay but we take a bit of a discount
83:45 - off of there two percent to be precise
83:47 - which gives us a payment of a hundred
83:50 - and sixty seven thousand
83:52 - five hundred and eighty dollars
83:54 - that's a big discount
83:56 - if we look at it
83:59 - the amount of the discount
84:01 - is a hundred and seventy one thousand
84:05 - times
84:06 - 0.02 two percent of that is thirty four
84:10 - hundred dollars so that two percent is
84:13 - worth getting if we're going to save
84:15 - ourselves three thousand four hundred
84:17 - and twenty dollars almost thirty five
84:19 - hundred dollars
84:21 - let's go back to this problem we
84:24 - actually can't pay the entire thing at
84:26 - once but the supplier offers cash
84:29 - discounts on partial payments
84:31 - so what we're gonna do is pay what we
84:33 - can and then pay the rest later so after
84:36 - five days we pay a hundred thousand
84:38 - dollars and after another fifteen days
84:41 - after the invoice we pay another fifty
84:43 - thousand dollars
84:44 - now we want to know how much we owe
84:46 - to do this let's start with a balance
84:49 - sheet
84:51 - so november third that's our original
84:55 - i'm going to say within 10 days
84:59 - and within 15 days
85:03 - those are our different categories here
85:06 - if we pay within 15 days we get a 1
85:08 - discount and if we pay within 10 days we
85:11 - get a 2 discount so let's start with
85:14 - what we owe
85:16 - we owe 171
85:20 - 000
85:23 - we make our first payment within
85:25 - 10 days that payment is 100 000
85:32 - when we try to do the discount we
85:34 - multiplied it by one minus two percent
85:38 - the opposite is dividing by one minus
85:41 - two percent when we go
85:43 - this way to the left we're going to
85:45 - divide
85:48 - so a hundred thousand dollars
85:53 - divided by one minus point zero two
85:58 - is the same as a hundred and two
86:01 - thousand forty dollars and eighty two
86:04 - cents
86:05 - this is a credit
86:15 - so we have a credit of a hundred
86:18 - thousand
86:19 - two thousand forty dollars and eighty
86:21 - two cents that's what comes off our
86:22 - account which means we now owe less
86:25 - money than if we made that hundred
86:27 - thousand dollars later we actually only
86:30 - owe
86:31 - sixty eight thousand nine hundred fifty
86:33 - nine dollars and eighteen cents now
86:36 - let's make another payment
86:38 - this other payment is going to be
86:42 - 50 000
86:44 - so let's write that in
86:46 - but this payment was within 15 days so
86:49 - we get a one percent discount
86:57 - so we're going to divide that by that
86:58 - one percent
87:00 - so 50 000
87:04 - i'm just going to
87:05 - simplify 1 minus 0.01 to 0.99 and it
87:09 - turns out that the credit for that 50
87:12 - thousand dollars is 50
87:17 - cents 505.05 i subtract that from 68
87:21 - we owe
87:24 - eighteen thousand four hundred fifty
87:26 - four dollars and thirteen cents
87:31 - that's going to be the amount of the
87:32 - final payment
87:36 - okay
87:38 - let's just write down what we did
87:48 - the credit is the payment over one minus
87:51 - the discount
87:53 - the payment that we have to make
87:56 - is the amount we owe or the credit that
87:58 - we want to get times 1 minus the
88:01 - discount
88:05 - i'm going to write that we never ever
88:07 - see
88:08 - 1 plus the discount
88:11 - we're never going to multiply something
88:13 - by 1.02 or divide by 1.02
88:19 - to finish off let's do one more partial
88:21 - payment problem but a difficult one
88:24 - an invoice for ten thousand dollars has
88:26 - payment terms 310 220 and 45. discounts
88:30 - are allowed for partial payments the
88:32 - company made a payment of three thousand
88:33 - dollars nine days after the date of the
88:35 - invoice and the second payment 18 days
88:37 - after the date of the invoice that
88:38 - reduced the balance owing to 2000. what
88:41 - was the size of the second payment
88:44 - it's a difficult one so let's look at
88:46 - our invoice
88:48 - our original one is due within 45 days
88:52 - if we pay within 10 days
88:54 - we get three percent discount
88:58 - and if we pay within it looks like 20
89:01 - days
89:02 - we've got a two percent discount
89:07 - at the beginning it looks like we owe
89:09 - ten thousand dollars
89:13 - let's make a line here we owe ten
89:14 - thousand dollars now let's put in our
89:16 - first payment
89:18 - first payment was three thousand dollars
89:20 - and it was nine days later so it got
89:23 - that discount
89:24 - which means we actually end up with a
89:26 - credit of three thousand dollars over
89:29 - one minus 0.03
89:32 - or
89:38 - three thousand
89:39 - ninety two dollars and seventy eight
89:41 - cents notice that i'm rounding here the
89:44 - rounding is a little bit contentious
89:46 - some people round at the middle some
89:48 - people round to the final step here
89:50 - you'll have to figure out from the
89:52 - supplier what they would prefer
89:54 - which means that now we owe
90:00 - six thousand nine hundred seven dollars
90:03 - and 22
90:04 - cents let's make our next payment
90:08 - our next payment is
90:11 - something
90:12 - if it's something i like to call it x
90:15 - that x payment
90:17 - is worth more
90:19 - than it is because we get a two percent
90:21 - credit
90:24 - when i subtract this i end up with two
90:26 - thousand dollars
90:28 - so let me write that as algebra and scan
90:31 - this up a little bit
90:33 - and i have
90:37 - six thousand nine hundred seven dollars
90:39 - and 22 cents
90:41 - minus x over i'm going to simplify that
90:44 - to 0.98
90:46 - equals
90:47 - 2 000
90:49 - now i've taken my partial payment
90:51 - problem and i've made it an algebra
90:53 - problem
90:55 - which is easier because we know how to
90:57 - solve algebra problems
90:59 - x over 0.98
91:03 - equals
91:06 - 6907.22
91:09 - minus 2000.
91:11 - scroll up a little bit
91:15 - x equals
91:17 - 4907.22
91:21 - times 0.98
91:25 - and that gives me
91:30 - four thousand eight hundred nine dollars
91:33 - and seven cents
91:35 - this is the size of the second payment
91:48 - hi today we're going to talk about
91:49 - currency conversions and along the way
91:51 - other types of conversions as well we're
91:54 - going to jump straight in with question
91:56 - one how many canadian dollars will it
91:58 - take to buy 500 rubles i'm going to go
92:01 - over here
92:02 - and highlight the exchange rate and
92:04 - we'll look about that
92:05 - in a second first
92:08 - let's look at some rules for converting
92:13 - the first rule is to multiply by one
92:18 - multiplying by one changes nothing
92:24 - and that's because whatever number we
92:26 - have let's say uh five dollars times one
92:31 - equals five dollars it doesn't change
92:34 - anything
92:35 - here i know that one ruble
92:38 - over here is the same
92:40 - as 0.1783
92:44 - canadian dollars or 17 canadian cents
92:48 - you can look up the exchange rate every
92:51 - day that you do calculations i fixed
92:53 - these ones in time but normally this is
92:56 - something that changes day to day
92:58 - depending on what's going on in the
92:59 - world
93:01 - because these two things are equal
93:03 - when i put one on the top
93:05 - and one on the bottom
93:08 - always using those units and putting
93:10 - them in it just equals one because the
93:13 - two things are equal top and bottom
93:15 - numerator and denominator
93:17 - again it also doesn't matter if i
93:19 - reverse that and put the canadian
93:22 - dollars on the top and one ruble on the
93:24 - bottom all of those fractions equal one
93:31 - and that leads me to rule number two
93:39 - always show units
93:41 - if you don't show units then these
93:43 - fractions aren't true
93:45 - so if i say
93:48 - 0.1783
93:50 - over 1 equals 1
93:52 - that would be incorrect
93:56 - it's the units the canadian and the
93:58 - rubles that make this equation correct
94:01 - okay so now let's actually solve our
94:04 - problem
94:05 - and write down our 500 rubles
94:09 - well that equals
94:11 - itself
94:12 - now i'm going to multiply it by a
94:13 - fraction
94:15 - so
94:16 - i'm gonna put that over one i'm gonna
94:19 - actually write that in a different color
94:20 - but you can always divide something by
94:22 - one it doesn't change anything but it
94:24 - does make it easier to understand the
94:26 - fraction i'm going to multiply that by
94:28 - this fraction over here
94:31 - so 0.1783
94:34 - canadian
94:36 - divided by one
94:37 - ruble
94:39 - now when i look at this
94:42 - i've got a ruble on the top and a ruble
94:44 - on the bottom i'm going to cancel those
94:45 - out so the only units left are that cad
94:48 - or canadian dollars that means this is
94:51 - the same as 500 times 0.1783
94:55 - canadian dollars
94:58 - or
95:01 - 89.15 canadian
95:03 - that is
95:06 - our equivalency so
95:11 - we can
95:12 - buy 500 rubles
95:17 - with
95:19 - 89.15
95:20 - canadian and we can put that dollar sign
95:23 - in or not since we have the cad
95:28 - okay
95:28 - let's do the second question this time
95:31 - we're going to convert 500 euros into
95:33 - canadian dollars and see how much money
95:36 - we would need to buy 500 euros if i look
95:40 - at this expression i'm going to write
95:41 - this
95:43 - a different way one euro is equal to
95:47 - 1.4245 canadian
95:50 - when we're working with only one dollar
95:52 - i can use the dollar sign to mean
95:53 - canadian dollars
95:55 - this is the euro sign it looks like a c
95:58 - with a line through it and i can use
96:00 - that as well we are gonna see in our
96:02 - next
96:03 - two questions when we have two
96:05 - currencies that are both named dollars
96:07 - like canadian and u.s it's best to just
96:10 - use the name of the country but let's
96:12 - start with this so 500 euros
96:17 - is equal to
96:19 - 500 euros let's multiply that by a
96:24 - fraction
96:25 - i've got euro on the bottom so i can
96:27 - cancel that out and i've got dollars on
96:30 - the top
96:34 - i don't need to put the one underneath
96:36 - there if i'm comfortable with cross
96:38 - multiplying but you're welcome to cross
96:40 - off the euros and i am left with 500
96:44 - times dollar sign 1.4245
96:49 - which is the same as
96:50 - 712 dollars and 25 cents
96:55 - it takes
96:59 - 712
97:02 - to buy
97:03 - 500
97:04 - euros and that's because in this
97:07 - exchange euros are worth more than the
97:09 - canadian dollar while rubles are worth
97:12 - less so 500 rubles is only 89
97:16 - canadian dollars well 500 euros is 712
97:19 - canadian dollars
97:22 - now we're going to do a more complicated
97:24 - and bigger problem in this problem we're
97:26 - not just going to convert currency we're
97:28 - also going to convert our units
97:31 - one note
97:32 - in canada we use the metric system while
97:35 - in the united states they use the
97:36 - imperial system however because the us
97:40 - is our closest trade partner we often
97:42 - use u.s measurements like feet and miles
97:46 - and pounds when we should be using
97:48 - metric like meters and kilometers and
97:51 - kilograms
97:53 - that's why if you're going to work in
97:55 - canada it's really important to be able
97:57 - to convert canadian units
98:01 - so this time you have decided to visit
98:02 - the thrifty market in downtown
98:04 - bellingham which is just across the
98:05 - border in the united states you purchase
98:07 - a quart of black cherry pop for a dollar
98:09 - 25 per bottle u.s
98:12 - is this a better deal than canadian pop
98:14 - which sells for five dollars and ten
98:15 - cents per six pack solve the problem by
98:18 - changing the u.s price into canadian
98:20 - price per six pack
98:22 - i'm going to highlight those
98:25 - you can see here that we've used dollar
98:27 - sign for both canadian dollars and u.s
98:29 - dollars that's confusing that's why
98:32 - we're going to use cad for canadian and
98:35 - usd for us dollars and here are our
98:38 - measurements from above one us dollar is
98:41 - a dollar twelve canadian right now as
98:44 - i'm filming this both of our dollars are
98:47 - in free fall and nobody knows what will
98:48 - happen with the economy so i'm going to
98:50 - stick with numbers that got pulled out
98:52 - about 10 years ago
98:55 - okay let's start with this so the price
99:00 - for the u.s one
99:06 - is
99:06 - a dollar 25 and i'm going to write usd
99:10 - per one quart bottle
99:14 - i'm going to say qt means a quart
99:17 - okay
99:18 - so it's a dollar 25 per quart let's
99:21 - start multiplying it by things first
99:23 - let's get rid of that u.s dollar to do
99:26 - that i want a fraction with a u.s dollar
99:28 - on the bottom i put u.s dollar on the
99:30 - bottom here and the top there they'll
99:32 - cancel off nicely so one u.s dollar is
99:35 - equal to
99:37 - 1.1218 canadian when i do my
99:41 - calculations
99:43 - you can see that us dollar u.s dollar
99:46 - those nicely cancel
99:48 - okay now let's get rid of court
99:51 - so what i'm going to do is put quart on
99:53 - top
99:54 - i know over here
99:57 - that four quarts is one us gallon
99:59 - four quarts is one gallon i'm just going
100:02 - to say gallon and not us gallon that
100:04 - should be clear so now i have quart on
100:07 - the bottom quart on the top nicely
100:10 - canceled out
100:12 - let's add to this let's get rid of the
100:14 - gallon now
100:15 - i know that one gallon
100:21 - is equal to
100:23 - 3.7843
100:26 - liters i'm just going to use capital l
100:28 - for liters
100:29 - okay now i can cross off gallon now i
100:32 - have something that's in canadian
100:33 - dollars per liter but i actually want
100:36 - this to be in canadian dollars per six
100:38 - pack the good thing about the metric
100:40 - system is that it's pretty easy to
100:42 - convert one liter
100:44 - let's just change colors there to make
100:46 - it clearer
100:47 - one liter
100:49 - is equal to a thousand milliliters
100:54 - liter liter disappears now we have a
100:56 - price per milliliter which is useful but
100:59 - we want to get this into cans
101:01 - in canada cans are about or at least in
101:04 - this case
101:05 - they're 355 milliliters milliliters is
101:08 - on the top to cancel at the bottom and
101:10 - that's one can
101:12 - we want this in a six pack so let me
101:15 - just cross out milliliter milliliter
101:18 - and i want to get one more thing here
101:22 - i have six cans
101:24 - is a six pack
101:27 - of pop
101:28 - can
101:29 - can
101:30 - okay i'm going to have to rewrite this
101:32 - whole thing because it's a big equation
101:35 - 1.25
101:38 - times 1.1218
101:41 - i'm going to leave that canadian till
101:43 - the end of the there but i am going to
101:45 - put it in i'm just doing things on the
101:47 - numerator at the top the one
101:50 - here i don't have to put that in one
101:51 - here i don't have to put that in but i
101:53 - do have to put 355 and six cans and that
101:57 - is cad are the units
102:00 - now let's do all the denominators one
102:03 - one
102:04 - one
102:05 - three point seven eight four three
102:08 - times a thousand
102:12 - and now that's just six pack
102:16 - and there we have it our units the only
102:19 - ones that were canceled were canadian
102:20 - dollars per six-pack so we have this in
102:23 - here now we just plug this into a
102:25 - calculator i'd like you guys to do this
102:28 - at home
102:28 - just so you know when you're doing these
102:30 - videos it's best if you're following
102:31 - along with your calculator you can pause
102:33 - me whenever you want and make sure that
102:36 - you got 3.16
102:38 - once we round it canadian dollars
102:41 - six pack
102:43 - if you didn't that's something you
102:45 - should come ask me and we'll talk about
102:47 - your calculator and we'll go over some
102:49 - calculator techniques
102:51 - so what is it cheaper in so this is the
102:53 - u.s price remember
102:55 - and the canadian price
102:58 - for canadian pop is five dollars and 10
103:01 - cents per six-pack
103:04 - and that's canadian which one would you
103:06 - prefer to buy
103:08 - well spoiler for all of these problems
103:12 - things are almost always cheaper in the
103:13 - u.s
103:15 - so
103:17 - don't be surprised
103:19 - if this is what happens
103:21 - this type of problem where we're
103:22 - converting both units of measurement and
103:25 - units of money at the same time comes up
103:27 - a lot in canada
103:29 - gas in the united states is measured in
103:31 - gallons and it's measured in liters here
103:33 - so it's important to be able to do that
103:35 - conversion but using this method and
103:37 - multiplying through and keeping careful
103:39 - track of our units you should never make
103:42 - that many mistakes only small arithmetic
103:45 - ones but once you get good at this you
103:47 - won't make mistakes
103:50 - hi
103:51 - let's format our ba2 plus calculator
103:54 - correctly
103:55 - you'll notice that my calculator is
103:57 - probably a different version than yours
103:59 - but they all work the same way
104:01 - notice that it says
104:02 - 0.00 we wanted to not show two decimal
104:06 - places we wanted to show all the decimal
104:08 - places
104:09 - and we're going to check to see how it's
104:11 - doing arithmetic if i put in 3 plus 2
104:14 - times 10 i expect an answer of 23 using
104:18 - order of operations to know that
104:20 - multiplication comes before addition
104:22 - if we don't use order of operations and
104:24 - we do it incorrectly we end up with the
104:26 - number of 50. checking out our
104:28 - calculator the 3 plus 2 times 10 without
104:33 - putting the equals in between we get 50.
104:35 - that's the incorrect answer so we're
104:37 - going to change the formatting on this
104:39 - calculator we go to second and when you
104:41 - go to second now you get access to all
104:44 - the things on the top on top of the
104:46 - decimal place is the format
104:49 - press that and now it says decimal is
104:51 - two places we don't want that
104:53 - nine is the biggest we can have and if
104:55 - we don't put point o it means when
104:57 - there's nine decimal places it will show
104:59 - nine and when there's zero it will show
105:01 - zero so i'm going to press enter
105:04 - now i'm going to scroll up
105:06 - using the arrows to scroll around until
105:09 - i get to the chn mode that's chain mode
105:12 - and that's what's giving us the
105:13 - incorrect answer of 50. since i want
105:16 - algebraic order of operations or order
105:18 - of symbols i'm gonna go to second then
105:21 - press that enter again and now it says
105:22 - aos
105:24 - once i clear
105:25 - i can try that question again three plus
105:29 - 2 times
105:30 - 10
105:31 - is 23 what we think it is
105:34 - let's just go over a few more settings
105:38 - decimal places we've seen that one if i
105:40 - scroll down we get degrees if you're
105:42 - going to be doing calculus or
105:44 - engineering math you might need to know
105:46 - the difference between degrees and
105:47 - radians not necessary for this course
105:50 - this is our date mode
105:52 - if you are european and you're used to
105:55 - day month year instead of month day year
105:57 - you might wish to change it but our
105:59 - textbook and all of the notes we do are
106:01 - going to assume we're using us mode
106:04 - next
106:05 - us mode shows a comma as a thousand
106:08 - separator and a decimal place separates
106:11 - the fractions or a fraction of a cent
106:14 - we could set this to european mode which
106:17 - uses space as a thousand separator and
106:20 - the comma for decimals but in canada we
106:22 - use the us mode finally we get back down
106:25 - to aos
106:27 - clear out of that notice it doesn't say
106:29 - 0.00 and our calculator is set correctly
106:34 - final question question 3 you are
106:37 - planning a winter surfing vacation you
106:39 - will begin on the north shore in hawaii
106:41 - try to catch the 50-year storm at bells
106:43 - beach australia and finish your trip
106:45 - with a little longboarding
106:47 - on new zealand's north island you
106:48 - estimate you will need 500 in each
106:51 - currency how much canadian will you need
106:53 - to spend i'm just going to separate that
106:55 - i've highlighted the currencies that
106:57 - we're going to use
106:58 - canadian australian new zealand and usa
107:01 - unfortunately they're all dollars which
107:03 - is why we're going to use the
107:04 - abbreviations and those are official
107:06 - abbreviations
107:08 - so let's start with how much we need
107:14 - so we need
107:16 - 500 us dollars
107:19 - we need
107:20 - 500 australian dollars and we need 500
107:25 - new zealand dollars
107:28 - we can do all of these and we're going
107:30 - to put this all
107:31 - together into one equation and do it all
107:33 - at the same time by multiplying each one
107:35 - by a fraction
107:37 - 500 us dollars
107:40 - times
107:42 - well we've done this one before
107:45 - 1.1218 canadian dollars equals one u.s
107:48 - dollar plus
107:51 - 500 australian dollars
107:54 - well that is
107:56 - 84 cents
108:01 - over one australian dollar
108:03 - plus our 500 new zealand dollars
108:08 - and we know that
108:10 - one new zealand dollar
108:12 - is equal to 71 canadian cents
108:20 - let's work this out
108:22 - all we have to do
108:23 - is cancel off those units
108:28 - and do some multiplication in addition
108:30 - i'm going to dump that into a calculator
108:32 - and come up with 1340.45
108:38 - canadian
108:40 - looking at these currencies
108:42 - which one is more valuable
108:52 - well that's going to be the u.s dollar
108:54 - the us dollar is worth more than the
108:57 - canadian dollar
108:58 - the canadian dollar is worth more than
109:00 - the australian dollar because one
109:02 - canadian dollar is 84 cents australian
109:05 - but one canadian dollar is a dollar
109:08 - twelve
109:09 - canadian and australian
109:11 - is stronger than the new zealand dollar
109:14 - that's because 84 australian cents is
109:17 - equal to 72 ish new zealand cents
109:24 - okay now let's do part b
109:27 - when you land in auckland new zealand
109:29 - you discover that you still have 65 us
109:31 - dollars and 90 australian dollars in
109:33 - your wallet you'd like to exchange that
109:35 - for new zealand currency since we don't
109:38 - have exchange rates from new zealand
109:41 - from us dollars to new zealand dollars
109:43 - we're going to have to do an
109:45 - intermediate calculation to canadian so
109:47 - let's write what we have
109:50 - we have 65 u.s dollars
109:53 - plus 90 australian dollars
109:57 - and we're going to convert that i'm
109:58 - going to zoom this up
110:01 - so 65 usd
110:04 - and i'm going to multiply that and
110:06 - change it into canadian
110:08 - because that's the only thing i know how
110:10 - to do
110:14 - but i'm also going to change it into new
110:16 - zealand
110:18 - so
110:19 - let's change that in from canadian to a
110:22 - new zealand dollar we know that one
110:25 - new zealand dollar is 71 cents canadian
110:30 - and when i look at my conversions us us
110:33 - cancels canadian canadian cancels and
110:36 - i'm left with just new zealand on the
110:39 - top
110:39 - i'm going to do the next one in the
110:41 - exact same expression
110:43 - i've got 90 australian dollars and i'm
110:45 - going to change that
110:47 - from australian
110:52 - into canadian and
110:54 - here this is worth 84 cents
110:58 - now it's in canadian now i'm going to
111:01 - change that the same way i did before
111:03 - into new zealand one new zealand dollar
111:06 - is
111:07 - 71.68 canadian cents i go through
111:11 - australian australian canadian canadian
111:14 - i'm just going to rewrite this
111:15 - expression because it will be easier
111:18 - 65.1.12
111:21 - over
111:23 - 0.7168
111:25 - canadian
111:27 - sorry not canadian
111:28 - new zealand
111:30 - that's what we were left with here and
111:32 - here plus 90
111:35 - times 0.8423
111:39 - divided by 0.7168
111:43 - canadian
111:45 - i put that into my calculator and end up
111:48 - with
111:49 - 207 dollars and 48 cents
111:53 - and that's new zealand dollars
111:58 - just one more note here we've simplified
112:02 - things
112:03 - a little bit
112:05 - when you exchange money the bank takes a
112:08 - cut
112:09 - so you're not going to get the exact
112:11 - amount a little percentage is going to
112:14 - go towards whoever is
112:16 - exchanging the money that's the reason
112:18 - they do it
112:20 - we're going to ignore that in this
112:21 - instance
112:24 - because we're looking at a little bit
112:26 - simplified but think of that as more of
112:28 - a fee
112:30 - hi we're going to use the ba 2
112:32 - calculator to compute some dates we're
112:34 - going to start with an example an
112:36 - invoice stated june 1st 2010
112:39 - is due in 45 days find the due date
112:46 - let's highlight that
112:50 - okay so first thing we start by going
112:53 - second
112:54 - and then the date
112:55 - date is on top of one
112:58 - we're going to put in the date
113:00 - 6.010
113:02 - i'm going to write this down
113:12 - so six stands for june which is the
113:15 - sixth month
113:17 - june 1st nope that we have to put a zero
113:21 - there
113:22 - if it
113:23 - is one digit long and this is the last
113:25 - two digits
113:26 - of 2010
113:29 - okay
113:30 - so to put that in we go 6.0110
113:36 - and then we have to press enter to store
113:38 - it
113:39 - now i want to know 45 days later i'm
113:42 - going to scroll down
113:43 - to dbd dpd is days between dates so the
113:48 - days between dates here is going to be
113:50 - 45
113:51 - enter
113:53 - now let's go and back up to date two and
113:56 - all i have to do is press compute to
113:59 - find out that it was friday july 16 2010
114:03 - let's do another one let's figure out
114:06 - how old a person might be
114:08 - in days
114:10 - so let's say
114:12 - go back up to date one let's say someone
114:15 - was born on
114:17 - september
114:18 - 15th
114:20 - 1990.
114:22 - in that case their name their date would
114:25 - be 09 or just 9 for september
114:28 - 15 9 0.
114:31 - so i'm going to go
114:33 - 9.15
114:38 - enter
114:39 - and today's date i'm going to go down
114:41 - today's date is actually may which is 5
114:46 - dot the 17th
114:48 - 2020
114:50 - press enter
114:52 - when i scroll down to days between days
114:54 - all i have to do is press compute to
114:56 - find out that it's 10
114:58 - 837 days
115:02 - finally what day of the week was i born
115:04 - or a fictional person
115:07 - scrolling back up to date one we can
115:08 - find this very easy once we have three
115:11 - things in here
115:12 - we can just compute the other one and it
115:14 - tells us that september 15 1990 was
115:18 - actually
115:19 - a saturday
115:23 - finally let's look at the last item
115:27 - dbd down to act and if we go one more
115:31 - we're back to date one act stands for
115:35 - actual
115:38 - that's a
115:39 - 365 days plus leap year
115:43 - every so often every four years
115:46 - the other calendar we can do is 360.
115:50 - that's going to be a calendar that has
115:52 - 12 months of 30 days each or 360 days we
115:55 - don't use this one because
115:57 - the earth takes
115:59 - in a bit days to revolve around the sun
116:01 - even though 360 would be easier math so
116:04 - we keep that at act i'm just going to
116:06 - write 360.
116:09 - that's a fictional calend
116:11 - calculator
116:13 - calendar and that is oh
116:18 - hi we're going to talk about cost
116:21 - equations today
116:24 - a cost equation
116:28 - is linear
116:33 - so it's of the form
116:35 - y equals a plus b
116:38 - x
116:39 - and just so you
116:40 - know if you learned this in high school
116:43 - you might have seen this as y equals
116:47 - m x plus b
116:49 - same thing different words
116:52 - i like to say y equals intercept
116:57 - plus slope
116:58 - times x
117:01 - okay
117:02 - for costs
117:07 - we have an equation that looks like cost
117:09 - equals
117:10 - fixed cost
117:14 - plus variable cost per item
117:19 - times the number of items
117:24 - or c equals fc
117:27 - plus bc x
117:29 - i'm going to draw this
117:32 - here we've got our axes and we're going
117:35 - to draw a line we have our intercept a
117:39 - here
117:44 - and we've got a slope
117:46 - so our line looks something like this
117:51 - let's just turn that ruler around and
117:54 - draw in a line
117:59 - okay
118:00 - the slope is the variable cost
118:13 - let's jump into question one you're
118:15 - concerned about your cell phone bill for
118:17 - this month and you can't remember how
118:19 - your plan actually works you've been
118:21 - careful to keep track of how much data
118:22 - you used each month and the month this
118:24 - month that you've used 160 megabytes
118:27 - using the payment information from your
118:29 - online banking you compile the following
118:32 - what is the independent variable and
118:33 - what is the dependent variable
118:36 - so here
118:38 - cost
118:40 - equations are easier in that cost is
118:44 - always going to be
118:45 - the dependent variable
118:49 - and x is the independent
118:54 - i like to say that y depends
118:58 - on x
119:00 - here
119:01 - cost
119:03 - depends on data used
119:06 - the more data you use the more expensive
119:09 - it will be
119:11 - to put this into a
119:15 - function we have cost
119:20 - equals we've got some sort of base rate
119:26 - no matter what we're not going to get
119:27 - away with using it for free we're going
119:29 - to pay a certain base plus we have some
119:31 - sort of price per megabyte
119:36 - times
119:37 - the num amount of data used
119:43 - so cost is going to depend on the data
119:46 - used
119:51 - part b use a graph to determine the
119:53 - amount of your cell phone bill for this
119:55 - month i've gone ahead and put a graph in
119:57 - here
119:58 - usually we use computers for these or
120:00 - graph paper works perfectly well
120:03 - i'm going to put in my points x is the
120:05 - megabytes used y is the cost
120:13 - so we have our points
120:15 - when we used 120 megabytes
120:18 - we spent 40 dollars
120:21 - let's put that mb in there when we used
120:23 - 80
120:24 - megs we ended up spending only 30
120:28 - dollars and when we had 200 megabytes
120:32 - we used
120:34 - ended up paying 60
120:36 - so those are our three points a line is
120:39 - determined by two points so three is
120:41 - just extra
120:43 - drawing this i've gone ahead and labeled
120:46 - all my axes and i've used units and i
120:48 - know i don't have the neatest
120:49 - handwriting but i try
120:52 - so let's draw in these plans
120:55 - let's use red
120:57 - so what we're going to do is put in
120:59 - those points so 120
121:01 - 40.
121:02 - 120 on the x-axis 40 on the y-axis
121:06 - 80
121:07 - 30. that's going to be halfway here
121:10 - finally we have
121:13 - 260.
121:15 - that is over here on this and when i
121:17 - line those three points up they look
121:20 - like a line i'm going to use a ruler to
121:24 - try to get this perfect and again when
121:27 - you're freehanding it it doesn't matter
121:29 - if it's perfect
121:31 - but it's a nice thing we can do there's
121:33 - our line so
121:35 - looking at that question what do you
121:36 - think our
121:37 - the amount of our cell phone bill is
121:39 - this month remember this month
121:46 - we used 160 megabytes so what we're
121:50 - going to do is look over here
121:52 - and i think this month
121:55 - right around there i'm going to assume
121:57 - it's around 50
122:00 - looking at a graph isn't precise but
122:03 - often it's good enough for whatever we
122:06 - are trying to do part c determine the
122:08 - slope of the line in the graph and
122:10 - describe the slope in the words of the
122:12 - problem
122:13 - this is a review from high school work
122:15 - which you might remember
122:17 - slope
122:20 - is defined as rise over run
122:24 - otherwise known as the change in y
122:28 - over the change in x
122:33 - we can look at that as
122:35 - any two points we take y2 minus y1 and
122:38 - we divide that by that is an error x2
122:42 - minus x1
122:45 - lovely this is going to be our variable
122:48 - cost
122:49 - in this case let's pick two points i'm
122:52 - going to pick
122:53 - two of them that look easy enough for
122:55 - i'm going to choose as my two points
122:59 - the following
123:01 - for point number one
123:03 - i'm going to say 80
123:05 - 30. when we used 80 megabytes
123:09 - it cost us 30
123:11 - and for 0.2
123:16 - i'm going to say that when we used 120
123:21 - megabytes
123:23 - it cost us 40 dollars those are the
123:26 - points i'm going to use so the slope is
123:28 - going to be the rise the change in the
123:30 - money
123:31 - or cost
123:32 - 40 minus 30
123:35 - over the run which is going to be 1 120
123:39 - minus 180
123:41 - make sure that your units
123:43 - match up there
123:44 - okay when i put that in
123:47 - i get 10 over 40
123:49 - or 0.25
123:53 - and i'll write that in the words of the
123:54 - problem for each additional megabyte
124:01 - i use
124:04 - i'm going to pay
124:05 - an extra 25 cents
124:11 - i'm going to make a note here
124:13 - let's say we had flipped our y1 and y2
124:16 - in that case i'd end up with 30 minus 40
124:21 - over 80 minus
124:23 - 120 megabytes
124:28 - in this case what i end up with
124:32 - is negatives here i have negative 10
124:35 - over negative 40 which still equals 0.25
124:39 - the order doesn't matter as long as i am
124:41 - consistent
124:44 - if we don't pay our cell phone at all
124:46 - for the month of october how much will
124:48 - you have to pay well let's scroll up and
124:50 - look at that for 0 megabytes we have
124:54 - what is the intercept
124:56 - it looks like somewhere around
125:00 - halfway between 0 and 20
125:04 - so i'm going to go with around ten
125:06 - dollars
125:15 - i'm going to call this by inspection
125:16 - which means i looked and i didn't do any
125:20 - actual arithmetic
125:25 - finally let's determine the equation of
125:27 - the line in the graph
125:30 - looking at it we know at the slope
125:33 - and we know that we will end up with
125:35 - costs
125:36 - equals fixed costs plus variable cost
125:40 - times x we suspect that the fixed cost
125:43 - is somewhere around 7 and we know what
125:45 - the slope is i'm going to put in one of
125:48 - the points and here i just choose any
125:50 - point that i would like
125:52 - [Music]
125:53 - 80 megabytes
125:55 - cost 30
125:57 - either of these points is fine so i'm
126:00 - going to put that in here
126:02 - knowing that
126:06 - the variable cost is 25 cents
126:13 - now i'm going to put in 30 for c
126:15 - and 80 for x
126:26 - i'm just going to leave off the
126:27 - megabytes
126:28 - because it's not necessary but now we
126:32 - have this it ends up being fc
126:35 - equals
126:36 - 30 dollars minus
126:39 - 0.25 times 80 and we can just run that
126:42 - through a calculator and we get ten
126:44 - dollars which is actually what we
126:47 - guessed in the previous
126:49 - uh
126:50 - examples so that is true
126:54 - d
126:55 - now let's look at how much
127:00 - c is our slope and that is already there
127:03 - so now let's just check our work
127:06 - by putting in every single point so x
127:10 - equals 120
127:13 - cost equals
127:16 - 10 dollars plus 25 cents
127:19 - times 120 that's 40 dollars
127:23 - correct
127:24 - now let's put in x equals 80 megabytes
127:28 - now our cost is going to be 10
127:31 - times 25 cents
127:34 - times 80
127:36 - and that is 30
127:38 - just like we want it to
127:40 - finally our last point was 200 megabytes
127:44 - cost equals 10
127:46 - times 25 cents
127:49 - times 200 megabytes and we end up with
127:52 - 60 dollars those are the points that
127:54 - we're looking for
128:00 - finally i want to just verify part b
128:03 - so b said what happens when we make a
128:06 - hundred and sixty
128:09 - so when we use 160 megabytes our cost
128:13 - should be 10
128:15 - plus
128:17 - 25 cents
128:19 - times
128:20 - 160 megabytes
128:24 - running this through a calculator equals
128:26 - 50. which is the amount that we
128:28 - estimated
128:31 - hi continuing on with question one let's
128:34 - look at a different company remember the
128:36 - cell phone bill on the company that we
128:38 - have is the cost is 10 connection fee
128:41 - per month plus 25 cents for every
128:44 - megabyte used
128:45 - part f another company offers a cell
128:47 - phone plan that costs 20 dollars per
128:49 - month and charges 15 cents per megabyte
128:51 - determine the cost equation and graph it
128:54 - using the same grid
128:55 - this time instead of having two points
128:58 - the line is given to us in words we can
129:01 - look at this and say that cost is going
129:04 - to be twenty dollar fixed costs
129:06 - plus fifteen cents
129:10 - times x where x is the amount of
129:12 - megabytes used
129:22 - remember the line that we found in part
129:26 - b and we graph that on the line now
129:28 - we're going to graph this second
129:31 - cell phone plan on the exact same line
129:34 - i'm going to do that by finding two
129:35 - points
129:36 - this time
129:38 - i wasn't given any points so i'm going
129:40 - to have to find them
129:42 - usually using the intersection point or
129:45 - when x equals zero is going to be the
129:48 - best choice when x equals zero the cost
129:51 - or y is equal to twenty dollars so that
129:54 - gives me the point zero
129:56 - twenty
129:58 - let's put that in
130:01 - purple
130:02 - okay now let's think about one more
130:04 - point here we can choose anything we'd
130:07 - like but it makes sense to come up with
130:11 - a simple number to use
130:14 - i've chosen to use x equals 200 here
130:17 - because i think it will be fairly simple
130:20 - when x equals 200 the cost is going to
130:23 - be 20
130:26 - plus 15 cents times 200
130:30 - put that into a calculator and it comes
130:32 - up with 50 dollars
130:34 - that gives me the point
130:37 - 250
130:39 - easy enough to use 200 let's find 50
130:43 - right over here so now we have two
130:45 - points all we have to do is connect them
130:49 - with a straight line
130:56 - perfect
130:58 - let's put a bracket there now we have
131:00 - our two points together
131:05 - now what we're going to do is compare
131:07 - our two plants
131:08 - sometimes one of them is cheaper and
131:10 - sometimes another one of them is cheaper
131:12 - so let's look at plan one
131:16 - if we are going to spend 175 megabytes
131:21 - then our cost will be 10
131:24 - plus 25 cents for each of those 175
131:28 - megabytes which is 53
131:31 - and 75 cents
131:33 - plan 2 on the other hand
131:36 - is more expensive for its connection fee
131:39 - but cheaper
131:41 - otherwise only 15 cents a megabyte so
131:44 - when i put that in i get 46.25
131:48 - i can kind of see that let's look at
131:50 - 175. it's about here
131:53 - i can see that plan two
131:57 - is more it's cheaper it's lower on the
132:00 - line than plan one
132:03 - mark in that plan one is in red
132:07 - different prices
132:08 - what's happening here is that if you
132:10 - don't spend any plan two is going to be
132:12 - more expensive if we don't use it at all
132:14 - it's a twenty dollar fee as opposed to
132:17 - ten dollars but if we spend 200
132:19 - megabytes it will be 60 on plan 1 but
132:22 - only 50 on plan 2.
132:25 - what we're going to look at is the point
132:26 - at which they're the same
132:29 - by inspection looking at this it looks
132:32 - like
132:33 - somewhere between 80 and 120 somewhere
132:36 - around 100 our two plans will have the
132:38 - same cost
132:39 - when it we spend less than this amount
132:42 - use less data plan one would be cheaper
132:45 - if we use more data plan two is cheaper
132:47 - to find that point what we're going to
132:50 - do is solve some equations i'm just
132:52 - going to highlight over here in g that
132:54 - plan 2 was cheaper
132:59 - so what i'm going to do is solve a
133:01 - system of equations cost 1
133:04 - equals cost 2 and i'm going to solve for
133:07 - x
133:11 - cost 1 well that was 10
133:14 - plus 25 cents
133:16 - a megabyte
133:18 - i'm going to change colors here to say
133:20 - cost 2 was 20
133:22 - plus only 15 cents
133:24 - per megabyte
133:26 - to solve this equation i'm going to move
133:30 - all the x terms to the left and all the
133:32 - constants to the right
133:35 - now i get 25 x
133:37 - minus 15
133:39 - x 15.15 x
133:42 - equals 20 minus
133:44 - 10. notice that i'm leaving all those
133:46 - units in there
133:48 - that is
133:49 - 10 cents times x
133:52 - equals 10 dollars or
133:54 - x equals 10
133:56 - over
133:57 - 0.10
133:59 - which gives me exactly 100 megabytes
134:03 - that was what this looked like by
134:05 - inspection this looked to be at about a
134:07 - hundred
134:09 - the cost is the same there
134:12 - so
134:13 - in conclusion
134:17 - if we average more
134:20 - than 100 megabytes per month
134:26 - two is going to be cheaper
134:31 - if we average less
134:36 - than 100 megabytes per month
134:40 - plan one will be cheaper
134:43 - so the conclusion is we're going to take
134:46 - our use patterns and figure out which
134:48 - plan is best
134:53 - question two let's do one more linear
134:55 - equation that is a costing equation
134:58 - babysitters r us charges a flat booking
135:00 - fee plus an hourly rate on a normal
135:03 - workday i hire a sitter for nine hours
135:05 - and i pay
135:07 - dollars and 50 cents on saturday nights
135:09 - i usually hire a sitter for four hours
135:11 - while i go to the movies and i pay 66
135:13 - dollars find a linear equation giving
135:15 - cost in terms of the number of hours so
135:18 - this is a question where we have two
135:20 - points
135:22 - and we're trying to find the linear
135:24 - equation between them
135:26 - so first of all the independent and
135:28 - dependent variable
135:30 - cost is always the dependent variable in
135:33 - a costing equation so we have here cost
135:36 - depends on time
135:40 - time is always independent
135:47 - costing is
135:48 - dependent remember we say why it depends
135:52 - on x
135:55 - cost depends on it time is never the
135:58 - dependent variable because it's strange
136:00 - to say that time is going to change
136:02 - based on other things unless you had a
136:04 - time machine which would be very cool
136:09 - so what we're doing is this and we have
136:11 - an equation that looks like cost
136:14 - equals
136:15 - intercept
136:18 - plus slope
136:20 - times
136:22 - x
136:23 - our intercept here is going to be our
136:25 - fixed cost
136:27 - or booking fee
136:29 - so let's say actually i'm going to call
136:31 - this a booking fee
136:34 - that's our fixed cost here plus our
136:37 - hourly rate
136:40 - times the number of hours
136:45 - so that's what i'm trying it to find
136:49 - let's look at our two points
136:52 - i'm going to draw these here
136:55 - points and let's cut x comma y well i
136:58 - know
136:59 - nine hours
137:01 - on a work day
137:03 - gives me a fee of 123 dollars and 50
137:05 - cents
137:06 - i know that on my movie day only four
137:09 - hours
137:11 - i only pay 66 dollars that means that i
137:15 - have my y values are in money and my x
137:18 - values are in time so first let's find
137:21 - that slope
137:26 - so slope again is rise over run
137:29 - or y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1
137:34 - y's over x's putting those in i'm going
137:36 - to start with this one because they're
137:38 - bigger numbers and i always like to put
137:40 - the bigger numbers first 123 dollars and
137:43 - 50 cents minus 66 dollars
137:46 - nine minus four putting in the units
137:49 - really ensures that you don't mix things
137:50 - up
137:51 - if i run this through a calculator
137:54 - we come up with eleven dollars and fifty
137:56 - cents
137:57 - that is our hourly weight
138:01 - we pay our sitter eleven dollars and
138:03 - fifty cents
138:06 - we're going to assume that they get some
138:07 - of that booking fee to bring them up to
138:09 - minimum wage
138:11 - so let's look again at our costing
138:13 - equation
138:14 - cost equals our booking fee
138:16 - or i'm going to call it this time fixed
138:18 - cost fc
138:20 - plus 1150
138:23 - times x so we can plug in any one point
138:26 - and that will help us solve and we can
138:28 - choose either of these points
138:30 - i'm going to choose the second point
138:32 - just because it's smaller numbers and i
138:34 - find that often smaller numbers tend to
138:36 - be a little bit easier to work with but
138:39 - not always so our cost is 66 dollars
138:42 - that equals fixed costs plus 1150
138:46 - times four
138:48 - when i move this around and this is
138:51 - something where if this is not easy for
138:53 - you to solve this that fixed cost is 20
138:58 - come talk to me send me an email go over
139:01 - some algebra things and we will get that
139:03 - nicely sorted because this is an
139:05 - important thing to know
139:07 - another important thing to do is to
139:08 - check
139:11 - so i put in the second point so let's
139:13 - try the first point
139:15 - so if i put in 9 hours
139:19 - the cost will be
139:21 - i've said i had a 20 flat rate
139:24 - plus nine hours
139:27 - times
139:28 - 11.50
139:31 - and when i dump that in it ends up being
139:33 - 123.50
139:35 - just what we wanted and just to check
139:37 - even though we used it we can always
139:39 - just check the four hour cost
139:41 - so 20 dollars plus 1150
139:45 - times 4
139:47 - is equal to 66
139:49 - that's correct
139:51 - if we got the wrong answer here then we
139:54 - would know to stop and redo our
139:56 - arithmetic
139:59 - okay let's describe the slope in the
140:01 - words of the problem we know that the
140:04 - slope is the hourly rate
140:08 - so i'm going to say
140:10 - one slope equals hourly rate
140:16 - so for every
140:19 - additional hour
140:25 - we have to pay our sitter
140:27 - an extra 11.50
140:32 - notice that i used the following the
140:35 - actual slope
140:37 - the word additional hour and what's
140:39 - going on we're paying an extra eleven
140:41 - fifty we're paying that flat rate plus
140:43 - what we paid before and every additional
140:45 - hour cost us 11.50
140:48 - extra
140:51 - finally part c if i hire a sitter for
140:54 - six hours how much will it cost me well
140:57 - i'm going to write down our cost
140:58 - equation again
140:59 - our cost is going to be twenty dollars
141:02 - no matter how much time i use you have
141:04 - it a babysitter come for five minutes
141:06 - it's gonna cost you at least twenty
141:08 - dollars
141:09 - plus eleven dollars and fifty cents per
141:12 - hour
141:13 - so if x equals six hours
141:16 - then our cost is going to be
141:18 - twenty dollars plus
141:21 - eleven fifty
141:23 - times
141:24 - six which equals eighty nine dollars
141:28 - that's how much we're going to pay our
141:29 - sitter
141:31 - hi today we're going to jump right in to
141:34 - lecture six break even analysis by going
141:37 - straight into a problem break even
141:40 - analysis is sometimes called cvp the c
141:43 - stands for cost
141:45 - the v stands for volume and the p stands
141:47 - for profit break even is what our
141:50 - calculator uses and there we're going to
141:52 - learn more about that later
141:54 - so let's jump right in the hungry days
141:57 - ice cream company has fixed costs of
141:59 - thirty thousand dollars per month each
142:02 - case of ice cream costs four dollars and
142:04 - fifty cents to make write an equation
142:06 - giving total cost as a function of the
142:08 - number of cases of ice cream made we're
142:10 - going to graph that in the space below
142:12 - well we know from last time that our
142:14 - cost cost equation
142:17 - is fixed costs
142:19 - plus variable costs times x where x is
142:23 - the quantity
142:25 - so in our case
142:27 - we have
142:28 - thirty thousand dollars
142:32 - plus
142:33 - four dollars and fifty cents for every
142:36 - carton case of ice cream
142:45 - let's write that in
142:47 - so i'm going to scroll a little bit and
142:49 - by the way k
142:52 - little aside 60k is 60 000. k stands for
142:56 - kilo which comes from the greek word for
142:58 - thousand i use that when i draw legends
143:00 - because i don't like writing all those
143:02 - zeros my hand gets tired a computer
143:06 - besides one that i write on would be
143:07 - very helpful
143:08 - i've gone ahead and labeled this because
143:10 - i know what the axes when you're doing
143:13 - this in the real world you'll often be
143:16 - using excel or a graphing program so i'm
143:18 - going to label it every five is going to
143:21 - be ten thousand dollars on the y-axis
143:23 - costing is always on the y-axis and i've
143:26 - put 2500 for every five blocks on the
143:30 - x-axis so let's start with cost
143:33 - our
143:34 - intercept is going to be zero when i
143:38 - have zero cases of ice cream our cost is
143:41 - thirty thousand dollars
143:43 - so zero
143:45 - thirty thousand dollars now i'm going to
143:47 - come up with something else i've chosen
143:50 - five thousand
143:53 - because that seems to be a nice easy
143:56 - number then y or the cost equals thirty
143:59 - thousand
144:01 - plus four fifty
144:03 - times five thousand and when i run that
144:07 - into a calculator i get the point five
144:10 - thousand
144:14 - 52 500.
144:17 - okay let's put that on 5000 is a nice
144:19 - dark line and 52 500 seems to be right
144:24 - about here
144:27 - now i've got that on my list on my chart
144:30 - i go ahead and put in a nice straight
144:33 - line
144:37 - and i can even label that as my cost
144:39 - equation
144:43 - okay
144:44 - part b the company sells ice cream for
144:47 - 12 dollars per case give an equation for
144:50 - the revenue function
144:52 - and graph the revenue below here
144:55 - price actually i'm gonna
144:57 - switch this to purple why not price is
145:01 - 12 dollars per case
145:05 - revenue is the same as sales
145:09 - and that's always going to be defined as
145:14 - price
145:16 - times
145:17 - quantity
145:19 - sometimes quantity is done as q for
145:22 - quantity
145:24 - we often use x because that's what's
145:26 - used in algebra for unknowns
145:28 - when i put in what i have for this i end
145:31 - up with revenue i'm calling that r
145:33 - is 12
145:35 - x
145:36 - if i sell
145:37 - x
145:38 - cases of ice cream i make 12 times x
145:42 - in price
145:44 - scrolling up i'm going to write this
145:46 - again over here
145:50 - let's put this on the exact same chart
145:54 - the intercept of revenue is easy
145:57 - if we sell no ice cream we make no money
146:01 - expect zero zero to be a point on every
146:04 - revenue graph now i'm going to go with
146:07 - something that looks equally easy
146:09 - if i sell 5 000 cases of ice cream
146:13 - then i make 12 times 5
146:16 - is 60 000
146:19 - in sales
146:21 - so five thousand
146:23 - sixty right at the top
146:25 - again all i have to do is put in my
146:28 - ruler
146:30 - line everything up
146:32 - the nicer you line this up the easier it
146:34 - is to really see what's going on and now
146:38 - we can see where these cross
146:42 - okay let's label our graph
146:44 - this is the important part profit loss
146:47 - and break even i'm going to go back to
146:49 - what we talked about in the very first
146:52 - lecture i'm pretty sure in the very
146:54 - first video
146:56 - profit
146:58 - is revenue or sales
147:02 - minus cost
147:04 - when profit is
147:09 - greater than zero we're in a profit
147:11 - situation
147:12 - when profit is less than zero
147:16 - let's put that as a dollar sign we're in
147:18 - a loss situation and when profit is
147:22 - exactly zero
147:24 - this is what we call the break even
147:26 - point
147:28 - this is what the purpose of this lecture
147:30 - is we're always going to be trying to
147:32 - figure out what the break-even point is
147:37 - the minimum
147:38 - sales
147:40 - to not lose money it's okay if we make a
147:43 - little bit of money but if we lose money
147:45 - we're in a bad situation we want to be
147:48 - in a positive situation
147:50 - okay so looking at our graph
147:52 - this time we're just gonna eyeball it
147:54 - i'm gonna go ahead and highlight
147:57 - this
147:58 - i'm even going to put a little line
148:00 - there right at that point and it looks
148:02 - like it's a nice even point
148:07 - and we have on the yellow side over here
148:10 - our costs are higher than our revenues
148:14 - so i'm going to write revenue here in
148:17 - purple when our cost is higher than our
148:19 - revenue
148:22 - this is a loss situation
148:27 - when our profit
148:28 - when our revenue is higher than our
148:30 - costs over here this is a profit
148:33 - situation so if we sell more than
148:36 - somewhere around 4 000 we'll be in a
148:39 - profit and if we sell less than that we
148:41 - will be in a loss
148:46 - okay
148:47 - part d let's calculate the break even
148:49 - point we're going to express it in
148:51 - multiple ways so looking at our chart
148:53 - earlier scroll up we think it's
148:56 - somewhere around 4 000 but now we're
148:58 - going to look at that algebraically so
149:00 - the breakeven point
149:04 - comes
149:06 - when profit equals zero
149:10 - and since profit is revenue minus cost
149:13 - that's the exact same as saying that
149:15 - revenue
149:16 - and costs are equal so we're looking
149:19 - from when those two things are the same
149:22 - so i'm gonna put in our equations
149:25 - revenue
149:27 - was 12
149:29 - x
149:30 - and cost
149:32 - was
149:33 - three thirty thousand dollars
149:38 - [Music]
149:40 - plus 450
149:42 - x
149:44 - solve this i'm going to move everything
149:46 - over to the same side i've got 12x
149:49 - minus 4.50
149:51 - x equals 30 000
149:55 - or
149:58 - 12 minus 4.5 i'm factoring out the x
150:09 - so i end up with
150:11 - 7.5 x equals 30 000
150:16 - so x is 30 000
150:19 - divided by 7.5
150:22 - which is the same as 4 000
150:26 - cases
150:28 - that's our breakeven and that's what it
150:29 - looked like on our chart
150:33 - so let's write that down
150:40 - break even is four thousand cases
150:43 - in sales
150:44 - we would need to sell
150:46 - well it's twelve dollars per case
150:51 - so if we sold forty eight thousand
150:54 - dollars worth of material worth of ice
150:56 - cream we would be at break even
150:59 - so we need to sell
151:05 - 4 000 cases of ice cream
151:12 - or
151:13 - we need to bring in
151:19 - 48 000 worth in sales
151:23 - and at that point our costs are also
151:25 - going to be 48 thousand dollars let's
151:28 - look at this
151:29 - capacity
151:32 - we cannot sell a million cases of ice
151:35 - cream
151:36 - we can't because our factory won't
151:39 - work so we have
151:41 - a capacity
151:43 - we always have a capacity
151:50 - so our factory and our staff and all the
151:52 - materials we have can only make
151:56 - 16 000 per month and there's always a
151:59 - limit
152:00 - if you think back to the very first day
152:03 - we talked about sam and charlie and
152:04 - their lemonade stand they can't suddenly
152:07 - sell
152:08 - 200 million liters of lemonade they are
152:10 - just two kids with a stand
152:13 - so our factory can only make 16 000 per
152:15 - month after that our calculations change
152:17 - because our fixed costs will change we
152:19 - will need to upgrade our factory we will
152:21 - need to hire more people things are
152:23 - going to change
152:25 - so what we're going to do is say we need
152:27 - to sell
152:31 - 4 000
152:33 - of our 16 000 maximum
152:36 - or 25 of capacity
152:41 - to break even
152:42 - this is a good thing to look at if it
152:44 - turns out we need to sell 90 of capacity
152:48 - that doesn't give us a lot of room to
152:50 - get to sell more
152:52 - and we have to sell quite a lot that's
152:54 - not a great business case if we only
152:56 - need to sell five percent of capacity
152:58 - then maybe we're in a good position we
153:00 - need to know these numbers
153:04 - okay going back to this problem let's
153:07 - calculate our profit or loss if
153:10 - 4001 cases are sold
153:14 - so profit
153:17 - equals
153:18 - revenue minus cost
153:22 - this time i'm going to write this with
153:24 - variables before i put in our numbers
153:27 - profit is
153:28 - revenue revenue is price
153:32 - times quantity and quantity is x
153:35 - cost is going to be
153:38 - fixed costs
153:39 - plus
153:41 - variable cost times x
153:46 - moving this around i end up with
153:50 - price
153:51 - minus
153:53 - variable costs
153:55 - x i've moved it around and i factored
153:57 - that out minus the fixed costs one thing
154:00 - to make sure of is the minus here in the
154:02 - brackets distributes
154:09 - i'm going to write that down because
154:10 - it's an easy thing to forget
154:12 - so price minus variable cost times x
154:15 - minus fixed costs
154:17 - we've seen this before in our case
154:20 - we got to the point where 12
154:24 - minus
154:25 - 450
154:27 - x
154:28 - minus 30 000
154:31 - that number price minus variable costs
154:36 - is something that we call the
154:38 - contribution margin
154:43 - another way to think of that is the
154:45 - gross profit per item
154:47 - that's what we were looking at in
154:48 - chapter one
154:50 - any time we calculated our margins and
154:52 - markups we were usually looking at that
154:54 - gross profit per item or markup in
154:58 - dollars
155:00 - those all mean the same thing
155:02 - that happens a lot in business math we
155:04 - end up with the same
155:06 - idea but expressed differently
155:09 - in this case
155:10 - we had 750x
155:13 - minus 30 000
155:16 - that's the profit equation
155:20 - for happy days ice cream
155:22 - 750 is our
155:25 - profit margin
155:26 - okay where am i going with this
155:29 - let's go back to profit or lost if 4001
155:32 - cases are sold
155:34 - so if x equals
155:36 - 4001
155:39 - there's an extra zero there
155:41 - i have
155:43 - profit
155:44 - equals
155:45 - 750 times 4001 minus 30 000
155:52 - putting that into my calculator i end up
155:55 - with
155:57 - 3007.5
156:00 - oh minus 30 000
156:04 - which gives me
156:06 - 750
156:11 - that's the contribution margin
156:17 - that isn't a coincidence
156:27 - so i'm going to say the first 4 000
156:29 - cases
156:33 - pay off the fixed costs
156:38 - every additional
156:43 - case contributes
156:47 - contributes contribution
156:49 - seven dollars and fifty cents to the net
156:52 - profit
156:54 - and in this case we are talking about
156:56 - net profit because we're subtracting the
156:58 - fixed costs
157:00 - that means if i had
157:04 - if we sell x equals 4002 cases
157:09 - our profits net profits are going to be
157:12 - two times
157:14 - seven dollars and fifty cents or fifteen
157:17 - dollars
157:24 - okay
157:25 - let's calculate the profit or loss if 3
157:27 - 250 cases are sold i'm going to scroll
157:31 - back up to look at our chart
157:33 - if we look over here
157:35 - this
157:36 - our breakeven point was at 4 000 cases
157:40 - 4001 gave us a profit of 750 but
157:44 - anything below 4 000 was a loss
157:46 - situation
157:49 - we know before we do any arithmetic at
157:52 - all
157:53 - that we're going to end up with a loss
158:04 - so we know going in no matter what
158:07 - happens we're going to lose money but
158:09 - anyways we're going to go and work this
158:11 - out our profit we've already said that
158:15 - once we've come up with this equation
158:18 - 750x minus thirty thousand dollars we
158:21 - can just plug this in
158:28 - so 750 times 3250
158:32 - minus 30 000
158:36 - is going to give us
158:38 - negative
158:41 - six two five
158:46 - so anytime we have a negative profit we
158:48 - have a loss of five thousand six hundred
158:50 - and twenty five dollars
158:54 - once we have that profit equation we can
158:56 - use it to solve all sorts of things
158:59 - let's say our company wants to make a
159:01 - profit of 75 000
159:03 - how many cases must they sell
159:05 - first of all we know it's going to be
159:08 - more than four thousand because four
159:10 - thousand had a profit of zero
159:12 - so let's just write that in
159:17 - we know it's more than four thousand
159:19 - cases
159:20 - but what we're going to do is set
159:23 - profit
159:25 - equals
159:27 - revenue minus costs
159:29 - equals 75 000.
159:32 - in our case we know what profit is
159:35 - profit is that contribution margin times
159:38 - x minus the fixed costs
159:41 - 750x minus 30 000 equals 75 000.
159:53 - moving over the thirty thousand dollars
159:57 - it moves from a negative
159:59 - to a positive
160:01 - we end up with
160:05 - x equals
160:07 - i'm going to write this whole thing in
160:13 - 105 000 over 7.50
160:17 - which is
160:19 - thousand dollars sorry fourteen thousand
160:32 - cases i'm going to say this is possible
160:40 - since it is under capacity
160:45 - if we need to sell 20 000 cases
160:53 - i'm going to write down we can't do that
160:55 - anything over 16 000 is impossible
160:58 - because our factory only fits 14
161:01 - thousand
161:04 - finally we're going to play around with
161:06 - the structure hungry days is considering
161:09 - dropping its prices and would like to
161:10 - make a profit of eighty two thousand
161:12 - dollars by selling sixteen thousand
161:14 - cases what should the new price be what
161:16 - is the break even in units
161:18 - so now things are changing our price is
161:21 - not twelve dollars anymore our price is
161:24 - something different so we're going to
161:26 - need a new profit equation
161:29 - always start with profit equals revenue
161:33 - minus costs
161:35 - what i'm going to do over here is write
161:37 - down all the things we have
161:39 - fixed costs variable costs price
161:43 - quantity
161:47 - and profit
161:50 - i'm going to write q or x and that's
161:52 - because we're going to talk about how
161:54 - the ba 2 calculator does this later
161:57 - our fixed costs didn't change
162:01 - our variable costs well those also
162:04 - didn't change
162:05 - our price is what we don't know
162:08 - x well we want to sell 16 000 cases so
162:12 - i'm gonna put that in a sixteen thousand
162:14 - if we sell our full capacity our profit
162:16 - will be eighty two thousand dollars
162:20 - once i have four out of these five items
162:23 - i can just solve for the rest using the
162:25 - profit equation
162:27 - so my profit is
162:30 - 82 000
162:33 - equals revenue well revenue is going to
162:36 - be price
162:39 - times
162:40 - x and x is sixteen thousand
162:45 - minus the costs well that's going to be
162:48 - four dollars and fifty cents
162:50 - times sixteen thousand
162:52 - minus because i don't actually let's put
162:55 - brackets in here then that's going to be
162:57 - plus
162:58 - 30 000
163:01 - our fixed costs
163:04 - once i put this together
163:06 - what we're going to do is clean up this
163:08 - equation
163:10 - moving
163:12 - the sides over i'm going to say 16 000
163:15 - times price
163:17 - minus what goes in this whole bracket
163:20 - dump that into a calculator and it's a
163:22 - hundred and two thousand
163:24 - that equals
163:27 - eighty-two thousand
163:29 - so now i have price
163:33 - equals
163:37 - 82 000
163:39 - plus 102 000
163:43 - over 16 000
163:46 - putting that into a calculator
163:50 - that is going to equal 184 000
163:54 - over 16 000
163:56 - which is
163:58 - 11.50
164:00 - so our new price
164:05 - is
164:07 - 11.50
164:11 - to find the break even in units
164:15 - all we have to do is the even equation
164:18 - so break even is just revenue
164:23 - is the same as costs
164:27 - our revenue is now 11.50
164:31 - times x but our cost remains the same at
164:34 - thirty thousand dollars
164:36 - plus four dollars and fifty cents
164:39 - times x
164:41 - giving us
164:44 - eleven dollars 11.50
164:46 - minus 450
164:47 - as our contribution margin
164:50 - equals 30 000
164:53 - that is going to end up with 1150 minus
164:57 - 450
165:00 - is a contribution margin of seven
165:03 - dollars so we have x equals thirty
165:05 - thousand dollars divided by seven
165:07 - thousand dollars again noting those
165:09 - dollar signs disappear and we get
165:13 - 4285.71428
165:19 - let's stop and look at that number
165:22 - can we sell
165:24 - 0.714 of a case of ice cream
165:27 - not really we're not selling carton by
165:29 - carton we're selling an entire case to
165:31 - our distributor so
165:33 - we have a key here
165:35 - always round up
165:37 - never round down
165:42 - if we round down we end up with a tiny
165:44 - loss that is not okay losing five cents
165:47 - is a loss
165:50 - a tiny profit is okay
165:54 - so we would prefer to end up
165:57 - up by five cents then down by five cents
166:00 - so we're always going to round up and
166:02 - say we need to sell
166:06 - 4
166:07 - 286 cases of ice cream
166:12 - let's do one last question question two
166:15 - rain city umbrellas does a thriving
166:17 - business and selling umbrellas each
166:19 - month they spend one thousand fifty
166:21 - seven dollars on rent for their prime
166:23 - umbrella kiosk and two thousand dollars
166:25 - on a salary for their sales person just
166:28 - highlight those numbers
166:30 - they also buy umbrellas wholesale for
166:32 - 750 per umbrella
166:35 - got a different color and then they sell
166:37 - each umbrella
166:38 - for 26 dollars to wet tourists find
166:41 - their break even point in sales
166:43 - so let's start by writing out all the
166:45 - elements of our formula
166:47 - we've got our fixed costs our variable
166:50 - costs
166:51 - are price
166:53 - so fixed costs here is going to be
166:56 - there's actually two things we're going
166:57 - to add together both rent and salaries
167:02 - gives us
167:05 - seven 3057.
167:06 - our variable cost is going to be seven
167:09 - dollars and fifty cents per umbrella
167:12 - that's how much it costs
167:15 - and our price is going to be twenty six
167:18 - dollars
167:20 - those are the variables we have our
167:22 - revenue
167:24 - is then twenty six dollars per umbrella
167:29 - x is the number of umbrellas
167:34 - our cost
167:36 - is going to be
167:39 - that
167:40 - 3057.
167:42 - plus an extra 7.50 for every umbrella we
167:46 - make to find the break even
167:51 - we set profit equals zero
167:55 - or we just do revenue equals costs those
167:59 - are equivalent so let's do revenue
168:02 - equals costs
168:03 - we have 26x
168:06 - equals
168:08 - 3057
168:10 - plus
168:11 - 750
168:13 - x we move things over
168:21 - 26 minus 750 x equals
168:24 - 3057.
168:30 - that's the same as x
168:32 - equals
168:34 - 3057 over
168:36 - 18.50 and just to write down 1850
168:41 - is our contribution margin or our gross
168:44 - profit per item
168:47 - that's nice to know
168:48 - it's pretty healthy profit margins in
168:51 - umbrellas
168:52 - solving this we end up with x equals
168:56 - 165
169:00 - we know we can't sell a quarter of
169:02 - umbrella of an umbrella so let's look
169:07 - if we sell
169:08 - 165 umbrellas
169:13 - then our profit
169:15 - is going to be
169:19 - well that would end up being
169:22 - negative four dollars and 50 cents and
169:26 - that's by putting in just our revenue
169:29 - minus cost
169:37 - so i'm writing in the equation
169:40 - put an extra minus there 3057.
169:44 - if we sell 166 umbrellas
169:50 - our profit ends up being exactly 14
169:52 - dollars
169:55 - here we have something going on this
169:58 - is a loss
169:59 - losses are not good
170:02 - if we sold 166 that would be a small
170:04 - profit and that's okay
170:11 - so we need to sell
170:12 - 166 umbrellas not 165
170:17 - or
170:18 - because it the question asked for sales
170:23 - we need to make twenty six dollars times
170:26 - 166
170:27 - which is the same as
170:30 - 4300 or
170:31 - 4316 dollars
170:34 - in sales
170:37 - hi welcome to lesson seven
170:40 - simple interest today we're going to
170:42 - start talking about time value money how
170:45 - money changes
170:47 - over time
170:54 - and the key here
170:56 - is time
170:58 - value money
171:00 - i'm going to write that down because
171:02 - this is going to come up again and again
171:04 - and that's the shortcut on our
171:06 - calculator
171:09 - this works via interest
171:13 - interest is money that you earn on
171:15 - investments
171:23 - in that case
171:25 - high rates are best
171:31 - or
171:34 - interest is the money that we pay on
171:36 - loans
171:38 - in that case low rates are best
171:44 - which case every problem we have we're
171:46 - going to have to decide am i borrowing
171:48 - money or am i investing money and that's
171:51 - how we're going to pick the basic
171:53 - which one is better so let's look at the
171:56 - two basic types of interest
172:04 - and those are simple
172:06 - and compound
172:08 - they are used for different things
172:11 - simple is what we're going to do today
172:15 - and in our next lesson
172:18 - we're going to talk about compound
172:19 - interest which is used more often
172:23 - however starting with simple we're going
172:25 - to come to a basic equation and
172:28 - everything we do
172:30 - is going to stem from this
172:35 - and that is going to be i equals p
172:39 - r
172:40 - t
172:41 - where i is the interest earned
172:47 - p is the principal whatever we invest or
172:50 - borrow
172:58 - and
172:59 - r
173:00 - is the interest rate
173:04 - i'm going to put annual there because
173:06 - that's important
173:08 - we're going to see this and t
173:10 - is time in years
173:18 - to illustrate what i really mean by time
173:21 - value money i'm going to give you a
173:23 - choice
173:27 - would you rather have
173:31 - one hundred dollars today
173:34 - or would you prefer to have one hundred
173:37 - dollars next year
173:40 - same amount of money different time
173:43 - well i don't know about you but i would
173:45 - prefer to have money today
173:52 - that's basically what we're doing
173:55 - we're trying to figure out
173:57 - today versus next year but let's change
173:59 - this now what would you prefer
174:04 - one hundred dollars today
174:08 - or
174:10 - two hundred dollars next year
174:12 - this is a harder question me personally
174:15 - i'm okay with waiting until next year
174:18 - but you might need the money now
174:20 - that's what's going to do how much does
174:22 - something have to be worth in the future
174:32 - to make it equally valuable so for the
174:35 - rest of the course we're going to be
174:36 - dealing with this question
174:38 - what's better money now or money later
174:41 - if we have less now and more later when
174:44 - are those things going to be the same or
174:46 - equivalent to us
174:49 - we're gonna jump right into a problem
174:52 - question one
174:54 - you deposit a thousand dollars into a
174:56 - bank that pays ten percent simple how
174:58 - much interest would you earn if you left
174:59 - the money in for two years for this
175:02 - whole question
175:04 - we're going to be using
175:06 - the equation i equals prt
175:09 - our p or principal is a thousand dollars
175:12 - that's how much money we're investing
175:14 - today our r
175:18 - sorry about that is going to be 10
175:22 - simple which is the same as 0.10
175:25 - and our t is going to vary so part a two
175:30 - years and since t is measured in years
175:34 - t is going to be two
175:37 - in this case i'm going to set this up i
175:40 - equals p
175:42 - r t
175:44 - is one thousand dollars
175:47 - times
175:48 - ten percent
175:50 - times two and when i put that in
175:53 - we've made two hundred dollars in
175:56 - interest
175:59 - let's write that down we have two
176:01 - hundred dollars in interest
176:06 - we have
176:08 - a future value
176:11 - this is
176:12 - something we're going to be talking
176:13 - about a lot of fv
176:16 - equals
176:17 - well we have the one thousand dollars we
176:19 - had
176:20 - and then we add 200 which means now
176:23 - we've got 1200 dollars
176:28 - okay let's go on to part b
176:30 - what if t is six months
176:34 - in this case what we're going to do is
176:37 - translate t into years
176:43 - and we can do this
176:45 - by using our conversions from chapter
176:48 - one there are 12 months in a year so six
176:52 - times months times a year
176:54 - divided by 12 months
176:56 - equals 6 over 12 years
177:00 - or 0.5 years
177:03 - for a lot of these unit conversions in
177:05 - time it's going to be simple to do it in
177:07 - your head six months is half a year but
177:10 - for other questions when we start
177:12 - talking about quarters and days it'll be
177:14 - easier to do an official unit conversion
177:16 - so be aware of that i'm going to cross
177:18 - off those months just so this looks good
177:21 - so let's look at how much interest we
177:23 - have
177:24 - i equals p
177:26 - r
177:27 - t
177:28 - our principal is still a thousand
177:30 - dollars
177:31 - our r is still 0.10 but our time is now
177:35 - 0.5
177:37 - which means we have made 50 dollars
177:40 - in interest
177:41 - let's try that one more time
177:47 - what if t equals 9 months in this case
177:51 - that's the same as 9 over 12 years
177:56 - or 0.75
178:02 - you should have i equals 75
178:07 - one of the important things about simple
178:09 - interest is that we often
178:11 - use things on a daily rate so we end up
178:14 - counting days a lot in the review for
178:17 - chapter one there's a video on how to
178:19 - use the date calculator for your ba two
178:21 - plus i encourage you to check that out
178:24 - so what we're going to do is go from
178:27 - march 3rd to november the 7th
178:32 - so march 3rd
178:37 - on our calculator is going to be march
178:39 - that's the third month
178:41 - 03
178:42 - third day and it doesn't matter what
178:44 - year we choose so i'm going to choose 20
178:47 - because that's this year
178:51 - november 7th well that's going to be the
178:53 - 11th month
178:55 - the 7th day and again i'm going to go
178:57 - with 2020. going over to our calculator
179:00 - i'm going to go to this date function
179:01 - which is above 1 and set my first date
179:04 - as 3.0320
179:08 - enter
179:09 - scroll down my second date is 11.07
179:16 - enter i'm going down to dvd which was
179:19 - days between days and i'm going to press
179:20 - compute that tells me that it's 249
179:25 - days
179:29 - so in that case i have t
179:32 - is 249
179:34 - days
179:36 - and in order to change that into years
179:38 - i'm going to remember that one year is
179:40 - 365
179:42 - days
179:43 - we're just always going to stick with
179:45 - 365 days for this class if you're doing
179:48 - something where you need to worry about
179:50 - leap years you'll be using a computer
179:52 - so what i'm going to use is 249
179:56 - divided by 365 years as my t value i'm
180:00 - going to leave that as a fraction
180:02 - so now i have i equals p r t
180:06 - again for this whole question it's one
180:08 - thousand times 10
180:11 - times 249 over 365.
180:15 - put that into a calculator and i'm going
180:17 - to do that clearing out of my dates
180:20 - 1000
180:24 - times 0.1
180:26 - times 249
180:28 - divided by 365
180:31 - that is
180:33 - 68.22 cents
180:38 - okay
180:39 - i'm going to make some notes about dates
180:47 - one of the notes is save all of our
180:49 - digits
180:52 - the best practice is to just use a
180:54 - fraction
180:55 - in our calculator
180:57 - that's why we didn't compute
181:00 - what 249 over 365 is
181:03 - leap
181:04 - year let's write this down
181:08 - every four years
181:10 - we have 366 days and it's even more
181:13 - complicated than that that every 100
181:16 - years or so we skip the leap year and
181:18 - every thousand dollars we skip the
181:19 - skipping thousand dollars it's thousand
181:21 - years guys
181:23 - okay and i'm going to say in this course
181:26 - we will always use 365.
181:32 - as the base or denominator don't worry
181:35 - about
181:37 - 366. for today for this course we're
181:40 - just going to ignore leap year and i'm
181:42 - going to make sure that no calculations
181:44 - take place over leap year
181:50 - what i would like you to do now
181:52 - is to pause this video and do the next
181:55 - three questions
181:58 - okay
181:59 - you should have
182:00 - for these questions
182:02 - t equals 261
182:05 - over 365
182:07 - t equals 123 over 365 and t equals
182:13 - 328 over 365.
182:17 - that should give you the following
182:19 - interest calculations
182:25 - 71.50
182:29 - and 70 cents and 89
182:33 - and 86 cents
182:35 - one thing i'm gonna note
182:38 - every time we do something like this
182:45 - that is not what i was trying to do
182:47 - let me try that again
182:51 - eh good enough okay
182:55 - here our interest is linear
183:00 - if we get one hundred dollars after one
183:02 - year we get two hundred dollars after
183:04 - two year and three hundred dollars after
183:06 - three year
183:10 - now that we know how to find the
183:12 - interest we're going to solve for other
183:13 - variables first we're going to start
183:15 - with finding the principal
183:17 - on december the 1st your one-year term
183:19 - deposit comes due when you collect the
183:21 - principal plus 120 in interest the term
183:24 - deposit paid six percent simple interest
183:27 - how much money did you deposit
183:29 - let's start with our equation
183:32 - everything we do starts with this i
183:35 - equals prt a linear equation
183:39 - solving for p
183:40 - means moving r and t to the other side
183:46 - p equals i divided by rt i
183:52 - is 102
183:54 - dollars
183:55 - p
183:57 - well that's what we're looking for
183:59 - r
184:00 - that's going to be six percent or 0.06
184:04 - and t is one year
184:09 - putting that together we end up with p
184:13 - equals
184:14 - 120
184:16 - divided by
184:17 - 0.06
184:19 - times one or one twenty divided by point
184:25 - zero six
184:26 - is two thousand dollars even
184:31 - so we invested
184:35 - two thousand dollars
184:41 - let's try that one more time
184:43 - 18 months ago you purchased a bond that
184:45 - paid 7.5 simple interest you cashed on
184:48 - the bond and received the principal plus
184:50 - 337 dollars and 50 cents in interest
184:54 - find the principal
184:55 - again
184:56 - pause
184:58 - and work this out
185:07 - okay
185:09 - p
185:10 - equals i divided by r
185:13 - t
185:14 - 337.50
185:18 - divided by
185:20 - seventy five
185:22 - zero point seven five times one point
185:25 - five putting that all in three thousand
185:28 - dollars
185:30 - now we're going to solve for time
185:32 - on may 31st you decided it was time to
185:35 - start a new life in the palm trees you
185:37 - emptied out your bank account you
185:38 - received your principal
185:40 - of
185:41 - 1750 an interest of
185:45 - dollars and 50 cents how long had your
185:47 - money been in the bank if the account
185:48 - paid interest at five percent simple
185:52 - so let's write this down again i equals
185:56 - p
185:57 - r t
185:58 - when we solve for t
186:01 - we end up with i
186:03 - divided by
186:05 - p
186:06 - times r
186:09 - so let's
186:10 - look at all the things we have i p
186:14 - equals p rt
186:16 - our interest is going to be 437.50
186:21 - our principal
186:23 - is 1750.
186:26 - our rate is five percent
186:28 - simple
186:29 - and time well that's what we're going to
186:32 - solve for
186:34 - so now i put this into my equation
186:38 - t equals i
186:43 - divided by p
186:48 - times r
186:51 - i'm going to put this into the
186:52 - calculator so you can see how i do that
186:55 - 437.5
186:58 - divided by 1750
187:01 - and i like to press equals and then
187:03 - divide by 0.05
187:06 - and i end up with 5.
187:10 - and t is always measured in years does
187:13 - it matter that it's may 31st
187:15 - not really
187:19 - let's do this again question 5. on your
187:22 - 65th birthday you eagerly cash in one of
187:24 - your rrsps or retirement savings plan
187:28 - you receive a total of four thousand two
187:31 - hundred ninety five dollars your
187:33 - original investment was three thousand
187:35 - and your interest was paid at seven
187:36 - percent simple how many months was your
187:38 - money in the rrsp
187:40 - this is a slightly more complicated
187:43 - problem because we don't have our
187:45 - interest instead we have a future value
187:48 - of four thousand two hundred and ninety
187:50 - five dollars that is principal plus
187:54 - interest together
187:58 - our principal is three thousand dollars
188:01 - three thousand dollars plus what equals
188:03 - four thousand two hundred five well we
188:06 - know that we must have made 1295
188:10 - in interest which is
188:13 - 4295
188:15 - minus 3 000.
188:18 - our interest rate is seven percent and
188:20 - our t is what we're looking for and
188:22 - we're looking for it in months which
188:24 - we're going to get to
188:26 - at the end i'm going to scroll up a
188:28 - little bit
188:30 - and start again with t
188:32 - by our formula before
188:35 - t equals p
188:37 - over
188:39 - sorry
188:42 - i
188:42 - over p
188:44 - times r
188:46 - i will fix that so when i put that in i
188:49 - end up with
188:51 - 1
188:52 - 295
188:54 - divided by 3 000
188:57 - times
188:58 - 0.07
189:00 - let's look at that on the calculator one
189:02 - two
189:03 - nine five divided by three thousand
189:06 - dollars
189:07 - equals and divide that by .07 and i
189:10 - usually like to do my division in two
189:12 - steps like that and i end up with six
189:15 - point
189:17 - one six six six six seven and remember
189:21 - this is in years
189:22 - six and a bit years
189:25 - to get this into months the way we want
189:33 - well i'm going to have to remember that
189:36 - one year is 12 months writing down this
189:39 - formal calculation
189:41 - helps us to make sure that we divide and
189:43 - multiply properly so i'm going to
189:45 - multiply this times 12
189:47 - and once i do that you'll see that it is
189:49 - exactly
189:50 - 74 months
189:57 - finally in time we're going to look at
189:59 - this question how long will it take to
190:01 - double your money at eight percent
190:03 - simple well i've got
190:06 - so let's start with i equals p
190:08 - r t
190:10 - i know that r is eight percent and i
190:12 - know that t is what i'm looking for but
190:14 - i don't know i or p
190:16 - so my tip is going to be
190:22 - pick any p just like we did in chapter
190:25 - one we don't know a number we can make
190:27 - something up because everything is
190:29 - proportional
190:31 - i always use one hundred dollars when i
190:34 - can a thousand one all good answer if i
190:38 - invest a hundred dollars then to double
190:40 - it
190:43 - makes i going to be also a hundred
190:45 - dollars or future value
190:48 - is 200
190:51 - 100 plus 100 so if i make a hundred
190:53 - dollars in interest i've doubled it
190:56 - so i've got
190:58 - t
190:59 - equals i
191:01 - over p
191:02 - times r
191:04 - or 100
191:06 - divided by 100
191:09 - times
191:10 - 0.08 notice that the 100 is the same on
191:13 - the top on the bottom no matter what
191:15 - number i chose it would end up that way
191:18 - so all i have to do is divide
191:21 - take point zero eight and say one
191:23 - divided by that there's a handy button
191:25 - for this on the calculator
191:27 - 12.5 years
191:34 - now we're going to solve for r
191:36 - same equation exact same thing except
191:39 - this time
191:40 - i equals p rt we're solving for r when
191:45 - we rearrange this we get r equals i
191:48 - divided by p times t
191:51 - on march the sixth you deposit three
191:53 - thousand dollars into a bank account you
191:56 - withdraw the principal and interest
191:58 - totaling three thousand one hundred
192:00 - twenty three dollars
192:03 - and 29 cents on december the 31st what
192:06 - interest rate was paid
192:09 - so what we're going to do
192:12 - is see which things we need to do
192:15 - here we deposited three thousand dollars
192:18 - that's the principle
192:21 - our interest is going to be 123.29
192:26 - or the future value
192:29 - minus the principal three thousand one
192:31 - hundred twenty three dollars and twenty
192:33 - nine cents minus three thousand dollars
192:36 - i'm just gonna re-highlight that
192:39 - r well that's what we are solving for at
192:42 - this time and t
192:44 - i'm going to put this in already but i
192:47 - would like you guys to take the time
192:49 - pause if you'd like
192:51 - and show that you can do in the
192:53 - calculator
192:54 - finding out that march the 6th to
192:57 - december 31st is 300 days i'm gonna
193:00 - remind you that date one is march the
193:04 - sixth
193:07 - third month sixth day
193:10 - uh let's pretend it's 2020. some people
193:13 - like to present it's 2 000 then you
193:15 - don't have to put anything in at all and
193:17 - it goes until december 31st
193:22 - and you're computing days between days
193:25 - so you can go ahead and do that on your
193:28 - own
193:29 - let's put this in
193:31 - r equals
193:33 - 123.29
193:36 - divided by 3 000
193:39 - times 300 over 365.
193:43 - this is a little more tricky to do i'm
193:46 - going to show you how to do this on the
193:47 - calculator if you're familiar with
193:49 - algebra you might want to simplify this
193:51 - expression but what i'm going to do is
193:54 - start with the bottom
193:56 - putting this into the calculator 300
193:59 - days divided by 365
194:03 - equals i'm gonna multiply that by three
194:05 - thousand dollars
194:07 - that's the denominator now what i'm
194:09 - going to do is use that 1 over x button
194:11 - to put it on the bottom and multiply it
194:13 - by 123.29
194:17 - that gives me
194:20 - almost exactly
194:26 - five percent
194:28 - that's a nice even number
194:30 - forgetting about the round off
194:35 - one more on december 16 2011 you
194:38 - withdrew your entire christmas fund of
194:40 - 2098.63
194:42 - from your account you deposited 2 000 on
194:45 - february 19th 2011. what simple interest
194:48 - was paid i want you guys to pause
194:52 - writing that down
194:53 - and then i will show you the answer
194:57 - ready
194:58 - here's the answer
195:00 - we end up with six percent make sure
195:02 - that you can count those days and get
195:04 - 300 days if not this is a really good
195:07 - thing to talk to me about during lab
195:12 - okay
195:14 - finally we're ready to solve for the
195:16 - future value the future value
195:20 - is the principal plus the interest how
195:23 - much money we have in the future
195:25 - you've decided to start a new car fund
195:28 - you deposit six thousand dollars into an
195:30 - account paying 10 simple how much money
195:33 - will you have in 50 months
195:36 - okay so let's look at this
195:39 - future value is principal plus i
195:44 - i
195:47 - equals
195:49 - p
195:50 - r t that means that future value is
195:53 - principal plus principal times r t what
195:56 - we can do is factor out this
196:00 - p and we get 1 plus r
196:04 - t
196:05 - this
196:06 - is a formula that we're going to see a
196:09 - lot of
196:10 - and if i want to go backwards because
196:12 - we're going to see this p equals fv
196:15 - divided by 1 plus rt
196:18 - these are new equations that we're going
196:20 - to see
196:22 - are sometimes easier to use in this case
196:25 - i never need to solve for i
196:27 - so f b
196:29 - p
196:30 - r
196:31 - t
196:32 - future value is what i'm trying to find
196:34 - the present value is 6 000
196:37 - r is 10
196:39 - and t is 50 months which is 50 over 12
196:44 - years and i'm going to leave that as 50
196:46 - over 12.
196:47 - so the future value equals the principal
196:53 - times 1 plus 0.1
196:57 - times 50 over 12.
197:03 - i'm going to put that into the
197:05 - calculator now
197:06 - let's pull up our calculator
197:08 - and i like to work from the inside out
197:10 - and you can use your brackets to do this
197:12 - any way you want
197:14 - 50 divided by 12 is this
197:18 - times 10 percent
197:21 - add 1
197:23 - equals now i'm going to multiply that by
197:25 - 6 000
197:27 - and i end up with 8 500
197:33 - i don't have the interest here it's easy
197:36 - to tell
197:37 - that the interest is going to be future
197:40 - value minus principal
197:42 - which is eighty five hundred dollars
197:44 - minus six thousand dollars
197:47 - is twenty five hundred but it's good to
197:49 - know we don't need that intermediate
197:52 - value
197:55 - okay let's do another one like this on
197:57 - december 31st you were paid a loan to
197:59 - the hammerhead finance and loan company
198:02 - you repaid six thousand dollars which
198:04 - was principal and interest on a
198:06 - five-year loan at 10 simple how much
198:09 - money did you borrow
198:10 - well in this case i don't know i or p
198:17 - i need to use this future value
198:20 - one p
198:21 - equals f v divided by one plus r t so
198:26 - let's write that down p
198:28 - f b
198:29 - r and t
198:31 - principles what i'm trying to find the
198:33 - future value is six thousand dollars
198:35 - because that was principal plus interest
198:38 - the interest rate is ten percent and the
198:40 - time was five years
198:43 - putting that into our equation here i
198:45 - get p equals six thousand dollars
198:49 - divided by
198:50 - one
198:51 - plus zero point one times five
198:54 - this time i'm going to simplify the
198:57 - denominator i think that ends up being
198:59 - easier to put into a calculator
199:03 - well point one times five is point five
199:05 - so i end up with six thousand divided by
199:08 - one point five
199:13 - well that is exactly four thousand
199:15 - dollars so that's how much we borrowed
199:23 - i'm going to do a little calculator note
199:25 - here
199:28 - 1 plus 0.10
199:31 - times 5
199:32 - with our brackets the way they should be
199:35 - multiplication before addition is 1 plus
199:37 - 0.5 is 1.5
199:41 - if i do this wrong
199:44 - one plus 0.1
199:46 - addition first and then multiply it by
199:48 - 5. that's chain mode i end up with 1.1
199:51 - times 5 which is 5.5
199:55 - this is wrong this is not the way we
199:57 - should be doing things so pay attention
199:59 - to the algebra and how you put things in
200:01 - the calculator it's okay to use extra
200:05 - steps
200:07 - hi and welcome to lesson 8 compound
200:10 - interest
200:12 - let's start by remembering simple
200:14 - interest when we talk about simple
200:17 - interest
200:20 - we are only
200:24 - sorry i'm going to race we
200:26 - only earn interest
200:30 - on the principal
200:38 - so only on the principle do we earn
200:40 - interest with compound interest it's
200:43 - different
200:58 - what's happening with compound interest
201:00 - is every time we get interest we add
201:02 - that back to the principal and we earn
201:04 - interest on it
201:07 - let's look at what these look like as a
201:10 - graph
201:15 - okay
201:16 - simple interest
201:18 - looks like a line so i'm just going to
201:22 - uh do this
201:25 - there we go
201:26 - so this is
201:28 - simple interest
201:32 - and what we're looking at here is the
201:33 - future value and over here we've got
201:37 - time the more time we spend the more
201:39 - money we get
201:41 - compound interest is a little bit
201:43 - different instead of being a straight
201:44 - line it's going to end up looking like
201:46 - an exponential curve
201:50 - i have to draw it in this way there we
201:52 - go
202:01 - exponential versus linear exponential
202:04 - grows really really fast over the long
202:06 - term well simple interest a linear curve
202:09 - stays the same that's the difference
202:12 - between it so what we're going to do is
202:15 - look at a very simple example
202:17 - so let's invest a thousand dollars
202:23 - at 25
202:25 - simple
202:26 - one note you're going to see throughout
202:28 - these lectures and throughout this
202:30 - entire course i often use really big
202:32 - interest rates no bank out there is
202:35 - paying 25 simple but big interest rates
202:38 - make the math and the arithmetic easier
202:40 - to see and that's why we use it not
202:43 - because there's an investment that
202:44 - actually gets 25 simple
202:47 - so let's do that for a year
202:50 - in that case our future value
202:55 - is going to be
202:58 - principal times 1 plus rt our principal
203:02 - was a thousand dollars
203:04 - one plus 0.25
203:08 - times one once i dump that into a
203:11 - calculator
203:12 - i get
203:14 - two hundred and fifty dollars
203:17 - okay let's reinvest
203:27 - so we're gonna take that money and we're
203:29 - going to put it in for another year now
203:32 - our future value is going to be
203:36 - 1250
203:37 - times
203:39 - 1.25 that's the same as up here and that
203:43 - gives me
203:44 - one thousand five hundred sixty two
203:47 - dollars and fifty cents
203:50 - okay
203:51 - what about
203:53 - simple for two years
203:57 - so if i just did this for two years
204:01 - instead of taking that money out and
204:03 - then reinvesting
204:05 - i would end up with a thousand dollars
204:08 - one plus point two five times two is
204:12 - fifteen hundred dollars
204:15 - so in this case
204:18 - i've got sixty two extra dollars
204:27 - we have an extra 62 dollars because we
204:29 - took the money out and reinvested and
204:32 - otherwise we got
204:36 - interest on the interest and our
204:38 - interest to remember after the first
204:40 - year was 250
204:43 - so if i look at that 250 dollars
204:46 - times one
204:49 - uh
204:50 - yeah let's go sorry 0.25
204:53 - and times one that ends up being sixty
204:55 - two dollars and fifty cents
204:57 - so what i've ended up with is exactly
205:00 - the interest on the interest
205:04 - scrolling down that leads us to a
205:05 - formula
205:10 - so after many years
205:13 - when i'm compounding this way every year
205:15 - i'm taking it out and i'm reinvesting
205:18 - after one year
205:20 - i have a thousand times 1.25 two years
205:28 - three years
205:29 - well let's multiply it by 1.25 again
205:34 - and i do that a bunch of times
205:37 - so after n years
205:39 - where n is a big number
205:42 - or any number
205:44 - future value equals
205:46 - one thousand
205:48 - 1.25
205:51 - to the power of n i'm multiplying this
205:53 - together n times that's an exponent so
205:57 - now i have an exponential equation
206:03 - let's look more about how often we
206:05 - compound
206:09 - how often do we compound in that example
206:11 - we compounded annually
206:15 - and that means once a year so
206:17 - something like a gic will be annual
206:19 - interest
206:20 - semi-annually
206:22 - that means twice a year
206:28 - that is going to be what we're going to
206:30 - see later on the course is mortgages in
206:32 - canada are compounded sempi annually
206:35 - quarterly
206:36 - quarterly is something that you haven't
206:38 - probably seen a lot but what is used a
206:41 - lot in business that means four times
206:43 - per year
206:47 - or every three months
206:49 - which is confusing three months and a
206:51 - quarter because three times four equals
206:53 - 12 months in a year quarterly is how
206:56 - businesses file their reports and do
206:58 - their financial statements
207:00 - monthly this is probably i'm not what
207:03 - you've seen the most and i'm just going
207:05 - to write that 12 times per year
207:07 - and this is something like your credit
207:09 - card or your bank account
207:14 - this is one of the most common
207:17 - monthly and then we have weekly this
207:19 - isn't really used very much
207:22 - but it's nice to know
207:24 - i'm actually going to put bi-weekly
207:28 - because we're going to see that in
207:30 - mortgages that's 26 times per year
207:35 - or every two weeks
207:37 - and a lot of you
207:39 - if you are working will be paid
207:41 - bi-weekly or every two weeks in which
207:43 - case you need to know that i'm going to
207:45 - add in daily
207:47 - that's every day some bank accounts work
207:49 - that way et cetera i could compound
207:52 - a thousand times a year we don't do that
207:55 - very often but it's possible
208:00 - okay
208:05 - we compound
208:07 - and compounding means to compute
208:09 - interest
208:13 - add it to the principle
208:22 - okay so we compute it and we add it to
208:24 - the principal how many times per year
208:26 - i'm going to come up with m times per
208:28 - year
208:33 - i'm also going to write this
208:37 - actually i'm not going to say p
208:39 - let's say c y
208:41 - on the calculator
208:43 - and we're going to see this later on but
208:44 - the calculator uses that
208:48 - i'm going to write in some m's i'm going
208:50 - to scroll up here and i'm going to write
208:53 - m equals 1
208:55 - m equals 2
208:57 - m equals 4 for quarterly's m equals 12
209:00 - for monthly
209:01 - m equals 52
209:03 - m equals 26 bi-weekly and m equals 365
209:08 - because i'm ignoring leap year
209:10 - that's probably all the ones you will
209:12 - see
209:13 - okay
209:15 - let's do some terminology
209:20 - nominal that's the english word for in
209:23 - name only
209:30 - and we call that j
209:31 - with a little m subscript and i'm just
209:33 - going to write in name only
209:37 - because we don't use it to compute
209:46 - so let's look at an example of nominal
209:51 - so my bank
209:52 - pays a very large
209:57 - j12 a nominal rate of 24
210:01 - that means
210:07 - it's a monthly rate
210:09 - so the interest is paid into my bank
210:11 - account once per month
210:16 - this actually means how much per month
210:24 - two percent 24 over 12 is two percent
210:28 - per month so nominal is not what were
210:30 - you going to use in our computations 24
210:33 - isn't going to go into our math 2 is and
210:36 - this is called the periodic rate
210:44 - i'm going to rewrite that that's .02
210:48 - and that's called the periodic rate
210:54 - and that's the rate per period over that
210:57 - time
210:59 - this is a formula it's fairly easy to
211:01 - remember but
211:03 - when in doubt look something up
211:08 - so nominal
211:12 - is j m
211:14 - then the periodic
211:17 - is i
211:19 - and we call it i equals j m divided by m
211:23 - so if our nominal
211:25 - was j 12 equals
211:29 - 24
211:30 - then i equals 24
211:34 - over 12 equals two
211:38 - percent i think we have most everything
211:41 - we need now to be able to share the
211:44 - formula for compound interest
211:50 - and this is the important one
211:52 - you'll probably end up memorizing it but
211:54 - you can always look at it on tests and
211:56 - this is going to be fv
211:59 - equals pv
212:01 - 1 plus i to the power of n
212:04 - explain what these things mean fb we've
212:07 - seen that that's called future value
212:11 - when we talk about compound interest we
212:14 - use pv
212:16 - to be the opposite of future value is
212:18 - present value what we have now
212:20 - and that's the same as p for principle
212:25 - they're the same thing
212:26 - i is the periodic rate
212:31 - so that would be j m
212:33 - over m
212:34 - if we have that and n is the number of
212:37 - periods
212:40 - so the number of
212:42 - months or weeks depending on how we're
212:45 - compounding it okay
212:47 - let's start with question number one
212:49 - we're going to invest 100 for one year
212:52 - with a nominal rate of 24
212:55 - and now we're going to look at a whole
212:57 - bunch of different kinds of compounding
213:00 - so starting
213:01 - with
213:02 - m m is how many times per year we
213:05 - compound for annually this is one
213:09 - for semi-annually this is two
213:13 - what i would like you to do
213:15 - is keep on pausing this video and fill
213:18 - things out so fill out quarterly and
213:19 - monthly now
213:24 - okay hopefully you paused and came up
213:26 - with four quarters per year or 12 months
213:29 - per year
213:30 - now i'm going to write in the nominal
213:32 - rate
213:33 - annual means j1 equals 24
213:38 - semiannual j2 equals 24
213:42 - pause
213:45 - hopefully you have written in j4 equals
213:48 - 24
213:50 - and j12 equals 24
213:56 - for the periodic rate what we do is we
213:58 - divide it so remember i'm going to write
214:01 - up here i equals j m
214:04 - over m
214:06 - so if m is 1 we're just dividing by 1.
214:09 - that makes this really easy
214:16 - semi-annual we're going to divide it by
214:18 - 2 so 24 divided by 2 is 12 percent you
214:22 - guys try it pause
214:26 - hopefully
214:27 - you have
214:29 - i equals six percent that's 24 over four
214:33 - and i equals two percent or 24 divided
214:37 - by 12.
214:39 - how many periods are in a year well how
214:41 - many years are in a year that's actually
214:44 - fairly easy
214:46 - one
214:47 - how many years
214:49 - how sorry how many half years
214:52 - are in a year that's going to be two how
214:55 - many quarters in a year four quarters in
214:57 - a year and 12 months in a year so now
214:59 - we're going to do our future value
215:01 - computations
215:03 - i'm going to write over here
215:04 - fv is 100
215:07 - one
215:08 - plus
215:09 - .24
215:13 - to the power of one because it's one
215:15 - year that gives me
215:18 - 124 dollars
215:20 - for semi-annual
215:23 - well i take that hundred dollars and
215:25 - it's one plus i
215:27 - that's
215:28 - 1.12 but it's happening twice when i
215:31 - compound it twice i get 125.
215:35 - and 45.44
215:38 - your turn
215:42 - well hopefully you paused it and came up
215:45 - with
215:47 - fb is 100
215:50 - 1.06 to the power of 4
215:53 - which is 126 dollars and 25 cents and
215:58 - finally
216:00 - 126.82 cents
216:02 - which is the same as 100
216:05 - 1.02 to the power of 12.
216:13 - look at these
216:15 - one thing you should notice is that the
216:17 - future value is increasing
216:21 - the more you compound the bigger it gets
216:25 - if you want to know the limit the
216:27 - absolute biggest it can be
216:28 - we'll talk about that a little bit later
216:30 - but you can use your calculator to
216:32 - compute that fairly nicely
216:34 - so
216:36 - the more we compound the more money we
216:38 - get up to a certain point
216:41 - compounding makes a huge difference in
216:43 - our equation over here we use i
216:47 - not
216:48 - that nominal rate we only use the 24
216:51 - when we're talking about annual
216:55 - okay let's start with question two
216:57 - you have five thousand dollars and you
216:59 - deposit the money in a mutual fund that
217:01 - has an average return of nine percent
217:03 - compounded annually how much will you
217:05 - have when you retire in 25 years
217:07 - okay
217:08 - so let's look at all the elements of our
217:11 - equation i'm going to rewrite
217:14 - the compound interest equation future
217:17 - value equals present value 1 plus i to
217:20 - the power of m
217:22 - future value is the thing we're trying
217:24 - to find
217:25 - present value here
217:27 - that's 5 000 dollars
217:31 - average return of nine percent that's
217:34 - going to be
217:35 - one because it says annual that annual
217:38 - means it's j1 equals nine percent or
217:42 - 0.09
217:46 - that means
217:48 - that i
217:49 - is going to be 9
217:51 - divided by 1 which is just 0.09 that's
217:55 - the good thing about annual and why
217:57 - people use them
217:58 - let's change colors so we can see it a
218:00 - little better n is going to be 25 years
218:04 - here n is counting years because it's
218:07 - the same as annual
218:09 - those things go together if it was a
218:11 - monthly we would talk about months
218:14 - so our future value
218:19 - actually let's write this at the bottom
218:22 - we end up with future value equals
218:25 - five thousand
218:28 - one plus nine percent which is 1.09 to
218:31 - the power of 25. i'm just going to show
218:34 - this on the calculator because
218:37 - sometimes
218:38 - it can get difficult 5000 times 1.09
218:44 - to the power of that's this y to the
218:46 - power of x and then i write 25
218:50 - and i should get 43 000 it's a big
218:52 - number
218:58 - if you're getting the wrong answer and
219:00 - i'd like you to try this it's a good
219:02 - chance that your settings are wrong so
219:03 - go back to
219:05 - week zero look at the video on how to do
219:07 - your settings and make sure that it's on
219:09 - aos mode not chn
219:12 - just to check what if i had done simple
219:14 - interest
219:17 - i would have started with five thousand
219:19 - dollars
219:21 - and i would have added one plus
219:24 - nine percent
219:25 - times 25 years dumping that into a
219:29 - calculator i would have had sixteen
219:32 - thousand two hundred and fifty dollars
219:35 - what would you prefer forty three
219:36 - thousand sixteen thousand this is
219:39 - definitely better
219:41 - to practice this i'm gonna give you a
219:43 - nice little bonus
219:50 - we do with your age so that's 65 or
219:53 - whatever retirement date you want
219:55 - minus your age and i'm gonna say let's
219:58 - use j1 equals six percent that's a more
220:01 - conservative estimate of how you can do
220:03 - in the market over the long term
220:10 - okay let's do another one you deposit
220:13 - ten thousand dollars at j4 equals twelve
220:15 - percent for 54 months how much money
220:17 - will you have
220:19 - let's go back to finding all of our
220:22 - items our present value
220:24 - what we start with is 10 000
220:28 - j4 that's a quarterly nominal rate is 12
220:33 - or 0.12
220:36 - that means that i
220:40 - equals
220:41 - 0.12 divided by
220:44 - 4. or three percent
220:50 - that's what we're going to use in our
220:51 - calculation
220:52 - n
220:54 - n is 54 months
220:57 - but we don't want it to be monthly we
221:00 - want it to be quarterly
221:05 - so we're going to use a unit conversion
221:07 - just like we did in chapter one to
221:09 - change it from months into quarters and
221:12 - i'm going to do this the long way once
221:14 - you're more comfortable with it you can
221:16 - do this quickly you can sometimes do it
221:18 - in your head but i'm going to go very
221:20 - slowly i'm going to note that one year
221:24 - is equal to 12 months
221:28 - now i cross off my months
221:30 - i'm also going to note that one year and
221:33 - i put that on the bottom
221:35 - right because i want to cancel things
221:37 - off is equal to four quarters
221:45 - so what i have here is 54
221:51 - times 4
221:52 - divided by 12
221:55 - quarters or
221:57 - 18 quarters
222:01 - i'm going to write this one more time
222:03 - you might
222:04 - look at me and say hey but you already
222:07 - told me
222:08 - that there are three months and a
222:10 - quarter
222:14 - that's right 54 divided by 3
222:20 - is 18 quarters
222:22 - either way
222:24 - one of the strange things is that
222:26 - quarters seem to be hard it's hard to
222:28 - remember it's three months your brain
222:30 - thinks quarter four it should be four
222:32 - months that's incorrect
222:36 - okay back to our equation future value
222:38 - is present value one plus i to the power
222:42 - of n present value is ten thousand
222:45 - dollars
222:46 - uh i was three percent
222:50 - n is eighteen quarters and that gives us
222:55 - seventeen thousand
222:57 - twenty four dollars and thirty three
222:59 - cents that's how much money i have
223:02 - how much interest did i make
223:04 - can use the same thing we did before
223:07 - interest is the difference between how
223:08 - much money we have and how much money we
223:11 - started with in other words
223:14 - i have seventeen thousand dollars and
223:16 - some change
223:17 - i started with ten thousand dollars
223:20 - so now i must have made seven thousand
223:23 - and twenty four dollars and thirty three
223:24 - cents in interest
223:29 - question four you would like to save
223:31 - twenty thousand dollars so you can take
223:33 - a year off in 42 months how much should
223:35 - you deposit today if money earns four
223:37 - percent compounded semi-annually okay
223:40 - let's note that
223:44 - we have the same formula we start every
223:46 - single example with this time we're
223:49 - trying to solve for present value not
223:51 - future value so i'm going to divide both
223:53 - sides by 1 plus i to the n and come up
223:55 - with this formula present value equals
223:58 - future value
223:59 - over 1 plus i to the n that's important
224:04 - it's a formula that you are going to see
224:06 - many times we'll go put a box around it
224:09 - let's look at what we have in this
224:11 - problem
224:12 - we're trying to find a future value of
224:14 - twenty thousand dollars we have a
224:17 - semi-annual interest rate of four
224:19 - percent which means
224:22 - that i is going to be 0.04 over two or
224:26 - two percent
224:28 - n is 42 months and i want to get that
224:31 - into half years
224:34 - most people can remember quite easily
224:36 - that one half year
224:39 - is exactly six months
224:43 - so in the end we end up with seven half
224:46 - years
224:49 - going back to this equation our present
224:51 - value equation
224:53 - pv equals twenty thousand dollars
224:57 - divided by 1.02 to the power of seven
225:01 - put that in i'm going to go with 1.02
225:05 - to the power of seven
225:07 - solve for that and use that one over x
225:09 - button
225:10 - multiply it by twenty thousand dollars
225:14 - and i end up with one thousand sorry
225:16 - seventeen thousand four hundred eleven
225:19 - dollars
225:20 - and twenty cents
225:22 - one more question
225:24 - how much money do you need to invest to
225:25 - earn a thousand dollars in interest in
225:28 - 18 months if the interest rate is eight
225:30 - percent compounded quarterly
225:32 - this is going to be a weird one because
225:34 - we don't know the present value or the
225:36 - future value instead all we know is the
225:40 - difference between those things is a
225:42 - thousand dollars
225:44 - that's why this is a tricky question uh
225:47 - quarterly n is 18 months
225:52 - and i'm going to go ahead and say that
225:53 - six quarters but if you need some help
225:56 - getting from months to quarters go back
225:58 - and watch the other videos and do a
225:59 - proper unit conversion
226:02 - i'm going to use a few of these
226:03 - equations future value equals present
226:06 - value plus interest
226:08 - and
226:09 - present value
226:12 - equals future value over 1 plus i
226:16 - to the n
226:18 - putting those
226:20 - together i end up with
226:24 - present value equals future value still
226:27 - don't know what that is
226:29 - uh what was my interest rate eight
226:31 - percent
226:40 - well let's just remember that it's eight
226:42 - percent quarterly so it's two percent
226:45 - as our periodic rate and this is going
226:47 - in for six quarters
226:49 - okay
226:50 - put this together and i know what fb is
226:52 - so what i'm going to do is substitute
226:54 - this
226:55 - into that
227:05 - i'm going to write that again
227:07 - pv
227:08 - equals pv
227:10 - plus i and i is a thousand dollars
227:13 - divided by 1.02
227:16 - to the sixth this looks confusing but we
227:19 - can solve this with algebra
227:22 - with algebra i know i'm gonna multiply
227:24 - both sides by 1.02 to the sixth and i
227:28 - could work out what that is but i've
227:30 - decided to leave it
227:33 - for the moment
227:36 - and i get
227:38 - 1.02 to the power of 6 times present
227:42 - value equals
227:43 - present value plus one thousand
227:47 - well that's easier for me to handle
227:50 - moving this around i end up with
227:54 - 1.02
227:56 - to the power of 6 minus one times the
228:00 - present value equals a thousand dollars
228:03 - well mul divide both sides
228:12 - and then dump that into a calculator
228:15 - and we get
228:19 - 7926.29 i'm just going to show you over
228:21 - here on the calculator i'm going to go
228:24 - with
228:26 - 1.02
228:28 - to the power of six minus one
228:32 - equals a big thing i'm gonna store that
228:34 - store one
228:36 - clear
228:37 - and you can notice when i press recall
228:38 - one there it is so now i'm gonna say a
228:41 - thousand
228:43 - that is ten thousand let's do one
228:49 - i hope you were having better luck with
228:51 - your real calculators as opposed to the
228:53 - silly emulator recall one
228:56 - and we get the same thing i have over
228:58 - there
229:02 - ba two plus calculator time it's time to
229:06 - learn about tvm time value money and
229:09 - you'll see that on your calculator and
229:11 - if you look at the instruction manual
229:14 - that came with it you'll see
229:16 - all the things that i'm doing
229:18 - we're going to illustrate this with a an
229:21 - example as usual and you're going to see
229:23 - this chart
229:24 - written again and again and again typed
229:27 - out hand written all over the place i'm
229:29 - going to be writing the same thing every
229:31 - single time
229:32 - so mclean's magazine estimates that it
229:34 - will cost 130 000 for a four-year
229:37 - university education when children born
229:39 - this year reach university in 18 years
229:42 - you have ten thousand dollars to invest
229:43 - today what annual rate is required to
229:46 - reach 130 000
229:49 - i'm going to write this in
229:51 - as an equation we know our present value
229:54 - future value equation
229:55 - is
229:57 - future value is present value 1 plus i
230:01 - to the power of n the future value i
230:04 - want here is and thirty thousand dollars
230:08 - that equals present value sorry we know
230:11 - what that present value is it's ten
230:12 - thousand dollars
230:15 - one plus i and i don't know what i is to
230:18 - the power of 18. that's a difficult
230:21 - equation because i'm going to have to
230:22 - take an 18th root which i can do with
230:24 - the calculator
230:25 - however it's easier to use the tvm
230:28 - functions on your calculator and that is
230:32 - this line over here n i y p v p m t f v
230:37 - and i'm going to c
230:39 - n i y p v p m t f v i'm going to enter
230:42 - it in in the order that i like to put it
230:44 - in the calculator
230:46 - n is the number of periods
230:49 - n i y
230:51 - p y c y talk about that in a second pv
230:55 - pmt fv
230:57 - n
230:58 - is 18.
231:01 - so what i'm going to do is write this
231:02 - underneath
231:04 - 18. iy that's what i'm going to try to
231:07 - find
231:08 - cpt if you remember means compute
231:11 - pycy that just means m
231:16 - so m here is how many times per year and
231:19 - i'm looking for an annual rate that
231:21 - means that my pyc way is y is one
231:26 - i'm going to show you how to enter that
231:27 - in a second present value i started with
231:30 - ten thousand dollars
231:31 - payment we're going to talk about this
231:33 - later on in chapter five we'll talk
231:34 - about annuities and then i'm going to
231:36 - explain what it is the important thing
231:38 - is to put zero in
231:39 - for future value i'm going to put in 130
231:42 - 000. to make it balanced correctly and
231:44 - not get an error we want a present value
231:46 - and future value needs to be negative
231:48 - i'm just going to make that negative and
231:50 - we're going to talk about that a little
231:52 - bit more later
231:54 - let's put this in to the calculator
231:57 - the way you do this is you type 18 first
232:00 - then you press n
232:02 - i y will leave p y c y that's above the
232:04 - interest rate so i go second interest
232:06 - rate and it says p y equals one one
232:09 - enter if you want you can scroll down
232:11 - and see that py and cy are both there
232:14 - we'll explain the difference later but
232:16 - they're both one
232:18 - present value is ten thousand dollars
232:22 - let's go enter
232:24 - not enter sorry present value
232:26 - payment is zero so i press zero payment
232:29 - and i'm trying to get 130 thousand
232:31 - dollars and again i said i had to make
232:33 - that negative so now i say compute
232:36 - i y and i come up with
232:40 - iy which is the nominal rate
232:43 - is 15.31498
232:48 - percent
232:49 - let's see what happens
232:51 - if i put 130 000
232:54 - positive into my future value now when i
232:57 - compute i y i get an error so you know
233:00 - that you made a mistake
233:02 - if i want to check out what's in there i
233:04 - press recall and then the number
233:06 - now i can say oh i wanted that to be
233:08 - negative and now it is in correctly
233:14 - okay part b how much do you need to
233:16 - invest if you can only expect a rate of
233:18 - return of j two equals 12 percent so i'm
233:22 - going to write everything again
233:30 - well and i'm going to fill in the things
233:32 - i know from before how much do i need to
233:34 - invest that means i'm computing the
233:36 - present value and my future value still
233:39 - needs to be that hundred and thirty
233:40 - thousand dollars payment is zero for
233:43 - this chapter pycy however is now two to
233:47 - show that it's a semi-annual rate
233:49 - iy this is important we put the nominal
233:52 - in there
233:54 - we're putting our nominal rate in for iy
233:57 - because the calculator knows to divide
233:59 - it by 2 to come up with 0.06 we also put
234:02 - this in in percent not in decimal so
234:05 - it's 12 and not 0.12
234:08 - and well it's going to be 18 years times
234:10 - twice a year that's 36.
234:13 - important to note so let's put those
234:16 - things in
234:17 - i type 36
234:18 - n
234:19 - 12
234:20 - i y i go second i y and now i set make
234:24 - two enter scroll down a couple times and
234:27 - it's two i'm pressing clear a few times
234:29 - to get rid of that
234:31 - now pv i'm going to leave that alone
234:33 - payment still zero future value i'm
234:36 - going to say recall future value it's
234:37 - the same so i don't need to re-enter it
234:39 - if you're doing the same problem
234:42 - clearing everything i go compute present
234:44 - value and i come up with
234:49 - 15956.30
234:53 - and i could have done this with a
234:54 - formula pretty simply that would have
234:57 - been fv
235:00 - over
235:01 - 1.06 because that's i to the power of
235:04 - 36. you can confirm that that is the
235:08 - same thing but the calculator is easier
235:10 - and faster
235:13 - final part you deposit twelve thousand
235:16 - dollars and invest in bonds that pay six
235:18 - percent compounded semi-annually how old
235:21 - will your child be when they can start
235:23 - university what we're trying to do here
235:25 - is solve for n
235:29 - so let's write down all of the items
235:32 - that we're looking for p y c y
235:35 - present value payment
235:37 - future value
235:39 - i like to change colors but truly it
235:42 - doesn't matter note that i'm computing n
235:45 - six percent
235:46 - computed semi-annually present value is
235:50 - now twelve thousand dollars
235:52 - payment is still zero and my future
235:54 - value remains 130 thousand dollars so
235:58 - let's put that in
236:00 - six i y
236:03 - second pres p y cy is the same because i
236:06 - haven't changed yet
236:07 - twelve thousand dollars is now what i
236:09 - started with
236:10 - and i'll press recall future value is
236:13 - still negative 130. let's compute n
236:17 - well it says n equals 80.606
236:21 - and that's in half years
236:24 - so to get that back into years i'm going
236:27 - to have to divide by 2.
236:29 - that is about 40.3 years so not really
236:34 - ideal
236:35 - let's play around a little bit i'm going
236:37 - to go back to my future value 130 000
236:41 - and make it positive instead of negative
236:43 - now let's compute n
236:45 - error five
236:46 - good thing to know your errors when you
236:48 - get an error five it's probably a sign
236:50 - error you can also get an error too and
236:53 - you might end up with a negative n we'll
236:55 - see that later on if you get a negative
236:57 - n you also made a mistake and you know
236:59 - to fix your mistake
237:02 - i'm just going to know what the formula
237:04 - for this is if i was trying to solve
237:06 - this it would be
237:09 - 12 000
237:12 - 1.03
237:14 - to the power of n equals 130
237:17 - 000
237:19 - to solve this i'm going to need to use
237:21 - logarithms so if you remember your
237:23 - logarithms really well go ahead and do
237:25 - that i'm going to stick with using my ba
237:28 - ii plus calculator
237:32 - today we're going to talk about
237:34 - equivalent effective and average rates
237:37 - first
237:38 - i'm going to define one term
237:40 - because we're going to see this a lot
237:42 - effective rate just means an annual rate
237:46 - and we already know that means that it
237:49 - is j
237:51 - with an underscore of one or compounded
237:53 - annually so when we use that word that's
237:56 - all we mean is an annual rate
238:00 - comp pounded sorry let's put it once a
238:03 - year
238:04 - equivalent rate is our other
238:07 - term
238:09 - an equivalent really means
238:13 - that things are the same
238:17 - and i'm going to put that in quotes
238:19 - mathematically equivalent and we often
238:22 - use some curly brackets to mean
238:23 - equivalent
238:25 - that means things that are the same in
238:28 - the way that we care about sometimes you
238:30 - will see as well because the curly can
238:32 - be approximate three lines instead of
238:34 - two but it means the same in the way we
238:37 - care about
238:44 - in terms of interest rates the thing we
238:47 - care about the most is how much money we
238:49 - get out of them we don't care how often
238:51 - the bank compounds we care that
238:55 - they give the same future value
239:04 - let's say we put a hundred dollars in
239:06 - each one
239:09 - and after a year we have the same future
239:12 - value
239:17 - that means they're equivalent because as
239:19 - long as
239:21 - we care
239:23 - as far as we are concerned we don't care
239:24 - how often the bank is doing accounting
239:27 - we care that we get the same amount of
239:28 - money and we usually measure after a
239:31 - year because that
239:33 - means that whether it's monthly
239:34 - bi-weekly daily we're going to get the
239:36 - same result
239:39 - let's jump right into a problem the
239:41 - humongous bank believes in offering its
239:43 - customers choices a banker offers you
239:46 - two different options for your
239:47 - investments the premium growth account
239:49 - offers interest at j2 equals 10
239:52 - i'm just going to write that here so we
239:54 - can see
239:55 - better
239:56 - and the accelerator is an effective rate
239:58 - of 10.25
240:00 - what should we choose
240:02 - well what we're going to do is invest
240:04 - 100 in each just like we said before and
240:07 - you could put any amount here i just
240:09 - find 100 really useful and we're going
240:12 - to see that most of the reason is
240:13 - because 100 makes the math easy
240:18 - so in each account
240:20 - so let's start i'm going to scroll down
240:22 - a little
240:23 - to j2 equals 10
240:26 - that's the premium
240:31 - uh spell premium correctly
240:34 - okay so after one year we have a future
240:38 - value of 100
240:41 - times
240:42 - 1.05 because 5 is half of 10
240:46 - to the power of 2 because there's two
240:48 - half years in a year which means at the
240:50 - end of the day i have 110 dollars and 25
240:53 - cents
240:54 - now let's look at the next one so that's
240:56 - going to be
240:58 - j1 equals 10.25
241:01 - percent
241:02 - and that is called the accelerator
241:07 - so at the end of one year we have 100
241:11 - and here because it's only compounded
241:13 - once a year we don't have to divide that
241:16 - j to get an i and we put that to the
241:18 - power of one which means at the end we
241:20 - have a hundred and ten dollars and
241:22 - twenty five cents
241:23 - so which one is better
241:25 - well it makes no difference whatsoever
241:30 - they're the same
241:31 - or they are equivalent
241:37 - so i'm going to write that in a few
241:39 - different ways
241:41 - j2 equals 10
241:44 - is equivalent
241:49 - to j1 equals 10.25
241:53 - percent
241:55 - j2 equals 10 percent
241:59 - is effectively you'll see this given a
242:02 - lot effectively means the same as but
242:05 - here we're meaning it as
242:07 - equivalent to the effective rate of
242:10 - 10.25 percent when we put the word
242:12 - effective in we don't need to put that
242:14 - one in because it is
242:16 - assumed you're also going to see the
242:18 - term apr
242:20 - or annual percent return
242:23 - we're not going to use that overly in
242:25 - this course but know that that means the
242:27 - same thing
242:29 - and either way we are going to get 10.25
242:35 - interest per year
242:42 - okay let's talk about converting rates
242:45 - with your ba2 plus calculator this is
242:47 - going to be the easiest way to do
242:50 - converting between equivalent weights
242:52 - because it's already given in our
242:53 - calculator to do this we're going to use
242:56 - the iconv or interest conversion
242:59 - worksheet you get to that by pressing
243:02 - 2nd
243:03 - and finding interest conversion which
243:06 - lives over the number
243:08 - 2. and that stands for interest
243:11 - conversion so i go second then i type in
243:14 - interest conversion
243:15 - and we've got three things in here and
243:17 - at this point you should be getting used
243:20 - to entering things in your ba two plus
243:22 - calculator enter things compute one
243:25 - thing and there's three things here so
243:28 - if you see
243:29 - nom i'm gonna scroll down
243:31 - eff
243:33 - that stands for effective scroll down
243:35 - one more time and we get cy
243:39 - and that stands for the nominal rate
243:45 - so that's j
243:47 - n whatever it is the effective rate
243:50 - i'm going to write that in
243:53 - the effective rate is j1 and cy is n
243:57 - whatever the subscript is so let's
243:59 - convert from at 10.25
244:04 - sorry let's do j2 equals 10 percent
244:07 - in that case to convert it what i'm
244:09 - going to do is see why let's go back to
244:12 - nominal it's 10
244:14 - enter
244:19 - scroll down
244:22 - eff i'm going to scroll down again
244:25 - because i don't care about that
244:27 - cy so let's put num equals 10
244:30 - cy equals
244:33 - 2
244:34 - and then we type in enter
244:37 - and now we scroll back up to nominal
244:39 - effective sorry and press compute 10.25
244:46 - and that's what we had everything here
244:49 - goes through effective so i'm going to
244:51 - go on a long-winded metaphor
244:54 - let's pretend
244:55 - we have our train system
244:58 - the train system is based in vancouver
245:03 - if you want to get to nanaimo
245:06 - you have to stop in vancouver
245:08 - if you want to get to prince george
245:11 - you're routing through vancouver this is
245:14 - something in the north and then we have
245:15 - kelowna
245:18 - so these are four cities in british
245:20 - columbia and everything is going to pass
245:23 - through that middle one
245:24 - that's the effective rate
245:27 - j1 so if i want to go from j2 that was
245:31 - 10.10
245:33 - and i want to go to let's say a monthly
245:35 - rate
245:36 - over here i have to convert into
245:38 - effective and then i have to convert to
245:40 - monthly
245:41 - let's say i want to go from a quarterly
245:44 - rate
245:44 - to a monthly rate i'm going to have to
245:46 - go
245:48 - convert from quarterly to effective and
245:50 - then over to monthly so we're always
245:52 - going back and forth but we're always
245:54 - routing through that middle
245:59 - to practice we're going to convert a
246:01 - whole bunch of these things just using
246:03 - the calculator i'm not going to do
246:05 - everything on camera because that's
246:08 - incredibly boring in my opinion so i'm
246:11 - going to let you fill in some of it but
246:13 - let's start with j1 equals 12. so what
246:15 - i'm going to do that's an effective rate
246:18 - remember
246:19 - so i'm going to set eff equals 12. and i
246:22 - want to convert that to semiannual so
246:24 - that means that cy is two and now i go
246:26 - down to nominal and i press compute and
246:28 - i get
246:30 - 11.66 percent
246:33 - and that's a j2
246:36 - let's do it again for quarterly we go up
246:38 - to cy we change to four
246:41 - and now we recompute the nominal and we
246:43 - get j4 equals 11.49
246:47 - etc
246:49 - percent
246:51 - now let's do one more monthly
246:53 - i change that to 12
246:55 - i change nominal by using my compute
246:58 - button and i get
247:00 - j 12 equals
247:03 - 11.3865 i'm just going to put some dot
247:05 - dot dots so i don't have to round
247:09 - fairly simple
247:11 - so now let's do j2 equals eight percent
247:14 - so i'm going to go back up and i don't
247:16 - have to clear this but i don't i want to
247:18 - so what i'm going to do is press 2nd
247:21 - clear and that sets everything back to
247:24 - the base you don't need to do it because
247:25 - you can overwrite but it's useful
247:28 - so this time i'm going to start with a
247:30 - nominal and that's 8.
247:33 - i start with a nominal rate of eight
247:35 - percent and i change my cy to be two
247:38 - because it's semi-annual now i go to the
247:41 - effective and that's what i'm computing
247:43 - j1 is 8.16
247:48 - now that i have the effective rate i can
247:49 - find the quarterly and monthly so to
247:51 - find quarterly
247:54 - i set that to be 4 and my nominal is now
247:56 - 7.92
248:02 - one more cy is 12.
248:07 - nominal is 7.86
248:13 - i'm just going to put some dot dot dots
248:16 - one thing to notice our rates are
248:18 - changing in size
248:20 - this is a smaller number
248:24 - because we're compounding more often
248:26 - which we know gives us more interest a
248:28 - smaller interest rate gets us the same
248:31 - amount of number as the bigger
248:34 - so in this case these two numbers are
248:36 - going to be bigger than 10 percent
248:38 - and this number is going to be smaller
248:41 - than 10 percent
248:45 - i'd like you guys to pause the video and
248:47 - continue to fill out the table
248:49 - i'm going to unpause and everything will
248:50 - be magically filled in
248:54 - see like magic it's all nicely filled in
248:57 - so make sure that you get the same
248:59 - answers as me
249:02 - mortgages charge interest on a
249:03 - semi-annual basis but payments are
249:05 - usually made monthly change a mortgage
249:07 - rate of j two equals seven percent to a
249:09 - rate compounded monthly
249:11 - we're going to come back to this again
249:13 - when we start talking about mortgages
249:15 - this is one of the big differences
249:18 - between banking in canada and banking in
249:20 - the united states canadian banks
249:23 - compound mortgages semi-annually they
249:25 - don't really though they actually
249:27 - advertise
249:32 - semi-annual rates
249:38 - but compound usually using
249:48 - an equivalent rate
249:51 - every time you make a payment
250:02 - that's opposed as opposed to american
250:04 - banks that report with monthly rates
250:06 - that's how they advertise this wasn't
250:09 - always true
250:10 - once upon a time before computers were
250:12 - widespread it was actually compounded
250:14 - every six months so every payment you
250:16 - made before six months
250:18 - no interest was accruing they all went
250:20 - towards principal which was a different
250:23 - type of mortgage and you would end up
250:25 - paying for a different amount of time
250:26 - and paying less interest things are
250:28 - different now that computers make this
250:30 - very simple
250:32 - so
250:34 - if you pay monthly
250:40 - they use an equivalent monthly rate
250:44 - if you pay
250:46 - bi-weekly
250:48 - and we're going to come to this uh
250:51 - more when we get to mortgages but
250:53 - bi-weekly is the way a lot of people are
250:55 - paid and that means you're paid
250:58 - 26 times a year
251:02 - then they're going to use the equivalent
251:04 - j26 often people do this because it
251:07 - works out with your payment scheme if
251:09 - you are paid that way
251:12 - okay so what we're going to do is find
251:13 - at the monthly rate and again
251:16 - we did this in the last one j2 goes to
251:19 - j1 goes to j12 we're always going
251:22 - through that effective rate
251:25 - so let's start with j2 equals seven
251:28 - percent
251:30 - and i'm going to use the calculator so
251:32 - we go to second interest conversion our
251:35 - nominal rate is seven
251:37 - my effective rate is what i'm looking
251:39 - for
251:40 - right now i have two
251:42 - go back to the effective rate and it's
251:47 - five 7.1225 not
251:49 - getting rid of any of those decimal
251:50 - places for now now i'm going to change
251:53 - cy to 12
251:55 - and compute the nominal rate which is
251:58 - around 6.9
252:05 - there we go
252:06 - okay
252:07 - but let's
252:08 - do it a different way
252:10 - and i'm going to say this is a check
252:12 - because i started at the beginning and
252:14 - said if i start with a hundred dollars
252:16 - how much do i have at the end so i'm
252:19 - gonna start with a hundred dollars and
252:21 - i'm going to invest it at seven percent
252:25 - dividing seven and two gives me three
252:27 - and a half
252:28 - so i do that
252:30 - and i end up with 107 dollars and 12
252:33 - cents
252:35 - let's do that with the effective rate in
252:37 - the middle here
252:42 - 100
252:47 - to the 1 is when i round it 107 12.
252:52 - same thing
252:54 - and finally let's do the last one
252:57 - i start with a hundred dollars
252:59 - one point i'm going to put that entire
253:02 - thing in here
253:07 - over 12. i'm going to say 1 plus that to
253:10 - the power of 12. okay i'm going to use
253:11 - the calculator for this because i don't
253:13 - want to round it at all so i'm going to
253:14 - clear and clearing lets me save that
253:17 - number i'm going to divide it by 100
253:20 - first to make it a percent
253:22 - then i'm going to divide it by 12
253:24 - and i'm going to add that to one
253:27 - now i'm going to take that to the power
253:29 - of 12
253:31 - and multiply it by a hundred dollars
253:34 - and i get the same thing 107 dollars and
253:37 - 12 cents or 12 and a quarter they're all
253:41 - the same
253:42 - not only are they all the same
253:45 - when i was did the rounding there
253:48 - notice that i had these
253:50 - this is 7.122
253:54 - the amount of interest i get
253:56 - is the effective rate the effective rate
253:59 - is exactly the interest you get on a
254:01 - hundred dollars
254:09 - if you don't want to divide by a hundred
254:12 - do it on a dollar
254:15 - that will give you seven point one two
254:17 - two five cents
254:20 - but it's easy enough to see it in
254:22 - percent
254:23 - let's do one more
254:26 - your credit card charges interest at one
254:28 - and a half percent per month
254:30 - find the effective rate
254:32 - credit cards
254:33 - one thing to remember is unless you're
254:36 - told differently all credit cards are
254:38 - monthly
254:44 - this is a piece of what we call domain
254:46 - knowledge it's knowledge that you really
254:48 - should have a question will not
254:50 - necessarily tell you that credit cards
254:52 - are monthly so that's something you need
254:54 - to know
254:55 - let's find the effective rate so first i
254:58 - can learn
255:02 - per means periodic rate anytime you see
255:07 - that word per month
255:09 - you know that that's the periodic rate
255:11 - at or per
255:16 - so that's the periodic rate so i equals
255:21 - 0.015 that means that j 12 equals 0.015
255:27 - times 12
255:29 - or
255:31 - 18
255:34 - that's a lot that's more than one and a
255:35 - half it looks small when you say it
255:37 - monthly but you do have to end up
255:40 - multiplying that so let's see how much
255:42 - we have
255:43 - after one year
255:47 - and this is the same thing that we've
255:49 - been doing we start with a hundred
255:51 - dollars
255:53 - and we put it at
255:56 - well we know that it's 015 to the power
255:59 - of 12.
256:00 - so 100 times
256:04 - 1.015 to the power of 12.
256:07 - and that is going to give me
256:09 - 119.56
256:14 - the effective rate or j1 it's 19.56
256:22 - and you can check this using the
256:24 - interest conversion worksheet
256:28 - in part two of this lesson we're going
256:30 - to talk about average rates
256:33 - the big idea on this unit
256:37 - is that our interest rates are not
256:39 - stable
256:42 - they change over time
256:47 - and this is what happens when you invest
256:49 - in something like the stock market or
256:51 - mutual funds the rate is not fixed for a
256:54 - 10-year investment it's going up and
256:56 - down with the market
256:59 - let's say not over time but over the
257:00 - course of our investment
257:07 - in this case
257:08 - i don't really care
257:10 - what it's doing every single month i
257:13 - care what it's doing on average
257:23 - and just so you know there's lots of
257:26 - types of averages when i talk about an
257:28 - average rate of return i'm definitely
257:31 - not talking about taking all the numbers
257:34 - adding them and dividing by the number
257:36 - of rates or the arithmetic mean
257:38 - when you take statistics you'll learn
257:40 - more about that but here what i care
257:42 - about is
257:44 - how much i get on average so if i
257:46 - invested at that average rate i want the
257:48 - same present value giving the same
257:50 - future value or
257:52 - they are equivalent
257:58 - so we're looking here at equivalent
258:00 - rates
258:04 - as usual the best way to learn a concept
258:07 - is to actually go through an example so
258:10 - let's start with example number five
258:12 - from the lesson premium savings bonds
258:15 - have the following rates all annual in
258:17 - the first year you make two percent in
258:19 - the second year you make five percent in
258:21 - the third year twelve in the fourth year
258:23 - fifteen percent and by year five you're
258:25 - making twenty four percent per year and
258:28 - i'm just going to do an aside these are
258:30 - exaggerated rates so that we can do the
258:32 - arithmetic easily not because i know of
258:35 - an investment that pays 24
258:38 - so the first thing we're gonna do is
258:39 - figure out how much a thousand dollar
258:40 - investment would be worth at the end of
258:42 - the fifth year and we can do this with
258:44 - thousand dollars a hundred dollars
258:46 - anything but the question says a
258:48 - thousand so after one year
258:52 - well we start with a thousand and after
258:55 - one year we say
258:57 - 1.02 to the power of one that's how much
259:00 - money we have after the first year
259:02 - let's see how much that is
259:05 - 1 000
259:06 - times 1.02
259:09 - so i've made 20 dollars in interest
259:12 - okay
259:13 - now let's look at that second year in
259:15 - the second year we make five
259:18 - percent interest so i take everything i
259:20 - did before i'm going to put brackets
259:22 - around it though that isn't necessary
259:24 - and i'm going to multiply that by
259:27 - 1.05 to the power of 1. so now i have 15
259:30 - 30. i think i did that wrong so i'm
259:33 - going to stop
259:34 - following along with the calculator
259:36 - right now and now i'm going to say
259:40 - 1.12
259:42 - to the power of 1 so this is the second
259:45 - third
259:46 - fourth year 1.15
259:50 - finally
259:52 - 1.24
259:53 - so let's do the entire thing with the
259:55 - calculator
259:57 - thousand
260:01 - times
260:02 - 1.02 times
260:06 - 1.05 indeed i had made a mistake there
260:10 - one times
260:11 - 1.12 at the end of the third year we
260:14 - have 199 dollars in interest
260:18 - fourth year we have 13.79 and finally a
260:22 - whopping
260:27 - let's put a one there
260:29 - at
260:32 - 1
260:33 - 710
260:35 - and 52 cents
260:38 - and i'm going to leave this whole
260:39 - unrounded number
260:41 - okay so that's how much money i have
260:44 - that's my future value and i'm going to
260:45 - write the whole unrounded number down
260:48 - because i'm going to use this in the
260:49 - next part when we use things it's best
260:52 - not to round them store one
260:55 - i like to put a one in square brackets
260:57 - to remind myself of where i stored that
260:59 - in my calculator so now let's look at
261:01 - the average rate
261:09 - the average effective rate
261:11 - is the rate i would need to get to that
261:13 - future value
261:15 - so it's i
261:17 - where
261:19 - let's look at this
261:21 - if i take a thousand dollars
261:24 - and i go one plus i
261:28 - to the power of five years
261:31 - equals
261:32 - one
261:33 - seven one oh and i'm gonna put in all
261:35 - those decimal points
261:38 - this is solvable all i need to do is use
261:40 - a fifth root or 1 to the power of point
261:44 - something to the power of 0.2 but i'm
261:46 - not going to do that i'm going to use
261:47 - the calculator because as we've seen
261:50 - that tvm button on our calculator is
261:52 - really really useful
261:56 - that's a v
262:00 - okay
262:01 - n is five years
262:04 - the rate is what i'm trying to do
262:06 - it's effective so one i start with a
262:09 - thousand and i end with
262:15 - remember this has to be negative and
262:17 - that's so our equation can balance
262:19 - correctly
262:20 - so let's go into that and i'm going to
262:22 - leave make this negative and put it
262:24 - straight into the future value
262:27 - 1000 is the present value 0 is our
262:30 - payment
262:32 - our interest rate is what we're going to
262:34 - find make sure pycy is 1.
262:39 - nice and our n is 5. in that case i
262:42 - worked backwards but usually i work
262:44 - forwards
262:46 - so let's compute i y and we end up with
262:49 - 11.33 percent
262:59 - so i averaged
263:01 - 11.33
263:03 - on this investment
263:05 - that means that on average even though
263:07 - sometimes we were making two percent and
263:09 - sometimes 24
263:11 - had we invested at point three three
263:13 - percent for five years we would end up
263:15 - with the same thing so they're effective
263:17 - now i'm gonna write down a bad idea
263:20 - i'm gonna write bad idea first so you
263:22 - don't get a still of this and end up
263:23 - with a mistake
263:25 - two percent
263:26 - five percent
263:28 - 12
263:31 - 15
263:33 - 24
263:36 - well there's five years we divide that
263:37 - all by five and what do we get eleven
263:39 - point six percent that is not
263:42 - the answer it doesn't work that way at
263:45 - all
263:50 - when we're talking about average rates
263:52 - we're talking about a particular kind of
263:54 - average a single number that is
263:56 - equivalent we're not talking about the
263:59 - arithmetic mean or that type of app
264:02 - let's just do a little one to illustrate
264:04 - what's going on our investment earns a
264:07 - hundred percent return in the first year
264:08 - and loses 50 percent in the second year
264:11 - what is the effective rate of return
264:12 - over two years
264:14 - in this case we don't have a number
264:20 - so let's make something up
264:26 - you've probably noticed by now that when
264:28 - i have to make something up
264:31 - i start with a hundred dollars
264:34 - some people use one dollar some people
264:36 - use a thousand you could use 312 dollars
264:39 - and 52 cents but that seems a little
264:41 - difficult for me so let's start with a
264:43 - hundred dollars at the end of the first
264:45 - year
264:50 - our future value is now
264:53 - a hundred dollars and it's earned a
264:55 - hundred percent return so that means
264:57 - it's one plus one that's our markup
265:00 - or percent change and that means that
265:02 - now we have two hundred dollars
265:04 - at the end of year two it's lost money
265:11 - it's lost fifty percent
265:15 - this is the same as a markdown we
265:18 - haven't overly talked about
265:22 - negative interest rates but negative
265:23 - interest rates happen a lot especially
265:26 - in the stock market we lose money over
265:28 - time
265:30 - hopefully we make more money than we
265:32 - lose but from month to month we might
265:34 - lose that's a negative interest rate
265:36 - this is a rate of negative fifty percent
265:39 - when i dump that in i end up with a
265:41 - hundred dollars so what's my average
265:43 - rate
265:45 - present value is 100 and at the end of
265:48 - two years
265:50 - i still have a hundred dollars that
265:52 - means that we averaged
265:55 - zero percent interest
265:58 - so
265:59 - this investment was equally as good as
266:01 - taking your money putting it in a box
266:03 - and putting it under your bed
266:05 - in general we say that we've lost money
266:08 - on something with a zero percent
266:10 - interest because we have
266:13 - inflation going on where money is worth
266:15 - less over time
266:17 - in
266:18 - 1989 to buy a chocolate bar might have
266:20 - cost me about 50 cents now a chocolate
266:23 - bar probably costs about a dollar 75
266:26 - that's a huge change over time money is
266:29 - worth less
266:30 - and when you take econ you'll learn more
266:33 - about that how that is going to change
266:35 - things
266:36 - finally question 7 a mutual fund had
266:39 - returns of 12 compounded monthly in the
266:41 - first year 18 compounded annually in the
266:44 - second year and four percent compounded
266:46 - quarterly in the third year what would a
266:48 - thousand dollar investment three years
266:50 - ago be worth today
266:52 - so we can do this in multiple ways i'm
266:54 - going to confess i'm a big fan of
266:56 - algebra so i would probably write this
266:59 - out algebraically well i started with a
267:02 - thousand
267:03 - then i have one plus twelve percent over
267:07 - twelve
267:08 - first year to the power of one
267:10 - multiplied by
267:12 - 1.18 because it's annual and then 1 plus
267:16 - 0.04
267:18 - divided by 4 quarterly for the third
267:20 - year so that's going to be 4. sorry this
267:23 - is 12 because it was for 12 months
267:26 - that's the way i would think to do this
267:28 - in my head and i would get the right
267:29 - answer
267:31 - however
267:32 - a lot of people most people prefer to
267:35 - use something like a calculator
267:38 - so what we're going to do is look at
267:41 - this
267:42 - by using our ba2 plus calculator and
267:46 - also by keeping track so i'm going to
267:48 - add one extra column and that's the year
267:51 - in the first
267:52 - year we earn
267:55 - 12 percent compounded monthly i'm gonna
267:58 - write j twelve
267:59 - equals twelve percent
268:01 - in the second year
268:04 - we have
268:06 - eighteen percent annual and i'm writing
268:08 - that in
268:09 - and in the third year
268:14 - we have j4 equals 4
268:18 - and sometimes these can happen for
268:19 - multiple years the textbook whose pdf is
268:23 - up on our website
268:27 - our learning hub class has an example
268:29 - where things take place over multiple
268:31 - years so expect to see that as well
268:33 - okay so the first year that's 12 months
268:37 - and a monthly rate our interest rate is
268:39 - 12 that's a lot of 12s in a row and our
268:42 - present value was a thousand dollars and
268:44 - this is what we're going to compute
268:46 - next in our next year whatever my future
268:49 - value is i'm going to move that over to
268:51 - present value
268:53 - it's annual
268:54 - but it's an 18 interest rate
268:57 - payment is always zero and i'm still
268:59 - going to compute
269:00 - finally i'm going to do this again
269:03 - for four quarters quarterly
269:05 - four and whatever i got here i'm going
269:08 - to put there
269:09 - so let's try this
269:11 - i start and i go 12 for n my interest
269:15 - rate also 12 and i'm going to make sure
269:17 - my pycy
269:19 - turns to 12 and when you change py cy
269:21 - changes automatically
269:23 - we start with a thousand dollars
269:26 - make sure payment is zero and at the end
269:28 - of the first year
269:29 - we
269:30 - have negative one
269:34 - one two six
269:36 - point eight two five and we store
269:39 - everything
269:40 - i'm gonna make this positive because i'd
269:42 - like my present values to be positive
269:44 - but you don't need to do that i'm going
269:45 - to press present value
269:47 - what i've done here
269:51 - is put this into the present value so
269:52 - now let's clear and start at the
269:54 - beginning n is 1
269:56 - i y is now 18.
270:00 - pycy is back to one
270:02 - present value i did payment i don't have
270:05 - to put in zero every time
270:07 - but i like to
270:09 - and i go compute future value and now i
270:11 - have 13 26.
270:14 - and that's negative
270:16 - sorry
270:17 - 13 29 and 65 cents
270:21 - i like to make it positive by just
270:23 - pressing that plus minus button and then
270:25 - i'm going to press present value what
270:27 - i've done now is store this
270:31 - in my present value
270:33 - clear that
270:34 - n is now four our interest rate is also
270:37 - four and my pycy has gone to four enter
270:41 - and i clear
270:43 - i've done my present value and payment
270:45 - already so i'm just going to compute the
270:46 - future value and i get
270:50 - 1383
270:54 - 0.648
270:58 - anytime i see this i'm going to save it
271:00 - so store 1 in case i need it again
271:04 - and you never know when you're going to
271:05 - need it
271:06 - so the answer for a is the future value
271:10 - is 1
271:12 - 383
271:13 - 64
271:15 - cents and you can go up here and see
271:18 - i've done this on my own off camera
271:21 - and i did get the exact same answer
271:23 - which is nice to know
271:27 - part b
271:28 - what was the average rate compounded
271:30 - monthly of return earned so we're trying
271:33 - to find the average rate
271:35 - one advantage is we already have this
271:38 - future value here
271:39 - so it's monthly for three years
271:44 - that means we're investing this for 36
271:46 - months
271:47 - i y is what we're going to be looking
271:49 - for p y c y well that's monthly
271:52 - and i start with what i started with at
271:54 - the beginning a thousand dollars and i'm
271:56 - going to end
271:59 - with my future value
272:02 - 1383 dollars and change so let's put
272:06 - that in
272:07 - 36
272:08 - n
272:10 - let's go to our pycy i already actually
272:12 - set that to be 12.
272:14 - good for me
272:15 - start with a thousand dollars
272:18 - pv zero payment it's always good to
272:20 - recall so i'm gonna say recall future
272:22 - value and know what i have recall is how
272:26 - you check things out so let's compute i
272:28 - y and then we find out that
272:32 - j 12 equals 10.87
272:37 - and change and that's our average rate
272:40 - so if i had taken a thousand dollars and
272:42 - invested it at 10.87 compounded monthly
272:46 - after three years i would have thirteen
272:48 - hundred dollars
272:51 - okay let's do one more part
272:54 - part c
272:55 - the fun lost a hundred dollars in its
272:57 - fourth year whoops the average effective
273:00 - rate of return for the four years
273:02 - so what we're going to do is look at
273:04 - just that fourth year
273:08 - i don't need to use my tvm buttons
273:11 - we lost
273:13 - a hundred dollars so we started
273:17 - with
273:23 - 13 83 and 64 cents and we lost 100 so we
273:28 - end up with
273:34 - 1283.64
273:36 - here i'm going to say it doesn't matter
273:38 - as much if we hold on to our rounding
273:41 - because now we're on a specific number
273:43 - and
273:44 - it's always good to hang on to our
273:46 - interest
273:47 - hang on to all those decimal places but
273:51 - it's less important in this particular
273:53 - example
273:54 - so now our future value is going to be
273:59 - always negative
274:02 - our payment's always zero we started out
274:05 - with a thousand dollars and we invested
274:07 - it and this is effective
274:09 - so it's annual
274:10 - over four years and our interest rate is
274:14 - what we're looking for
274:15 - so let's start n is four iy we can leave
274:19 - alone pycy now changes to one
274:22 - our present value is still a thousand
274:25 - dollars but our
274:27 - end
274:28 - or future value
274:33 - is oh we have to clear out a py
274:40 - negative at the end our future value is
274:43 - now 1200 and change so our interest rate
274:46 - is going to be smaller
274:49 - so we end up with
274:51 - 6.44 percent
275:00 - and that's how we do average interest
275:02 - rates
275:03 - importantly i'm going to say that you
275:05 - should be practicing this there's
275:08 - questions
275:09 - on the online homework as well as
275:11 - questions in the textbook this is a good
275:13 - thing to practice
275:16 - lesson 10 payment plans and making
275:19 - choices
275:20 - let's start with a question and we're
275:22 - going to work through this question and
275:24 - learn how to make decisions using
275:26 - interest rates
275:27 - for your first job after graduation you
275:29 - have decided to accept a contract
275:31 - position the manager is offered to pay
275:33 - you thirty thousand dollars at the end
275:35 - of the first year and thirty five
275:36 - thousand dollars at the end of the
275:37 - second year or to pay you twenty two
275:39 - thousand dollars now twenty thousand
275:41 - dollars at the end of the first year and
275:42 - twenty thousand dollars at the end of
275:44 - the second year which option is better
275:46 - and by how much if interest is at ten
275:48 - percent simple use today as your focal
275:51 - date
275:52 - so let's talk about comparing two
275:54 - choices
275:56 - sorry
276:03 - what we do is we pick a focal date or
276:06 - one is given to us
276:08 - and in the truth
276:10 - it doesn't matter which one we choose
276:12 - the better choice is the better at any
276:14 - time
276:15 - usually or often we use today
276:19 - today is a good focal date because
276:22 - computing it is nice then what we do is
276:24 - we compute all values
276:29 - at this date
276:33 - and then we pick the best one
276:40 - and the best one is the one where either
276:42 - we have the most money or we pay the
276:45 - least money depending what it is
276:48 - what we're going to do to help us is
276:50 - draw what's called a timeline
276:53 - timelines are something we're going to
276:54 - be doing a lot of in this course so i'm
276:57 - going to draw two of them
276:59 - one of them was perfect and one of them
277:00 - was not
277:01 - and i'm gonna put in the times zero is
277:04 - today
277:06 - all the times mentioned in
277:09 - the problem one year
277:11 - two years
277:13 - zero
277:16 - one year
277:18 - two years and i've drawn two of these
277:20 - because i have two options my options
277:23 - are a
277:25 - and b
277:27 - okay
277:28 - let's put in our money i like to say
277:31 - that money into my account is going to
277:33 - be
277:34 - an arrow down
277:37 - so this money goes into my account at
277:39 - one year in option one i get two
277:41 - payments one at a year and one at two
277:44 - years so i get thirty thousand dollars
277:49 - and then i get thirty five thousand
277:50 - dollars two years from now
277:53 - seventy sorry sixty five 000 in total
277:56 - but not for a while
277:59 - in option b i'm getting 22 000
278:03 - right away
278:06 - 20 000
278:07 - in a year and another twenty thousand
278:10 - dollars
278:13 - looking at this just so you can see the
278:15 - total
278:16 - here it's sixty five thousand dollars
278:18 - over the two years but i get have to
278:21 - wait a while until i get it
278:23 - in this one it's 40
278:25 - plus 22 is a little bit less it's 62 000
278:29 - but the fact that i'm getting some of it
278:31 - today
278:32 - is good
278:33 - so i'm going to use some arrows to show
278:35 - that i'm going to move everything to the
278:37 - focal date circle the focal date that's
278:40 - today and i'm going to move this over
278:44 - when we move something
278:48 - backwards we are starting with a future
278:50 - value and we're ending with
278:54 - a present value so what i'm going to do
278:56 - is find the present value of each of
278:58 - those payments and then add them
278:59 - together
279:00 - so here i've got
279:02 - present value 1
279:04 - is
279:05 - thousand dollars
279:07 - and it's going backwards one year at
279:10 - simple interest and that was ten percent
279:12 - interest
279:13 - so that's what's happening
279:15 - present value two
279:18 - is thirty five thousand dollars
279:22 - over
279:23 - one plus
279:26 - times one let's just pull the calculator
279:28 - back up
279:30 - uh
279:32 - so let's look at those together
279:36 - 30 000
279:38 - divided by 1.1
279:42 - is 27 000 ish
279:49 - here sorry this should be a 2 here
279:51 - because it was 2 years
279:53 - just going to highlight that
279:56 - 2 because it's going 2 years
279:59 - i'm going to store this as well
280:01 - and then i'm going to do my present
280:02 - value 2 is 35 000
280:04 - divided by 1.2
280:07 - and that gives me 29 166.
280:14 - so my present value how much this is
280:17 - worth
280:18 - is found by adding those two things up
280:21 - and it's 56 000
280:23 - so you can use the calculator i've
280:25 - already worked this out ahead of time
280:28 - so you can believe me that it's 56
280:30 - 439.39
280:33 - let's go on to the second example
280:36 - so i'm finding present values for each
280:39 - thing
280:40 - future value 1 was 22 000 future value
280:43 - two is twenty thousand and future value
280:45 - three was also twenty thousand so
280:48 - present value one
280:50 - well that's just twenty two thousand
280:52 - it's not moving anywhere when something
280:54 - stays still we don't need to worry about
280:56 - interest
280:57 - present value two is going to be that
280:59 - twenty thousand dollars divided by one
281:02 - plus
281:03 - ten percent times one
281:06 - and present value two is going to be the
281:08 - same
281:09 - size payment but it's worth a bit less
281:13 - because i'm multiplying that ten percent
281:15 - times two
281:17 - so my present value for this
281:19 - is going to be adding all those three
281:21 - things together and i'd like you guys to
281:23 - try this in your calculator and you
281:26 - should end up with the same answer as me
281:29 - that is 56848.48
281:34 - so what would you choose
281:37 - well i don't know about you but i would
281:39 - choose this one
281:46 - let's
281:47 - put a sentence down there
282:02 - and that sentence is option b is worth
282:04 - more in what we call today's dollars by
282:07 - today's interest rate so it is a better
282:10 - option
282:11 - and part of that is big part is that
282:14 - upfront money getting that 22 thousand
282:16 - dollars today is really worth a lot
282:26 - now we're going to talk about a payment
282:27 - scheme and we're going to be doing more
282:29 - of this in lesson 11 but we're going to
282:31 - start now
282:33 - you have two debts coming too a debt of
282:35 - one thousand dollars in six months and
282:38 - another of fifteen hundred dollars at
282:40 - the end of the year interest is charged
282:42 - at twelve percent simple you speak to mr
282:45 - hammerhead the loans manager and discuss
282:47 - several different payment options so
282:49 - let's start with a
282:52 - how much would we have to pay to pay it
282:54 - off today so for this what we do is we
282:57 - start by
283:00 - drawing a timeline so timelines are the
283:03 - way we start a lot of these we say today
283:08 - zero
283:09 - six months
283:12 - and i like to put in simple how many
283:14 - years it is if that because that's easy
283:17 - to put into the
283:20 - calculator and one year
283:25 - from now
283:26 - okay
283:27 - so we owe a thousand dollars
283:31 - and i'm going to put this
283:33 - as an arrow out to show that i have to
283:35 - pay that money
283:38 - it doesn't matter how you put it but
283:40 - we're going to see next time that you
283:42 - need to when you have
283:44 - both
283:45 - incoming money and outgoing money
283:47 - inflows and outflows you do have to pay
283:49 - attention to that type of thing so we'll
283:51 - talk more about that in the next series
283:54 - of videos so we owe a thousand dollars
283:58 - now or in six months and fifteen hundred
284:00 - dollars in a year so somehow we are
284:03 - going to pay the whole thing off today
284:05 - just like we did before
284:07 - we're going to move everything to our
284:09 - focal date and that's today because it
284:12 - says so in the problem
284:15 - so we're going to pay them both so same
284:18 - as we did before let's make that a
284:20 - future value
284:22 - future value one is a thousand future
284:24 - value two is fifteen hundred so present
284:27 - value one is then
284:30 - one thousand
284:32 - over one
284:34 - plus
284:35 - zero point one two times zero point five
284:39 - and present value two
284:41 - is going to be
284:43 - fifteen hundred
284:45 - over
284:46 - one plus zero point one two
284:49 - times one
284:51 - i'm going to simplify this a little bit
284:54 - because it's easier if this goes into my
284:56 - calculator like this
284:59 - and over here it's easier if it goes
285:01 - into my calculator as 1500 over 1.12
285:06 - so we're going to put that in the
285:07 - calculator together and i put them in at
285:10 - the exact same time and we come out with
285:18 - those two things added together which is
285:21 - going to be
285:23 - two thousand eighty not twenty two
285:26 - thousand sorry guys i'm reading my notes
285:28 - wrong it's twenty two hundred
285:32 - and i'm going to do that by putting that
285:34 - in the calculator as well
285:36 - one thousand divided by 1.06
285:40 - plus
285:42 - 1500
285:45 - divided by 1.12 putting that in together
285:48 - i get the same answer
285:53 - we're going to do the exact same one for
285:56 - part b but now we're going to pay in 18
285:58 - months
286:00 - so we're going to do the same
286:03 - problem different focal date so this
286:06 - time let's draw in this equation
286:09 - i've got
286:11 - today
286:13 - six months or 0.5 years
286:17 - one year
286:19 - and now i'm going to add
286:21 - 1.5
286:23 - years
286:24 - or 18 months
286:26 - and this isn't a scale your diagrams do
286:29 - not need to be perfect mine certainly
286:32 - are not
286:33 - sorry that i wanted that to go upwards
286:36 - we owe 1 000 at six months
286:39 - we owe
286:41 - fifteen hundred dollars in a year
286:44 - and what we're going to do is pay
286:45 - everything off
286:47 - here
286:49 - so i'm going to move everything over
286:53 - this time
286:54 - i'm moving it to one and a half years so
286:56 - i'm gonna have to do some counting
286:59 - six months to one and a half years i'm
287:01 - going to write this here so i remember
287:04 - one year to one and a half years is 0.5
287:07 - years
287:10 - now
287:11 - remember this is now a present value and
287:14 - i'm going to be finding
287:16 - future values so fv1
287:20 - is going to be a thousand but this time
287:22 - i'm moving it forwards in time i'm going
287:24 - to be paying more interest on this loan
287:26 - so it'll be 1000 times one plus zero
287:30 - point one two times one
287:32 - plus fifteen hundred
287:35 - with six months interest
287:41 - uh this is actually i'm not going to
287:43 - even put the one there i'm just going to
287:44 - say future value equals this thing
287:47 - i'm going to simplify it a little
287:56 - and i can put this in the calculator
287:58 - just like this
288:00 - 1000
288:01 - times 1.12
288:04 - plus 1500
288:07 - times
288:08 - 1.06 and that is 27 10.
288:14 - so what would you prefer
288:17 - 2710 in 18 months or 2282 right away
288:27 - well if we wait 18 months we have to pay
288:29 - more interest that's what is happening
288:32 - here the interest is a lot more so if i
288:34 - had the money i'd choose today
288:37 - if i don't have the money then i'm going
288:39 - to choose 18 months because i don't have
288:42 - 2 200 to pay right now
288:47 - let's do another one where we're making
288:49 - choices this time however instead of
288:51 - using simple interest we're now using
288:54 - compound interest however nothing
288:57 - changes just the interest formula
288:59 - everything else is the same
289:01 - so sagir received two offers for
289:03 - property is selling offer one consists
289:07 - of seven hundred thousand dollars
289:10 - immediately and offer two consists of
289:12 - five hundred thousand dollars now and
289:15 - one hundred and ten thousand dollars per
289:17 - year at the end of the next two years
289:20 - money earned six percent compounded
289:22 - semi-annually which one is better and
289:25 - how much economic advantage just means
289:27 - which one is better for us economically
289:29 - and that's always how we're saying and
289:31 - by how much that's going to be the
289:33 - difference between the offers so let's
289:35 - write in the offer
289:38 - offer one today and we have one year
289:41 - and two years
289:44 - and for our next offer
289:46 - we've got today
289:48 - one year
289:50 - two years
289:52 - offer one is seven hundred thousand
289:54 - dollars now so i write in seven hundred
289:57 - thousand dollars and an arrow going in
290:00 - to my account and that's it
290:03 - that's actually easy to figure out the
290:05 - present value of offer one i'm putting a
290:07 - one there to mean offer one
290:10 - is just that seven hundred thousand
290:11 - dollars that's how much it's worth
290:13 - offer two is a lot more interesting
290:16 - it's going to be only 500 000 now
290:20 - but there's extra money added
290:22 - we also get
290:25 - 110 000
290:26 - a year
290:28 - for two years so we get some extra
290:30 - payments an extra twenty thousand
290:32 - dollars in total versus offer one but we
290:35 - have to wait for a while
290:37 - one thing that i like to do when i draw
290:39 - these timelines
290:41 - is write my interest rate right in
290:49 - just so i remember what's going on there
290:51 - so offer one we've gotten that we don't
290:53 - need to do any interest but for offer
290:55 - two it says in today's dollars and that
290:58 - means that focal date is today
291:06 - and that is often the way we do these
291:08 - choices it makes sense to use today's
291:11 - money
291:12 - okay
291:13 - so what we end up with is our present
291:15 - value is going to be well five hundred
291:18 - thousand dollars today
291:20 - is worth five hundred thousand dollars
291:21 - today
291:23 - a hundred and ten thousand dollars in a
291:26 - year
291:28 - is going to be worth 110 000
291:30 - plus
291:32 - 1.03 and it's one year i'm gonna say
291:35 - that's two half years
291:41 - so to the power of two
291:43 - and my last payment
291:47 - well that's going to be over 1.03
291:50 - to the power of four
291:53 - put that into the calculator and we will
291:56 - see our answer i'm going to actually do
291:58 - this entire thing feel free to stop the
292:00 - video if you want to just know i'll give
292:03 - you the answer 701 419.13
292:08 - in the calculator
292:10 - 500 000
292:14 - plus
292:16 - oops i'm not doing this correctly
292:20 - 500 000 plus
292:22 - 1 one
292:24 - zero one two three divided by 1.03
292:30 - squared
292:32 - equals
292:33 - plus
292:35 - 110 one two three
292:42 - might have been better
292:44 - now that i look at this
292:46 - for me to store all these numbers so
292:48 - forget me putting it in i can't work the
292:50 - tiny little calculator today
292:53 - it's 701 i did it on a real calculator
292:57 - so this one is better
293:05 - it's a better one or it has a more
293:07 - economic advantage and it's better by
293:10 - exactly one thousand four hundred
293:12 - nineteen dollars and thirteen cents in
293:15 - today's dollars
293:18 - because the present value is worth
293:20 - exactly one thousand four hundred
293:22 - nineteen dollars and thirteen cents more
293:28 - anna poured thousand dollars from a
293:30 - local loan shark on january the first
293:32 - twenty ten at j 12 equals 24
293:35 - on january 1st 2012 anna paid the loan
293:38 - shark 500 and the loan shark agreed to
293:40 - lower the rate to j12 equals 18 percent
293:43 - how much money will anna owe as of
293:45 - january 1st 2014
293:46 - and if anna pays the balance how much
293:48 - interest will she have paid
293:50 - so let's go over this question in a
293:53 - little bit of detail
293:55 - we have
293:57 - more complicated things going on than
293:59 - the others because our interest rate is
294:01 - changing
294:03 - this is going to take some more careful
294:05 - planning so i'm going to write january
294:07 - 1st 2010
294:09 - everything is january 1st so that's okay
294:15 - 2012. let's just extend this
294:18 - and we're going to 2014
294:24 - and i could say that zero years
294:26 - one year
294:27 - two year
294:29 - three year
294:30 - four year if that's what i would like
294:32 - okay so anna borrowed one thousand
294:36 - dollars
294:41 - so she borrowed it i like to say that it
294:44 - goes into her account
294:47 - and then in 2012 she paid back 500
294:52 - so we're gonna do this
294:55 - by checking the balance but we're also
294:57 - going to see next time that we could do
295:00 - this as what's called an equation of
295:01 - value so we're going to see this in a
295:04 - couple different ways
295:06 - let's look at january 1st 2014.
295:09 - actually before i do that let's look at
295:12 - the most important thing that's going on
295:13 - here and making it crazy the interest
295:15 - rate changes so in the beginning we have
295:18 - j 12 equals 24
295:22 - otherwise known as i is 2
295:25 - that's 24 over 12. in the second half
295:28 - the interest rate changes to only 18
295:31 - dividing that by 12
295:34 - it's one and a half percent so things
295:36 - are changing
295:38 - so let's see what happens if we go
295:41 - through her balance on january 1st 2010
295:45 - anna owes
295:49 - one thousand dollars
295:53 - in 2011 she now owes a thousand dollars
295:56 - plus interest
296:01 - that interest
296:03 - well
296:04 - it's going two years
296:07 - into the future 2 times 12 is 24 months
296:13 - in which case she now owes
296:15 - a thousand times 1.02
296:20 - to the power of twenty-four
296:24 - so she was sixteen hundred dollars
296:29 - i'm gonna write what she owes
296:32 - but she pays
296:36 - five hundred dollars so she owes
296:42 - less
296:47 - okay so she only owes 11.08
296:51 - but now it's going to accrue some
296:53 - interest
296:55 - sorry this not 2011 it is 2012
296:59 - because that's what's happening here in
297:01 - 2014 she now owes
297:04 - 1108
297:07 - plus another two years of interest but
297:10 - this time she's only being charged one
297:12 - and a half percent
297:14 - per month
297:15 - so this and i'm going to leave it
297:17 - unrounded
297:18 - though that is
297:20 - one of those things that i'm going to
297:22 - have to talk about in a different
297:23 - lecture
297:24 - the truth is some people keep track of
297:26 - all those decimal places and some people
297:28 - don't and in this class i'm going to let
297:30 - you do either
297:34 - 0.015 to the power of 24
297:37 - equals 15 8 4 51.
297:41 - here we go
297:48 - so that's how much money anna owes
297:52 - on the 14th
297:53 - if she pays it off how much interest
297:56 - should she have paid
298:00 - interest
298:02 - is going to be
298:05 - money paid
298:06 - minus money borrowed and we're going to
298:09 - see this in lots of different ways money
298:11 - in money out money paid money borrowed
298:15 - so anna paid
298:17 - looks like she made a payment of a
298:19 - thousand dollars
298:20 - and she made that payment of 1584.51
298:26 - sorry she didn't pay a thousand dollars
298:28 - she paid 500
298:34 - correct
298:37 - but she borrowed a thousand dollars in
298:40 - total which means
298:42 - in the end
298:43 - she paid
298:47 - 1084.51 cents in interest
298:58 - lesson 11 equations of a value
299:01 - we've talked a lot about interest rates
299:03 - compound and simple interest this time
299:06 - we're going to balance everything into
299:08 - an equation
299:12 - an equation of value
299:14 - is a fancy way of saying that we need to
299:17 - balance our account
299:23 - so that means that all of the inflows
299:30 - is the same as all of the outflows
299:34 - when we count for
299:36 - interest in other words
299:39 - all the money in
299:41 - equals all the money out
299:44 - or
299:45 - in other words
299:47 - money borrowed
299:49 - equals money paid
299:55 - those things balance as soon as we add
299:58 - in interest
300:07 - when we do an equation of value we're
300:08 - going to look through
300:10 - a story about either borrowing money or
300:13 - lending out money and we're going to
300:15 - move everything to the same time and
300:18 - then we're going to solve this equation
300:20 - so i'm going to tell you what the basic
300:23 - tools are the first thing we're going to
300:25 - do is draw a timeline those timelines
300:28 - really really help it's hard to do it
300:31 - without we're going to circle the focal
300:33 - date
300:36 - here's a rule
300:38 - simple interest
300:42 - you must be told because the answer is
300:44 - going to be different
300:46 - depending on what you choose as a focal
300:48 - date for compound interest
300:51 - choose the easiest one
300:54 - and we'll talk about what makes it
300:55 - easiest the one that the algebra would
300:57 - be easy is for
301:02 - put in all the monies
301:05 - paying attention
301:06 - to the direction
301:12 - and that really means did i borrow the
301:14 - money did the money go into my bank
301:16 - account or did i pay it back and i lost
301:18 - the money then we're going to set up
301:20 - equation
301:27 - and we're going to find a bunch of pvs
301:29 - and feves
301:33 - in general
301:38 - if we're moving forward in time we find
301:40 - the future value and we multiply
301:43 - if we are moving backwards in time we're
301:46 - finding a present value and we divide
301:48 - it's the same as it was in
301:50 - our
301:52 - partial payments back in chapter one
301:54 - next we're going to solve the equation
302:00 - and next then we're going to state the
302:02 - answer
302:07 - example one today you take out a five
302:10 - thousand dollar loan at ten percent
302:11 - simple interest which is to be repaid
302:13 - with two equal payments at the end of
302:15 - the first year and at the end of the
302:17 - second year find the size of the
302:19 - payments using today as your focal date
302:22 - so let's
302:23 - put in some of our items ten percent
302:27 - simple these questions could deal with
302:29 - simple or compound interest and it's
302:31 - important for us to know which one five
302:34 - thousand dollar loan and then two equal
302:36 - payments so let's start with a timeline
302:44 - there we go nice and neat
302:46 - let's put in our times
302:49 - today is always zero
302:52 - one year and
302:55 - two years
302:57 - so those are the times that are
302:58 - important
303:00 - we borrowed five thousand dollars
303:06 - and we're going to repay
303:07 - x dollars
303:14 - and that's because i have to choose
303:18 - any kind of variable and i choose the
303:20 - letter x that's often what we do
303:22 - it says use today is your focal date so
303:25 - i'm going to go ahead and circle that
303:28 - importantly i have to say whether
303:30 - everything is money in or money out that
303:33 - five thousand dollars is a loan it came
303:35 - into my account
303:37 - well those payments are leaving my
303:39 - account
303:40 - it doesn't matter which way you decide
303:42 - to draw your arrows as long as you're
303:43 - consistent after all five thousand
303:46 - dollars coming into my account means the
303:49 - person who loaned me the money had five
303:51 - thousand dollars leave their account and
303:53 - the payments will come to them as income
303:55 - every question has both people and it
303:58 - can be done either way
304:00 - let's move everything to the focal date
304:05 - and then we set this up so x is the size
304:07 - of the payment and we're going to set
304:09 - this up as money in equals money out
304:16 - or money paid
304:19 - sorry money borrowed equals money paid
304:24 - so let's start with that money that we
304:26 - borrowed we borrowed five thousand
304:28 - dollars
304:30 - and the five thousand dollars isn't
304:31 - moving at all so it gets to stand alone
304:34 - exactly where it is
304:35 - that's going to be equal to this first
304:37 - payment of x
304:39 - that's moving backwards and we know that
304:41 - then we're dividing we're finding a
304:43 - present value and that is x over one
304:47 - plus ten percent simple
304:50 - times one
304:52 - and then we're going to take the present
304:53 - value of this guy again we're moving
304:56 - backwards so that second payment of x
304:58 - is one plus ten percent times two
305:03 - when we come up with something like this
305:05 - it makes a lot of sense
305:08 - to uh simplify before we start to do
305:10 - anything
305:12 - if you love algebra and this is really
305:15 - something you're good at pause now do
305:18 - the albert algebra to solve for x
305:20 - if you're struggling keep on watching
305:27 - okay i'm going to make this a little bit
305:29 - simpler now i have two different
305:32 - fractions on the bottom i'm actually
305:33 - going to move this over a little bit
305:37 - and you will see why i have two
305:40 - denominators so what i'm going to do
305:43 - is multiply both sides by 1.1 and 1.2
305:49 - and because
305:50 - there's a plus in here i'm gonna
305:52 - multiply everything
305:54 - let's just move this over here
305:57 - 1.1
305:59 - 1.2
306:00 - perfect now i can do some simplifying
306:03 - there's a 1.1 on the bottom and the top
306:05 - and there's a 1.2 on the top and the
306:07 - bottom
306:08 - this is a good way of clearing out those
306:10 - denominators i'm going to rewrite this
306:12 - expression without doing any arithmetic
306:22 - well that looks a lot nicer
306:26 - next i'm going to actually move those
306:28 - sides over because i personally always
306:31 - like my x to be on the left and the
306:34 - other number to be on the right
306:36 - stew five thousand dollars
306:38 - times one point one
306:42 - times one point two
306:44 - and i get six thousand
306:46 - six hundred dollars when i add these
306:49 - together because remember
306:51 - i'm distributing this through
306:59 - so 1.1
307:01 - plus 1.2 is 2.3
307:05 - so i have 2.3 x equals 6
307:08 - 600.
307:10 - i'm going to go ahead and divide both
307:12 - sides by 2.3 and that will clear
307:16 - that 2.3 from the x and what i'm left
307:19 - with is just x
307:20 - over equals six thousand six hundred
307:24 - over two point three
307:25 - six thousand six hundred showing up on
307:27 - my calculator divided by two point three
307:31 - and i get twenty two thousand
307:36 - 869.57 remembering to round up
307:41 - and that is the answer and i'm going to
307:43 - finish by writing a sentence
307:52 - each payment is going to be 2869.57
307:59 - let's do one more part it's not written
308:01 - in this question but we care about
308:04 - interest
308:11 - in general this is really important we
308:14 - do want to know how much we paid in this
308:16 - case interest is going to be money paid
308:19 - minus money borrowed with no interest
308:22 - calculated
308:29 - and i'm going to say no pv or fv
308:32 - so the money i paid is going to be two
308:34 - payments
308:35 - of 2869.57
308:39 - and we borrowed five thousand dollars
308:42 - i'm going to clear this because i don't
308:44 - want all those trailing decimal places
308:46 - one of the frustrating things about
308:48 - business math is even though we always
308:51 - end up with fractions of a cent and we
308:53 - carry them through you can't make a
308:55 - payment that's less than a cent so you
308:57 - always have to round when you make a
308:59 - payment so multiply that by two
309:02 - and subtract five thousand
309:04 - and it looks like i paid
309:08 - 739.14
309:11 - in interest
309:12 - that's how much this loan cost
309:16 - question two today you take out a five
309:18 - thousand dollar loan at ten percent
309:20 - compounded quarterly which is to be
309:21 - repaid with two equal payments at the
309:23 - end of the first year and at the end of
309:25 - the second year a find the size of the
309:27 - payments and b how much interest will be
309:29 - paid
309:30 - if this question looks familiar it
309:32 - should it's the exact same question that
309:35 - we did in question one
309:38 - except that now
309:40 - we have i'm just going to circle two
309:42 - equal payments
309:43 - now instead of having simple interest we
309:45 - have compound interest
309:48 - as before i'm going to start by drawing
309:50 - in my timeline today
309:52 - one year two years
309:56 - but everything here
309:58 - is quarterly so i'm going to say j4
310:00 - equals 10
310:02 - which means that i is 10
310:04 - divided by 4
310:06 - or 2 and a half percent in case you're
310:08 - wondering how i did that
310:10 - ten percent is point one and i divided
310:13 - that by four
310:17 - so
310:18 - let's use today as our focal date just
310:21 - because that's what we did last time
310:23 - here though we get a lot more
310:27 - leeway in compound interest no matter
310:29 - where you choose your focal date you're
310:31 - going to come up with the exact same
310:32 - answer
310:33 - that means that we could choose
310:36 - something where the equation looks nice
310:37 - in algebra but what we're going to do
310:40 - today is just do the same thing we did
310:42 - before except now we're using the
310:44 - compound interest formula
310:47 - i'm going to state what x is
310:53 - so x is the size of each payment
310:58 - and i'm going to put a note any focal
311:00 - date will do
311:05 - in compound interest
311:08 - this isn't true and simple simple
311:10 - interest is not as elegant and it does
311:12 - matter where we choose the focal date so
311:14 - the two people that are arranged in the
311:17 - in the
311:18 - lending sorry
311:20 - have to choose one together
311:22 - so let's put our money borrowed
311:29 - equals money paid
311:32 - or money in money out our money borrowed
311:35 - was five thousand dollars
311:38 - and our money paid was that first
311:40 - payment of x but it's going back in time
311:44 - one year or four quarters if you're not
311:48 - sure about these payments these
311:50 - measurements go ahead and put those
311:53 - quarters in
311:59 - so this is one quarter
312:01 - two quarters three quarters etc
312:04 - that helps now let's add
312:07 - that second payment
312:10 - also
312:11 - 1.025 but this time it's going eight
312:14 - quarters into the past
312:18 - let's calculate this there are lots and
312:21 - lots of ways to calculate this
312:23 - but i'm going to do just one way
312:28 - what i'm going to do
312:31 - is actually i'm going to move everything
312:33 - over
312:35 - to the other side i'm going to note
312:42 - that x over 1.025 to the 4 is kind of
312:45 - like this fraction times x
312:54 - and now i'm going to use the calculator
312:56 - scroll up a little
312:58 - 1 divided by 1.025
313:02 - to the power of 4.
313:04 - that's a big long number so i'm going to
313:06 - store it i press store and then 1. and
313:09 - that is 0.9059.x
313:14 - anytime i store something i like to
313:16 - write down what i stored it as so i can
313:18 - get it back
313:19 - let's do the next part
313:22 - 1.02
313:25 - to the power of 8
313:27 - and then it was 1 over that so 0.82
313:35 - and i'm going to store that as 2.
313:39 - and again let's write down that that was
313:42 - stored as two and that whole thing
313:44 - equals five thousand dollars
313:47 - now i can factor out that x
314:00 - so this thing here well that's going to
314:02 - be recall 1
314:04 - plus we call 2
314:06 - and it's 1.72666
314:09 - another big number every time i get to
314:11 - these big messy numbers i like to store
314:13 - them store three
314:15 - so now i have let's scroll up a little
314:19 - 1.72669
314:22 - x
314:23 - and that's the same as store three
314:27 - and that equals five thousand dollars
314:30 - and now we're back to a similar place
314:32 - where we were i can divide both sides by
314:36 - that
314:42 - so now
314:44 - i have x equals this guy
314:54 - so i have
314:55 - 1.72669 i'm going to clear 5 000
314:59 - divided by recall 3
315:02 - is this
315:04 - 2895.70
315:08 - it's different than we had before
315:11 - and i'm going to end this with a
315:13 - sentence
315:21 - each payment is
315:23 - 2895
315:25 - and 70 cents
315:29 - interest is the same way
315:33 - so we paid
315:35 - well money paid
315:38 - minus money borrowed in interest
315:46 - same thing here only
315:50 - we have a different payment
315:55 - we borrowed five thousand dollars so i'm
315:58 - going to clear this
316:00 - just so that
316:04 - i don't have to worry about those
316:06 - trailing decimal places though if you
316:08 - use the decimal places it's not the end
316:10 - of the world
316:14 - okay
316:15 - we paid 791.40
316:18 - in interest
316:23 - that's not dramatically different than
316:25 - before but if i'm going to scroll up to
316:28 - question 1 we paid 7.39 so that's a lot
316:32 - more
316:39 - in general that's going to be true the
316:41 - longer a time period we invest for the
316:43 - less we're going to pay in interest
316:45 - charges with simple and the more
316:47 - interest in compound
316:49 - if we're investing the money compound is
316:51 - going to be better in the long term
316:52 - because we end up with more money
316:55 - question three you must repay a debt of
316:57 - six thousand dollars at six percent
317:00 - simple borrowed today
317:03 - the finance company has agreed to allow
317:05 - you to make three yearly payments with
317:07 - the first payment in one year the first
317:09 - two payments will be equal and the third
317:11 - payment will be five hundred dollars
317:12 - more than the first two payments find
317:14 - the size of the payments using three
317:16 - years from now as your focal date
317:18 - first this is a simple interest question
317:20 - which means it's important that we note
317:22 - the focal date because we don't really
317:24 - have a lot of choice
317:26 - let's draw
317:27 - a line in
317:32 - okay
317:37 - our timeline goes from now
317:40 - or zero
317:42 - one year
317:44 - two years
317:46 - three years
317:48 - the focal date is at three years i'm
317:50 - gonna circle that
317:52 - and i'm gonna put everything there
317:54 - we borrowed six thousand dollars i like
317:56 - to show that as six thousand dollars
317:58 - going into your account
318:00 - and we repaid it in three payments at
318:03 - one year
318:04 - two years
318:06 - and three years
318:08 - everything here is going to be ten sorry
318:11 - ten percent six percent simple
318:15 - let's let x be the first payment
318:26 - then we have x here
318:28 - and the second payment is the same and
318:30 - the third payment is five hundred
318:32 - dollars more than the first one so it's
318:34 - x plus five hundred dollars
318:38 - when we have a choice if there's
318:40 - anything with an addition there it is
318:42 - easiest to put it at the focal date so
318:44 - if we could have chosen a focal date i
318:46 - would have chosen this one
318:48 - this time everything is moving forward
318:50 - so we're going to be finding future
318:51 - values for all of our items so we have
318:57 - again money borrowed equals money paid
319:01 - once we account for interest
319:05 - so we borrowed six thousand dollars but
319:08 - we're moving that forward in time six
319:11 - percent
319:15 - three years times six percent because
319:17 - it's going three years into the future
319:20 - that's going to be the same as this x is
319:23 - moving two years into the future
319:28 - and this x is moving one year into the
319:31 - future
319:38 - and finally our last payment
319:41 - is staying the same
319:43 - i'm going to put that in brackets just
319:45 - so we know it all sorts together
319:47 - i'm going to simplify this a little and
319:49 - then like i often do i'm going to move
319:51 - all the x's to the same side
319:53 - so here once i simplify this i have 1.18
319:59 - times 6 000
320:02 - equals
320:04 - 1.12 x
320:07 - plus
320:10 - yeah 1.12 x
320:13 - plus
320:14 - 1.06 x
320:16 - plus x plus
320:18 - 500.
320:19 - moving all the x's together
320:22 - 1.12 x
320:25 - plus 1.06
320:26 - x plus x
320:28 - equals
320:31 - 1.18
320:32 - times 6 000 and i'm going to do that in
320:34 - a second and then i have this minus 500
320:37 - because it really switched sides there
320:41 - adding these things together
320:44 - 1.12
320:45 - plus 1.06
320:48 - plus 1. and remember when it's just x
320:51 - it's the same as 1x
320:52 - this is 3.18 x
320:56 - equals
320:57 - 1.18
321:00 - times 6 000
321:02 - plus
321:03 - sorry minus 500
321:06 - is
321:07 - 6580
321:15 - okay i am going to divide both sides
321:19 - switch colors because we might as well
321:22 - by 3.18
321:25 - and we end up with x equals
321:28 - 6 5 8 0 is showing up divided by 3.18
321:33 - is going to be two thousand
321:37 - sixty nine dollars and eighteen cents
321:40 - and this is the first payment
321:45 - but if i scroll just a little to look at
321:47 - our timeline we had three payments
321:50 - the second payment
321:54 - was also x
321:59 - and the third
322:00 - payment was x plus 500
322:04 - so it's going to be 2569.18
322:10 - those are the payments
322:12 - now let's look at the interest
322:18 - money paid
322:20 - minus money borrowed
322:27 - well we paid
322:31 - one payment of two thousand sixty nine
322:33 - dollars and eighteen cents
322:35 - another payment of two thousand
322:38 - sixty nine dollars and eighteen cents
322:40 - a payment of two five six nine point one
322:44 - eight and we borrowed and put that all
322:46 - in a bracket
322:48 - six thousand dollars
322:51 - which means once we dump that into a
322:53 - calculator which i'm not going to do on
322:56 - screen we end up with 707 dollars and 54
322:59 - cents that's the interest
323:02 - i'm gonna note that sometimes we call
323:03 - this the cost of borrowing
323:05 - this was how much the loan cost us
323:08 - over the three years we paid
323:10 - 707.50
323:12 - in interest
323:15 - question four is the trickiest one of
323:17 - this whole bunch because now we're going
323:20 - to have multiple inflows as well as
323:22 - multiple outflows
323:24 - you borrowed thousand three thousand
323:26 - dollars from your line of credit eight
323:27 - months ago and a further five thousand
323:29 - dollars three months ago you arranged
323:31 - with the bank to pay off the line of
323:33 - credit with two payments the first
323:34 - payment six months from today will be
323:36 - twice as large as the second payment
323:37 - made one year from today the bank
323:39 - charges you nine percent interest
323:41 - compounded monthly suggested focal date
323:43 - six months from today find the size of
323:45 - each payment and then find out how much
323:47 - interest you paid i'm going to say it is
323:49 - a suggested focal date because with
323:51 - compound interest it actually doesn't
323:53 - matter we can choose whichever one we
323:56 - want so i'm going to draw in a timeline
324:00 - and start
324:01 - by putting in some months i usually like
324:03 - to put today
324:05 - right at
324:06 - the beginning and now i'm gonna
324:08 - highlight every
324:10 - date we have eight months ago
324:13 - three months ago six months from today
324:16 - one year from today
324:18 - those are all the points we have a go
324:21 - means in the past so i would put this
324:23 - down as minus eight months
324:26 - and we also have minus three months
324:28 - don't worry about it being to scale this
324:31 - timeline is meant to help me not to be
324:33 - super accurate
324:35 - six months
324:36 - 12 months
324:38 - okay
324:39 - we do know that the bank is going to
324:41 - charge us nine percent compounded
324:43 - monthly i'm just going to write that
324:45 - over here
324:47 - j 12 equals 9
324:50 - which means i is going to be
324:52 - 0.09 over 12
324:55 - is 0.0075
325:00 - and this is a compound interest problem
325:03 - let's let
325:05 - x
325:07 - be one of the payment let's let it be
325:09 - the second payment
325:18 - and i've chosen that you could choose
325:20 - any one you want because the first one
325:23 - is twice as large as the second
325:26 - so that way it makes sense to have x to
325:29 - be the second payment so let's put in
325:32 - the money we borrowed we borrowed three
325:34 - thousand dollars eight months ago again
325:37 - that's going into our account and we
325:39 - borrowed more money an extra five
325:42 - thousand dollars
325:44 - three months ago we arranged to pay off
325:47 - the bank line with two payments and
325:48 - those are at six months from today i'm
325:51 - actually going to change the color there
325:52 - so we can see that it's
325:54 - a different side
325:56 - and one at 12 months from today we said
325:59 - this was the second payment x which
326:02 - means that 2x
326:03 - is the first payment suggested focal
326:07 - date is six months from today but it
326:09 - could be anything today doesn't make
326:11 - sense because there's no payment
326:13 - happening today so i'm going to stick
326:14 - with that six months but with compound
326:16 - interest it's actually your choice
326:19 - now i'm going to move everything
326:21 - backwards remembering we divide when we
326:22 - go backwards we multiply
326:25 - when we go forwards
326:30 - money borrowed
326:33 - equals money paid
326:39 - so let's start with the money that we
326:41 - borrowed i'm gonna scroll up a little so
326:43 - we've got some extra space
326:45 - we borrowed
326:47 - three thousand dollars
326:48 - and actually let's take a moment before
326:51 - we really get started and write in those
326:53 - times
326:56 - eight months ago to six months from
326:58 - today is eight plus six is fourteen
327:01 - months
327:03 - three months ago to six months from
327:05 - today is six plus three is nine months
327:10 - six months to this that's zero and 12
327:12 - months from today six months from today
327:15 - that's six months sometimes it helps to
327:18 - have those n values written in already
327:21 - so we've got three thousand dollars is
327:23 - moving 14 months into the future
327:31 - that five thousand dollars
327:37 - is moving nine months into the future
327:40 - now that 2x
327:42 - it isn't doing anything
327:45 - but the x is moving backwards
327:50 - and it's moving six months into the past
327:56 - there's lots of ways to solve this
327:58 - equation
328:00 - i'm going to just do one way and i'm
328:02 - going to use the calculator heavily
328:04 - so first i'm going to rewrite this by
328:07 - moving the x's to the left side and i'm
328:09 - going to
328:10 - note that this is 2 plus
328:13 - 1 over
328:14 - 1.0075 to the power of 6.
328:18 - and then i have this whole mess and i'm
328:20 - going to put that in the calculator in a
328:21 - minute
328:29 - there's lots of clever algebra you could
328:31 - do by using rules of exponents but i'm
328:35 - not going to do that in this class but
328:37 - if that seems like something that you
328:40 - can do go ahead first let's calculate
328:43 - this guy
328:45 - so that is i'm going to go backwards
328:47 - 1.0075
328:50 - to the power of 6.
328:53 - and then i'm going to take 1 over that
328:55 - and add 2.
328:57 - and just like before i'm going to save
328:59 - this store 1.
329:01 - so this is 2.95615
329:06 - x and i'm going to print store one there
329:10 - that equals i'm going to put the entire
329:12 - second side in the calculator
329:15 - 3 000
329:17 - times 1.0075
329:21 - to the power of 14
329:24 - plus
329:25 - 5 000
329:27 - times 1.008
329:31 - to the power of 9.
329:34 - i get
329:37 - 8678.63
329:40 - i'm going to store that
329:42 - though in the next line
329:45 - once we divide out by this guy over here
329:56 - i'm going to have this number 8600 ish
329:59 - divided by whatever i stored under one
330:03 - and i get 2
330:05 - 935 dollars
330:15 - now at any time if you're having trouble
330:17 - making this algebra work this is a good
330:19 - reason to come talk to me or do some of
330:22 - the algebra work provided online talking
330:24 - to me is always going to help
330:27 - that is the second payment
330:30 - so let's do the first one as well
330:33 - that's 2x well i'm going to clear it
330:35 - because i don't
330:37 - want to worry about those decimal places
330:41 - but it is not overly concerning
330:44 - 5871.56
330:47 - is the first payment
330:52 - now let's do the interest
331:02 - so again
331:03 - money paid minus money borrowed
331:10 - so we paid
331:12 - in this side
331:14 - 29 35.78
331:17 - and we paid
331:19 - 5871.56
331:22 - i'm gonna put that in brackets the money
331:24 - we borrowed was those two payments
331:27 - together and i'm putting those in
331:28 - brackets to show that we're gonna add
331:30 - those first
331:32 - three thousand and five thousand so we
331:34 - borrowed eight thousand dollars
331:36 - running that through a calculator we
331:38 - come up with 807.34
331:42 - and again we call that the cost of
331:45 - borrowing
331:53 - today we're going to start talking about
331:55 - annuities the key to annuities is that
331:58 - we're taking a compound interest problem
332:00 - and we're adding a payment
332:04 - what is an annuity
332:06 - i'm going to write out this definition
332:08 - and then read it out loud
332:11 - an annuity is a sequence of payments
332:17 - at regular intervals
332:25 - for set time
332:30 - and to make it easier all the payments
332:32 - are equal
332:39 - let's go straight into a few examples
332:45 - one example is saving
332:49 - so what if i put
332:51 - a hundred dollars a month
332:57 - into the
332:58 - bank for three years
333:04 - that's one example
333:06 - how about another example
333:11 - i'm living off of credit
333:17 - and every year
333:20 - or every semester
333:23 - that's twice a year
333:25 - or
333:26 - semi-annually i am going to borrow
333:30 - five thousand dollars for living
333:32 - expenses
333:41 - this is a particular example of what we
333:43 - call accumulation
333:46 - the key here is that the balance is
333:48 - growing
333:50 - it gets bigger every month
333:54 - so my bank balance is
333:56 - higher every year every month
334:00 - and my debt
334:01 - is growing
334:03 - so every
334:05 - six months my debt is a little bit
334:07 - bigger
334:08 - let's look at some more examples
334:12 - of a different type of annuity
334:15 - uh i have a mortgage
334:20 - of three hundred thousand dollars
334:26 - every month
334:29 - i pay
334:31 - two thousand dollars
334:33 - and here's the second one
334:35 - i saved money to take a year off
334:44 - every quarter that's four times a year
334:51 - i take six thousand dollars out of
334:53 - savings
334:59 - and
335:00 - in this case i have a second kind of
335:03 - annuity
335:05 - this is called an amortization
335:08 - big fancy word which we're going to see
335:09 - a lot of
335:11 - but
335:12 - the gist is
335:13 - the balance is shrinking
335:16 - it gets smaller every
335:19 - month every period
335:21 - so here
335:23 - my debt is lower every month
335:28 - so every time i make a payment
335:30 - i have less money owing on my mortgage
335:34 - in the second example
335:36 - my bank balance is shrinking by six
335:38 - thousand dollars and that was a
335:40 - misspelled bank
335:41 - bank balance
335:44 - is shrinking
335:48 - so
335:49 - those are two kinds of things
335:51 - accumulation growing amortization
335:55 - shrinking
335:56 - two kinds of mortgages
335:59 - mortgages are divided into even more
336:01 - type of things
336:03 - so let's look at when the payment
336:04 - happens
336:11 - if it's at the end of the month
336:17 - or the end of the quarter or the end of
336:19 - the year we call that an ordinary
336:21 - annuity because ordinarily we pay at the
336:23 - end of the month
336:27 - oops
336:29 - so here we have end goes with ordinary
336:33 - we also have beginning
336:36 - so in this one actually let's give an
336:38 - example
336:39 - i pay my
336:41 - credit card bill at the end of the month
336:49 - usually when you're paying back money
336:51 - you pay back at the end because it seems
336:53 - silly to pay back the day that you
336:55 - borrow it
336:58 - when we have the beginning of the month
337:05 - we call that an annuity do
337:12 - beginning due and you can call that a
337:14 - begin annuity even though it's
337:16 - technically called an annuity due and
337:19 - often with a savings
337:21 - program
337:24 - the day you decide to start saving
337:26 - you actually start saving that's the day
337:29 - i'm going to put the money in and that
337:30 - means it's going to be begin i'm going
337:32 - to put this in to show you the
337:34 - calculator buttons and this will make
337:36 - more sense
337:38 - a little bit later when we talk about
337:40 - how to do this
337:42 - okay
337:44 - we've got one more step to go over
337:48 - and that's how often do i compound
337:59 - and how often do i pay
338:07 - so py
338:09 - we've seen this before this is payments
338:11 - per year
338:15 - and cy
338:17 - we're going to go over this in your
338:18 - calculator that's compounding periods
338:21 - per year
338:30 - in a simple annuity
338:37 - those things are the same
338:41 - so i deposit monthly in my bank account
338:47 - interest is compounded monthly that's
338:50 - the easiest type that's why we call it
338:52 - simple
338:56 - then we've got
338:59 - general the opposite of simple is
339:02 - general
339:05 - and those things are different
339:08 - and in the end of this
339:11 - unit we're going to see a lot of
339:14 - mortgages
339:18 - mortgages compound semi-annually in
339:20 - canada
339:25 - but usually people pay monthly
339:30 - so those are the different types
339:33 - of
339:34 - uh
339:35 - annuities
339:39 - by now you've seen me write this down a
339:41 - lot of times these are the things that
339:43 - go on that tvm row of your calculator
339:46 - i'm just going to quickly show that
339:47 - we've got this tvm button row here that
339:50 - we've seen when we talked about compound
339:52 - interest
339:54 - py is going to be the payments per year
339:58 - so how many times per year do we pay
340:00 - this is the compounding
340:05 - so this is the m from j m
340:08 - it's how many times we compound per year
340:10 - n is the number of payments
340:14 - this we're going to get to
340:16 - when p y and cy are different n is a
340:18 - little bit harder to do we're going to
340:20 - talk about that in the next lesson i y
340:23 - is the nominal rate
340:26 - same as it was in compound interest rate
340:29 - present value
340:31 - is well that's the balance the beginning
340:34 - i'm going to put a little plus sign here
340:36 - to say when the present value is
340:38 - positive
340:39 - the payment is going to be positive when
340:41 - we accumulate
340:43 - and negative when we amortize so balance
340:47 - growing it's a plus
340:48 - balance shrinking it's a negative and in
340:50 - this case the future value is always
340:52 - going to be negative
340:54 - just to make things complicated we can
340:56 - always do it the opposite way
341:01 - so we could say
341:05 - that if you wanted to say your debt was
341:07 - a negative at the beginning then you'd
341:09 - add a plus because you're digging
341:10 - yourself out of that hole and in that
341:12 - case every single thing is opposite
341:15 - begin
341:17 - when begin is off that's the ending mode
341:20 - and begin is on and that is the begin
341:23 - mode and we're gonna go over that and
341:25 - how to use that on the calculator later
341:28 - starting with example one you decide to
341:31 - begin a savings plan starting in one
341:33 - year you will deposit a hundred dollars
341:35 - each year into an account that pays j1
341:37 - equals 12 percent interest how much will
341:40 - you have in three years how much of that
341:41 - is interest
341:43 - let's start by drawing a timeline when
341:45 - you're first beginning
341:47 - it's really useful to draw in these
341:49 - timelines once you've done it for a
341:52 - while these basic annuities don't need
341:54 - them anymore but we will talk about more
341:57 - advanced ones
341:58 - so let's say that we start with no money
342:02 - then we're going to deposit a hundred
342:04 - dollars i'm putting the arrow down to
342:06 - show that that money is going into my
342:08 - account
342:12 - what we're doing is evaluating this
342:16 - at the last minute at time three
342:20 - algebraically
342:22 - using the compound interest formula
342:24 - that's the same as saying
342:26 - i've got a hundred dollars that i invest
342:30 - for looks like two years
342:32 - i've got a hundred dollars that i invest
342:35 - for
342:38 - one year and then i've got an extra
342:40 - hundred dollars
342:41 - so when we put those together i can
342:43 - evaluate how many of how much money i
342:45 - have at the end of the time
342:48 - that is 337 dollars and 44 cents
342:52 - please try this in your calculator if
342:54 - you would like
342:56 - three payments i can do that but let's
342:58 - say i had 100 payments i'm not going to
343:01 - calculate a hundred different things
343:03 - that's why i'm going to use the payment
343:05 - button for annuities so let's look at
343:09 - our types of annuities so the first
343:11 - thing i want to look at is are we
343:13 - accumulating
343:15 - or are we amortizing
343:18 - so here
343:19 - every month every year i have a little
343:21 - bit more money
343:23 - so i'm accumulating and that's because
343:25 - the balance is growing
343:30 - next i always want to look at
343:32 - well is it ordinary or do
343:35 - and those are funny words so ordinary is
343:37 - at the end of the year and due is at the
343:39 - beginning of the year
343:43 - here you can see and getting my first
343:45 - payment at the end of the first year at
343:48 - one not at zero so this is ordinary
343:51 - and finally i've got simple
343:54 - versus general
343:56 - and i'm going to actually just write
343:58 - that that is at the beginning
344:00 - end of the first year
344:03 - simple in general well my payments i put
344:06 - in a payment every year
344:08 - and my compounding period it compounds
344:10 - annually j1 equals 12 percent so those
344:14 - things are the same that makes this a
344:16 - simple ordinary annuity
344:19 - and now i'm going to put this in the
344:20 - calculator
344:24 - so let's start at the beginning
344:26 - i said that the payments were once a
344:29 - year and it was compounding once a year
344:31 - those are both one
344:33 - n well n here is three years because
344:36 - there are three payments the interest
344:38 - rate is 12. i start with no money this
344:41 - is very common in a savings and
344:45 - i'm going to put in a hundred dollars
344:48 - every year i'm putting a plus sign
344:50 - because my balance is growing this is an
344:52 - accumulation my future value i'm going
344:55 - to compute that but i'm going to hope
344:56 - that it's negative at the end begin is
344:59 - going to be off and we'll worry about
345:01 - how to use that on the calculator in the
345:03 - next lesson
345:05 - so let's
345:06 - calculate this i'm going to put
345:08 - everything in starting with pycy i make
345:11 - sure that that is 1
345:12 - it is
345:14 - n is 3
345:16 - our iy again was 12
345:18 - present value i put in 0. now i'm going
345:21 - to actually put in that payment of 100
345:24 - and i'm left with computing the future
345:26 - value and i get
345:30 - negative
345:32 - 337.44
345:35 - which is exactly the same that we got by
345:37 - algebra
345:39 - often in an accumulation
345:44 - present value is going to be zero
345:46 - because we assume that we start with no
345:48 - money if we had money in our account
345:51 - we'll deal with that next lesson it's
345:53 - just a matter of putting a number into
345:55 - pv
345:56 - let's calculate the interest
346:02 - interest is money out
346:05 - minus money in in a savings
346:08 - situation
346:10 - how much money did i have at the end
346:12 - well that was 337.44
346:16 - money in that was three payments of a
346:19 - hundred dollars when i run that through
346:22 - a calculator or do it in my head i get
346:25 - thirty seven dollars and forty four
346:26 - cents that's how much interest i earned
346:29 - over the three years 37 dollars and 44
346:34 - cents
346:35 - example two
346:37 - financial planners estimate you will
346:39 - require an income of 2500 per month to
346:42 - retire you dial a psychic and discover
346:45 - that you're going to live exactly 15
346:47 - years how much money will you need to
346:49 - retire if your first withdrawal will be
346:50 - in one month interest is going to be 9
346:53 - compounded monthly so let's draw a bit
346:56 - of a timeline here
346:59 - start with the line and i'm going to
347:01 - start with today
347:02 - and then write in one month
347:04 - i haven't left myself a huge amount of
347:06 - room and i'm not going to do the whole
347:08 - thing
347:09 - i'm going to go up to here and say
347:10 - that's 180 months or 15 years
347:15 - and then here is 179 months
347:18 - let's start putting in some things i'm
347:20 - going to put some money in now i have to
347:23 - put some money in and i don't know what
347:24 - that is
347:26 - then i'm going to take out 2500
347:29 - every single month
347:31 - starting one month from today
347:34 - and ending
347:36 - exactly 15 years from today where i take
347:39 - out my last payment and then i am going
347:41 - to not no longer need any money at the
347:44 - end of the day
347:46 - i don't have any money left that's
347:48 - important because otherwise i couldn't
347:50 - calculate this
347:51 - so let's look at this
347:53 - i'm putting in a bunch of money now and
347:55 - at the end i have zero in this case my
347:57 - balance is definitely shrinking so i
348:00 - would call this an amortization
348:03 - looking at my chart you can see that i'm
348:05 - taking those payments out at the end of
348:07 - the month and one thing is if it's
348:10 - unclear we treat it at the end of the
348:12 - month that's what we mean by ordinary
348:14 - that's the normal course of events
348:17 - finally we've got our py and cys so i'm
348:20 - taking out monthly payments
348:23 - and i'm compounding monthly
348:27 - those are the same and that's because i
348:29 - have j12 equals nine
348:32 - let's put this into the calculator and
348:34 - you should get used to drawing this out
348:37 - because we do this for every example
348:41 - okay
348:42 - in this case i said p y and c y were
348:44 - both 12. i can write 12 12 or i could
348:47 - write those together either way it's
348:50 - going for 15 years and that is 180
348:53 - months and i'm just going to put in and
348:55 - that's 15 times 12.
348:59 - our interest rate is 9. and i'm going to
349:01 - start out well that's what i'm trying to
349:03 - find i don't know how much money i start
349:05 - out with but i'm going to take money out
349:08 - so i'm going to make this payment
349:10 - negative because my balance is shrinking
349:13 - my future value i said that should be
349:15 - negative as well but it's actually zero
349:17 - so it's a negative zero it's coming at
349:20 - the end of the month so begin is off
349:23 - so let's put this in i'm going to show
349:25 - you by pressing recall
349:28 - i still have everything in for my last
349:29 - example i can override overwrite that
349:33 - just start putting it in or i can press
349:36 - second
349:37 - clear tvm
349:39 - and then if you look at it everything is
349:41 - now zero
349:43 - but pycy will still need changing they
349:46 - don't clear when i clear that if i
349:48 - change p y to 12 notice that c y changes
349:51 - as well that's very handy for us when
349:54 - we're working on a simple annuity
349:56 - n is 180
349:59 - i y is
350:01 - nine the present value is what i'm
350:03 - computing
350:05 - 2500
350:06 - negative is the payment and future value
350:09 - is zero
350:11 - so i'll compute the present value and we
350:14 - get a very big
350:16 - number
350:18 - i need to have two hundred and forty six
350:21 - thousand four hundred and eighty three
350:23 - dollars and fifty two cents
350:25 - uh
350:26 - to retire today
350:29 - that's great if i have that much money
350:31 - later on we're going to talk about how
350:33 - you would go about trying to save that
350:35 - much money which makes a lot more sense
350:38 - so do the interest calculation
350:44 - we call that interest when we borrow
350:46 - something we call that cost of financing
350:48 - cost of borrowing you're going to see
350:50 - this a lot and that's going to be money
350:53 - out
350:56 - minus money in
350:59 - or the money we pay
351:04 - minus the money borrowed
351:09 - there's lots of way of doing interest
351:11 - but in the end you should get a positive
351:12 - number because it doesn't make sense to
351:14 - have negative five dollars
351:16 - of interest
351:18 - so in this case let's look at this
351:20 - question
351:23 - our interest payment is going to be well
351:26 - i took out
351:28 - 180 payments of 2500
351:33 - and we deposited
351:35 - 246 483.52
351:40 - and i'm going to round that so if i do
351:42 - this i go 180
351:45 - times 2500
351:48 - oops
351:53 - minus
351:54 - two four six
351:56 - four eight three
351:58 - point five two
352:00 - equals
352:01 - two hundred and three thousand dollars
352:04 - so we actually made quite a lot of
352:07 - interest and that's because we had a
352:09 - fairly good interest rate of nine
352:10 - percent but also this was invested for
352:12 - 15 years that's a long time for money to
352:15 - compound
352:17 - example three you've just purchased a
352:20 - new house for two hundred and fifty
352:21 - thousand dollars you can afford to pay
352:24 - twenty six hundred dollars per month on
352:25 - your mortgage how long will it take you
352:27 - to pay off your house if interest is
352:29 - calculated at twelve percent compounded
352:31 - monthly
352:32 - let's just take a second to draw this
352:35 - i borrowed
352:37 - 250 000
352:40 - that's going into our account and then
352:42 - we're going to start paying
352:44 - payments of 2600. those are going to
352:46 - come out at the end of the month monthly
352:49 - for a bunch of time
352:52 - and months
352:54 - and what we're going to do
352:57 - is find that n
352:59 - so firstly
353:01 - i borrowed money and every month i pay
353:03 - it back my balance is shrinking when i
353:06 - repay money which means that this is an
353:08 - amortization
353:11 - i'm paying at the end of the month so
353:13 - this is an ordinary annuity
353:16 - also i'm paying monthly
353:20 - and i'm compounding
353:22 - monthly because i have j12
353:26 - equals 12
353:28 - so this
353:29 - is a simple ordinary amortization
353:34 - let's take all the numbers from here and
353:36 - put them in
353:38 - in this case some people really like to
353:40 - see this as a negative number under your
353:43 - present value because you've borrowed
353:44 - that that's your debt
353:46 - i prefer to make everything positive in
353:49 - present present value so i'm going to
353:51 - continue to do that
353:52 - and then because my balance is shrinking
353:55 - that 2600 becomes negative my future
353:59 - value well it doesn't say but assume
354:01 - that i'm paying off all that money so my
354:03 - future value should be zero in the end
354:06 - my begin is off because it's at the end
354:08 - of the month
354:10 - j12
354:11 - well
354:12 - everything was 12 and the interest rate
354:15 - was 12 what i'm trying to compute is n
354:19 - now just like in compound interest
354:22 - problems with these annuities i can
354:24 - calculate n i y pv payment or future
354:28 - value as long as i know four out of five
354:31 - of these things i can compute the other
354:34 - one using a calculator
354:36 - here let's just put this into our
354:38 - calculator so our pycy
354:41 - still says 12
354:43 - and i'm going to compute
354:45 - 12 is the interest rate
354:47 - 250 000
354:49 - for the present value i'm making my
354:51 - payments of negative 2600 and my future
354:55 - value will be zero at the end when i
354:58 - compute n
355:00 - i get 327
355:06 - months
355:09 - and that means 327 big payments
355:16 - plus
355:17 - one little baby payment at the end
355:20 - and we're going to talk about those
355:22 - final payments later on in the course
355:25 - and just so we know that's around 27.3
355:29 - years i'm going to be paying off this
355:30 - mortgage for a while
355:32 - i'm going to do one thing
355:35 - i'm going to make my pa payment positive
355:39 - and i'm going to re-compute n
355:42 - notice that n is a negative number
355:50 - in this case n is negative 67.709
355:55 - that makes very little sense it says i'm
355:57 - going to pay off my mortgage in negative
356:00 - five and a half years
356:03 - negative years negative time that
356:05 - doesn't make a lot of sense
356:08 - if you see a negative n
356:15 - means that you put an entry error and
356:17 - wrong
356:23 - when you see an error or you see
356:25 - something that makes no sense like a
356:27 - negative n you know that you've made
356:29 - an input error and you've pressed the
356:31 - wrong
356:32 - button example four your new car loan
356:36 - has payments of 499 at the end of each
356:39 - month
356:41 - for five years
356:42 - to pay a 25 pay for a 25 000 car what
356:47 - rate of interest is being charged what
356:49 - is the effective rate what is the cost
356:50 - of financing
356:52 - so let's look through this one as well
356:55 - we borrowed
356:57 - 25 000
356:59 - and every month we're going to pay back
357:01 - 4.99
357:06 - etc and that's going to go on for 60
357:09 - months or 5 years
357:14 - every month the amount of money we owe
357:16 - on that car is shrinking that makes this
357:19 - one also an amortization
357:23 - we are always making our payments at the
357:26 - end of each month and it says that right
357:28 - in the problem so it is an ordinary
357:31 - annuity finally simple general well
357:33 - that's a little more tricky because this
357:35 - question is asking two things so let's
357:38 - do this with just a monthly rate
357:44 - and then we're going to do this again
357:46 - and see what happens if we treat this as
357:48 - a general annuity
357:50 - so let's start with py and cy both being
357:53 - 12 because we're making those monthly
357:55 - payments 60 of them we're trying to find
357:58 - the interest rate
358:00 - we started by owing 25 000 and we're
358:03 - making payments of 4.99 those are
358:06 - negative because our balance is
358:08 - shrinking at the end we owe nothing on
358:11 - the car and we're paying at the end of
358:14 - the month
358:15 - so we go into here it's clear
358:18 - and our pycy should still be 12.
358:23 - our n is going to be 60
358:25 - our interest rate is what we're trying
358:27 - to find we're borrowing 25 000 and
358:30 - making payments of negative
358:33 - 4.99
358:34 - and at the end of the day we'll own no
358:37 - money when i compute the interest rate i
358:40 - get 7.33
358:48 - now there's a few things we can do
358:50 - i could take this interest rate
358:52 - and store it
358:55 - and then use that interest conversion
358:57 - worksheet that we talked about in the
358:59 - last section
359:00 - so the nominal let's put recall 1
359:04 - enter
359:06 - now i go down i'm going to find my
359:08 - effective rate but i need my cy to be
359:10 - 12. i'm going to compute that and i find
359:13 - out
359:17 - that i have 7.5875
359:21 - percent
359:22 - but
359:23 - i can treat this separately i'm gonna do
359:26 - this as a general annuity because we're
359:28 - going to start doing this in our next
359:30 - lesson i'm still gonna pay 12 times a
359:33 - year but now i'm going to compound one
359:35 - time a year
359:37 - n is 60 everything else stays the same
359:42 - so what i'm doing is just changing
359:45 - one thing in the calculator so let's
359:47 - clear out of this one go to second py
359:51 - py is 12 but now i'm going to go down
359:53 - and change cy to be one
359:56 - so when i scroll here you can see 12 1
359:59 - those are different
360:01 - clear out of that worksheet compute the
360:03 - interest rate and now i get
360:10 - 7.5875
360:13 - exactly what i got through the interest
360:15 - conversion worksheet so general
360:17 - annuities seem complicated
360:21 - however
360:22 - in the end
360:24 - we can do them fairly easily given that
360:27 - we have a good financial calculator
360:30 - finally let's do the cost of financing
360:32 - cost of financing is fancy for interest
360:35 - so cost of financing or cost of
360:38 - borrowing
360:39 - is a fancy way of saying interest when
360:42 - we borrow we say our interest is going
360:45 - to be the money paid
360:47 - minus money borrowed
360:52 - so in this case how much did i pay well
360:55 - we paid 499 dollars 60 times and
360:59 - borrowed 25 000
361:02 - we can throw that into a calculator
361:05 - which i did off camera and i ended up
361:08 - with 4
361:10 - 940
361:12 - that's the cost of financing
361:16 - one more note on this
361:18 - cars
361:23 - the sticker price on this car
361:25 - is actually a bigger money a bigger
361:28 - number
361:29 - let's say this car is 29
361:32 - 940 with zero percent financing
361:39 - where did i get that number well that
361:41 - number was 499 times 60.
361:44 - if a car dealership advertises zero
361:46 - percent financing
361:48 - usually this is what they mean the car
361:50 - is actually 29 000 or you get
361:55 - nine hundred and forty dollar cash
361:57 - discount
361:59 - that's for paying cash right away
362:03 - the real moral here is you're not
362:05 - getting something for nothing so that
362:06 - zero percent interest really means that
362:09 - the cost is actually 25 000
362:13 - lesson 13 more annuities today we're
362:16 - going to look at different types of
362:18 - annuities simple versus general ordinary
362:22 - versus do for completeness sake here are
362:25 - the formulae that you can use to do
362:28 - annuities in this course we're going to
362:30 - be using a pre-programmed ba 2 plus
362:33 - calculator but if you are a person who
362:35 - loves algebra go ahead knock yourself
362:38 - out these formulas are also in the
362:40 - textbook
362:42 - first we're going to start with what we
362:43 - like to call five finger problems a five
362:46 - finger problem just means you have a
362:48 - problem where pv
362:50 - and fv
362:52 - and payment
362:54 - are not zero so we've got a present
362:56 - value and a future value going on
362:59 - i want to start with a car lease
363:02 - you decide to lease a new bmw automobile
363:05 - the vehicle costs thirty thousand
363:07 - dollars new and you are required to pay
363:09 - all taxes at the beginning of the lease
363:12 - the lease payments are six hundred
363:13 - dollars per month for three years
363:17 - and you know the lease in company
363:19 - charges interest at six percent
363:21 - compounded monthly i'm just going to
363:23 - write j-12 equals six percent
363:25 - what is the residual value of the car
363:27 - and how much interest do we pay over the
363:29 - lifetime of the lease
363:31 - so let's pause for a moment and talk
363:33 - about car leases
363:37 - in car lease you don't actually buy the
363:39 - car all you're doing is renting it
363:42 - this way we pay less per month than if
363:44 - we bought the car outright but the
363:46 - problem is or the advantage is we don't
363:48 - get a car at the end this is great if
363:50 - three years after getting a car you want
363:52 - to trade up to a new car a lease is
363:54 - often the way to go
363:56 - at the end of the lease if you want to
363:58 - you can buy the car for its residual
363:59 - value cars depreciate over time
364:02 - depreciate means they're worth less than
364:05 - when they began a three-year-old car
364:07 - three even a three-year-old bmw is not
364:10 - going to
364:11 - cost thirty thousand dollars it will
364:13 - cost less
364:14 - to calculate that residual value we find
364:17 - out what the balance is or how much is
364:19 - owing at the end of those three years
364:24 - so let's look at this problem
364:27 - the balance or how much we owe starts at
364:30 - 30 000 but it goes down every month as
364:32 - we make payments that makes this an
364:34 - amortization
364:36 - but it's an amortization where fv is not
364:39 - going to be zero
364:42 - the lease payments are 600
364:44 - and unless you're told that the payments
364:46 - are at the very beginning we usually
364:48 - assume that the payments are at the end
364:50 - of the month any payment we make at the
364:52 - very beginning well that goes with
364:55 - payments and taxes
364:59 - and that's how leasing often works
365:02 - here we're paying monthly
365:04 - and the interest rate is a monthly
365:07 - interest rate
365:09 - so that makes this a simple this is a
365:12 - simple ordinary amortization but it's
365:15 - different than what we've done before
365:16 - because the future value and the present
365:18 - value are not both zero
365:22 - let's look at the numbers in this
365:24 - problem the vehicle cost thirty thousand
365:27 - dollars originally
365:29 - that thirty thousand dollars is the
365:31 - present value of the car i like to leave
365:34 - this one positive we make six hundred
365:37 - dollar payments that's minus because the
365:40 - balance is shrinking
365:43 - the payments are at the end of the month
365:46 - and they are for three years so three
365:49 - times 12 is 36 payments and those
365:52 - payments and compounding are monthly
365:56 - the interest rate is six percent
365:59 - our future value is what we're trying to
366:01 - find we're trying to figure out
366:03 - what
366:04 - we owe on the car at the end of the
366:06 - three years this will have been set up
366:10 - by the car company so that that's the
366:12 - value of the car
366:13 - and if we choose not to buy the car
366:15 - somebody else might want to buy our
366:17 - vehicle off lease
366:18 - so let's
366:19 - scroll down and calculate this so we
366:22 - start as usual by going to the pycy
366:26 - they are not the same so we have to
366:28 - check
366:29 - py equals 12 and now they're both
366:32 - exactly the same
366:34 - n is 36.
366:36 - the interest rate is six
366:38 - our present value is thirty thousand
366:42 - and we're making six hundred dollar
366:44 - payments negative
366:46 - now we're going to compute the future
366:47 - value
366:48 - future value here is negative
367:00 - that really means that a three-year-old
367:03 - car
367:11 - is only worth
367:13 - 12
367:17 - cents 298.75 we want to pay the car that
367:19 - is how much we have to pay at the end of
367:21 - the lease
367:23 - if we don't want to pay the car buy the
367:25 - car we can walk away at this point and
367:28 - we've just spent that money to rent the
367:30 - car over time and then someone else can
367:32 - step in and buy a three-year-old car for
367:35 - twelve thousand two hundred ninety eight
367:37 - dollars and seventy five cents
367:39 - that is the residual value
367:49 - let's pretend that we actually bought
367:51 - the car
367:58 - how much interest did we pay over the
368:00 - lifetime of this lease well our interest
368:03 - is always
368:06 - amount paid versus amount borrowed
368:12 - amount or money borrowed
368:17 - scrolling up over here well we paid
368:21 - taxes we didn't borrow that we don't
368:23 - have to worry about that we made 36
368:26 - payments
368:27 - of six hundred dollars
368:29 - and we paid off that residual value
368:34 - how much did we borrow that was thirty
368:37 - thousand dollars
368:39 - which means that our interest was not
368:42 - very much it was three thousand eight
368:45 - hundred ninety eight dollars and seventy
368:47 - five cents for our bottom of the line
368:50 - new bmw
368:53 - two you are saving for your son's
368:55 - post-secondary education in 10 years
368:58 - you have 27 000 in an resp account and
369:02 - plan to add a thousand dollars at the
369:03 - end of the year for the next 10 years
369:06 - how much money will your son have when
369:08 - he goes to school in 10 years if you
369:09 - receive a return a 4.8 percent
369:12 - compounded annually on the investments
369:15 - this is another five-fingered problem
369:18 - but it's different than the last one and
369:20 - that's because we are accumulating money
369:23 - we have twenty seven thousand now and it
369:25 - keeps on rising
369:27 - it starts at twenty thousand twenty
369:30 - seven thousand
369:32 - and at the end we will have more
369:34 - again if we're not told
369:37 - it's going to be ordinary but here it
369:40 - says end that's a key word that we're
369:42 - looking for an ordinary annuity
369:45 - finally we have we're going to make
369:47 - annual payments
369:50 - i'm just going to put that in here and
369:52 - we have it compounded annually
369:55 - so let's put that one down right over
369:57 - here for cy
370:00 - now let's go back to the beginning and
370:02 - put in all of the information we start
370:06 - 10 years
370:07 - n equals 10.
370:09 - 27 000. well that's how much money we
370:11 - have at the very beginning
370:14 - we're gonna add a thousand dollars at
370:15 - the end of each year this is a plus one
370:18 - thousand because our balance is growing
370:21 - the payment is adding to the present
370:22 - value
370:24 - how much money will we have well that
370:27 - means future value is compute and we
370:29 - know that this is ordinary so we keep
370:31 - begin off
370:33 - iy 4.8 and now we have enough
370:36 - information to begin
370:39 - putting this into the calculator we
370:41 - start with second py and we put in one
370:44 - check that py and cy are both the same
370:48 - n is ten
370:51 - i y was four point eight our present
370:54 - value that we started with was twenty
370:55 - seven thousand dollars
370:57 - our payment is one thousand dollars
371:02 - per year and we're computing the future
371:04 - value
371:05 - that gives us 55 000
371:14 - 610.68 cents
371:17 - i'm just going to show you that that
371:18 - algebra equation that we did at the
371:20 - beginning
371:21 - that actually works the same way so if i
371:24 - use that equation i've got payment
371:30 - 1
371:30 - plus
371:32 - i
371:33 - to the power of n minus 1 over i
371:40 - and then i'm going to add in that
371:41 - present
371:42 - value i'm going to calculate that 27 000
371:46 - separately
371:51 - trying that in a calculator you'll get
371:53 - the same answer so when we do one of
371:56 - these five fingered problems what we
371:58 - really have is two problems that are
372:00 - adding together
372:02 - we have an ordinary simple annuity with
372:04 - the present value equals zero and we
372:06 - have a compound interest problem
372:08 - and we add those together
372:11 - one of the advantages of a financial
372:13 - calculator is we don't have to
372:15 - explicitly do this
372:18 - general annuities
372:20 - you are shopping for a hundred thousand
372:22 - dollar mortgage and the bank has quoted
372:24 - you a rate of j two equals six percent
372:26 - you will make monthly payments for
372:28 - twenty years how much will your payments
372:29 - be
372:30 - again this is very typical of canadian
372:33 - mortgages we usually have c y equals two
372:37 - and p y equals 12.
372:40 - that makes this
372:41 - a general annuity
372:44 - because we have a mortgage we're taking
372:46 - a hundred thousand dollar loan that's
372:48 - our balance at the very beginning we
372:50 - want our balance to shrink it's an
372:52 - amortization and unlike a lease it
372:55 - doesn't say what our n value is how much
372:57 - we'll owe at the end it should be zero
373:00 - unless you're told otherwise assume that
373:02 - we pay off all of our loans completely
373:05 - our rate is j2 equals six percent
373:08 - and it's a mortgage so we're going to
373:10 - make the payment at the end of the month
373:12 - any money that we spend at the very
373:14 - beginning that's part of a down payment
373:18 - so this is an ordinary general
373:20 - amortization
373:22 - we've filled that in most of this while
373:24 - i've been talking
373:27 - and payment well that's what i'm trying
373:29 - to find
373:31 - finally we just have n and that's going
373:33 - to be 20 times 12
373:36 - that's important
373:40 - n always counts payments
373:44 - payments per year not compounding period
373:48 - so we're going to count how many
373:50 - payments we make over the lifetime of
373:52 - the mortgage which in the end is going
373:54 - to be
374:02 - 240 payments
374:08 - let's run this through
374:10 - we go into py and we set that equal to
374:13 - 12. when i scroll down you can see that
374:16 - cy has changed so i have to set it to be
374:18 - different when i scroll up you'll see
374:20 - when you set cy py doesn't change but
374:24 - when you set py cy changes
374:27 - i always scroll around to make sure that
374:30 - everything has worked correctly
374:34 - 100 000 present value zero is our future
374:38 - value compute that payment and i get an
374:41 - answer of 712 dollars
374:50 - and 19 cents we're gonna round out a
374:53 - little bit
374:54 - at the end
374:55 - let's talk a little bit more about
374:57 - general annuities
375:04 - when we're using those formulas
375:06 - what we do is we convert
375:10 - our interest rate
375:14 - to an equivalent one
375:21 - so that we have p y equals c y so what i
375:25 - would do here is i would say
375:29 - i've got j
375:31 - 2 equals 6 percent
375:36 - and i want to convert
375:38 - to j 12 equals something i'm going to do
375:41 - that so we go to second interest
375:43 - conversion our nominal rate is 6.
375:48 - cy is 2 i find that effective rate
375:52 - 6.09 so let's write
375:56 - what the effective rate is then i take
375:58 - that effective rate
376:00 - change cy again and go back to the
376:02 - nominal rate so this is what i would use
376:06 - in the calculation
376:08 - no rounding saving that entire thing
376:11 - that's how it works in a spreadsheet
376:14 - like excel and that's how it works with
376:15 - the formula
376:17 - we are lucky that we have a calculator
376:19 - that does that
376:22 - it's doing that under the hood
376:28 - and that's why we set it correctly so
376:30 - that we can use our technology correctly
376:38 - the important thing
376:40 - to always remember
376:43 - is that n counts payments
376:45 - not
376:46 - compounding periods
376:54 - so that's because things go together so
376:58 - if for example let's say a five-year
377:01 - mortgage
377:07 - monthly payments
377:12 - and j2 equals let's go with nine percent
377:16 - n is going to be 12 times 5
377:20 - 60 payments
377:23 - and it's not going to be 2 times 5
377:27 - equals 10 compounding periods and that's
377:29 - because your calculator is actually
377:31 - changing that interest rate
377:35 - i'm gonna put a big x on this so that
377:38 - everybody knows that that's not there
377:42 - question four you want to have
377:44 - accumulated four thousand dollars for
377:45 - your european trip four years from now
377:48 - if interest is six point four percent
377:50 - compounded monthly find the size of the
377:52 - quarterly deposits required for four
377:54 - years if deposits are made at the
377:56 - beginning of each quarter
377:58 - this time we're going to go through our
378:00 - question and fill out what's happening
378:01 - as we go you want to have accumulated
378:04 - well to me that makes this seem like an
378:07 - accumulation and it is we are saving
378:10 - money when we save money start with
378:12 - something positive add something
378:14 - positive end up with something negative
378:17 - what we want to accumulate is four
378:19 - thousand dollars
378:21 - think of that negative as in i'm gonna
378:22 - withdraw it
378:24 - four years from now
378:26 - i'm gonna put four years under n but
378:28 - we're gonna have to change that once we
378:30 - find out what p y and cy are
378:33 - if interest is 6.4 percent compounded
378:36 - monthly
378:37 - 6.4
378:39 - compounded monthly
378:41 - find the size of the quarterly deposits
378:44 - well py is four since those two are
378:47 - different we're working on a general
378:49 - annuity
378:50 - find the size of the quarterly deposits
378:53 - required for four years if deposits are
378:55 - made at the beginning of each quarter
378:58 - well beginning to me that looks like do
379:02 - and it is it's begin on
379:05 - so what i'm going to do is put begin
379:08 - on
379:10 - it doesn't say how much money i started
379:11 - with so we're going to assume we start
379:13 - with nothing
379:14 - our payment well that's what i'm going
379:16 - to compute
379:19 - so we have an accumulation that is a
379:22 - general annuity due
379:25 - let's go through the entry on this and
379:27 - i'm going to show you how to turn begin
379:29 - on in the calculator
379:31 - first let's go into our py and change it
379:34 - to 4
379:35 - but now our cy has changed so set it to
379:38 - b12
379:39 - again i like to scroll around the arrows
379:41 - a few times and make sure that
379:43 - everything is set the way i want before
379:44 - i clear out
379:46 - n was four years
379:48 - so n is going to be four years
379:52 - times four payments per year
379:57 - that means we're making 16 payments
380:02 - 16. the interest rate is 6.4
380:06 - the present value well we start with
380:08 - nothing
380:09 - payment that's what i'm trying to find
380:11 - and my future value is four thousand
380:13 - dollars i'm making that a negative
380:15 - because i will withdraw it
380:17 - begin
380:20 - above the payment button you'll see
380:22 - bgn that stands for begin so we go
380:25 - second
380:27 - payment or begin and then we press
380:29 - second set
380:31 - that turns begin mode on when begin mode
380:33 - is on you'll see that begin in the top
380:36 - of the calculator
380:38 - to turn it off you do the same thing
380:40 - second begin second set that set toggles
380:44 - through begin and end
380:47 - so here we've got begin
380:51 - now all i have to do is compute that
380:54 - payment and the payment
380:59 - is going to be 217.70
381:06 - i'm going to write that down
381:08 - second
381:11 - payment begin begin lives over the
381:13 - payment because it refers to the payment
381:16 - second
381:18 - set which lives above the enter
381:23 - you'll be doing this a lot
381:25 - end is the default mode
381:27 - and you can see that when we have end
381:29 - nothing shows up here when begin is on
381:32 - that makes it an annuity due
381:35 - five you deposit one thousand dollars at
381:37 - the end of each quarter into an account
381:39 - that pays j4 equals ten percent find the
381:42 - future value in one year
381:45 - let's go through this question we are
381:46 - depositing a thousand dollars so our
381:49 - balance is growing and we're depositing
381:51 - that at the end of each quarter
381:54 - end or begin off
381:56 - let's draw that in we put a thousand
381:59 - dollars
382:00 - in
382:03 - at the end of each quarter
382:06 - and at the end how much money do we have
382:10 - we're going to assume we start with
382:11 - nothing
382:12 - j4 equals 10 percent
382:15 - 4
382:16 - 10 and we're making quarterly payments
382:20 - first of all we're accumulating money
382:22 - our balance is growing
382:25 - we're making our payments at the end of
382:27 - the month so this is an ordinary annuity
382:30 - finally py equals cy this is just a
382:33 - simple ordinary annuity same as we have
382:37 - had many times before
382:40 - look at my calculator note that begin is
382:42 - still on from the last thing i did so
382:44 - i'm going to start by going second begin
382:47 - second set and clearing that making sure
382:50 - it's not on there then i'm going to fill
382:52 - in everything in the calculator
382:55 - making sure that py and cy are the same
382:58 - uh n is
383:00 - four quarters in one year
383:04 - 10 iy our payment is a thousand dollars
383:09 - and we started with nothing and i'm
383:11 - computing how much money we have at the
383:13 - end
383:14 - i get
383:16 - a future value of four one five
383:20 - two point five two
383:23 - that's how much money i have at the end
383:29 - let's do it again
383:30 - b you make the deposits at the beginning
383:32 - of the quarter how much money will you
383:34 - have at the end of the year
383:35 - draw this in and show you that it looks
383:39 - very similar except one payment
383:42 - comes in right now at today and the last
383:45 - payment comes in at three quarters and
383:47 - we're still trying to find the future
383:49 - value at one year
383:51 - i'm still accumulating but now
383:56 - this is an annuity do it's still simple
383:59 - in fact everything else remains exactly
384:02 - the same as it was before
384:05 - the only difference is this begin toggle
384:08 - i usually write on to mean beginners on
384:11 - off for end but you can write begin and
384:13 - end or do in ordinary
384:16 - everything's still in my calculator so
384:18 - all i have to do is go second
384:20 - payment sorry
384:22 - i have now set that payment wrong a
384:24 - thousand dollar payment
384:27 - second begin
384:30 - second set to turn it on now everything
384:33 - is exactly the same and all i have to do
384:35 - is compute that future value which is
384:37 - similar
384:39 - let's scroll down and write down our
384:41 - future value
384:46 - 4256.32 cents it's similar but it's
384:49 - bigger that's because
384:51 - our payments had a little bit more time
384:54 - to grow because i started earlier
384:56 - how much money do i have in three months
385:01 - what about in three months
385:03 - this time i'm going to take my initial
385:05 - answer from a
385:09 - and see what happens three months after
385:12 - the scenario from a
385:14 - ends so at the fifth quarter
385:16 - so i'm going to just use my equations
385:20 - here instead of the compound
385:22 - using the calculator but you can do
385:24 - whichever you would like to do
385:29 - so we've got four thousand one hundred
385:31 - fifty two dollars and fifty two cents
385:33 - and we're going to invest that at two
385:35 - and a half percent per quarter that's
385:38 - ten divided by four for only one quarter
385:41 - when i run that through a calculator
385:49 - i end up with
385:51 - four thousand
385:52 - two hundred and fifty six dollars and
385:54 - thirty three cents
385:56 - this
385:57 - is round off error from the fact that i
386:00 - rounded this 4 152
386:03 - in fact
386:05 - when you take your ordinary annuity and
386:07 - multiply it by one plus i you get the
386:10 - same value as the annuity do
386:13 - question six you begin a savings plan at
386:16 - the beginning of each month you deposit
386:18 - 250 dollars into an account that pays
386:21 - j-12 equals nine percent how much money
386:24 - will you have after five years
386:26 - this is a savings or accumulation i'm
386:29 - going to go ahead and put in my signs
386:33 - present value and payment will be
386:34 - positive future value will be negative
386:37 - at the beginning of each month
386:40 - begin is on
386:43 - that makes this an annuity do
386:45 - you deposit 250
386:48 - balance is growing and it's the
386:50 - beginning of each month so our payment
386:53 - is monthly into an account that pays j12
386:56 - equals nine percent
386:58 - j 12
386:59 - equals nine percent p y and cy are the
387:02 - same that makes this a simple annuity do
387:06 - and it's an accumulation
387:08 - how much money will you have after five
387:10 - years well five times 12
387:13 - is 60. we make 60 payments
387:16 - it doesn't say anything about starting
387:18 - with money
387:19 - but it does ask how much we'll have at
387:21 - the end
387:24 - notice that my calculator says begin
387:26 - already
387:27 - so i could change that if i didn't want
387:29 - it second begin
387:31 - second set
387:32 - i want the begin to be turned on
387:35 - let's go into py and set it to be 12.
387:38 - check that cy is also 12 and clear out
387:43 - 60 is n
387:47 - 9 is iy
387:49 - 0 is present value 250 is payment and
387:54 - i'm going to compute the future value
387:56 - which is
388:01 - 18
388:03 - 997 and 45 cents so i have 18
388:09 - 997 dollars and 45 cents
388:13 - let's see how much interest we made
388:18 - that's going to be money
388:21 - out how much money we took out
388:24 - minus how much money we deposited
388:30 - so when i put this in i took out
388:33 - eighteen thousand nine hundred and
388:35 - eighty seven dollars and forty five
388:37 - cents and we put in sixty payments
388:40 - of two hundred and fifty dollars
388:45 - so 60 times 250
388:49 - well that was 15 000 dollars
389:00 - which means that we have
389:04 - 3997.45 cents that we've made in
389:07 - interest
389:09 - we looked at a lot of different types of
389:11 - annuities today we've seen annuities
389:13 - that are accumulation and amortization
389:16 - annuities that are ordinary and
389:17 - annuities that are due as well as simple
389:20 - and general annuities
389:23 - i'm going to conclude by writing in all
389:25 - of our calculator things again
389:29 - py counts the number of payments
389:33 - cy counts the number of compounding
389:40 - periods the important thing here is that
389:44 - n is going to be
389:46 - p y
389:47 - times years so i'm going to put that in
389:49 - a different color n counts payments not
389:53 - compounding periods
389:56 - when we have something like a j m
389:59 - we put that in i y
390:01 - and the m is the same as the compounding
390:03 - period
390:05 - when these things are the same
390:10 - that's called simple
390:12 - and when they're not the same
390:15 - we call that general
390:20 - present value
390:22 - i like to always make it positive
390:26 - our future value then
390:28 - can just go ahead and be negative
390:31 - our payment
390:34 - is going to be
390:36 - positive when our balance is growing
390:40 - and negative when our balance is
390:42 - shrinking
390:45 - and that's going to be an accumulation
390:49 - or an
390:50 - amortization we can do this opposite
390:54 - minus
390:55 - minus plus
391:01 - and then this would end up being a plus
391:04 - i'm going to go ahead and say there is
391:06 - an exception to this
391:08 - but in general present value and future
391:10 - value tend to be the opposite in the
391:12 - simple situations we go over in this
391:14 - class
391:15 - begin
391:16 - when begin is on
391:18 - it's an annuity due and we begin as off
391:21 - it's an ordinary
391:24 - and when it's off we call that end mode
391:27 - you can see there's an end showing up on
391:28 - my calculator
391:30 - again
391:31 - when we do an annuity
391:34 - we always look
391:35 - is it an accumulation
391:38 - or is it an amortization
391:42 - is it ordinary
391:44 - is it due
391:46 - is it simple
391:48 - or is it general
391:52 - these are the three questions we ask
391:54 - ourselves when we start doing an annuity
391:56 - problem
391:58 - lesson 14 deferred and back-to-back
392:00 - annuities today we're going to do a
392:02 - series of two-step problems these
392:05 - problems are going to have two parts to
392:07 - them in some of them the first part is
392:10 - going to be a compound interest problem
392:12 - we call that a deferred annuity and in
392:14 - some of them the first and the second
392:16 - are both going to be different types of
392:18 - annuities we call those back-to-back
392:20 - annuities let's jump right in with a
392:22 - problem
392:23 - you plan to retire in 21 years
392:26 - you will need 25 annual payments of
392:29 - thirty thousand dollars with the first
392:30 - payment to be received in twenty one
392:32 - years
392:33 - interest is calculated at ten percent
392:35 - effective
392:36 - and this is of course an approximation
392:38 - because interest rates won't stay the
392:40 - same for 46 years but we usually pretend
392:43 - they will in order to do calculations
392:45 - a how much money should we set aside for
392:47 - our retirement
392:48 - i've started this with a timeline and
392:50 - i've already drawn it in
392:52 - it has two parts to it one let's go to
392:55 - 21
392:56 - years when our first
393:00 - payment happens
393:04 - and then it keeps on going until our
393:07 - last payment which is going to be at 45
393:10 - because that will give us 25 annual
393:13 - payments one at one one at two all the
393:16 - way to twenty five
393:18 - today we're going to put some money in
393:22 - so let's put some money in this today
393:26 - and then
393:28 - i'm going to circle this because this is
393:29 - a very key point we're going to invest
393:32 - it for 21 years
393:34 - and then we're going to start pulling
393:36 - money out
393:38 - so we have two problems here
393:40 - problem one is a compound interest
393:43 - problem
393:48 - and problem two is an annuity it's not
393:52 - just any type of the annuity it's an
393:54 - annuity due because it starts right at
393:57 - the beginning at 21 and it is possible
393:59 - to set this up so that it starts at 20
394:03 - but
394:04 - in this case it seems to make more sense
394:06 - to start at 21. so compound interest
394:10 - let's look at our values we start off
394:12 - with
394:13 - i don't know how much money
394:16 - i make payments of well nothing because
394:19 - it's a compound interest problem at the
394:21 - end of the day i have
394:23 - some money i don't exactly know how much
394:27 - let's change this color here to make it
394:28 - more exciting
394:30 - at the beginning of this annuity which
394:32 - is exactly at 21 i have
394:36 - however much money i saved in the first
394:38 - compound interest problem
394:41 - my payments
394:43 - well those are going to be 30 000 and
394:45 - i'm going to make that negative because
394:47 - we can see that they're coming out of
394:49 - our account i'm going to start writing
394:51 - 30k so i don't have to write a bunch of
394:54 - zeros
394:56 - and our future value well that's gonna
394:58 - be zero unless we're told otherwise
395:01 - always assume that we have no money left
395:03 - at the end of one of these problems
395:05 - so we have to solve these one at a time
395:13 - and here
395:15 - we have two unknowns here
395:18 - two and here we only have one unknown so
395:21 - we're gonna start
395:23 - with two because we only have the one
395:26 - unknown
395:28 - so let's start by drawing in
395:32 - our calculator buttons
395:36 - okay all nicely drawn very fast
395:39 - we're going to start with number two
395:42 - so i'm going to put a 2 in here
395:44 - in this whole problem our py and cy are
395:47 - both one that makes these a simple
395:50 - annuity because everything in sight is
395:53 - annual and our interest rate is 10. this
395:56 - annuity goes on for 25 years or 25
395:59 - payments i want to figure out what the
396:01 - present value is my payment will be
396:04 - thirty thousand dollars and my future
396:06 - value is zero it's an annuity due so i
396:09 - need to make sure that begin is turned
396:11 - on i usually like to do that first
396:14 - so let's turn that on here and now let's
396:17 - put in the rest
396:18 - p y and c y are both one again i always
396:21 - check that they both entered properly
396:24 - interest rate is 10
396:26 - present value is what i'm going to find
396:29 - should i get that 25n
396:32 - yep i have these in the wrong order i'm
396:34 - gonna go ahead and
396:35 - fix that because it's going to confuse
396:37 - me
396:43 - better
396:44 - i y present value our payment is thirty
396:47 - thousand dollars negative and our future
396:50 - value ends up being zero so we're going
396:51 - to compute that present value and we get
396:55 - 299.542.32
396:59 - what that means is the day we retire
397:06 - i'm going to say we
397:07 - could be you
397:10 - we need to have saved
397:15 - a lot of money
397:17 - 299
397:19 - 542 and 32 cents
397:21 - that could be around thirty thousand
397:24 - dollars
397:25 - so let's look at saving that much
397:32 - so what we're going to do now is part
397:34 - one of our problem so part one let's
397:37 - just scroll up to look at that is a
397:39 - compound interest problem where i'm
397:41 - trying to figure out how much money to
397:42 - put in
397:44 - zero payments begin doesn't matter when
397:47 - the payment is zero dollars it doesn't
397:49 - matter if i put zero dollars in my
397:50 - account at the beginning or the end of
397:52 - the year so i can just leave that alone
397:55 - we know that n is 21.
397:59 - future value is 299 000. the easiest way
398:02 - to do this
398:07 - is while it's showing up on my screen i
398:10 - press that negative sign and now i just
398:12 - press future value and it's stored in
398:15 - there so let's go ahead and change
398:17 - everything begin doesn't matter so i'm
398:19 - going to leave it pycy should stay the
398:22 - same
398:23 - n is now 21.
398:26 - our interest rate recall iy is still 10.
398:29 - our payment is zero that's an important
398:31 - one remember our future value has
398:33 - changed so let's compute that present
398:35 - value and we find out
398:43 - that we need to invest 40 000
398:47 - 477
398:49 - and 32 cents right now
398:53 - if we do that
398:55 - we put 40 000 in today
398:58 - we will have enough so that we can have
399:00 - 30 000 a year
399:02 - for twenty five years
399:13 - so thirty thousand per year
399:18 - that is great
399:21 - in part a of this question we figured
399:23 - out that if we can
399:25 - save forty thousand dollars right now
399:27 - put that in the bank today then we're
399:29 - fine to retire
399:31 - the problem is i don't actually have
399:33 - forty thousand dollars to invest so
399:36 - instead of making one payment right here
399:38 - at the beginning what we're going to do
399:40 - is put 21 payments in starting today
399:46 - so i'm gonna put in a payment every year
399:49 - and we're talk and
399:51 - save slowly over 21 years so that i will
399:55 - be able to get that thirty thousand
399:58 - dollars at the end
400:00 - let's look at this again as a two-step
400:02 - problem
400:04 - step one
400:06 - this is now an annuity do
400:11 - and it's an accumulation because we're
400:13 - saving
400:15 - it's also still going to be simple
400:17 - because j1 is still 10
400:21 - and py is going to be 1 for everything
400:24 - so everything in sight will be simple so
400:27 - now i've got an annuity due that is an
400:28 - accumulation
400:31 - i'm not going to save any money at the
400:33 - beginning
400:35 - but i am going to start putting in
400:37 - payments
400:38 - and at the end i will have
400:40 - well we actually know that so put a pin
400:43 - in that for one minute
400:45 - let's look at number two this is the
400:47 - same thing
400:50 - and i'm going to write here that this is
400:51 - an amortization
400:53 - often these back-to-back problems are
400:55 - one accumulation followed by an
400:56 - amortization a retirement scheme has us
401:00 - save save saving spend spend spending
401:04 - so we know at the end we have nothing we
401:07 - know what the payments are
401:09 - they are thirty thousand dollars and
401:11 - they're negative because it's an
401:12 - amortization and actually we know what
401:15 - the money is that we should be saving
401:18 - it is 299 000.
401:24 - because we've done that already so
401:27 - that's really useful that means that
401:30 - we've already done half this problem
401:34 - in general it's important to save all of
401:37 - our intermediate values so if i go back
401:39 - to that future value we're going to use
401:41 - that i'm going to store that in one just
401:44 - so i have it just in case
401:46 - even though we've already done
401:48 - the second annuity i'm going to still
401:50 - rewrite this so we can see everything
401:52 - all together remember it was a 21-year
401:55 - annuity we were computing the present
401:58 - value we were taking 30 000 out zero
402:01 - begin was on we computed that
402:05 - and we got
402:07 - 299 etc
402:10 - then we're going to go ahead and do
402:12 - number one
402:13 - this is also a simple annuity p y and cy
402:17 - equals 1. now our n is still 25 and our
402:20 - interest rate is 10 but our present
402:22 - value is going to be zero and we're
402:24 - going to be computing those intermediate
402:25 - payments the amount of money we need is
402:28 - still negative 299.54
402:33 - and begin is still on
402:35 - so looking at this it's almost exactly
402:38 - what we did last time only we're
402:40 - switching the present value and future
402:42 - value we can just go ahead and check our
402:44 - pycy we know that stays the same
402:47 - n should still be 25 our iy has stayed
402:50 - the same but our present value is now
402:53 - zero and our payment is what we're going
402:55 - to find so future value is still
402:57 - negative 299 and you can see there that
402:59 - that begin is on so i'm going to compute
403:02 - the payment
403:07 - 4
403:08 - 254
403:09 - and 70 cents
403:11 - that's not so bad that's how much money
403:13 - we need to save annually starting today
403:19 - so let's write that down
403:28 - so if we have 4 200
403:30 - and we think we can come up with that
403:32 - every year we will have enough to retire
403:36 - let's start looking at some interest
403:42 - let's look at interest
403:44 - instead of just part a i'm actually
403:46 - going to start with b
403:47 - sorry start with a
403:52 - our interest is going to be the money
403:54 - out minus money n so we took out
403:58 - 30 000
404:00 - and we did 25 of those payments
404:06 - and we put in
404:07 - well we know how much we put in we put
404:09 - in exactly forty thousand four seven
404:12 - seven and thirty two cents
404:14 - note
404:15 - nowhere do i see that intermediate 299
404:18 - thousand dollars that's because i didn't
404:20 - actually withdraw or deposit that i left
404:24 - it in the bank so it doesn't end up
404:25 - being part of this interest calculation
404:29 - 30 000 times 25 well that's 750 000 and
404:33 - let's subtract
404:35 - 4477
404:37 - and 32 cents
404:38 - well i've made quite a lot of interest
404:40 - there
404:41 - 709
404:43 - 522 and 68 cents and that's because i
404:46 - have a lot of time we have 45 years on
404:49 - this scenario that's a lot of time to
404:52 - save and we end up with a lot of
404:53 - interest especially at 10
404:56 - which would probably be an average
405:00 - in b this is almost going to be the same
405:02 - except now
405:04 - i'm still putting in that same
405:06 - 30 000 times 25 but i'm putting in
405:11 - 21 payments of 4 200.
405:18 - so looking at this let's go back to 30
405:20 - 000
405:22 - times 25
405:24 - we're going to subtract
405:26 - 21 times
405:28 - 4254.7
405:32 - and that leaves us with 660
405:36 - 651
405:38 - and 30 cents
405:40 - not as much as an a because we didn't
405:42 - put the money in the whole time but
405:44 - still quite a lot of money
405:48 - i'm leaving this last part up to you i
405:51 - would like you to finish this question
405:54 - noting that the answers are at the back
405:59 - knowing that in this case instead of
406:02 - making our payments starting today we're
406:05 - going to start in one year our last
406:07 - payment goes in at 21 and our 30 000
406:11 - payments still come out at the same time
406:15 - in this case
406:17 - let's put our last 30 000 payment
406:20 - this is going to be an ordinary annuity
406:28 - and the second one is going to be an
406:30 - annuity due
406:32 - so the second annuity stays exactly like
406:34 - it was before but this time the first
406:36 - one is an ordinary annuity the answers
406:39 - are
406:40 - going to be they're in the handout at
406:43 - the beginning of this chapter
406:45 - and we will go over this in lab
406:48 - you are saving money for your retirement
406:51 - starting in six months and for five
406:53 - years you invest fifteen hundred dollars
406:55 - every six months in a mutual fund that
406:56 - pays six percent compounded
406:58 - semi-annually after five years the rate
407:01 - drops to four point eight percent
407:02 - compounded quarterly and you decide to
407:04 - deposit a thousand dollars every quarter
407:06 - for another five years how much money
407:08 - will you have at the end of the ten
407:09 - years
407:10 - this is another back-to-back annuity but
407:12 - in this one they're both going to be
407:15 - accumulations because we keep on saving
407:18 - we're never going to amortize or take
407:20 - money out of that account
407:24 - that's good to note in our first one it
407:27 - is going to be every half year and we're
407:29 - going to start in
407:31 - six months
407:33 - one year
407:35 - 1.5 all the way 4.5 so for every six
407:39 - months we're going to start depositing
407:41 - money i'm going to draw that in we're
407:43 - going to deposit 1500
407:48 - and our last deposit is going to go in
407:51 - right at that five years
407:55 - after this it's going to drop to
407:56 - quarterly so let's do a quarter
408:00 - half three quarters six years etc etc
408:04 - all the way up to 10 years and that's a
408:07 - quarter less than that so nine and three
408:10 - quarter of a year
408:12 - here we're going to be putting in a
408:14 - thousand dollars each quarter
408:19 - and it's going to be at the end of the
408:20 - quarter because we're not putting it in
408:22 - twice at a time when we're not told
408:24 - we're always putting it in at the end
408:27 - let's look at our two annuities
408:30 - one this is still an annuity but because
408:33 - it starts six months from now it's an
408:35 - ordinary annuity
408:40 - okay we start with no money
408:44 - we put in
408:46 - fifteen hundred dollars
408:49 - every
408:50 - six months and at the end we have
408:54 - something
408:55 - let's look at the second one
408:57 - over here
408:59 - at the beginning of the second five
409:01 - years and this is the important time
409:03 - we have
409:05 - some money the present value of that
409:08 - second annuity is equal to the future
409:10 - value of the first and this is almost
409:12 - always true in back-to-back annuities
409:15 - because this one starts at the end of
409:16 - the quarter it's still an ordinary
409:19 - annuity
409:21 - now we have payments
409:23 - of a thousand dollars
409:26 - and at the end we have
409:28 - money
409:30 - looking over here we've got two unknowns
409:35 - future value and present value so we
409:37 - can't do anything here we have only one
409:39 - unknown that's why we're going to start
409:41 - with number one
409:45 - okay we're gonna put everything in our
409:47 - calculator and i'm gonna start with one
409:50 - i like to label these so i know which
409:52 - one is which in this case
409:54 - the payments are semi-annual
409:57 - and the compounding looks like it's
409:59 - semi-annual and you can even write the
410:01 - compounding up here on the timeline if
410:04 - you think that makes things easier j4
410:06 - equals 4.8
410:08 - i think it does
410:10 - so in here i'm gonna put six percent and
410:13 - my n is going to be five years
410:16 - times twice a year so ten
410:21 - my present value well that's going to be
410:23 - zero because i start with nothing but
410:25 - we're putting fifteen hundred dollars in
410:28 - the future value that's what we're going
410:30 - to try to find and begin is off
410:34 - so let's go through the calculator i'm
410:36 - going to start by turning off the begin
410:40 - because this is an ordinary annuity
410:43 - now we're going to set py
410:47 - and you are welcome to fast forward if
410:50 - you're tired of watching me put stuff in
410:52 - a calculator
410:54 - fascinating
410:55 - zero present value 1500 that's positive
410:58 - because we're accumulating and i'm going
411:00 - to compute our future value so 17 000
411:04 - ish i'm going to write that right in
411:12 - i'm going to store this
411:14 - because i might need it for later i
411:16 - don't know i i personally do but you
411:18 - wouldn't know it's always good to store
411:20 - those intermediate values
411:23 - now let's start setting up annuity
411:25 - number two this one is quarterly
411:28 - payments but also quarterly compounding
411:30 - and our interest rate is 4.8 it's going
411:33 - to be five times four so we've got 20
411:36 - payments and our present value is 17 195
411:40 - and 81 cents
411:42 - payment is a thousand
411:44 - future value is a compute and our begin
411:46 - is still going to be off so let's put
411:49 - input things into the calculator make
411:52 - this positive now that's the present
411:54 - value starting at the side i have p y c
411:57 - y is 4
411:59 - our n is now 20 important 4.8 is the
412:04 - interest rate the present value we've
412:06 - done payment is a thousand
412:09 - and the future value is what we're
412:10 - trying to compute we end up with an
412:13 - answer
412:14 - of 44 000 dollars
412:21 - forty four thousand two hundred and
412:22 - eighty one dollars and eighty three
412:23 - cents that's how much money we have
412:25 - let's pretend we take that out of the
412:27 - bank let's find out how much interest we
412:29 - made
412:31 - so our interest is money out
412:34 - minus money in
412:38 - in this case we took out our savings our
412:41 - life savings of forty four thousand two
412:43 - hundred eighty one dollars and eighty
412:45 - three cents
412:46 - we put in 10 payments of 1500
412:50 - and we put in 20 payments of a thousand
412:54 - running that through a calculator we've
412:56 - actually made
412:58 - quite a lot of interest
413:02 - which is ninety two hundred dollars
413:10 - so nine thousand two hundred eighty one
413:11 - dollars and eighty three cents follow
413:14 - along on your calculator to make sure
413:16 - you get the right answers
413:19 - question three you would like to save
413:20 - enough to take a two year sabbatical in
413:22 - 15 years starting today you make your
413:25 - first of 180 monthly deposits of 500
413:28 - into an account that pays j12 equals
413:30 - nine percent
413:32 - write that in here
413:34 - one month after making your last deposit
413:36 - you take your first of 24 monthly
413:37 - payments find the size of these payments
413:40 - this is again
413:42 - a back-to-back annuity problem so i'm
413:45 - going to reiterate the important things
413:46 - that we need to do one is we have to
413:49 - draw a timeline and having a focal date
413:52 - and circling it
413:53 - right here on it is going to be really
413:56 - important in getting this right i'm
413:58 - going to take the time to identify our
414:00 - annuities and store all of our
414:01 - intermediate values and an important
414:04 - thing is to pay really close attention
414:06 - to the begin and end on our calculator
414:08 - so let's start by drawing in things
414:11 - first of all 15 years is when we start
414:13 - and it's a two year
414:16 - sabbatical so and we're going to start
414:18 - making monthly everything is monthly
414:22 - that's okay we can just put in little
414:24 - dashes for months and we know what that
414:26 - means
414:27 - starting today i'm going to make my
414:28 - first payment so i'm going to say that
414:31 - this is right away
414:33 - and it is five hundred dollars
414:37 - if i start today then i'm going to end
414:40 - one month before 15 years from now
414:43 - that's going to give me the right number
414:45 - of payments which is 180.
414:48 - because i'm starting right away i'm
414:50 - going to note that this is an annuity
414:52 - deal
414:54 - and that's annuity number one for new
414:57 - need number two
414:59 - well one month after i make my last
415:02 - deposit
415:03 - that's going to be exactly at 15
415:06 - i'm going to start taking out my
415:09 - 24 monthly payments and those well i
415:13 - don't know what they are but i do know
415:14 - that at the end of this i'm not going to
415:16 - have any money so this is also an
415:19 - annuity due
415:22 - let's look at the steps of these and
415:24 - these are both simple annuities and what
415:27 - we have is we have an accumulation
415:32 - we accumulate accumulate save save save
415:34 - and then we spend spend spend
415:38 - knowing this is going to get our signs
415:39 - correct
415:41 - starting well i'm going to assume
415:43 - because i didn't say anything about this
415:45 - i have no money at the beginning we
415:47 - could have started with something and
415:48 - then it would be as easy as putting that
415:50 - number in
415:52 - i'm going to start making payments of
415:53 - 500
415:55 - and at the end i will have
415:57 - something
415:59 - second annuity i'm going to start with
416:02 - well that same something i had last time
416:04 - because those are at the same points
416:06 - this is two
416:09 - my payment in this annuity is going to
416:10 - be
416:11 - something and my future value at the end
416:14 - will be zero because i'm going to spend
416:16 - all of that money
416:17 - two unknowns here
416:19 - one unknown here means i should start
416:21 - with one
416:24 - you'll probably get sick of drawing the
416:26 - same thing out over and over again but
416:29 - i've found when i don't write it and
416:30 - when i don't do it in the right order
416:32 - which i occasionally do
416:34 - i start making mistakes so putting
416:36 - everything in the calculator writing it
416:38 - out really helps us not make mistakes
416:41 - i'm gonna start with annuity one
416:43 - everything here is going to be monthly
416:46 - my n well that's 180 because it's
416:50 - written in there and that's 15 times 12.
416:53 - the interest rate is 9 for the entire
416:55 - time start with nothing and i put in 500
416:59 - and then we're going to figure out the
417:00 - future value
417:01 - begin is on
417:03 - i'm going to go ahead and start filling
417:05 - in the second annuity as well
417:08 - and i like to sometimes set these up
417:09 - before i even start so everything is
417:11 - very quick 24 monthly payments
417:15 - my present value is going to be this
417:17 - number i'll put that in there and here
417:20 - that's what i'm going to be computing
417:22 - and i'll end up with nothing and it's
417:23 - still an annuity due
417:26 - starting with this
417:29 - and again fast forward if you're really
417:31 - good at putting stuff in your calculator
417:33 - 12 i check that that's correct
417:36 - uh n is 180
417:39 - i y is
417:40 - 9. present value zero
417:44 - payment is five hundred dollars
417:47 - future value is what i'm computing and
417:50 - begin mode is not on so let's go to set
417:53 - make sure that begin mode is on now i
417:55 - can compute the future value and what
417:57 - i'm going to end up with is
418:00 - let's use a different color why not
418:03 - i apologize if you are colorblind and
418:06 - cannot see all my beautiful colors it's
418:08 - okay
418:09 - 190 000 621 and 91 cents i'm gonna store
418:14 - this again store one because i might
418:16 - need it later
418:18 - but i'm also going to just go ahead
418:21 - and
418:23 - plus minus put that right into present
418:25 - value
418:29 - that's very useful okay let's do the
418:31 - second annuity 12 should stay the same
418:34 - but n is now 24.
418:38 - i usually press recall and then i y to
418:40 - make sure that it's correct and then i
418:42 - haven't done anything recall present
418:44 - value is correct
418:46 - recall payment well i don't even know
418:48 - about payment so i'm going to leave that
418:49 - alone and i'm going to make sure that my
418:52 - future value is zero begin is still on
418:56 - so compute
418:58 - the payment
419:00 - i get 8
419:01 - 643.68
419:12 - so we need
419:14 - actually not we need we will have
419:20 - eight thousand six four three point
419:22 - sixty eight sixty nine
419:26 - per month that's a pretty
419:28 - good amount to live off of
419:34 - let's look at part b
419:36 - i've actually just copied everything we
419:38 - just did and i'm going to redo it except
419:41 - now
419:42 - two months after making our last deposit
419:45 - that means instead of having a payment
419:48 - come out here at 15 our first payment
419:50 - comes out one
419:52 - month later and our last payment comes
419:55 - out here
419:56 - what does that do well that makes this
419:59 - an ordinary annuity let's erase that and
420:02 - i'm going to use another color
420:04 - this time it's an ordinary
420:08 - annuity what else changes the first part
420:11 - doesn't change at all
420:13 - still in amortization everything is the
420:16 - same except for
420:21 - this begin right over here all we're
420:24 - going to do to make this different
420:27 - is change this to off i'm going to
420:30 - highlight these changes that's it
420:34 - all we've done here is change one button
420:38 - that means that everything is already
420:40 - properly stored in my calculator so if i
420:42 - go to second
420:44 - begin
420:45 - second set and turn that begin mode off
420:48 - and now i'm going to recompute that
420:50 - payment with everything identical i get
420:52 - the correct answer
420:58 - we will have
421:00 - eight thousand seven hundred eight
421:02 - dollars and fifty one cents per month
421:06 - if we start one month later
421:12 - so these questions are almost the same
421:15 - the only difference was in that begin on
421:18 - or begin off
421:20 - let's summarize what we've done today on
421:23 - back-to-back and deferred annuities
421:26 - these are two-step problems
421:30 - in order to get them correct we are
421:32 - going to have to take our time
421:35 - and write things out
421:37 - having graded
421:39 - about
421:41 - 5000 tests testing this
421:44 - draw a timeline when people don't draw a
421:47 - timeline and take the time to label it
421:49 - correctly they usually make a mistake
421:52 - circle that focal date that's an
421:54 - important day
422:02 - let's identify those annuities and those
422:06 - annuities the first one can often be a
422:08 - compound interest problem
422:11 - we do it in the same way we just have
422:13 - payment equals zero
422:21 - so we look for the problem with only one
422:24 - unknown
422:32 - and that's the one we're going to solve
422:34 - first
422:35 - if we have something with two unknowns
422:37 - then we should solve that one second
422:38 - because we won't be able to do it
422:40 - an important point we're going to store
422:42 - those intermediate values
422:49 - with their decimals because we keep
422:51 - those unless we're taking money out and
422:53 - putting it in a different bank we can
422:55 - carry all those decimals with us
422:57 - pay really close attention
423:00 - to begin and end
423:04 - so write that down on your piece of
423:06 - paper put that in your calculator make
423:09 - sure you do that
423:12 - think about your counting
423:18 - and at the end of the day an important
423:20 - thing is to remember that interest
423:24 - is the money you withdraw
423:27 - minus the money that you put in
423:30 - that's the same as money paid minus
423:32 - money borrowed out and in are just
423:35 - expressions
423:39 - but if we're borrowing money we usually
423:41 - write it this way
423:44 - intermediate values
423:50 - don't go in here
423:56 - that's an important
423:57 - thing
423:59 - to
424:00 - note
424:03 - and actually i'm going to write one more
424:05 - thing
424:08 - round your payments
424:10 - because we're going to put in a bunch of
424:12 - payments but we have to round to the
424:14 - nearest set because we can't put in a
424:16 - half a cent
424:20 - lesson 15 bonds perpetuities and stocks
424:23 - we're going to start by learning about
424:25 - coupon bonds and i should put
424:28 - a date on this
424:33 - when governments and companies want to
424:35 - raise money sometimes they issue things
424:38 - called bonds
424:40 - this bond
424:41 - has a face value of one thousand dollars
424:45 - and i'm going to explain what that means
424:48 - as we go
424:50 - what that means is you buy actually i'm
424:53 - gonna write down the coupon rate
424:56 - is at six percent
425:02 - okay
425:06 - you buy this bond
425:08 - for one thousand dollars
425:12 - for however long the time period is
425:16 - every six months and bonds tend to be
425:19 - semi-annual
425:22 - you get a coupon payment
425:28 - or your interest
425:30 - is calculated and sent to you
425:33 - so we're not compounding the interest
425:36 - the person who owns the bond is getting
425:38 - that interest i've written this as an
425:40 - old-fashioned coupon bond where there's
425:42 - literally a bunch of coupons and when
425:44 - you pull them off you get money
425:47 - at the end of the time period
425:50 - and that here is going to be in december
425:53 - 2025
425:56 - you get your thousand dollars back
425:58 - so the money
426:00 - the interest is being calculated every
426:02 - six months and you get that
426:08 - so this bond has a face value of a
426:10 - thousand dollars a coupon rate of six
426:12 - percent compounded semi-annually and it
426:14 - has a maturity of 10 years that means
426:18 - that for 10 years you get these payments
426:21 - what's the semi-annual coupon payment
426:24 - for this we're just coming up with the
426:26 - interest after one half year or the
426:28 - simple interest
426:30 - so the coupon payment
426:35 - is really the interest accrued in one
426:37 - period
426:44 - or here it's going to be six months and
426:46 - i'm going to say that often bonds are
426:48 - semi-annual
426:50 - so our interest here
426:52 - is going to be i equals prt because
426:56 - we're just using simple interest
426:59 - our interest
427:00 - is going to be the principal that's a
427:02 - thousand dollars
427:04 - the rate well that's just going to be
427:06 - the periodic rate so if it's six percent
427:09 - divided by two
427:12 - and t well that's where that divided by
427:15 - two comes from
427:17 - so six months for one or is it 0.06
427:20 - times a half
427:22 - that's 30
427:24 - and that's where i got this 30
427:26 - up here
427:27 - so every six months you get a check in
427:29 - the mail for 30 dollars
427:34 - let's look at this bond in a timeline
427:37 - so
427:38 - this goes on for 10 years and every six
427:41 - months we get a payment so i'm gonna put
427:44 - in a payment of thirty dollars
427:47 - thirty dollars
427:48 - every six months starting
427:51 - from there we get thirty dollars at the
427:54 - very end we still get thirty dollars but
427:56 - we also get a thousand dollars
428:00 - this is in fact an ordinary annuity
428:05 - how much did we pay for this originally
428:07 - we paid one thousand dollars the face
428:10 - value
428:12 - the interesting thing here comes when we
428:14 - don't keep it for the full 10 years
428:16 - bonds are financial instrument just like
428:18 - stocks and we can sell them on the open
428:20 - market on the bond market in this case
428:23 - it's usually useful to calculate what we
428:25 - call fair market value
428:29 - so
428:31 - fair market value
428:36 - how much somebody else would pay for the
428:37 - bond
428:44 - so right now
428:46 - it's three years later so that means i'm
428:48 - just gonna write in seven years are left
428:52 - anybody can go and buy a similar bond
428:55 - the same type of bond at eight percent
428:58 - so how much
428:59 - do you think somebody would pay for our
429:01 - bond which is in fact at six percent
429:05 - so this is what we're going to be
429:08 - computing
429:09 - so looking at this we have the exact
429:11 - same timeline
429:17 - except for the fact that we only have
429:19 - seven years remaining three years have
429:22 - already happened so the timeline here
429:24 - just has to do with the fact that
429:26 - there's only seven years left
429:30 - looking at this this is an ordinary
429:32 - annuity
429:34 - ordinary begin is off it's also simple
429:38 - because
429:40 - looks like our interest rate is eight
429:42 - percent compounded semi-annually and our
429:44 - coupon payments are semi-annual that
429:47 - makes this a simple ordinary annuity
429:50 - i'm going to go through and calculate
429:52 - all of this and i'm going to note this
429:54 - iy isn't six anymore it's changed to
429:57 - what the market is so that's important
429:59 - you're using your new interest rate
430:01 - and that's how many coupon payments are
430:04 - left and that is well we have seven
430:06 - years of twice a year payments 14
430:09 - payments left present value is what
430:11 - we're trying to compute that's going to
430:13 - be our fair market value the payment
430:16 - well that was that thirty dollars
430:18 - and future value that's the thousand
430:20 - dollars we get at the end
430:22 - this is important these two are going to
430:25 - have the same sign you can make them
430:27 - both positive or both negative but they
430:29 - have to have the same sign i'm just
430:32 - going to write down some notes on this
430:34 - so you remember
430:36 - payments left
430:41 - present value is fair market value
430:46 - that's what we're computing almost
430:48 - always
430:50 - this is our new rate
430:53 - the payment that's the old rate
430:57 - times the face value or future value
431:01 - it's kind of nice that the face value
431:02 - and future value both have the same
431:05 - initials
431:12 - i would say ordinarily this is an
431:14 - ordinary annuity i can't see very many
431:17 - opportunities where it isn't
431:19 - and i am going to put in a little note
431:21 - here
431:22 - that these have the same sign they're
431:24 - either both positive or they're both
431:26 - negative and you can choose which it is
431:28 - but they have to be the same
431:30 - so let's just bump that in
431:33 - so we go into pycy make sure it's 2
431:38 - 14
431:40 - 8 percent
431:43 - our payment is 30 and a thousand dollars
431:46 - is the future value so now all i'm going
431:49 - to do is compute that present value and
431:52 - i get
431:55 - that the fair market value
431:59 - is 840
432:01 - 894 dollars
432:04 - and 37 cents it's less
432:08 - than a thousand and that's because
432:10 - anybody can get
432:11 - forty dollar payment that's eight
432:13 - percent divided by two times a thousand
432:16 - if anybody can get a payment of forty
432:18 - dollars why would they want our payment
432:19 - of only thirty dollars the answer is
432:22 - only if the price is discounted
432:26 - let's try one more how much is the bond
432:29 - worth if you sell it in four years and
432:32 - the interest rate for similar bonds is
432:33 - five percent compounded semi-annually
432:36 - that means anybody buying a similar bond
432:43 - has a coupon payment
432:48 - of a thousand dollars
432:50 - times 0.05
432:52 - over 2 which is 25
432:55 - so our 30 bond should be worth more now
433:00 - four years means six years left
433:04 - which makes our n six times two means we
433:07 - have 12 payments again our py and cy are
433:11 - two our interest rate has gone down to
433:14 - five
433:16 - present value is what we're going to
433:17 - compute and our payment and future value
433:20 - stay the same and still an ordinary
433:22 - annuity so all i'm going to change here
433:25 - because i have everything already in my
433:26 - calculator
433:28 - is 12 and
433:30 - 5 i way
433:32 - and we can always go recall and then
433:34 - press something to make sure it is
433:36 - correct
433:38 - now i'm just going to recompute that
433:39 - present value and i find out that the
433:42 - fair market value
433:49 - has gone up it's actually 1051.29
433:55 - which makes sense we've locked in at a
433:57 - higher rate that makes it more valuable
434:00 - than bonds that are selling right now
434:04 - a perpetuity is an annuity
434:08 - that goes on forever
434:15 - how does this work this works by paying
434:17 - out only the interest which leaves the
434:20 - principal untouched
434:23 - our payment here
434:25 - is going to be
434:27 - just like
434:28 - the bond the amount of interest
434:32 - accrued in one period
434:39 - so if we have a periodic rate
434:45 - of i
434:46 - as we often do
434:49 - and we have a principle of pv in the
434:52 - bank
434:55 - we end up with this
434:56 - payment equals pv
434:59 - times i
435:00 - and i'm just going to note that this is
435:02 - just like a bond payment
435:10 - and just like a bond payment that
435:12 - payment is coming out of the bank so
435:14 - what we're doing is we're looking at the
435:15 - interest that accrues every month or
435:17 - year or six months we're taking all that
435:20 - interest and we're spending it
435:22 - i'm going to take this equation and i'm
435:24 - going to solve for
435:27 - pv
435:28 - by dividing both sides by i remembering
435:32 - i can't be zero or this doesn't make any
435:34 - sense whatsoever
435:36 - here i've got two
435:38 - important equations and you will have
435:40 - these on tests these are called the
435:43 - ordinary perpetuity
435:48 - formulas
435:56 - okay
436:00 - a wealthy bcit alumnus has decided to
436:02 - make an endowment to the school of
436:04 - business to fund an annual scholarship
436:06 - for the best business math student she
436:08 - will donate fifteen thousand dollars
436:11 - and the funds will be invested at six
436:13 - point six percent effective how much
436:15 - will the annual scholarship be the first
436:17 - scholarships in one year
436:19 - so we're gonna deposit fifteen 000
436:22 - and then every year we're going to take
436:24 - out the interest
436:26 - when are we going to stop never this
436:28 - goes on in perpetuity which means
436:31 - forever we've got j1 equals 6.6 percent
436:35 - well that's the same as a periodic rate
436:38 - of
436:39 - 6.6 percent a year
436:41 - here
436:42 - using the formulas from above
436:45 - our payment is going to be 15 000
436:49 - times 0.066
436:52 - which gives us
436:54 - 990 dollars
436:59 - b if they decide to give out the first
437:01 - scholarship today instead of next year
437:04 - how much will the alumnus have to donate
437:06 - to keep the exact same scholarship from
437:08 - part a i'm going to draw this in one
437:10 - more time
437:12 - now we're going to put in something and
437:15 - immediately we're going to take out
437:17 - 990 dollars this is a one year 990
437:22 - etc forever and forever in perpetuity
437:27 - this is a different type of perpetuity
437:30 - it's called unsurprisingly a perpetuity
437:32 - do
437:37 - perpetuity do
437:39 - starts today
437:42 - so the first payment is immediate just
437:44 - like with an annuity do
437:46 - so we are going to need how much money
437:52 - well we need from our earlier
437:56 - one
437:57 - this much
437:58 - to start in a year
438:04 - so it's payment over i
438:10 - plus
438:11 - one extra payment of 990 for right now
438:17 - let's put that in so we're going to need
438:20 - 990 dollars over
438:23 - 6.6
438:26 - plus 9.90
438:30 - that is well it's 15 000
438:33 - that's what we needed before
438:35 - plus 990.
438:38 - so 15
438:39 - 990.
438:41 - that's the perpetuity due formula i'm
438:44 - going to rewrite this one
438:49 - present value equals payment over i plus
438:52 - payment
438:54 - moving this around and solving for
438:56 - payment which i encourage you to do as
438:58 - an algebra exercise but you don't need
439:01 - to
439:02 - if you try to solve this for payment
439:05 - using some factoring you end up with
439:07 - this
439:08 - payment equals i times present value or
439:10 - present value times i divided by 1 plus
439:13 - i you're taking it back one period in
439:15 - time
439:16 - these are the perpetuity do formula
439:21 - so let's just write that down
439:26 - and using these we can do everything we
439:29 - want
439:32 - if she decides to keep her endowment at
439:34 - 15 000
439:35 - how much will the annual scholarship be
439:37 - if the first scholarship is today so
439:40 - this is asking us to find
439:44 - payment of a perpetuity due
439:51 - so that's going to be this equation over
439:54 - here i'm going to write this down
439:57 - i times present value divided by 1 plus
440:01 - i
440:02 - which is 0.066
440:05 - times
440:06 - that fifteen thousand dollars
440:08 - divided
440:10 - by 1.066
440:13 - let's actually look at this
440:15 - 15 000 times 0.066
440:20 - that's that 990 we had before and we're
440:22 - gonna divide it by one
440:25 - year of interest
440:28 - that gives us 928
440:32 - and 71 cents it's going to be less
440:35 - because we have one less year to accrue
440:39 - interest
440:41 - the win it all lottery offers you two
440:43 - choices for a grand prize either cash
440:46 - prize of 1.5 million dollars or seven
440:48 - thousand dollars per month forever with
440:51 - the first payment today what should you
440:53 - select if interest is
440:55 - six percent monthly so we've got two
440:58 - methods here
441:01 - i'm going to use the first method and
441:03 - then i'm going to try the second one
441:04 - let's find the pv of both options
441:12 - well
441:12 - option one
441:15 - so let's go a
441:17 - 1.5 million dollars
441:21 - has a pv
441:23 - of well that's 1.5 million dollars it's
441:25 - just getting that money up front
441:28 - now let's look at option b that was
441:31 - seven thousand dollars a month
441:37 - starting today
441:39 - that
441:40 - is a
441:41 - perpetuity due
441:47 - and our i is going to be
441:49 - well six percent monthly is a half a
441:52 - percent per month
441:55 - and our payment is seven thousand so our
441:57 - present value is going to be payment
442:00 - over i plus payment
442:03 - which is the same as
442:06 - seven thousand dollars
442:10 - divided by 0.005
442:14 - plus 7 000
442:16 - which gives us
442:18 - you can do that on your calculator
442:20 - follow along
442:22 - i've done this already and it gives me
442:24 - about 1.4
442:26 - million dollars so i don't know about
442:28 - you
442:29 - i choose this
442:34 - i prefer to have 1.5 million dollars
442:36 - right away than something that has a
442:38 - present value
442:40 - of only 1.4 million dollars
442:43 - but let's try this again
442:47 - so let's do method two
442:51 - if i invest that 1.5 million dollars
443:01 - in a perpetuity due so if i took that
443:03 - 1.5 million dollars and i put it in the
443:05 - bank and i pulled out money every single
443:08 - month forever how much money would that
443:10 - be
443:11 - so if we took that cash and put it in
443:13 - this is kind of a stranger method but
443:15 - the interesting thing
443:19 - is that we're going to end up with a
443:21 - similar answer
443:22 - so i'm just going to use this formula
443:25 - i is still .005
443:29 - my present value is 1.5 million
443:33 - and i'm going to divide that by 1.005
443:37 - so let's just do that over here
443:41 - 1.5 million times 0.005
443:45 - and i'm going to divide that
443:47 - by 1.005
443:51 - and it looks like i've got a payment
443:54 - as 7 4
443:56 - 6 2 and 69 cents and this
444:00 - is better
444:06 - so i prefer 7 400 a month to 7 000 a
444:09 - month
444:10 - the important thing is that no matter
444:12 - what we do a is going to be the better
444:15 - option
444:18 - that's most of what there is to
444:20 - perpetuities but perpetuities could get
444:24 - complicated
444:37 - we can get deferred perpetuities that
444:40 - means perpetuities that start maybe 10
444:42 - years from now
444:44 - or after an annuity
444:50 - so we can combine perpetuities
445:00 - uh with an annuity or a compound
445:02 - interest problem to get something way
445:04 - more complicated we can also get general
445:07 - perpetuities
445:13 - so when p y and c y are different this
445:16 - becomes really complicated so what we're
445:19 - going to do is do a calculator cheat
445:24 - it's a cheat or a trick
445:26 - because our calculator isn't really
445:28 - supposed to do this but we can make this
445:30 - work by pretending
445:35 - that n is very big
445:46 - so really we want our money to last
445:49 - forever but if we made our
445:51 - money it lasts for a thousand
445:54 - years we're going to be okay the round
445:58 - off between this is almost nothing so
446:01 - let's do part c again
446:05 - in part c i'm going to do the calculator
446:08 - buttons
446:11 - so in part c we had something where the
446:15 - annual rate was 6.6 percent
446:18 - our payments were annual and our
446:20 - compounding period was annual but we
446:22 - could change that i'm gonna make this
446:24 - last a thousand years
446:26 - putting in a bunch of nines will also
446:28 - work if your n is too too big you might
446:31 - end up stalling out your calculator so a
446:33 - thousand years seems to get pretty good
446:35 - results
446:36 - our present value was fifteen thousand
446:38 - dollars our payment that's what we were
446:41 - computing we're pretending we run out of
446:43 - money that's the important thing and
446:46 - it's due
446:47 - so here is an important thing
446:52 - it's not going to be zero we're
446:54 - pretending it's zero
446:57 - everything else
446:59 - is the same i'm going to go with 1000
447:01 - years so if we had py was 12 and would
447:05 - be 12 000. so just multiply
447:09 - your py by a thousand and that seems to
447:12 - not jam out the calculator so let's go
447:14 - through this make our py and cy1
447:18 - n is
447:20 - a thousand years
447:23 - six point six is our interest
447:26 - our present value was fifteen thousand
447:28 - dollars
447:30 - our payment
447:32 - was nothing and our future value
447:37 - was
447:38 - zero
447:40 - and begin is on
447:44 - so let's compute what the payment was
447:47 - and this was question one part c that
447:50 - payment was going to be exactly what we
447:52 - got
447:53 - 928 and 71 cents
447:57 - stocks or dividend stocks this is a
448:00 - coupon bond basically that just goes on
448:03 - forever so this is a combination of
448:06 - bonds in the first first part of this
448:08 - lesson and perpetuities from the second
448:10 - part so i'm just gonna simplify
448:13 - totally simplify the stock process
448:16 - obviously it's always more complicated
448:19 - so to simplify we're always going to
448:21 - sell
448:22 - right after we get a dividend payment
448:29 - why do we do this
448:30 - that makes this ordinary
448:36 - if i do it that way then i'm only
448:38 - calculating ordinary perpetuities and
448:41 - that's always going to be easier
448:45 - two
448:45 - now here's the big if
448:49 - assume that our dividends are a constant
448:51 - number
448:54 - and this is a really big if if you guys
448:57 - have know anything about the stock
448:59 - market you know that stocks go up and
449:02 - down the dividends will change as the
449:04 - company does better or worse because
449:06 - dividends are part of the profits and
449:08 - that is not going to be
449:10 - a constant
449:11 - but for the purpose of assessing fair
449:13 - market value we say hey the payment
449:16 - that's going on right now will probably
449:18 - go on forever
449:22 - at the easiest stocks are really just
449:25 - the easiest simple ordinary perpetuities
449:29 - you purchase some preferred shares that
449:30 - have a semi-annual dividend of a dollar
449:33 - 25. how much should you pay for the
449:35 - shares if the interest is five percent
449:36 - compounded semi-annually and the first
449:38 - dividend is in six months
449:40 - this
449:43 - is going to be
449:45 - a simple ordinary perpetuity
449:49 - so our interest rate is five percent
449:51 - compounded semi-annually
449:55 - or two and a half percent
449:58 - and this is a simple
450:01 - ordinary perpetuity
450:05 - one note
450:06 - i've put in some semi-annual ones here
450:09 - to make it more similar to the ones that
450:10 - we did earlier in general stocks tend to
450:13 - be quarterly so expect to see quarterly
450:16 - payments
450:17 - and compounding
450:18 - so let's look at this
450:21 - our fair
450:22 - market value
450:26 - is the present value
450:28 - which makes it payment over i
450:32 - in this case that's going to be
450:35 - a dollar 25 divided by
450:38 - 0.025 or
450:41 - let's work this out 1.25 divided by .025
450:48 - 50
450:49 - so those stocks are worth fifty dollars
450:52 - each and every six months you get a
450:54 - check in the mail for a dollar twenty
450:56 - five
450:58 - let's try it again you purchase the
451:00 - shares in question four for fifty
451:02 - dollars each i'm gonna write in in each
451:06 - and then interest rate rises to eight
451:08 - percent compounded semi-annually how
451:10 - much would you make or lose and here
451:12 - it's going to be per stock because we
451:14 - don't know how many stocks there are
451:17 - our new fair market value as the stock
451:20 - market has changed
451:23 - is going to be a dollar
451:25 - 25 over our new periodic interest rate
451:29 - eight percent divided by two is 0.04
451:32 - which gives us 31.25
451:36 - that's how much each stock is worth so
451:38 - that means we have a loss
451:46 - i'm putting in brackets here capital
451:48 - because this is a capital loss
451:51 - of 50 minus 31.25
451:55 - per stock
451:57 - or 18.75
452:00 - per share or per stock
452:03 - why don't i say capital because if i
452:06 - have actually held on to the stock for a
452:08 - while i've gotten a bunch of payments
452:10 - and we don't use those payments when
452:12 - we're computing the profit and loss
452:15 - that's more for tax reasons and i'm not
452:17 - going to get into that just know here
452:19 - we're only looking at the value not of
452:21 - those dividends
452:26 - how much money would you make or lose if
452:28 - the interest rate was now six percent
452:30 - effective and we're just still going to
452:32 - assume the first dividend is in six
452:34 - months
452:35 - that makes this an ordinary perpetuity
452:38 - but it's no longer going to be simple
452:41 - because we get payments twice a year but
452:43 - we compound once a year
452:45 - so now
452:46 - this is going to be
452:49 - a general perpetuity anytime it's
452:52 - general uh we are allowed to
452:58 - convert that interest rate using
452:59 - interest conversion but it's easier just
453:01 - to use the calculator again future value
453:04 - is zero and n is going to be a thousand
453:07 - years which is 2 000 payments
453:11 - it's two times a thousand and why do i
453:15 - do that multiplying by two it really
453:17 - does mean that the round off is less
453:19 - than a cent in almost all cases and we
453:21 - don't get into trouble for using what's
453:23 - really an approximation method or a
453:26 - trick
453:27 - going into here i'm going to start with
453:29 - my pycy set my py to 2
453:32 - my cy has changed so i'll make that
453:34 - different i always like to scroll around
453:36 - there make sure i did it properly
453:39 - our n is now 2 000 and our interest rate
453:42 - is 6.
453:43 - present value is what i'm computing
453:47 - a dollar 25 is the payment and i need to
453:49 - make sure that i put in 0 for the future
453:51 - value compute the present value and now
453:54 - i get
453:56 - a fair market value
454:01 - of
454:03 - 42.28 cents per share
454:08 - which is still a loss
454:11 - because i bought them for 50 so i'm
454:13 - taking a loss
454:14 - and that's going to end up being
454:17 - well let's make this negative
454:19 - and add a fifty
454:23 - seven dollars and 72 cents per share is
454:28 - our loss
454:29 - lesson 16 mortgages and amortization
454:32 - part one
454:33 - the key to today's work
454:35 - is that balance is decreasing in a
454:37 - mortgage that's why it's called
454:39 - amortization
454:40 - it's when we are paying off a loan
454:43 - conventionally mortgages are paying off
454:45 - a building or a house but this could be
454:48 - anything paying off a car loan an rv a
454:51 - boat any makes sense
454:54 - what we're going to do first is go over
454:55 - some of the vocabulary
454:58 - first we have balance
455:02 - how much do we owe at a given time
455:05 - next we have principal
455:12 - how much of the mortgage we have paid
455:14 - off with those two we have this
455:18 - formula
455:19 - the balance that's how much we owe right
455:21 - now plus the principal how much we've
455:24 - paid off is the amount of the original
455:27 - mortgage how much we borrowed originally
455:34 - next we have interest
455:37 - and we should be very familiar with this
455:40 - one so far
455:42 - the interest is all the other money we
455:45 - paid so we have
455:50 - all the money we paid
455:55 - minus
455:57 - the interest
455:59 - is the money we borrowed
456:03 - or original mortgage
456:08 - for example i bought a house that cost
456:10 - six hundred thousand dollars with a down
456:12 - payment of a hundred thousand dollars
456:14 - i've made two hundred thousand dollars
456:15 - worth of payments and today the balance
456:17 - is four hundred and fifty thousand
456:19 - dollars the original mortgage
456:26 - was for five hundred thousand dollars
456:29 - because one hundred thousand was money i
456:31 - paid in cash and it's not part of this
456:34 - in any way
456:39 - so principal paid
456:44 - is going to be 50 000
456:47 - because it's worth
456:49 - 450 000 today i'm going to use k for
456:53 - thousand
456:57 - that's how much principle we've paid
456:59 - interest is the rest of the stuff
457:02 - the interest that we've paid is going to
457:05 - be
457:06 - 150 000
457:09 - finally
457:10 - the balance today
457:12 - well we know that that's 450 000.
457:17 - i'm gonna put some abbreviations in
457:19 - because our calculator uses these
457:22 - balance is bell
457:24 - int is interest
457:26 - p
457:26 - r n is principal and the original
457:29 - mortgage i'm going to call that the pv
457:31 - because it's the present value of our
457:34 - equation
457:36 - more things to talk about
457:40 - we've talked about this word before but
457:42 - we have to redefine amortization
457:47 - the amortization is the full length of
457:49 - the loan typically 20 to 25 years so
457:52 - that's over the entire lifetime
457:55 - this is different than the term of the
457:57 - loan
458:00 - the term is the length of time that the
458:02 - interest rate is fixed and the payments
458:04 - are fixed
458:05 - we usually say it's between three and
458:07 - seven years it's almost always five
458:09 - years over this term you know what your
458:12 - payments are and you've locked in at an
458:13 - interest rate at the end of the term the
458:16 - interest rate could change
458:19 - and odds are it will change
458:22 - let's start with an example
458:24 - you've just purchased a new house and
458:25 - taken a mortgage for a hundred thousand
458:27 - dollars the interest rate
458:30 - is 12 compounded monthly and you will
458:32 - make payments for 25 years find the size
458:35 - of the monthly payment
458:37 - so here we're going to assume
458:40 - that the amortization
458:43 - is 25 years and so we're going to work
458:45 - out our payments as if we're paying for
458:47 - 25 years we know though that our term is
458:51 - probably shorter after five years
458:54 - interest rates will have gone up or down
458:56 - depending on what's going on in the
458:57 - world
459:00 - so let's fill out our calculator our
459:02 - mortgage is for a hundred thousand
459:04 - dollars
459:05 - i like to make my present value positive
459:08 - but some people really like to make them
459:10 - negative to show that they're borrowing
459:11 - money either one is fine with me as long
459:14 - as your present value and your payment
459:16 - are opposite signs
459:18 - your future value though should always
459:19 - be zero because when you pay off a loan
459:22 - you pay it off completely unless you're
459:25 - told otherwise with a mortgage any money
459:28 - you pay at the beginning is considered
459:30 - part of the down payment so we're always
459:32 - going to treat this as an ordinary
459:33 - annuity
459:34 - in this case our interest rate is 12
459:37 - compounded monthly and we're going to
459:39 - make payments let's assume those are
459:41 - monthly payments because that's typical
459:46 - for 25 years so 25 times 12
459:50 - is 300 years
459:55 - in general you're going to see that
459:57 - mortgages in canada tend to be general
459:59 - annuities but for now we're going to
460:01 - stick with something fairly simple
460:04 - so let's work this out
460:06 - start with pycy
460:08 - make that 12 already seem to be there
460:12 - 300 is our month
460:15 - our interest rate is 12
460:18 - high interest rate
460:19 - we borrowed a hundred thousand dollars
460:22 - that's our payment our present value and
460:25 - our future value is zero so when i
460:28 - compute payment i end up with this
460:31 - number
460:41 - this is really important you can't pay
460:45 - 22.4 cents if we round it down a little
460:49 - at the end of 25 years we'd owe the bank
460:51 - money the bank is not okay with that so
460:54 - with our payment we're always going to
460:56 - round up
460:57 - sometimes to the next cent
461:03 - and then our payment would be and we're
461:05 - going to do this negative 1053.23
461:09 - or even next dollar
461:12 - sometimes we might even round up to the
461:14 - next hundred dollars
461:17 - in this case it says in the next cent
461:19 - sent is two decimal places
461:22 - we're going to be using our calculator
461:24 - to do a lot of the work for us so we
461:26 - need it to be correct in order to do
461:28 - that we're going to have to re-enter our
461:31 - payment it's a really important step
461:34 - 1053.23
461:37 - press payment
461:38 - and then press compute n
461:41 - now you'll notice i've got a negative n
461:44 - that's because i forgot that negative
461:45 - sign on purpose but still if your n
461:48 - makes no sense you know you made a
461:50 - mistake let's go back to that payment
461:52 - and make it negative
461:55 - and when i recompute the n
461:57 - now i should get something a tiny tiny
462:00 - bit smaller
462:05 - nine four nine eight seven
462:08 - so you're looking for something that's a
462:11 - tiny bit smaller than 300
462:14 - or your original n that means you're
462:16 - going to make 299 payments of the same
462:19 - size and one itty-bitty little payment
462:21 - that will be different
462:24 - let's talk about amortization tables or
462:27 - schedule an amortization schedule is
462:30 - just a list of all the payments that you
462:32 - make along with the balance at the end
462:34 - of that period and the principle and
462:36 - interest that are part of that
462:38 - there were three methods of constructing
462:41 - these
462:42 - and we're going to actually look at all
462:44 - three
462:45 - the first one we're going to do
462:47 - is by hand
462:48 - the second
462:49 - is using the built-in amortization table
462:52 - in the ba2 plus calculator
462:55 - and
462:56 - thirdly excel or another computer
463:00 - program spreadsheets are wonderful for
463:02 - this sort of thing so we're going to
463:04 - look at them all
463:06 - so let's start by doing one by hand and
463:09 - we are not going to do this whole thing
463:11 - because i for one do not have the
463:14 - patience
463:16 - at the beginning
463:17 - we owed a hundred thousand dollars we
463:20 - put that here under loan balance the
463:22 - interest that we paid on this was a
463:24 - thousand dollars i found that by
463:27 - remembering that i
463:29 - is 12 over 12 equals 0.01 so the
463:34 - interest of the first month is going to
463:36 - be the balance
463:39 - times i
463:41 - which is a thousand dollars
463:43 - so i take that thousand dollars
463:46 - let's work that out here
463:48 - i multiply that by .01 and it says that
463:52 - sorry it was a hundred thousand dollars
463:55 - times .01 and i owe an extra thousand
463:58 - dollars so now i owe a thousand
464:01 - a hundred and one thousand dollars i
464:04 - made payment of a thousand fifty three
464:06 - twenty three we already worked that out
464:08 - which means that a thousand of that was
464:10 - interest and 53 it was principal this
464:13 - plus this equals this
464:16 - my new balance is then
464:18 - a hundred thousand dollars
464:22 - minus the amount of principal i paid 53
464:25 - dollars and 23 cents so now we owe 99
464:29 - 946.77
464:32 - so i'm going to start off this row that
464:33 - way
464:34 - 99
464:39 - how much interest do i owe on that well
464:41 - let's
464:42 - multiply it by 0.01
464:44 - and it says i owe
464:47 - 999.46
464:50 - i'm rounding here at every step
464:52 - normally a computer is going to do this
464:55 - and every bank has its own rounding
464:56 - procedure
464:57 - my payment is the same
464:59 - because we have even payments in an
465:02 - annuity i'm gonna write that all down
465:06 - all the same which means the principal
465:09 - well if i make this negative and then
465:10 - add my payment 1053.23
465:15 - it looks like
465:17 - i actually paid off 53.76
465:22 - leaving me
465:25 - with a new balance of
465:29 - minus
465:31 - and then let's add how much we owed nine
465:34 - nine nine four six
465:37 - point seven seven
465:39 - and that is now we owe nine nine eight
465:43 - nine three
465:44 - and
465:46 - one cent
465:48 - perfect
465:50 - that is our amortization table
465:56 - in order to find the balance of the loan
465:58 - after three periods i could continue on
466:00 - doing this by hand
466:02 - but that is tedious and frustrating so
466:05 - we're gonna move on to method number
466:06 - three and i'm gonna do the rest of this
466:09 - with excel
466:11 - using excel
466:12 - i haven't done anything too fancy here
466:14 - except copy over the exact same thing we
466:17 - had but now into excel
466:20 - so i'm going to make sure that i have
466:22 - the correct interest rate i have to
466:24 - convert this
466:26 - for xl so i'm going to say that if j12
466:29 - is 12
466:30 - then i is 0.01
466:33 - we started with a hundred thousand
466:34 - dollars and we then
466:36 - that thousand was actually a hundred
466:38 - thousand
466:40 - times the interest rate for you guys who
466:42 - are
466:43 - excel aficionados pressing f4 here means
466:46 - that we've fixed that so that interest
466:48 - rate stays the same for the whole
466:50 - problem
466:51 - enter
466:52 - our payment that's fixed and our
466:55 - principal that's going to be
466:58 - well how much we paid minus the interest
467:01 - and our new balance is going to be that
467:03 - hundred thousand dollars
467:05 - minus
467:06 - the amount of principal we paid off
467:10 - here
467:11 - what i owe at the beginning of month two
467:13 - is what i owe at the end of month one so
467:18 - now i can fill down so i'm going to take
467:21 - all of these
467:22 - and fill them all the way down so that
467:25 - i'm
467:26 - filling out the entire thing at once
467:28 - one thing to be careful of is sometimes
467:31 - excel will fill incorrectly so i'm just
467:34 - going to make sure everything is working
467:36 - exactly according to plan
467:39 - once i do this
467:41 - you can see that here
467:44 - i've got the balance at the end of the
467:46 - third period so let's go back to our
467:49 - question
467:51 - and say that we have a balance of
467:55 - 99
467:56 - 838 and 71 cents
468:01 - let's do another method so here what
468:04 - we're going to do is use the
468:06 - amortization schedule on the calculator
468:09 - so above the present value
468:12 - is the amortization button
468:15 - so second amortization what i'm going to
468:18 - do is say let's look at the third row if
468:20 - i want to look at the third row
468:24 - i say from p1 equals 3 that means the
468:27 - beginning of the third row and i go 3
468:30 - enter
468:31 - from to the end of the third
468:34 - row
468:35 - 3 and enter
468:38 - the balance is now everything else i'm
468:40 - going to read off the
468:46 - balance is 99838.71
468:54 - the principal we've paid
468:56 - is negative
468:59 - 54299 that's 30 and the interest that
469:02 - we've paid
469:04 - is negative 998.93
469:08 - when we add these things up together
469:10 - you'll see that they are exactly that
469:14 - 1053 and 23 cents negative because our
469:18 - payment is negative it's decreasing the
469:20 - balance that's the same thing that we
469:22 - got via excel
469:26 - well we've already done part d here the
469:29 - principal was 54 30 and the interest was
469:34 - 998.93
469:35 - so now let's look at how much we paid in
469:37 - the first year again we're going to do
469:40 - two methods for this and i'm not going
469:42 - to do it by hand because that's a lot of
469:44 - work which seems a little silly
469:46 - so going back to here i'm going to sum
469:48 - everything the loan balance doesn't make
469:51 - sense to add but i'm going to go some
469:54 - bracket and then i highlight everything
469:57 - i've paid that's going to add all those
469:58 - numbers up together
470:00 - my payments well it looks like i've made
470:02 - 12 000 worth of payments how much
470:04 - principal have i paid off well all those
470:07 - add up together
470:08 - and now my new balance would be this
470:11 - 9938
470:13 - so let's make everything her bold
470:14 - because that will look a lot nicer
470:19 - so if we look here
470:21 - you can see that at the end of year
470:27 - one
470:28 - then we have
470:30 - the balance
470:34 - is nine nine
470:36 - three two four point nine one that's the
470:38 - balance at the end of year one how much
470:42 - interest did we pay over the entire year
470:45 - we paid 11 963 of
470:48 - interest and we only paid off 675
470:51 - dollars worth of principal that's what
470:53 - happens when we have a very high
470:55 - interest rate 12 percent
471:02 - so how much did we pay in the first year
471:05 - in the first year we made 12 payments of
471:09 - 1053
471:10 - and 23 cents and we could see that in
471:14 - our excel so let's clear out of this
471:16 - menu 12 times 1053.23
471:21 - we made
471:22 - 12
471:24 - 638.76
471:26 - worth of payments
471:28 - so now let's look at our amortization
471:30 - schedule on the calculator so second
471:33 - amortization when i'm doing the entire
471:36 - first year
471:39 - that says from the beginning of the
471:42 - first month
471:43 - so let's change that to 1 to the end of
471:46 - the year the end of the 12th month
471:48 - p2 equals 12 that's one year
471:53 - well how much did we pay
471:56 - our balance that's part h was 99324.91
472:02 - our interest was a lot
472:05 - again 11963.67
472:09 - and the principal we paid off
472:12 - was 675
472:16 - looking back at our excel you can see
472:19 - that this is exactly the same the
472:21 - principal paid 675.09
472:25 - those are the same numbers
472:27 - balance 99324 91
472:31 - same thing
472:32 - and
472:33 - when we go to the interest paid that's
472:35 - going to be 11963.67
472:38 - so again we're getting the exact same
472:40 - answers no matter which method we use
472:45 - how much interest did we pay in the
472:47 - third year
472:48 - the easiest way to do this is the
472:50 - amortization table built into our
472:52 - calculator the third year starts in the
472:55 - 25th month and it ends in the 36th month
473:00 - that's because the second year ends
473:05 - at 24. so the next one starts and we say
473:08 - at the beginning
473:10 - so let's go up here
473:12 - so p1 must be 25
473:15 - p2 is
473:17 - 36 that's three years so over those
473:21 - three years we paid
473:23 - less interest than we did in the first
473:24 - two years
473:27 - in the first year but we still paid 11
473:32 - 781.58 cents worth of interest
473:36 - finally let's find our last payment
473:40 - so what i mean by that is we have 299
473:43 - payments
473:46 - that are exactly
473:47 - 1053 and 23 cents and we have one
473:51 - littler payment the more we round
473:54 - the more different that is
473:57 - there's a several different ways that we
474:00 - can find this
474:02 - i'm going to call this the harder method
474:06 - that's find the balance
474:09 - at the end of the
474:11 - 299th month
474:15 - add one month of interest
474:20 - this is actually not that bad if we do
474:22 - it in excel
474:24 - that's the harder method easier is to
474:27 - use our calculator so pretend we
474:29 - overpaid
474:35 - and use p2 equals 300. it is going to be
474:40 - much easier if i just show you let's go
474:43 - into our amortization
474:45 - and p1 it doesn't matter what p1 is
474:47 - because i'm only looking at the balance
474:48 - but let's say let's only look at that
474:50 - final month
474:52 - so p1 is 300
474:54 - p2 is 300 that last month and now i'm
474:58 - going to look at it
474:59 - balance is negative 11.01
475:05 - that means we overpaid
475:08 - by eleven dollars had we paid a thousand
475:13 - fifty three and twenty three cents we
475:15 - would have overpaid by this so we really
475:18 - should have paid
475:23 - well that regular payment
475:26 - minus 1101
475:29 - let's do that so that's already negative
475:31 - so if i just say plus
475:33 - 1053.23
475:37 - [Music]
475:38 - i should have paid 11 1042.22
475:45 - let's do that again with excel because
475:48 - excel is actually a really good method
475:51 - so all i've done here in excel is
475:53 - instead of putting in that total i just
475:56 - copied it down one more month and then
475:58 - another month
475:59 - going to the end and we could hide all
476:02 - those rows which might be
476:04 - a smart thing to do
476:06 - at the end of the 299th month i owe a
476:10 - thousand dollars 31
476:13 - 1031 and 91 cents
476:16 - let's just pull these down a little bit
476:18 - more
476:20 - so i owe 10 and 32 cents worth of
476:23 - interest
476:25 - that means that i should only make a
476:28 - payment of 1031.91
476:31 - plus
476:33 - 10.32 or 1042.22
476:38 - pulling these down a little bit more you
476:40 - can see that now i owe no money at the
476:43 - end
476:44 - that's the same answer we got before
476:46 - alternatively
476:48 - if i just copied what i had before and
476:50 - this changed up to 1054 like that 1053
476:55 - you can see that i would have overpaid
476:57 - by one cent
477:00 - either way
477:06 - this is the answer for the final payment
477:10 - let's end with a little bit more
477:12 - vocabulary
477:14 - because you'll see these if you start
477:16 - looking at mortgages or doing your own
477:18 - research a fixed rate mortgage
477:23 - is one where the interest rate stays the
477:25 - same for the entire
477:26 - term typically five years
477:30 - the opposite of that is called a
477:32 - variable rate mortgage
477:37 - in a variable rate mortgage the payment
477:39 - is fixed but interest varies according
477:42 - to the prime rate that's fixed by the
477:44 - bank of canada
477:45 - in general a fixed rate mortgage is very
477:48 - stable it's safe you know exactly what
477:51 - will happen at the end of the five years
477:53 - variable rate is risky if interest rates
477:56 - go up you could end up owing more in
477:58 - your mortgage but if interest rates go
478:00 - down well that will be better for you
478:02 - because you will owe less
478:04 - then we've got the vert closed versus
478:08 - open mortgages
478:11 - in a closed mortgage if you try to
478:13 - pre-pay or pay off your entire mortgage
478:16 - or change your payments there will be a
478:18 - penalty on that so even if you sell your
478:21 - house mid-term there's a penalty in an
478:24 - open mortgage you can do whatever you'd
478:25 - like you could make extra payments
478:27 - sometimes you can make smaller payments
478:29 - if you need you can pay off the entire
478:31 - mortgage whenever you'd like typically
478:34 - because you have a lot more freedom in
478:35 - this mortgage you might have a higher
478:37 - interest rate
478:38 - finally i've said this before
478:41 - the down payment is not part of your
478:44 - mortgage
478:48 - it's the money that you pay
478:50 - right away
478:53 - i'm going to say that a very typical one
478:55 - is 20
478:57 - it can be more or less in canada if you
479:00 - have at least a 20
479:02 - down payment to not borrow that money
479:05 - then you don't have to pay what's called
479:06 - mortgage insurance where you're taking
479:08 - out an insurance policy on the mortgage
479:11 - and that goes to the cmhc that's a
479:13 - canadian institute
479:15 - 20 percent means less fees 15 you pay
479:19 - more fees
479:22 - lesson 17 mortgages and amortization
479:25 - part two we're going to jump right in
479:27 - with the problem but this time it's
479:29 - going to be a general annuity as
479:31 - canadian mortgages tend to be
479:33 - banks will apply the thirty percent rule
479:35 - no more than thirty percent of your
479:37 - gross income may be used for your
479:38 - mortgage payment if your gross income is
479:41 - three thousand three hundred thirty
479:43 - three dollars and thirty three cents
479:44 - you're looking for a five-year term on a
479:46 - 25-year amortization and banks are
479:49 - charging j2 equals six percent
479:51 - find the maximum size of the payment and
479:53 - the maximum mortgage
479:55 - what this means is that the size of the
479:57 - mortgage you can get really depends on
479:59 - your income banks are going to evaluate
480:01 - several factors one of them is your
480:03 - income and one of them is your debt to
480:05 - credit ratio how much other debt you
480:07 - have and how much access to credit you
480:09 - have
480:10 - if your gross income is
480:13 - three hundred and thirty three
480:15 - dollars and thirty three cents per month
480:18 - and we can use thirty percent of that
480:20 - for a mortgage payment then our maximum
480:23 - mortgage payment is going to be a
480:25 - thousand dollars
480:30 - so that's the biggest mortgage payment
480:32 - we can afford if we end up having to pay
480:35 - two thousand dollars we wouldn't be able
480:37 - to afford it when we try to calculate
480:39 - our maximum mortgage we're going to use
480:41 - that as our payment
480:43 - let's fill in the rest of our annuity
480:47 - in a canadian mortgage we're typically
480:49 - looking at a general annuity
480:51 - cy tends to be 2 and py is 12 because
480:55 - we're paying a monthly
480:57 - our
480:58 - semi-annual interest rate is six percent
481:01 - we're going to have this be a five-year
481:02 - term the 25-year amortization when we're
481:05 - calculating that that's just going to be
481:08 - a 25 years because we're going to pay it
481:10 - off in 25 years
481:12 - in five years we're going to have to
481:14 - reevaluate and figure out what's going
481:16 - on we're going to try to figure out a
481:18 - present value here and our future value
481:20 - is always zero begin is off because any
481:23 - money we borrow
481:25 - or pay at the very beginning is part of
481:27 - the down payment
481:29 - so let's start with that 12 and cy is
481:32 - two
481:33 - notice when i enter that p y and cy are
481:35 - now different
481:38 - n is 300
481:40 - our interest rate is six
481:44 - our payment is one thousand dollars
481:47 - making that negative and our future
481:49 - value is zero so when i compute the
481:51 - present value we can see that we can
481:53 - afford
481:54 - to borrow 156 297.23
482:00 - which is a reasonable sized mortgage
482:02 - that's our maximum
482:04 - mortgage but if we have some cash to put
482:07 - towards a down payment we could buy
482:13 - a house that cost two hundred
482:18 - thousand if we had about forty four
482:22 - thousand dollars down payment
482:26 - so we'd have to put some money down but
482:28 - we can afford to borrow 156 thousand so
482:32 - let's say we got this size mortgage and
482:34 - i'm going to leave it as is but in
482:37 - reality would probably round that number
482:39 - to 23 cents
482:41 - so let's
482:43 - look at what happens at the end of this
482:46 - mortgage
482:49 - well we're not at the end of the
482:50 - mortgage right now we're at the end of
482:51 - the term let's say five years has gone
482:54 - by
482:55 - let's look to see what happens there's a
482:57 - few different methods
483:01 - method one
483:02 - is going to be to use
483:05 - the amortization and that's going to be
483:07 - my preferred
483:09 - way of doing things if we go into that
483:11 - second
483:13 - pv
483:14 - amortization and p1 is now going to be
483:18 - it's the end of the five years so p1
483:20 - is one
483:22 - and the end of the five years p2 will be
483:25 - 60.
483:27 - so if i go down now my balance
483:32 - is 140 for 12 and 28 cents
483:37 - method number two
483:40 - well we could just
483:42 - set n equals 60 and compute the future
483:45 - value and that would be the exact same
483:47 - thing
483:48 - method three because we always have
483:50 - another method is to use excel
483:54 - let's look at this with excel
483:57 - you might recognize this as the same
483:59 - type of sheet that we looked at in
484:01 - lesson 16. this is an amortization table
484:04 - or an amortization schedule for our
484:07 - mortgage
484:08 - except excel does not deal with general
484:10 - annuities as well as our calculator does
484:13 - so i put in my semi-annual rate and i
484:16 - converted it to effective using the
484:18 - effect
484:19 - command then i had to switch it to a j12
484:22 - using the nominal command finally i
484:25 - divided it by 12 and that's the interest
484:27 - that i used you can see that one
484:30 - so i took my loan balance i found the
484:32 - interest i put in my payment is a
484:34 - constant principal again is just payment
484:38 - minus the interest and finally whatever
484:41 - i have
484:42 - is going to be what i started with minus
484:44 - the principal paid is our new balance in
484:46 - the next month i just pull my loan
484:48 - balance down from the previous month at
484:50 - the beginning
484:52 - this is exactly my amortization schedule
484:55 - and now i can look up any payment i want
484:57 - i've used a very interesting thing in
485:00 - excel where i've frozen the pane so if
485:02 - you'll notice i'm just scrolling down
485:04 - and i'm going to scroll down to month
485:06 - 60. at the end of the 60th month
485:10 - i have oh 140 412 dollars and 28 cents
485:15 - that's exactly what we got on the
485:17 - calculator which is helpful
485:22 - after five years the interest rate has
485:24 - increased to j2 equals eight percent
485:26 - what's the size of our new payment so
485:28 - what's happened here is five years have
485:31 - gone by
485:36 - five years have passed which means that
485:38 - i have 20 years left
485:42 - and my new present value
485:45 - is actually going to be
485:48 - well this number
485:50 - 144 12
485:53 - 28 cents don't worry so much about the
485:56 - decimal and rounding here if you're
485:58 - sticking with the same bank you don't
486:00 - have to do an intermediate rounding step
486:02 - but if you take your mortgage over to
486:04 - another bank you would what i'm going to
486:06 - do is take this and just press pv
486:09 - and now if we look over here
486:12 - recall present value is exactly what i
486:15 - want it to be that's going to be my new
486:17 - mortgage
486:23 - so all we have to do is fill out the
486:25 - exact same table we know that
486:30 - our present value is how much money we
486:32 - owe
486:33 - our interest rate has increased to j2
486:35 - equals eight percent and we're still
486:37 - going to make monthly payments we have
486:39 - 20 years left
486:42 - so that's 240 payments we're going to
486:45 - try to find our payment at the end of
486:46 - those 20 years hopefully we have paid
486:49 - everything off again this is an ordinary
486:51 - annuity so let's look at this our pycy
486:55 - are the same as they should be
486:58 - but now we only have
487:00 - 240 months left but our interest rate is
487:04 - eight
487:05 - our future value is the same we've reset
487:08 - our
487:09 - let's make sure that future value is
487:11 - zero so let's compute our new payment
487:14 - our new payment
487:17 - is going to be
487:19 - 11 63 and 12 cents
487:24 - here we're going to assume that we're
487:26 - going to have to round up so i'm going
487:27 - to re-enter that
487:32 - so let's put that in 11 63
487:35 - 2
487:36 - oops
487:40 - let's make that our new payment and just
487:42 - to check i recompute the n and i get
487:44 - just under 240 that's what i was looking
487:57 - 1166
488:00 - that is just wrong oops
488:09 - let's re-enter that payment with the
488:11 - rounded amount
488:14 - 1163.12 and that's negative
488:17 - let's press payment there we go and
488:19 - recompute our n our n is now just under
488:22 - 240 which is what we want to be
488:26 - so we're going to always round up and
488:28 - re-enter and now we know our new
488:30 - payments
488:32 - let's go ahead and update our excel
488:34 - sheet so our excel sheet now says this
488:36 - is 11 63
488:39 - and 12 cents let's press enter and then
488:42 - let's just spread this down make sure
488:44 - that it stays the same sometimes excel
488:46 - starts to count upwards that's probably
488:49 - enough
488:50 - because we're only doing this for a year
488:53 - let's go back to that 60 years and now
488:56 - we can see that we're paying this
488:57 - differently of course i have to change
489:00 - my interest rate as well so let's just
489:02 - stop doing this in excel
489:06 - let's do it again five years later the
489:08 - interest rate stays the same but we can
489:10 - actually afford an extra 12 000 on the
489:12 - mortgage assuming we will amortize the
489:15 - balance over the remaining 15 years what
489:17 - is the payment
489:18 - so what i'm going to do is put in an
489:20 - extra payment so we're going to use the
489:21 - amortization again
489:24 - and figure out what happens after
489:28 - five years
489:34 - one thing to remember the calculator
489:36 - doesn't remember the first five years
489:38 - those have been wiped out it thinks it's
489:40 - a 20-year
489:44 - notebook so p1 equals 1 and p2 equals
489:49 - 60. so we're doing exactly what we did
489:52 - in the last step
489:54 - except now our balance is less
489:58 - 122 671.40
490:01 - but we're also going to pay some money
490:04 - that's an extra 12 000 that we can
490:08 - afford to pay
490:13 - so if we can afford to pay an extra
490:15 - twelve thousand
490:19 - now it's only a hundred and ten thousand
490:21 - i'm going to go ahead and make that the
490:22 - present value
490:26 - so now i'm looking at a 15 year mortgage
490:32 - that starts at a hundred and ten
490:34 - thousand
490:36 - our payment is what we're going to be
490:38 - computing but again we're going to pay
490:39 - it off and it's always an ordinary
490:42 - annuity i'm making monthly payments it's
490:44 - compounded semi-annually and our
490:46 - interest rate stays at eight
490:49 - that many
490:51 - years sorry months 15 times 12
490:55 - is going to be 180 months so let's go
490:58 - ahead and work that out
491:01 - second py is 12 and 2 that stays the
491:04 - same
491:05 - let's change our n to 180
491:08 - our present value i've already changed
491:10 - our iy stays the same and so all i have
491:13 - to do is compute the payment which is
491:15 - now
491:19 - 1049 and 34 cents because remember we're
491:23 - rounding up and i'm going to go ahead
491:26 - there and re-enter
491:30 - negative payment and now i recompute the
491:33 - n and it's just under 180 which is
491:35 - exactly what i want to do
491:40 - let's look at this mortgage as a
491:42 - timeline
491:44 - so if i have six percent and then eight
491:46 - percent
491:47 - what i have is a 25-year amortization
491:50 - broken up into five-year terms
491:52 - originally how much did i borrow i
491:55 - borrowed 156
491:58 - 297
491:59 - and i like to treat that as arrow in
492:01 - because that was money that i was
492:03 - getting from the bank my payments come
492:05 - out of my accounts and there are
492:06 - payments of a thousand i make about 60
492:10 - of those exactly 60 of those
492:12 - with the last one coming out
492:15 - at year five
492:16 - at that point my balance
492:19 - or how much i owe is around 140 000.
492:24 - then i start making more payments i've
492:26 - raised my payments
492:29 - because the interest rate has gotten
492:31 - higher so i make a bunch of payments of
492:33 - 1163 and 12 cents
492:37 - and my last one
492:38 - comes out exactly at the 12 10 year
492:41 - anniversary of my mortgage
492:43 - at this point i'm gonna make one extra
492:46 - special
492:47 - at the same time deposit of twelve
492:49 - thousand dollars comes out of my account
492:51 - it goes on to my mortgage so my balance
492:55 - goes for to 110
492:58 - 671 after i make that 12 thousand dollar
493:01 - payment
493:02 - now i'm going to make some more payments
493:04 - so i keep on going and now i'm going to
493:06 - go all the way to the end because
493:08 - uh five of these is a lot and each of
493:10 - these payments is going to be 1049 and
493:13 - 34 cents so when i made that extra
493:16 - prepayment against the principal which
493:18 - i'm usually allowed to do at the
493:20 - anniversary date or when i renew my
493:22 - mortgage
493:23 - it reduced my payments
493:25 - so that's how much i did now let's
493:28 - figure out what the interest was on this
493:32 - mortgage
493:34 - okay
493:35 - well the interest was money paid minus
493:38 - money borrowed
493:48 - and i'm going to
493:50 - uh
493:51 - let's ignore the fact that that last
493:53 - month is a little bit tinier what we
493:55 - paid is going to be
493:57 - 60 payments of a thousand dollars
494:00 - plus 60 payments
494:03 - of 11 63 and 12 cents
494:06 - plus 180 payments
494:10 - of 1049 and 34 cents
494:14 - plus
494:16 - 12 000
494:18 - and that's really
494:19 - going to be 179
494:22 - plus one extra one but we're not going
494:24 - to worry about that tiny little extra
494:26 - how much did we borrow where original
494:29 - borrowing was a hundred and fifty six
494:31 - thousand
494:32 - two hundred ninety seven dollars and
494:34 - twenty three cents
494:36 - so in the end
494:38 - we paid
494:39 - a hundred and seventy four thousand
494:41 - three hundred seventy one dollars and
494:43 - seventeen cents in interest that's a lot
494:47 - but
494:48 - borrowing is expensive
494:52 - let's go back to part d
494:54 - we made that twelve thousand dollar
494:55 - prepayment and we used that money in
494:58 - order to lower our payments
495:00 - but what if we could afford the payment
495:02 - that we used to be paying that is we can
495:05 - afford to still pay 1163 and 12 cents
495:09 - that's how much we were used to it still
495:10 - fits into our budget
495:13 - our present value
495:15 - if you remember let's go back to recall
495:18 - present value
495:20 - remember at that time
495:22 - we owed 110
495:24 - 671 on our mortgage
495:26 - interest rate was eight percent and
495:28 - we're making monthly payments and
495:30 - compounding semi-annually
495:32 - if i change my payment to 1163.12
495:36 - a higher payment than i need i should be
495:39 - able to pay off my mortgage faster so
495:42 - let's compute the payment
495:44 - so compute
495:47 - payment
495:49 - that is not what i meant to do
496:07 - compute
496:08 - future compute
496:10 - n is what we're looking for so our new n
496:13 - is
496:14 - 149.64 months so 149 full months and
496:18 - then one small payment if i divide that
496:21 - by 12 we find out that's about 12 and a
496:24 - half years
496:26 - so we can save
496:28 - two and a half years
496:30 - pay it off faster and in the end we're
496:32 - going to be paying less of a mortgage if
496:35 - we do this
496:37 - example three let's do the exact same
496:40 - thing again this time your gross income
496:42 - is five thousand dollars per month
496:44 - that's your income before taxes
496:47 - the rate is now j2 equals eight percent
496:50 - let's write that in as we go and we're
496:52 - looking for a three-year term and a
496:54 - 20-year amortization 20 years
496:59 - and everything is monthly that means we
497:02 - have 240 months on our mortgage
497:04 - we can afford as our maximum payment
497:08 - well thirty percent of that five
497:10 - thousand dollars
497:12 - so let's multiply that by thirty percent
497:15 - and now we know we can afford fifteen
497:17 - hundred dollars and you can do this on a
497:19 - calculator so i'm gonna go ahead and
497:22 - write in that my payment is fifteen
497:23 - hundred dollars
497:25 - we're always going to pay it off and
497:26 - complete always an ordinary annuity and
497:29 - here because it doesn't say we're doing
497:31 - monthly payments let's compute our p y
497:35 - and cy stay the same through this whole
497:37 - lesson so i don't have to worry about
497:39 - that but i do have to reset n
497:42 - i y present value let's skip payment is
497:45 - 1500
497:48 - and the future value
497:50 - is zero so when i compute my present
497:53 - value it turns out i can afford
497:56 - or you can afford
497:58 - 181 000
498:07 - and 20
498:08 - 181 000 81 and 24 cents that's the size
498:13 - of our mortgage
498:17 - after three years you renew your
498:19 - mortgage at the same rate but are able
498:20 - to make a ten thousand dollar payment
498:22 - like we did last time we're going to run
498:24 - through two scenarios
498:26 - first we're just going to assume that
498:28 - we're going to amortize over the
498:29 - remaining 17 years this means our
498:32 - payments will decrease freeing up cash
498:34 - flow for other things
498:36 - our other option which we'll do next is
498:39 - keep our payments the same and then our
498:41 - time will decrease
498:43 - both of which are all right so let's see
498:45 - how much money we owe after three years
498:52 - we owe well that's going to be p2 equals
498:56 - 36. so p1 is 1 p2 is 36 or 3 years
499:05 - well we owe
499:06 - and sixty eight thousand dollars
499:14 - and forty cents
499:18 - so at the end of three years we owe 168
499:21 - 000
499:22 - we're going to make a 10 000 payment so
499:25 - i'm going to take that number i just
499:27 - pressed clear one time to make it just
499:29 - the number itself i'm going to subtract
499:32 - 10 000
499:33 - and that is going to be my new present
499:36 - value so let's write that in 158
499:40 - 441 and 40 cents i'm going to recompute
499:43 - my payment
499:45 - everything else
499:48 - stays the same except for my n because i
499:50 - have 17 times 12 is 204
499:55 - payments left so let's change that n to
499:58 - 204
500:00 - and recompute the payment and i get 14
500:04 - 10.95
500:13 - because i'm rounding that up
500:18 - now let's say we wanted to keep our
500:21 - payments the same we know we can afford
500:23 - fifteen hundred dollars even though
500:28 - we owe 158 441 we have a lower balance
500:31 - and we could get away with a lower
500:32 - payment but we don't want to
500:35 - everything's going to stay the same
500:37 - except for the n which i'm now going to
500:39 - recompute monthly payments seminal
500:42 - compounding etc etc so let's make our
500:46 - payment back to 1500 which is higher
500:49 - than the 1410 that we needed now when i
500:52 - compute n
500:53 - i get n is smaller
500:59 - 180 it's a little over 15 years 15 years
501:08 - it's 15 years and a tiny little bit so
501:11 - we've now saved two years off of our
501:14 - mortgage
501:18 - we've also saved interest i'm not going
501:20 - to go through and compute the exact
501:22 - number of interest here i'm going to do
501:24 - that in excel instead
501:28 - i've gone ahead and made this into an
501:30 - excel sheet we started with a hundred
501:32 - and eighty one thousand eighty one
501:34 - dollars
501:36 - and twenty four cents
501:38 - then we paid fifteen hundred dollars a
501:41 - month eight percent interest
501:43 - if we scroll down note that i made one
501:45 - very large payment of ten thousand
501:48 - eleven thousand five hundred dollars
501:50 - instead of fifteen hundred an extra ten
501:52 - thousand dollars at the end of that
501:54 - month the third year 36 months we owed
501:57 - 158 441 dollars and 40 cents
502:01 - the next month over in column
502:04 - a here the lower payments
502:06 - i lowered my payment to 14 10.95 here i
502:10 - left my payments the same
502:12 - notice that my balance is shrinking
502:14 - faster on this side let's zoom down all
502:18 - those months
502:19 - until the 218th month that's about 18
502:23 - years where i make one smaller payment
502:25 - of 780 for the last one i just added the
502:27 - interest to the balance owing and that
502:30 - is 218. going down over here we pay for
502:33 - two more years and
502:35 - my this one is only about 70 cents less
502:37 - than the other ones
502:39 - and in the end we've paid 170 751
502:42 - dollars in interest over here with lower
502:45 - payments but we've only paid 153 000
502:48 - over here so our difference is almost
502:50 - twenty thousand dollars worth of
502:52 - interest
502:53 - in that case it does make more sense to
502:55 - keep a higher payment

hi and welcome to opmt 1110 introduction to business math today we're going to start at the very beginning what is the point of business the point of business is profit of course there's other reasons to be in business lots of other reasons but in the context of a business math class this is what we care about mathematically profit is defined as sales minus costs sometimes instead of sales we say revenue and instead of costs we say expenses in the context of this class those are going to be interchangeable terms revenue and sales we also sometimes talk about this as money in money out and that's going to come up a lot throughout this course what do we know about profit when profit is a positive number that means bigger than zero that is a good thing on the other hand when profit is less than zero that's a negative number i'm going to write that that is less than that is going to be bad finally when profit is exactly zero that is what we're going to call the breakeven point and we'll get back to that in a couple of weeks but the word for a profit of exactly zero when sales equals cost is break even to understand the different types of expenses and the different types of profits we're going to go over an example example number one to run a lemonade stand charlie and sam spent 20 dollars in building a booth and 100 on lemons and sugar they brought in 300 in sales find their cost net profit and gross profit here we have two types of costs we've got fixed costs this is also called operating expenses and some books call this op for operating or fc for fixed costs we also have variable costs and those are also called costs of goods sold sometimes cogs and sometimes vc for variable costs in this case we have both types of expenses our operating expenses here are the 20 on the booth we spend that once no matter how much lemonade we make so that's a onetime expense that's what makes it an operating expense as opposed to our lemons and sugar which is a hundred dollars so every time we make a batch of that much lemonade we're going to have to spend an equal amount of money on lemon and sugars so what's our total costs 120 or 100 plus 20. that is our two types of expenses so now what we can do is look at what we call an income statement we write down our sales then we subtract the cost of goods solds and at the end what we get is called a gross profit so in this case we have three hundred dollars in sales minus one hundred dollars which gives us a gross profit of two hundred dollars that's the gross profit and it is sales minus cost of goods sold now we're going to subtract those operating costs so we spent twenty dollars on that booth and at the end what we're going to get is 180 and that is our net profit net profit is going to be all of our sales minus all of our expenses and eighty dollars is how much money we end up with in this this scan this up is the bottom line net profit so in the end we have a hundred and eighty dollars in profit let's sum up just the different equations that we went over we've got sales is money in is revenue we have costs that's money out is expenses we have profit that is sales minus cost we have net profit sorry we have two types of costs we have cost of goods sold and we have operating costs op or fixed cost and that is the cost of things that we are spending one time finally we've got gross profit is going to be sales minus cost of goods sold and then we have net profit which is going to be gross profit minus operating expenses hi now we're going to talk about ratios fractions and percent proportions and percent let's write that all down these are different ways of looking at the same problem a fraction is given as an amount over a base mathematically you might have heard this as the numerator over the denominator it's a hard word to spell a over c i'm going to give the example of 3 over 25 that's a fraction a ratio in a ratio we're going to express that in two parts 3 to 22 or a to b this is a way of comparing the two parts i've broken my fraction that has 25 pieces into two bits three and 22. when i add those together i get 25 so a ratio is a way of breaking our fraction up let's look at the same thing in decimal in decimal 3 over 25 is equal to 0.12 that's the same as 12 which means we have many ways of saying the same thing 3 twentyfifths three to twentytwo zero point one two twelve percent those are all the same but we use them in different ways often the one we like best is percent we use percent a lot in business because it's easy to understand 12 just makes a lot of sense however ratios do come in handy when we have lots of things to compare so i might say a to b to c equals one to three to two that means i've broken my hole into six parts one two three four five six i am going to color one of them a i'm going to color three of them b and i'm going to color let's uh sorry make this green the rest of it c two parts are c one part is a three parts are b question two detailed information about the minute made lemonade company is supplied below they have sales of 20 million dollars cost of goods sold that's things like lemons and sugar and cans or 12 million dollars giving them a gross profit of 20 minus 12 equals 8 million dollars their operating expenses that's things like salaries and factory costs are 5 million dollars leaving them with a net product profit of 3 million dollars this is an income statement and this is how we often write our expenses sales minus cost of good is gross profit minus operating expenses equals net profit the net profit is the bottom line what we're going to do is create a common size income statement that means that each line is as a percent of sales so we take each line and we divide it by sales so our sales line is going to be 20 million dollars i'm gonna write million that's okay because i can cancel it out 20 million over 20 million equals 100 percent so i write one hundred percent our sales line is always a hundred percent next we do our cost of goods sold and that's going to be 12 million dollars divided by 20 million dollars cancel out those millions and we end up with 60 percent we have two choices for the gross profit we can observe that gross profit is 100 minus 60 equals 40 percent but we can also observe that 8 million dollars divided by 20 million dollars equals 40 percent so either way works next we're going to do our operating expenses operating expenses is 5 million divided by 20 million dollars is 25 subtract again and we end up with 15 percent the important things are these two numbers gross profit divided by sales is called something special it is the percent gross margin that's going to be the gross profit divided by sales the one at the bottom here this is called the percent net margin and that's going to be the net profit divided by sales sometimes we call this pgm and sometimes we call this pnm and these are both examples of profit margins important thing when you hear margin we always divide by the sales question three finally we're going to use the concept of percent net margin or profit margin to be able to compare our two lemonade stands so let's remember back to the last video when we had sam and charlie sam and charlie had sales of 300 and they had a net profit of 180 that gives them a percent net margin of i'm gonna write the formula again net profit divided by sales is 180 divided by 300. this gives us 60 percent minute maid has a p n m as we already calculated before of 15 so we've got 15 percent and we've got 60 percent which one is better i'm going to go with sam and charlie so sam and charlie have a much smaller business but they have higher profit margins because they're keeping more of their money for every dollar in sales sam and charlie keep 60 cents for every dollar in sales minute maid keeps only 15 cents keep less of their money 85 cents goes to expenses now which one is the better business that's harder to compare sam and charlie with their small stand probably can't compete with minute maid on an international basis but just based on margins they're keeping more of their money hi now we're going to do a more complicated example sarah likes to keep the investments in her rrsp that's a registered retirement savings program in a ratio of 1 to 3 to 2 in cash bonds and stocks last year she invested twelve thousand dollars in total how did she invest her initial twelve thousand dollars first this is a ratio problem we have cash let's switch colors to bonds to stocks is equal to the ratio of one to three to two that means that our total is twelve thousand dollars which is going to be in how many parts it's going to be six parts one plus three plus two we add those together to get the total number of parts so each part is going to be two thousand dollars because two thousand dollars times six equals twelve thousand dollars so we start with twelve thousand dollars i'm going to do our initial percentage as a fraction instead of as a percent cash is going to be one over six bonds are going to be three over six and stocks are going to be two over six when we add those up together they add up to six over six or a hundred percent i've already said that one part is two thousand dollars so i'm going to fill that in here three parts then is going to be three times two thousand dollars which is six thousand dollars and finally two parts is going to be two times two thousand dollars is four thousand dollars when i add those up together and try them they do add up to twelve thousand dollars over the year her cash investments rose by three percent her bonds by eight percent and her stocks lowered by two percent that means she lost money what was her profit or loss over the year for part b we're going to look at percent change so start with three percent so percent change is always done by the old value times one plus the change i'm going to call that r equals the new value so for cash we end up with two thousand dollars one plus 0.03 equals 2000 times 1.03 which is 2060. that's today's value another way to do that would be to find the interest that would just be that two thousand dollars times 0.03 which is 60 dollars so we would put sixty dollars in here for bonds let's do the interest instead of the total we'll end up with six thousand dollars times 0.08 that's eight percent and that gives us four hundred and eighty dollars so i put that in there which means that i have a total of six thousand four hundred and eighty dollars finally stocks is a loss that's okay we can just still multiply four thousand dollars times negative 0.02 which gives us a negative number that negative number is 80. so she lost 80 dollars to show how the stocks would look like when we do the total or the new value we would say 4 thousand dollars times one minus 0.02 which is going to be 3920 or four thousand dollars minus eighty dollars giving us a total of four hundred and sixty dollars worth of interest 60 plus 480 minus 80 giving us now a total of 12 460 or 12 000 plus 460. now we get to part c the final and more difficult part the problem with this is that now we have more money but her money is no longer evenly balanced because sarah lost money in stocks she doesn't have a ratio of 132 anymore when she invests her 25 40 she's going to add that to the 12 460 dollars she already has giving her a total of fifteen thousand dollars so her new total is fifteen thousand dollars that's how much money she has in total with last year's twelve thousand four hundred and plus her this year's 2 540. so what we're going to do now is do the same thing we did before and break that into parts so this is six parts is 15 000. that means that one part is going to be equal to twenty five hundred dollars and i'm going to do that math so one part over six parts is equal to something over fifteen thousand dollars when we cross multiply we get x equals fifteen thousand dollars divided by six and then we get that it is twenty five hundred dollars that means that sarah wants to have 2500 in cash meaning she needs to invest an additional 440 which is 2500 minus 20 60. she's going to invest an extra 440 in cash for bonds we have three parts is going to be 2500 times 3 or if you prefer this it's going to be 15 000 times that ratio of 3 6. it doesn't matter which way we do it we still get seventy five hundred dollars and stocks we're going to take that 2500 times two and end up with five thousand dollars we check when we add those together 2500 plus 7500 plus 5 000 it actually does equal 15 dollars let's finish our differences subtraction tells us we need to invest one thousand and twenty dollars in bonds and more money one thousand and eighty dollars in stocks i'm actually going to check and add those together and not surprisingly it still adds up to 2540. so once sarah invests her money this way she will end up with an evenly balanced portfolio let's talk about markups and markdowns goods travel through many outlets before they reach the consumer i'm going to draw a graph of one item let's say this is a watch we've got the manufacturer have the wholesaler we have a retailer and we have me i'm the consumer what happens with this watch as we go through the watch costs the manufacturer 100 in materials and in operating costs let's just go with materials cost of goods sold then the wholesaler is going to pay more for that they're going to pay 145 that means that the manufacturer used a markup of 45. they bought it at a hundred dollars and they marked it up or have a profit of forty five dollars and here we're going to continue to just talk about gross profits so forty five dollars happened there the retailer well the retailer is not going to pay 145 the retailer paid 175 dollars meaning we have a markup of 30 dollars finally i pay more than 175 i'm actually going to pay 200 for this watch meaning the retailer marks it up by 25 so markup in dollars and i'm going to explain why i keep on saying in dollars in a moment is actually equal to the gross profit per item so for one watch the manufacturer makes 45 that's their profit the retailer their profit is 25 here the total markup from start to finish on this watch on this item is one hundred dollars that one hundred dollars is divided up forty five dollars goes to the manufacturer next thirty dollars goes to the wholesaler something like costco where the retailer shops or a person who buys from factories and sells just to store the retailer makes 25 and that's the store at the mall where i bought my watch i make no money because i'm now wearing the watch so that's our total markup when i add those together it adds to 100 total and the profits are divided like we talked about before with margins it makes sense to talk about percent percent markup is equal to markup over cost and we sometimes call that the gross profit per item over the cost or cost of the goods sold so that's the markup here our percent markup and sometimes we just call that markup is 100 in profit over one hundred dollars in cost is one hundred percent or one but let's look at each individual one so we have the manufacturer remember the manufacturer made 45 over 100 that was the cost is going to be a 45 markup when we go to the wholesaler let's just change colors there because why not the wholesaler made thirty dollars right 30 dollars but they also paid more they paid 145 because their cost was more that's going to be 20.69 markup and finally let's go to the retailer well their profit that was 25 but they paid more they actually ended up paying 175 dollars which gives us a markup of 14.29 percent the denominator here changes because it was the cost at each step what happens when i add these things together i end up with a round that means around 80 percent i'm going to cross that out don't add these when you add them together with you end up with nonsense something that doesn't make a lot of sense and that's because those bases were different the denominators of those fractions were different and that's what's giving us a problem the total markup as we know is a hundred percent even if those numbers don't add that way and that was because a hundred dollars profit over a hundred dollars cost equals one hundred percent okay let's talk about margins and markups percent margin versus percent markup margin is based on sales markup is cost as a base those are different margin is equal to gross profit over sales and this is the percent gross margin which is the one we're normally worrying about right now and here percent markup is the same amount or numerator but a different base try to figure out a way to remember this i tend to use markup has a co sound cost has a co sound margin no ku sound sales no cosound that's my mnemonic for remembering why margin goes with sales and markup goes with costs that may or may not be helpful to you let's go through one example of this a different example so let's pretend an item costs one hundred dollars to buy in a store the store paid forty dollars the gross profit is going to be sixty dollars so i bought uh groceries for a hundred dollars it cost the store and then we have stores profit using this basic we can do both the percent margin and the percent markup percent margin is profit over sales here that's going to be sixty dollars over one hundred dollars and that equals to sixty percent percent markup on the other hand well that's equal to profit over cost which is still 60 the cost is only forty dollars which gives us 150 percent that's okay i'm gonna note that markup can be very big however margin is always going to be less than a hundred percent let's do an example this is question one arizona computers marks up merchandise by 25 part a if a laptop costs 500 how much would it sell for now write down some formulas to start let's remember that percent markup equals profit over cost i like to start all these questions by writing down an abbreviated income statement sales minus costs equals profit here we're talking about gross profit but in essence it doesn't matter overly we're just going to say sales minus cost equals profit now i'm going to fill in the things i know from the problem i know that markup is 25 or 0.25 i know that sales is what i'm looking for the sales price i know that cost to the store is 500 and i know that profit is well i don't know that yet so i'm going to have to find that out let's look at this expression i've got profit equals cost times 0.25 this is formula in fact i can write here that profit equals cost times the percent markup remember that one i can also write this sales equals costs plus one percent story sales equals cost times one plus the percent markup here i'm gonna fill in what i know the cost is five 500 and the markup is 0.25 that means that the sales is going to be 625 dollars i can write that in here if we needed to how much would the profit be the profit would be 625 minus 500 equals 125 dollars also note if i use this equation 500 times 0.25 i'm going to come up with exactly 125 that's the profit let's continue on with part b now we're talking about a different object a desktop that sells for 750 and we're going to find the cost i'm going to remember that percent markup equals 0.25 and i'm going to write that same expression down sales minus cost equals profit this time i know just the sales price and i'm trying to find the cost so what we are going to do now is solve this problem using the expression earlier i said that sales equals cost times 1 plus the percent markup if i divide both sides by one plus the markup i'm just gonna say percent m for now this will cancel out as long as it's not equal to zero and i end up with this expression cost equals sales over one plus the percent markup that's another good formula that we can use anytime we need all i have to do is plug in the numbers that i know sales is 750 and markup is 0.25 so i get 750 over 1.25 which equals 600 dollars i put that in here so now we know the cost and if i need to know 150 dollars was the profit let's do a check profit over cost equals 150 over 600 dollars which is exactly 25 percent that's always a good thing to do check to make sure that our work is correct now let's go on to part c the company had total sales of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the month calculate the cost of goods sold and gross profit and percent margin so now we have a lot more information about this company i'm going to scroll this up but i'm still going to remember percent markup for this entire problem was 25 that's important to know and as usual let's just start with the same co income statement sales minus cost equals profit instead of one item now i'm talking about many items but it doesn't matter because the math is exactly the same i know i have sales of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars so what is my cost of good sold one there it is i'm correcting that okay so cogs is the same as cost and we're just going to say that's sales over 1 plus the percent markup in other words we have 150 000 over 1.25 which is 120 000 so 120 000 and that gives us a gross profit of 30 dollars we also needed the percent margin and that's going to be percent gross margin because we don't have any information about operating expenses so the margin is always going to be equal to profit over sales so here we have thirty thousand dollars over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars same numerator as the markup but a different denominator or base this gives us twenty percent so that is our percent margin let's go back to that finding a percent margin i'm going to go based on my laptop remember the laptop that we worked on in part a so our laptop had sales minus cost equals profit and in that case it was 625 our cost was 500 leaving us with a profit of 125. here the percent margin would be 125 over 625 which equals 20 let's do it one more time change colors because i enjoy that desktop we've got sales cost profit here the sales price of a desktop was 750 dollars and the cost was 600 giving us a profit of 150 so our percent margin is 150 over 750 which equals 20 percent no matter how we do this these are all the same 20 20 20 that's because the markup and margin are always travel together scroll down here and just say a markup of 25 is always equal to a margin of 20 those things travel together continuing with question one we're going to start talking about markdowns or discounts remember arizona computers marks up its merchandise by 25 percent that means the percent markup which equals profit over cost equals 0.25 now we're going to talk about a discount the company is having a sale where all goods are marked down by 10 of their selling price if a tablet is on sale for 200 how much did it cost so let's talk about this problem again we've got a markup of 25 which means that we have a margin of 20 which is what we found out in part c i'm going to use the following formula and that is going to be new price equals old price times 1 minus the discount we usually call that d when i divide both sides by 1 minus the discount or move it around i end up with old price equals new price over one minus the discount okay this is a twostep problem so step one is find the old price once we have that we can start working on the cost so we know that new price equals hundred dollars and we know that the discount is ten percent 0.10 or 10 percent that means that the old price equals new price instead of writing new i'm just going to put in 200 over 1 minus 0.1 which is the same as 200 over 0.9 here when i run that through i'm going to come up with 222 dollars and 22 cents i'm gonna round this originally there was a bunch of twos rounding that could be a video all on its own i can't sell something for a fraction of a cent that's against the law a cent or one hundredth of a dollar is the smallest proportion i can use i'm going to round that so now i've got part two going to find the cost so i've got sales minus cost equals profit the original price was 222 dollars and 22 cents and i know that the markup was 25 which means that cost equals sales over the markup one plus the markup run that through my calculator and i'm going to end up with 177.78 that was the original cost i'm going to write a sentence to finish that one off okay let's talk a little bit more of markups and markdowns i'm going to go through an example scroll this up i'm gonna buy a pair of apple brand air pods for 200. so i get those into my store now my store is going to have a 15 markup today only there is a 15 off sale sale is the same as a discount or markdown what's our profit on a pair of air pods well let's run through using our formulas the original price is actually two hundred dollars times one plus the markup i'm going to write down the formula underneath and that gives me a normal sales price of 230 dollars but now i've got a discount so new price equals old price times 1 minus the discount let's write down that formula and then let's put in our old price is 230 and our discount is 15 when i run that one through my calculator i'm just going to note that 1 minus 15 is 0.85 i end up with 195 dollars and 50 cents so what was my profit well it's not a profit it's a loss i lost 400 400 4.50 for every set of airpods i sold that's not good for my business as soon as i'm having a loss or a negative profit we're in trouble i'm going to write the moral of the story and that is 15 markup plus 15 mark down is not zero why isn't it and that has to do with the same reason when we were adding before when we talked about markups our base is different the base being 230 is different than the base being 200. let's do one more question to learn more about markups and margins artco fine handbags prices its products to give a 40 margin what rate of markup do they use let's remind ourselves first of what our formulas are percent margin no cosound is profit over sales percent markup with that sound hard k is profit over cost those are the two formulas we're going to use i'm going to put in something that we're going to use throughout this course and also in math when there are no numbers and there's no cost sales or profit just make something up we can do that because as we saw in our last example proportionately the markup and margin are always the same so it doesn't matter what we do when we know the margin i like to set sales to be a hundred dollars because 100 is easy to use so let's pretend we have sales of a hundred dollars so we've got sales of 100 minus some sort of cost over profit well what's our profit profit is 40 percent of sales or 0.40 times sales and that comes from this formula percent margin equals profit over sales multiply both sides by sales and we come up with profit equals percent margin times sales so our profit here is going to be 0.4 times 100 which is 40 dollars okay fill that one in i made a hundred dollars in sales my profit was 40 all i need to do is subtract to come up with a cost of 60 so my percent markup is going to be 40 over 60 or twothirds and i'm going to round that to 66.66666 or sixty six point six seven percent when in doubt two decimal places after the percent sign here we could have set sales to be anything we wanted had i set sales to be one dollar i would have 60 cents worth of cost and 40 cents worth of sales i also could have sorry worth of profit i also could have set sales to be 237 but that makes the arithmetic harder one a hundred ten a thousand those are easier numbers to work with i'm going to do parts b and c together because they really travel together our company had profits of six hundred thousand so what was their cost of goods sold well let's go back to our percent markup percent markup is profit over cost so 0.6667 is equal to the profit 600 000 over cost or we end up with cost equals six hundred thousand dollars divided by zero point six six six seven i wanna make a note if this algebra is tough for you that's a good reason to go back into the homeworks and look at the introductory lesson 0 homeworks there's lots of good algebra there i'm going to go back to this question all we have to do is say that this is actually nine hundred thousand dollars let's go into part c right away i wanted to do these together because what i really want to do is an income statement sales minus cost of goods sold equals gross profit minus operating expenses equals net profit this is always a good way to start okay they had profits of thousand dollars and here i'm going to note it doesn't say so but this must be gross profit or it doesn't make sense so under gross profit i'm going to write 600 thousand dollars i'm gonna write in my costs of nine hundred thousand dollars and then i'm gonna go upwards and note that sales must be nine hundred thousand dollars i'm gonna use k for thousand plus six hundred thousand dollars and that ends up with one point five million let's write that in okay operating cost net profit right now right next to this i'm going to draw a common line income statement 100 percent i know the gross profit is 40 because that's the margin we've already done that one and we know here then that the cost of goods sold is sixty percent what do i know the operating expenses are five percent of sales five percent that means that op is going to be take that sales and multiply it by five percent that gives us 75 000 i put that into here now i have two options i can do just subtraction that gives me a net profit of hundred and twenty five thousand dollars but i can also subtract these together forty percent minus five percent equals thirty five percent percent net margin it's difficult to know whether people are talking about gross margins and net margins when in doubt always try to clarify in case we want to check our work we can note that 35 of 1.5 million is equal to 525 000 so we get the same answer either way finally let's do part d the most recent shipment of bags had a cost of 270 000 what is the selling price well this is back to the basics and we have sales equals cost times 1 plus the percent markup when i put this together i end up with 270 000 and i know my markup it's one plus 0.6 in general it's better not to round but rounding in this case won't come up with a really big problem because we end up with sales of 450 000. hi today we're going to talk about trade and cash discounts a trade discount is a different way of looking at markups instead of looking at it as marking up we're going to look at it backwards so let's look again at some sort of item going through the chain the supply chain let's start with the manufacturer this time we're going to go straight to the retailer and skip the wholesaler step and then the consumer so we have a good it travels from the manufacturer to the retailer to the consumer at each step someone is paying money let's look at the retailer the retailer purchases it for 200 from the manufacturer and they're going to go ahead and sell that item to me for 250 so the retailer makes 250 every time they sell an item each item costs them 200 and then we have that gross profit per item or markup in dollars which is fifty dollars and that is let's call that markup in dollars or gross profit when we look at this as a percent we can see that markup is going to be gross profit or markup in dollars over cost which is 50 over 200 and that is 25 so the markup is 50 or 25 that's one model of looking at how the retailer buys it when the retailer sets the price we have another model i'm going to call this the apple model because it's the way that apple sells their products in this model the manufacturer sets the price not the retailer let's write that down they set the price not the retailer the store then bought an item let's say those airpod earbuds or some sort of apple produm they bought a 250 item with a discount and i'm going to call this a trade discount because that's a discount for being a retailer of 50 so they had a 50 discount and that's going to be at what percent or that would be 50 over 250 that's a 20 discount so they bought that 250 dollar item at a discount let's look at the supply chain from the way the retailer buys at we're going to say the retailer they buy from their manufacturer and then they sell it the consumer and on the way they mark it up by 25 from 200 to 250 or they mark it down by 20 and that is going the opposite direction so moral of this story is a 25 markup is the same as a 20 discount that's how that trade discount works now let's talk about chained discounts that's going to be when we have more than one discount and we're going to see in our examples this happens all the time so let's say you go to a store and they have a sale 25 off plus today only an additional five percent that's a good sale what we do is we apply one discount than the other one so let's look at pretending that we have something that's worth a hundred dollars so if we have our original price is 100 then our new price is going to be 100 times 1 minus 0.25 or 75 then we apply the next one today only so today's price is going to be 75 minus 5 that is 71 and 25 cents that's the price we're paying today but wait a second twenty five percent plus five percent equals thirty percent seventy five a hundred dollars times one minus thirty percent is seventy dollars so this is not the same and we've seen this before the moral of the story is never add because we're really using proportions with different bases this doesn't make sense what we're really going to end up doing is multiplying them together we could do this all in one stage question one a company makes snowboards that retail at thousand two hundred and fifty dollars the company offers chain discounts of thirty percent five percent with retailers calculate the price a retailer would pay for the snowboards why are there multiple discounts sometimes that's everybody gets 30 and 5 is for clients who pay on time or clients who have a long relationship there's many reasons to have a chained discount the price that we the consumer would pay is called the list price here it's one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars our cost is going to be our list times one minus the discount one one minus discount two and all we have to do is put our numbers in there our list price is one thousand two hundred and fifty one minus zero point three oh and one minus zero point oh five let's simplify that before i put that in a calculator just because it's easier to put in a calculator when we simplify it a little bit running that through we end up with 831 cents that's what a retailer is going to pay even though the consumers are going to pay a lot more for their snowboard a good question to ask is what single discount or single equivalent discount is equivalent to these two discounts that's a lot of words what that means is instead of saying thirty percent and five percent we could just say one number like 38 or 40 percent one thing to remember from before we know it isn't 30 plus five percent equals thirty five percent that's definitely not going to be the answer let's put an x right through that but we're gonna still use two different methods so method one we're going to take the old price and the new price as a proportion so we take the new price or the cost over the old price or the list and look at them as a proportion so i've got 831.25 divided by the list price of 12.50 and when i put those together i have 0.665 that means that we paid 66 and a half percent of lists or we had a discount of 1 minus 0.665 equals 34.5 33 sorry 0.5 percent let's just scroll down a little bit more now let's try another method either of these works there's more methods even than i'm saying that's one of the things with the algebra but whatever method you're using you want it to work i'm going to take the price and i'm going to put it on both sides of my equation then i'm going to use a different color and you'll see why price times 1 minus 1 minus our discount i'm going to call our single discount x because x often stands for unknown it's the same as price 1 minus 0.301 minus minus 0.05 let's just erase that because we have price on both sides and our price is nonzero we can just cancel those numbers out so now i have one minus x equals zero point seven zero 0.05 sorry nine five i multiply this through and i get one minus x equals 0.665 that's familiar which means x equals 0.335 or 33.5 notice that both methods are giving us the same answer this one is more algebra and this one uses the numbers you already know now let's look at what the percent markup is to the retailers well this is something that we know how to do percent markup equals profit over cost i know that the sales price or list price is 12.50 the cost is going to be 835 831.25 which means that my gross profit per item must be 418 dollars and 75 cents when i put this together let's change colors because why not i end up with 418 75 over 831.25 which gives me 50.38 percent markup a nice healthy markup now part d due to a slowdown in sales the manufacturer would like to increase the total discount given to its retailers to 40 percent what additional discount must they offer this is asking us to find one more discount d so that i can come up with this equation i'm going to say 1250 1 minus 0.30 1 minus 0.05 1 minus d and i don't know what d is is equal to right in that 1250 again 1 minus 0.5 once we have it written out this way there's lots of ways we can solve it i like to observe that that 1250 is the same on both sides so i don't actually need to know what that is i also know what one minus 0.3 and 1 minus 0.05 is that is the same as 1 minus 0.335 because we've done that 1 minus d equals 1 minus 0.4 is 0.60 so now i can divide both sides by 1 minus 0.335 and that's just 0.665 we know that and we end up with d equals 1 minus 0.9023 or the discount is 9.77 percent three discounts thirty percent five percent nine point seven seven percent when i add them together and chain them properly that is the same as forty percent just one note on these videos i'm not as amazing as a at arithmetic as it looks like i pause these videos to use my calculator and i encourage you to do the same get out your calculator and use it to compute as you go along okay now we're going to talk about cash discounts and payment terms these are things that are going to incentivize us to pay erla early or to pay in cash instead of credit you might have seen this before you go to a restaurant and there's a cash discount of five percent if you pay in cash and don't use a credit card so let's put not credit this is good because it incentivizes our customers to do the things we want when we write down payment terms that include our discounts it looks kind of like this 310 i'm going to write some more things here and 45 and there's some other stuff here this means there is a three percent discount if you pay within 10 days otherwise the net that's where the n comes from the net or everything all the money is due in 45 days 3 10 and 45 3 discount 10 days net everything due in 45 days then we put some extra terms here if we need it there's other abbreviations that you can always look up so this bill is due in 45 days i'm just going to put a little asterisks here any discount is for goods only not on your tax or your delivery etc that goes to a third party so you don't get a discount from the post office for paying early let's look at a sample invoice here we have an invoice it's dated it looks like it is dated may 12 2020 that's right around the time that i'm recording this video coincidentally and it is from bcit and it's to me amy gold list it has some important things like addresses bcit's logo importantly my customer id and over here we've got our shipping method and our terms and our delivery date this should not say 2016. let's change that to 2020. first let's look at these terms 115 and 30. so let's interpret that over here actually let's just write over here 115 and 30 rog one percent discount if paid within 15 days or the whole thing is due in 30 days the 30 days is from the receipt of goods rog stands for receipt of goods you can look up different abbreviations that's not super important for this class it just means that if we don't get it until september even though we ordered it in may it's going to take us we don't have to start paying until 30 days after september 16th even if it took six months to ship and it looks like we've got two calculators and five sets of course notes looking at this you can see how much it costs forty one dollars per calculator multiply that by two because there's two of those and uh of course notes thirty 31 dollars we multiply that by five because there's five of those we end up with 237 dollars we add in our tax we add in our delivery on top of that and we end up with 30 dollars and 44 cents authorized by and date i could sign this one myself even though it's shipped to me the important thing is this starts on september 16th 2020 so it's due on october 16 2020 30 days later now let's do a long question that has all the discounts and payments that we've done so far on november the 3rd the springfield power plant receives 10 fuel rods the rods have a list price of 20 000 each with discounts of 5 and 10 percent and payment terms of 210 115 net 30. what's the last day the invoice can be paid how much must be paid so first let's talk about how much we owe well it starts on november the 3rd and we've said net 30 and that is the same as saying n 30 but often we do just write net the last day that we can pay is december 3rd 30 days after november the 3rd if you're interested in date counting we will be looking at that in the ba 2 plus so look forward to a video about counting dates with your ba 2 plus calculator well how much are we going to pay well we have ten fuel rods each fuel rod costs twenty thousand dollars and we also have some discounts one is five percent and one is ten percent we put all of this together dump it into a calculator and we end up with a hundred and seventy one thousand dollars even so we have two discounts here what's the last day the two percent discount may be taken and how much must be paid let me just say we have two discounts we actually don't get them both we get two percent if we pay within 10 days or one percent within 15. we never get both discounts so three percent not gonna happen we only get a one percent on a two percent depending on how much we pay and when so if we add 10 days we end up with november the 3rd plus 10 days equals november the 13th easy how much do we pay well it's a hundred and seventy one thousand dollars is what we're supposed to pay but we take a bit of a discount off of there two percent to be precise which gives us a payment of a hundred and sixty seven thousand five hundred and eighty dollars that's a big discount if we look at it the amount of the discount is a hundred and seventy one thousand times 0.02 two percent of that is thirty four hundred dollars so that two percent is worth getting if we're going to save ourselves three thousand four hundred and twenty dollars almost thirty five hundred dollars let's go back to this problem we actually can't pay the entire thing at once but the supplier offers cash discounts on partial payments so what we're gonna do is pay what we can and then pay the rest later so after five days we pay a hundred thousand dollars and after another fifteen days after the invoice we pay another fifty thousand dollars now we want to know how much we owe to do this let's start with a balance sheet so november third that's our original i'm going to say within 10 days and within 15 days those are our different categories here if we pay within 15 days we get a 1 discount and if we pay within 10 days we get a 2 discount so let's start with what we owe we owe 171 000 we make our first payment within 10 days that payment is 100 000 when we try to do the discount we multiplied it by one minus two percent the opposite is dividing by one minus two percent when we go this way to the left we're going to divide so a hundred thousand dollars divided by one minus point zero two is the same as a hundred and two thousand forty dollars and eighty two cents this is a credit so we have a credit of a hundred thousand two thousand forty dollars and eighty two cents that's what comes off our account which means we now owe less money than if we made that hundred thousand dollars later we actually only owe sixty eight thousand nine hundred fifty nine dollars and eighteen cents now let's make another payment this other payment is going to be 50 000 so let's write that in but this payment was within 15 days so we get a one percent discount so we're going to divide that by that one percent so 50 000 i'm just going to simplify 1 minus 0.01 to 0.99 and it turns out that the credit for that 50 thousand dollars is 50 cents 505.05 i subtract that from 68 we owe eighteen thousand four hundred fifty four dollars and thirteen cents that's going to be the amount of the final payment okay let's just write down what we did the credit is the payment over one minus the discount the payment that we have to make is the amount we owe or the credit that we want to get times 1 minus the discount i'm going to write that we never ever see 1 plus the discount we're never going to multiply something by 1.02 or divide by 1.02 to finish off let's do one more partial payment problem but a difficult one an invoice for ten thousand dollars has payment terms 310 220 and 45. discounts are allowed for partial payments the company made a payment of three thousand dollars nine days after the date of the invoice and the second payment 18 days after the date of the invoice that reduced the balance owing to 2000. what was the size of the second payment it's a difficult one so let's look at our invoice our original one is due within 45 days if we pay within 10 days we get three percent discount and if we pay within it looks like 20 days we've got a two percent discount at the beginning it looks like we owe ten thousand dollars let's make a line here we owe ten thousand dollars now let's put in our first payment first payment was three thousand dollars and it was nine days later so it got that discount which means we actually end up with a credit of three thousand dollars over one minus 0.03 or three thousand ninety two dollars and seventy eight cents notice that i'm rounding here the rounding is a little bit contentious some people round at the middle some people round to the final step here you'll have to figure out from the supplier what they would prefer which means that now we owe six thousand nine hundred seven dollars and 22 cents let's make our next payment our next payment is something if it's something i like to call it x that x payment is worth more than it is because we get a two percent credit when i subtract this i end up with two thousand dollars so let me write that as algebra and scan this up a little bit and i have six thousand nine hundred seven dollars and 22 cents minus x over i'm going to simplify that to 0.98 equals 2 000 now i've taken my partial payment problem and i've made it an algebra problem which is easier because we know how to solve algebra problems x over 0.98 equals 6907.22 minus 2000. scroll up a little bit x equals 4907.22 times 0.98 and that gives me four thousand eight hundred nine dollars and seven cents this is the size of the second payment hi today we're going to talk about currency conversions and along the way other types of conversions as well we're going to jump straight in with question one how many canadian dollars will it take to buy 500 rubles i'm going to go over here and highlight the exchange rate and we'll look about that in a second first let's look at some rules for converting the first rule is to multiply by one multiplying by one changes nothing and that's because whatever number we have let's say uh five dollars times one equals five dollars it doesn't change anything here i know that one ruble over here is the same as 0.1783 canadian dollars or 17 canadian cents you can look up the exchange rate every day that you do calculations i fixed these ones in time but normally this is something that changes day to day depending on what's going on in the world because these two things are equal when i put one on the top and one on the bottom always using those units and putting them in it just equals one because the two things are equal top and bottom numerator and denominator again it also doesn't matter if i reverse that and put the canadian dollars on the top and one ruble on the bottom all of those fractions equal one and that leads me to rule number two always show units if you don't show units then these fractions aren't true so if i say 0.1783 over 1 equals 1 that would be incorrect it's the units the canadian and the rubles that make this equation correct okay so now let's actually solve our problem and write down our 500 rubles well that equals itself now i'm going to multiply it by a fraction so i'm gonna put that over one i'm gonna actually write that in a different color but you can always divide something by one it doesn't change anything but it does make it easier to understand the fraction i'm going to multiply that by this fraction over here so 0.1783 canadian divided by one ruble now when i look at this i've got a ruble on the top and a ruble on the bottom i'm going to cancel those out so the only units left are that cad or canadian dollars that means this is the same as 500 times 0.1783 canadian dollars or 89.15 canadian that is our equivalency so we can buy 500 rubles with 89.15 canadian and we can put that dollar sign in or not since we have the cad okay let's do the second question this time we're going to convert 500 euros into canadian dollars and see how much money we would need to buy 500 euros if i look at this expression i'm going to write this a different way one euro is equal to 1.4245 canadian when we're working with only one dollar i can use the dollar sign to mean canadian dollars this is the euro sign it looks like a c with a line through it and i can use that as well we are gonna see in our next two questions when we have two currencies that are both named dollars like canadian and u.s it's best to just use the name of the country but let's start with this so 500 euros is equal to 500 euros let's multiply that by a fraction i've got euro on the bottom so i can cancel that out and i've got dollars on the top i don't need to put the one underneath there if i'm comfortable with cross multiplying but you're welcome to cross off the euros and i am left with 500 times dollar sign 1.4245 which is the same as 712 dollars and 25 cents it takes 712 to buy 500 euros and that's because in this exchange euros are worth more than the canadian dollar while rubles are worth less so 500 rubles is only 89 canadian dollars well 500 euros is 712 canadian dollars now we're going to do a more complicated and bigger problem in this problem we're not just going to convert currency we're also going to convert our units one note in canada we use the metric system while in the united states they use the imperial system however because the us is our closest trade partner we often use u.s measurements like feet and miles and pounds when we should be using metric like meters and kilometers and kilograms that's why if you're going to work in canada it's really important to be able to convert canadian units so this time you have decided to visit the thrifty market in downtown bellingham which is just across the border in the united states you purchase a quart of black cherry pop for a dollar 25 per bottle u.s is this a better deal than canadian pop which sells for five dollars and ten cents per six pack solve the problem by changing the u.s price into canadian price per six pack i'm going to highlight those you can see here that we've used dollar sign for both canadian dollars and u.s dollars that's confusing that's why we're going to use cad for canadian and usd for us dollars and here are our measurements from above one us dollar is a dollar twelve canadian right now as i'm filming this both of our dollars are in free fall and nobody knows what will happen with the economy so i'm going to stick with numbers that got pulled out about 10 years ago okay let's start with this so the price for the u.s one is a dollar 25 and i'm going to write usd per one quart bottle i'm going to say qt means a quart okay so it's a dollar 25 per quart let's start multiplying it by things first let's get rid of that u.s dollar to do that i want a fraction with a u.s dollar on the bottom i put u.s dollar on the bottom here and the top there they'll cancel off nicely so one u.s dollar is equal to 1.1218 canadian when i do my calculations you can see that us dollar u.s dollar those nicely cancel okay now let's get rid of court so what i'm going to do is put quart on top i know over here that four quarts is one us gallon four quarts is one gallon i'm just going to say gallon and not us gallon that should be clear so now i have quart on the bottom quart on the top nicely canceled out let's add to this let's get rid of the gallon now i know that one gallon is equal to 3.7843 liters i'm just going to use capital l for liters okay now i can cross off gallon now i have something that's in canadian dollars per liter but i actually want this to be in canadian dollars per six pack the good thing about the metric system is that it's pretty easy to convert one liter let's just change colors there to make it clearer one liter is equal to a thousand milliliters liter liter disappears now we have a price per milliliter which is useful but we want to get this into cans in canada cans are about or at least in this case they're 355 milliliters milliliters is on the top to cancel at the bottom and that's one can we want this in a six pack so let me just cross out milliliter milliliter and i want to get one more thing here i have six cans is a six pack of pop can can okay i'm going to have to rewrite this whole thing because it's a big equation 1.25 times 1.1218 i'm going to leave that canadian till the end of the there but i am going to put it in i'm just doing things on the numerator at the top the one here i don't have to put that in one here i don't have to put that in but i do have to put 355 and six cans and that is cad are the units now let's do all the denominators one one one three point seven eight four three times a thousand and now that's just six pack and there we have it our units the only ones that were canceled were canadian dollars per sixpack so we have this in here now we just plug this into a calculator i'd like you guys to do this at home just so you know when you're doing these videos it's best if you're following along with your calculator you can pause me whenever you want and make sure that you got 3.16 once we round it canadian dollars six pack if you didn't that's something you should come ask me and we'll talk about your calculator and we'll go over some calculator techniques so what is it cheaper in so this is the u.s price remember and the canadian price for canadian pop is five dollars and 10 cents per sixpack and that's canadian which one would you prefer to buy well spoiler for all of these problems things are almost always cheaper in the u.s so don't be surprised if this is what happens this type of problem where we're converting both units of measurement and units of money at the same time comes up a lot in canada gas in the united states is measured in gallons and it's measured in liters here so it's important to be able to do that conversion but using this method and multiplying through and keeping careful track of our units you should never make that many mistakes only small arithmetic ones but once you get good at this you won't make mistakes hi let's format our ba2 plus calculator correctly you'll notice that my calculator is probably a different version than yours but they all work the same way notice that it says 0.00 we wanted to not show two decimal places we wanted to show all the decimal places and we're going to check to see how it's doing arithmetic if i put in 3 plus 2 times 10 i expect an answer of 23 using order of operations to know that multiplication comes before addition if we don't use order of operations and we do it incorrectly we end up with the number of 50. checking out our calculator the 3 plus 2 times 10 without putting the equals in between we get 50. that's the incorrect answer so we're going to change the formatting on this calculator we go to second and when you go to second now you get access to all the things on the top on top of the decimal place is the format press that and now it says decimal is two places we don't want that nine is the biggest we can have and if we don't put point o it means when there's nine decimal places it will show nine and when there's zero it will show zero so i'm going to press enter now i'm going to scroll up using the arrows to scroll around until i get to the chn mode that's chain mode and that's what's giving us the incorrect answer of 50. since i want algebraic order of operations or order of symbols i'm gonna go to second then press that enter again and now it says aos once i clear i can try that question again three plus 2 times 10 is 23 what we think it is let's just go over a few more settings decimal places we've seen that one if i scroll down we get degrees if you're going to be doing calculus or engineering math you might need to know the difference between degrees and radians not necessary for this course this is our date mode if you are european and you're used to day month year instead of month day year you might wish to change it but our textbook and all of the notes we do are going to assume we're using us mode next us mode shows a comma as a thousand separator and a decimal place separates the fractions or a fraction of a cent we could set this to european mode which uses space as a thousand separator and the comma for decimals but in canada we use the us mode finally we get back down to aos clear out of that notice it doesn't say 0.00 and our calculator is set correctly final question question 3 you are planning a winter surfing vacation you will begin on the north shore in hawaii try to catch the 50year storm at bells beach australia and finish your trip with a little longboarding on new zealand's north island you estimate you will need 500 in each currency how much canadian will you need to spend i'm just going to separate that i've highlighted the currencies that we're going to use canadian australian new zealand and usa unfortunately they're all dollars which is why we're going to use the abbreviations and those are official abbreviations so let's start with how much we need so we need 500 us dollars we need 500 australian dollars and we need 500 new zealand dollars we can do all of these and we're going to put this all together into one equation and do it all at the same time by multiplying each one by a fraction 500 us dollars times well we've done this one before 1.1218 canadian dollars equals one u.s dollar plus 500 australian dollars well that is 84 cents over one australian dollar plus our 500 new zealand dollars and we know that one new zealand dollar is equal to 71 canadian cents let's work this out all we have to do is cancel off those units and do some multiplication in addition i'm going to dump that into a calculator and come up with 1340.45 canadian looking at these currencies which one is more valuable well that's going to be the u.s dollar the us dollar is worth more than the canadian dollar the canadian dollar is worth more than the australian dollar because one canadian dollar is 84 cents australian but one canadian dollar is a dollar twelve canadian and australian is stronger than the new zealand dollar that's because 84 australian cents is equal to 72 ish new zealand cents okay now let's do part b when you land in auckland new zealand you discover that you still have 65 us dollars and 90 australian dollars in your wallet you'd like to exchange that for new zealand currency since we don't have exchange rates from new zealand from us dollars to new zealand dollars we're going to have to do an intermediate calculation to canadian so let's write what we have we have 65 u.s dollars plus 90 australian dollars and we're going to convert that i'm going to zoom this up so 65 usd and i'm going to multiply that and change it into canadian because that's the only thing i know how to do but i'm also going to change it into new zealand so let's change that in from canadian to a new zealand dollar we know that one new zealand dollar is 71 cents canadian and when i look at my conversions us us cancels canadian canadian cancels and i'm left with just new zealand on the top i'm going to do the next one in the exact same expression i've got 90 australian dollars and i'm going to change that from australian into canadian and here this is worth 84 cents now it's in canadian now i'm going to change that the same way i did before into new zealand one new zealand dollar is 71.68 canadian cents i go through australian australian canadian canadian i'm just going to rewrite this expression because it will be easier 65.1.12 over 0.7168 canadian sorry not canadian new zealand that's what we were left with here and here plus 90 times 0.8423 divided by 0.7168 canadian i put that into my calculator and end up with 207 dollars and 48 cents and that's new zealand dollars just one more note here we've simplified things a little bit when you exchange money the bank takes a cut so you're not going to get the exact amount a little percentage is going to go towards whoever is exchanging the money that's the reason they do it we're going to ignore that in this instance because we're looking at a little bit simplified but think of that as more of a fee hi we're going to use the ba 2 calculator to compute some dates we're going to start with an example an invoice stated june 1st 2010 is due in 45 days find the due date let's highlight that okay so first thing we start by going second and then the date date is on top of one we're going to put in the date 6.010 i'm going to write this down so six stands for june which is the sixth month june 1st nope that we have to put a zero there if it is one digit long and this is the last two digits of 2010 okay so to put that in we go 6.0110 and then we have to press enter to store it now i want to know 45 days later i'm going to scroll down to dbd dpd is days between dates so the days between dates here is going to be 45 enter now let's go and back up to date two and all i have to do is press compute to find out that it was friday july 16 2010 let's do another one let's figure out how old a person might be in days so let's say go back up to date one let's say someone was born on september 15th 1990. in that case their name their date would be 09 or just 9 for september 15 9 0. so i'm going to go 9.15 enter and today's date i'm going to go down today's date is actually may which is 5 dot the 17th 2020 press enter when i scroll down to days between days all i have to do is press compute to find out that it's 10 837 days finally what day of the week was i born or a fictional person scrolling back up to date one we can find this very easy once we have three things in here we can just compute the other one and it tells us that september 15 1990 was actually a saturday finally let's look at the last item dbd down to act and if we go one more we're back to date one act stands for actual that's a 365 days plus leap year every so often every four years the other calendar we can do is 360. that's going to be a calendar that has 12 months of 30 days each or 360 days we don't use this one because the earth takes in a bit days to revolve around the sun even though 360 would be easier math so we keep that at act i'm just going to write 360. that's a fictional calend calculator calendar and that is oh hi we're going to talk about cost equations today a cost equation is linear so it's of the form y equals a plus b x and just so you know if you learned this in high school you might have seen this as y equals m x plus b same thing different words i like to say y equals intercept plus slope times x okay for costs we have an equation that looks like cost equals fixed cost plus variable cost per item times the number of items or c equals fc plus bc x i'm going to draw this here we've got our axes and we're going to draw a line we have our intercept a here and we've got a slope so our line looks something like this let's just turn that ruler around and draw in a line okay the slope is the variable cost let's jump into question one you're concerned about your cell phone bill for this month and you can't remember how your plan actually works you've been careful to keep track of how much data you used each month and the month this month that you've used 160 megabytes using the payment information from your online banking you compile the following what is the independent variable and what is the dependent variable so here cost equations are easier in that cost is always going to be the dependent variable and x is the independent i like to say that y depends on x here cost depends on data used the more data you use the more expensive it will be to put this into a function we have cost equals we've got some sort of base rate no matter what we're not going to get away with using it for free we're going to pay a certain base plus we have some sort of price per megabyte times the num amount of data used so cost is going to depend on the data used part b use a graph to determine the amount of your cell phone bill for this month i've gone ahead and put a graph in here usually we use computers for these or graph paper works perfectly well i'm going to put in my points x is the megabytes used y is the cost so we have our points when we used 120 megabytes we spent 40 dollars let's put that mb in there when we used 80 megs we ended up spending only 30 dollars and when we had 200 megabytes we used ended up paying 60 so those are our three points a line is determined by two points so three is just extra drawing this i've gone ahead and labeled all my axes and i've used units and i know i don't have the neatest handwriting but i try so let's draw in these plans let's use red so what we're going to do is put in those points so 120 40. 120 on the xaxis 40 on the yaxis 80 30. that's going to be halfway here finally we have 260. that is over here on this and when i line those three points up they look like a line i'm going to use a ruler to try to get this perfect and again when you're freehanding it it doesn't matter if it's perfect but it's a nice thing we can do there's our line so looking at that question what do you think our the amount of our cell phone bill is this month remember this month we used 160 megabytes so what we're going to do is look over here and i think this month right around there i'm going to assume it's around 50 looking at a graph isn't precise but often it's good enough for whatever we are trying to do part c determine the slope of the line in the graph and describe the slope in the words of the problem this is a review from high school work which you might remember slope is defined as rise over run otherwise known as the change in y over the change in x we can look at that as any two points we take y2 minus y1 and we divide that by that is an error x2 minus x1 lovely this is going to be our variable cost in this case let's pick two points i'm going to pick two of them that look easy enough for i'm going to choose as my two points the following for point number one i'm going to say 80 30. when we used 80 megabytes it cost us 30 and for 0.2 i'm going to say that when we used 120 megabytes it cost us 40 dollars those are the points i'm going to use so the slope is going to be the rise the change in the money or cost 40 minus 30 over the run which is going to be 1 120 minus 180 make sure that your units match up there okay when i put that in i get 10 over 40 or 0.25 and i'll write that in the words of the problem for each additional megabyte i use i'm going to pay an extra 25 cents i'm going to make a note here let's say we had flipped our y1 and y2 in that case i'd end up with 30 minus 40 over 80 minus 120 megabytes in this case what i end up with is negatives here i have negative 10 over negative 40 which still equals 0.25 the order doesn't matter as long as i am consistent if we don't pay our cell phone at all for the month of october how much will you have to pay well let's scroll up and look at that for 0 megabytes we have what is the intercept it looks like somewhere around halfway between 0 and 20 so i'm going to go with around ten dollars i'm going to call this by inspection which means i looked and i didn't do any actual arithmetic finally let's determine the equation of the line in the graph looking at it we know at the slope and we know that we will end up with costs equals fixed costs plus variable cost times x we suspect that the fixed cost is somewhere around 7 and we know what the slope is i'm going to put in one of the points and here i just choose any point that i would like 80 megabytes cost 30 either of these points is fine so i'm going to put that in here knowing that the variable cost is 25 cents now i'm going to put in 30 for c and 80 for x i'm just going to leave off the megabytes because it's not necessary but now we have this it ends up being fc equals 30 dollars minus 0.25 times 80 and we can just run that through a calculator and we get ten dollars which is actually what we guessed in the previous uh examples so that is true d now let's look at how much c is our slope and that is already there so now let's just check our work by putting in every single point so x equals 120 cost equals 10 dollars plus 25 cents times 120 that's 40 dollars correct now let's put in x equals 80 megabytes now our cost is going to be 10 times 25 cents times 80 and that is 30 just like we want it to finally our last point was 200 megabytes cost equals 10 times 25 cents times 200 megabytes and we end up with 60 dollars those are the points that we're looking for finally i want to just verify part b so b said what happens when we make a hundred and sixty so when we use 160 megabytes our cost should be 10 plus 25 cents times 160 megabytes running this through a calculator equals 50. which is the amount that we estimated hi continuing on with question one let's look at a different company remember the cell phone bill on the company that we have is the cost is 10 connection fee per month plus 25 cents for every megabyte used part f another company offers a cell phone plan that costs 20 dollars per month and charges 15 cents per megabyte determine the cost equation and graph it using the same grid this time instead of having two points the line is given to us in words we can look at this and say that cost is going to be twenty dollar fixed costs plus fifteen cents times x where x is the amount of megabytes used remember the line that we found in part b and we graph that on the line now we're going to graph this second cell phone plan on the exact same line i'm going to do that by finding two points this time i wasn't given any points so i'm going to have to find them usually using the intersection point or when x equals zero is going to be the best choice when x equals zero the cost or y is equal to twenty dollars so that gives me the point zero twenty let's put that in purple okay now let's think about one more point here we can choose anything we'd like but it makes sense to come up with a simple number to use i've chosen to use x equals 200 here because i think it will be fairly simple when x equals 200 the cost is going to be 20 plus 15 cents times 200 put that into a calculator and it comes up with 50 dollars that gives me the point 250 easy enough to use 200 let's find 50 right over here so now we have two points all we have to do is connect them with a straight line perfect let's put a bracket there now we have our two points together now what we're going to do is compare our two plants sometimes one of them is cheaper and sometimes another one of them is cheaper so let's look at plan one if we are going to spend 175 megabytes then our cost will be 10 plus 25 cents for each of those 175 megabytes which is 53 and 75 cents plan 2 on the other hand is more expensive for its connection fee but cheaper otherwise only 15 cents a megabyte so when i put that in i get 46.25 i can kind of see that let's look at 175. it's about here i can see that plan two is more it's cheaper it's lower on the line than plan one mark in that plan one is in red different prices what's happening here is that if you don't spend any plan two is going to be more expensive if we don't use it at all it's a twenty dollar fee as opposed to ten dollars but if we spend 200 megabytes it will be 60 on plan 1 but only 50 on plan 2. what we're going to look at is the point at which they're the same by inspection looking at this it looks like somewhere between 80 and 120 somewhere around 100 our two plans will have the same cost when it we spend less than this amount use less data plan one would be cheaper if we use more data plan two is cheaper to find that point what we're going to do is solve some equations i'm just going to highlight over here in g that plan 2 was cheaper so what i'm going to do is solve a system of equations cost 1 equals cost 2 and i'm going to solve for x cost 1 well that was 10 plus 25 cents a megabyte i'm going to change colors here to say cost 2 was 20 plus only 15 cents per megabyte to solve this equation i'm going to move all the x terms to the left and all the constants to the right now i get 25 x minus 15 x 15.15 x equals 20 minus 10. notice that i'm leaving all those units in there that is 10 cents times x equals 10 dollars or x equals 10 over 0.10 which gives me exactly 100 megabytes that was what this looked like by inspection this looked to be at about a hundred the cost is the same there so in conclusion if we average more than 100 megabytes per month two is going to be cheaper if we average less than 100 megabytes per month plan one will be cheaper so the conclusion is we're going to take our use patterns and figure out which plan is best question two let's do one more linear equation that is a costing equation babysitters r us charges a flat booking fee plus an hourly rate on a normal workday i hire a sitter for nine hours and i pay dollars and 50 cents on saturday nights i usually hire a sitter for four hours while i go to the movies and i pay 66 dollars find a linear equation giving cost in terms of the number of hours so this is a question where we have two points and we're trying to find the linear equation between them so first of all the independent and dependent variable cost is always the dependent variable in a costing equation so we have here cost depends on time time is always independent costing is dependent remember we say why it depends on x cost depends on it time is never the dependent variable because it's strange to say that time is going to change based on other things unless you had a time machine which would be very cool so what we're doing is this and we have an equation that looks like cost equals intercept plus slope times x our intercept here is going to be our fixed cost or booking fee so let's say actually i'm going to call this a booking fee that's our fixed cost here plus our hourly rate times the number of hours so that's what i'm trying it to find let's look at our two points i'm going to draw these here points and let's cut x comma y well i know nine hours on a work day gives me a fee of 123 dollars and 50 cents i know that on my movie day only four hours i only pay 66 dollars that means that i have my y values are in money and my x values are in time so first let's find that slope so slope again is rise over run or y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1 y's over x's putting those in i'm going to start with this one because they're bigger numbers and i always like to put the bigger numbers first 123 dollars and 50 cents minus 66 dollars nine minus four putting in the units really ensures that you don't mix things up if i run this through a calculator we come up with eleven dollars and fifty cents that is our hourly weight we pay our sitter eleven dollars and fifty cents we're going to assume that they get some of that booking fee to bring them up to minimum wage so let's look again at our costing equation cost equals our booking fee or i'm going to call it this time fixed cost fc plus 1150 times x so we can plug in any one point and that will help us solve and we can choose either of these points i'm going to choose the second point just because it's smaller numbers and i find that often smaller numbers tend to be a little bit easier to work with but not always so our cost is 66 dollars that equals fixed costs plus 1150 times four when i move this around and this is something where if this is not easy for you to solve this that fixed cost is 20 come talk to me send me an email go over some algebra things and we will get that nicely sorted because this is an important thing to know another important thing to do is to check so i put in the second point so let's try the first point so if i put in 9 hours the cost will be i've said i had a 20 flat rate plus nine hours times 11.50 and when i dump that in it ends up being 123.50 just what we wanted and just to check even though we used it we can always just check the four hour cost so 20 dollars plus 1150 times 4 is equal to 66 that's correct if we got the wrong answer here then we would know to stop and redo our arithmetic okay let's describe the slope in the words of the problem we know that the slope is the hourly rate so i'm going to say one slope equals hourly rate so for every additional hour we have to pay our sitter an extra 11.50 notice that i used the following the actual slope the word additional hour and what's going on we're paying an extra eleven fifty we're paying that flat rate plus what we paid before and every additional hour cost us 11.50 extra finally part c if i hire a sitter for six hours how much will it cost me well i'm going to write down our cost equation again our cost is going to be twenty dollars no matter how much time i use you have it a babysitter come for five minutes it's gonna cost you at least twenty dollars plus eleven dollars and fifty cents per hour so if x equals six hours then our cost is going to be twenty dollars plus eleven fifty times six which equals eighty nine dollars that's how much we're going to pay our sitter hi today we're going to jump right in to lecture six break even analysis by going straight into a problem break even analysis is sometimes called cvp the c stands for cost the v stands for volume and the p stands for profit break even is what our calculator uses and there we're going to learn more about that later so let's jump right in the hungry days ice cream company has fixed costs of thirty thousand dollars per month each case of ice cream costs four dollars and fifty cents to make write an equation giving total cost as a function of the number of cases of ice cream made we're going to graph that in the space below well we know from last time that our cost cost equation is fixed costs plus variable costs times x where x is the quantity so in our case we have thirty thousand dollars plus four dollars and fifty cents for every carton case of ice cream let's write that in so i'm going to scroll a little bit and by the way k little aside 60k is 60 000. k stands for kilo which comes from the greek word for thousand i use that when i draw legends because i don't like writing all those zeros my hand gets tired a computer besides one that i write on would be very helpful i've gone ahead and labeled this because i know what the axes when you're doing this in the real world you'll often be using excel or a graphing program so i'm going to label it every five is going to be ten thousand dollars on the yaxis costing is always on the yaxis and i've put 2500 for every five blocks on the xaxis so let's start with cost our intercept is going to be zero when i have zero cases of ice cream our cost is thirty thousand dollars so zero thirty thousand dollars now i'm going to come up with something else i've chosen five thousand because that seems to be a nice easy number then y or the cost equals thirty thousand plus four fifty times five thousand and when i run that into a calculator i get the point five thousand 52 500. okay let's put that on 5000 is a nice dark line and 52 500 seems to be right about here now i've got that on my list on my chart i go ahead and put in a nice straight line and i can even label that as my cost equation okay part b the company sells ice cream for 12 dollars per case give an equation for the revenue function and graph the revenue below here price actually i'm gonna switch this to purple why not price is 12 dollars per case revenue is the same as sales and that's always going to be defined as price times quantity sometimes quantity is done as q for quantity we often use x because that's what's used in algebra for unknowns when i put in what i have for this i end up with revenue i'm calling that r is 12 x if i sell x cases of ice cream i make 12 times x in price scrolling up i'm going to write this again over here let's put this on the exact same chart the intercept of revenue is easy if we sell no ice cream we make no money expect zero zero to be a point on every revenue graph now i'm going to go with something that looks equally easy if i sell 5 000 cases of ice cream then i make 12 times 5 is 60 000 in sales so five thousand sixty right at the top again all i have to do is put in my ruler line everything up the nicer you line this up the easier it is to really see what's going on and now we can see where these cross okay let's label our graph this is the important part profit loss and break even i'm going to go back to what we talked about in the very first lecture i'm pretty sure in the very first video profit is revenue or sales minus cost when profit is greater than zero we're in a profit situation when profit is less than zero let's put that as a dollar sign we're in a loss situation and when profit is exactly zero this is what we call the break even point this is what the purpose of this lecture is we're always going to be trying to figure out what the breakeven point is the minimum sales to not lose money it's okay if we make a little bit of money but if we lose money we're in a bad situation we want to be in a positive situation okay so looking at our graph this time we're just gonna eyeball it i'm gonna go ahead and highlight this i'm even going to put a little line there right at that point and it looks like it's a nice even point and we have on the yellow side over here our costs are higher than our revenues so i'm going to write revenue here in purple when our cost is higher than our revenue this is a loss situation when our profit when our revenue is higher than our costs over here this is a profit situation so if we sell more than somewhere around 4 000 we'll be in a profit and if we sell less than that we will be in a loss okay part d let's calculate the break even point we're going to express it in multiple ways so looking at our chart earlier scroll up we think it's somewhere around 4 000 but now we're going to look at that algebraically so the breakeven point comes when profit equals zero and since profit is revenue minus cost that's the exact same as saying that revenue and costs are equal so we're looking from when those two things are the same so i'm gonna put in our equations revenue was 12 x and cost was three thirty thousand dollars plus 450 x solve this i'm going to move everything over to the same side i've got 12x minus 4.50 x equals 30 000 or 12 minus 4.5 i'm factoring out the x so i end up with 7.5 x equals 30 000 so x is 30 000 divided by 7.5 which is the same as 4 000 cases that's our breakeven and that's what it looked like on our chart so let's write that down break even is four thousand cases in sales we would need to sell well it's twelve dollars per case so if we sold forty eight thousand dollars worth of material worth of ice cream we would be at break even so we need to sell 4 000 cases of ice cream or we need to bring in 48 000 worth in sales and at that point our costs are also going to be 48 thousand dollars let's look at this capacity we cannot sell a million cases of ice cream we can't because our factory won't work so we have a capacity we always have a capacity so our factory and our staff and all the materials we have can only make 16 000 per month and there's always a limit if you think back to the very first day we talked about sam and charlie and their lemonade stand they can't suddenly sell 200 million liters of lemonade they are just two kids with a stand so our factory can only make 16 000 per month after that our calculations change because our fixed costs will change we will need to upgrade our factory we will need to hire more people things are going to change so what we're going to do is say we need to sell 4 000 of our 16 000 maximum or 25 of capacity to break even this is a good thing to look at if it turns out we need to sell 90 of capacity that doesn't give us a lot of room to get to sell more and we have to sell quite a lot that's not a great business case if we only need to sell five percent of capacity then maybe we're in a good position we need to know these numbers okay going back to this problem let's calculate our profit or loss if 4001 cases are sold so profit equals revenue minus cost this time i'm going to write this with variables before i put in our numbers profit is revenue revenue is price times quantity and quantity is x cost is going to be fixed costs plus variable cost times x moving this around i end up with price minus variable costs x i've moved it around and i factored that out minus the fixed costs one thing to make sure of is the minus here in the brackets distributes i'm going to write that down because it's an easy thing to forget so price minus variable cost times x minus fixed costs we've seen this before in our case we got to the point where 12 minus 450 x minus 30 000 that number price minus variable costs is something that we call the contribution margin another way to think of that is the gross profit per item that's what we were looking at in chapter one any time we calculated our margins and markups we were usually looking at that gross profit per item or markup in dollars those all mean the same thing that happens a lot in business math we end up with the same idea but expressed differently in this case we had 750x minus 30 000 that's the profit equation for happy days ice cream 750 is our profit margin okay where am i going with this let's go back to profit or lost if 4001 cases are sold so if x equals 4001 there's an extra zero there i have profit equals 750 times 4001 minus 30 000 putting that into my calculator i end up with 3007.5 oh minus 30 000 which gives me 750 that's the contribution margin that isn't a coincidence so i'm going to say the first 4 000 cases pay off the fixed costs every additional case contributes contributes contribution seven dollars and fifty cents to the net profit and in this case we are talking about net profit because we're subtracting the fixed costs that means if i had if we sell x equals 4002 cases our profits net profits are going to be two times seven dollars and fifty cents or fifteen dollars okay let's calculate the profit or loss if 3 250 cases are sold i'm going to scroll back up to look at our chart if we look over here this our breakeven point was at 4 000 cases 4001 gave us a profit of 750 but anything below 4 000 was a loss situation we know before we do any arithmetic at all that we're going to end up with a loss so we know going in no matter what happens we're going to lose money but anyways we're going to go and work this out our profit we've already said that once we've come up with this equation 750x minus thirty thousand dollars we can just plug this in so 750 times 3250 minus 30 000 is going to give us negative six two five so anytime we have a negative profit we have a loss of five thousand six hundred and twenty five dollars once we have that profit equation we can use it to solve all sorts of things let's say our company wants to make a profit of 75 000 how many cases must they sell first of all we know it's going to be more than four thousand because four thousand had a profit of zero so let's just write that in we know it's more than four thousand cases but what we're going to do is set profit equals revenue minus costs equals 75 000. in our case we know what profit is profit is that contribution margin times x minus the fixed costs 750x minus 30 000 equals 75 000. moving over the thirty thousand dollars it moves from a negative to a positive we end up with x equals i'm going to write this whole thing in 105 000 over 7.50 which is thousand dollars sorry fourteen thousand cases i'm going to say this is possible since it is under capacity if we need to sell 20 000 cases i'm going to write down we can't do that anything over 16 000 is impossible because our factory only fits 14 thousand finally we're going to play around with the structure hungry days is considering dropping its prices and would like to make a profit of eighty two thousand dollars by selling sixteen thousand cases what should the new price be what is the break even in units so now things are changing our price is not twelve dollars anymore our price is something different so we're going to need a new profit equation always start with profit equals revenue minus costs what i'm going to do over here is write down all the things we have fixed costs variable costs price quantity and profit i'm going to write q or x and that's because we're going to talk about how the ba 2 calculator does this later our fixed costs didn't change our variable costs well those also didn't change our price is what we don't know x well we want to sell 16 000 cases so i'm gonna put that in a sixteen thousand if we sell our full capacity our profit will be eighty two thousand dollars once i have four out of these five items i can just solve for the rest using the profit equation so my profit is 82 000 equals revenue well revenue is going to be price times x and x is sixteen thousand minus the costs well that's going to be four dollars and fifty cents times sixteen thousand minus because i don't actually let's put brackets in here then that's going to be plus 30 000 our fixed costs once i put this together what we're going to do is clean up this equation moving the sides over i'm going to say 16 000 times price minus what goes in this whole bracket dump that into a calculator and it's a hundred and two thousand that equals eightytwo thousand so now i have price equals 82 000 plus 102 000 over 16 000 putting that into a calculator that is going to equal 184 000 over 16 000 which is 11.50 so our new price is 11.50 to find the break even in units all we have to do is the even equation so break even is just revenue is the same as costs our revenue is now 11.50 times x but our cost remains the same at thirty thousand dollars plus four dollars and fifty cents times x giving us eleven dollars 11.50 minus 450 as our contribution margin equals 30 000 that is going to end up with 1150 minus 450 is a contribution margin of seven dollars so we have x equals thirty thousand dollars divided by seven thousand dollars again noting those dollar signs disappear and we get 4285.71428 let's stop and look at that number can we sell 0.714 of a case of ice cream not really we're not selling carton by carton we're selling an entire case to our distributor so we have a key here always round up never round down if we round down we end up with a tiny loss that is not okay losing five cents is a loss a tiny profit is okay so we would prefer to end up up by five cents then down by five cents so we're always going to round up and say we need to sell 4 286 cases of ice cream let's do one last question question two rain city umbrellas does a thriving business and selling umbrellas each month they spend one thousand fifty seven dollars on rent for their prime umbrella kiosk and two thousand dollars on a salary for their sales person just highlight those numbers they also buy umbrellas wholesale for 750 per umbrella got a different color and then they sell each umbrella for 26 dollars to wet tourists find their break even point in sales so let's start by writing out all the elements of our formula we've got our fixed costs our variable costs are price so fixed costs here is going to be there's actually two things we're going to add together both rent and salaries gives us seven 3057. our variable cost is going to be seven dollars and fifty cents per umbrella that's how much it costs and our price is going to be twenty six dollars those are the variables we have our revenue is then twenty six dollars per umbrella x is the number of umbrellas our cost is going to be that 3057. plus an extra 7.50 for every umbrella we make to find the break even we set profit equals zero or we just do revenue equals costs those are equivalent so let's do revenue equals costs we have 26x equals 3057 plus 750 x we move things over 26 minus 750 x equals 3057. that's the same as x equals 3057 over 18.50 and just to write down 1850 is our contribution margin or our gross profit per item that's nice to know it's pretty healthy profit margins in umbrellas solving this we end up with x equals 165 we know we can't sell a quarter of umbrella of an umbrella so let's look if we sell 165 umbrellas then our profit is going to be well that would end up being negative four dollars and 50 cents and that's by putting in just our revenue minus cost so i'm writing in the equation put an extra minus there 3057. if we sell 166 umbrellas our profit ends up being exactly 14 dollars here we have something going on this is a loss losses are not good if we sold 166 that would be a small profit and that's okay so we need to sell 166 umbrellas not 165 or because it the question asked for sales we need to make twenty six dollars times 166 which is the same as 4300 or 4316 dollars in sales hi welcome to lesson seven simple interest today we're going to start talking about time value money how money changes over time and the key here is time value money i'm going to write that down because this is going to come up again and again and that's the shortcut on our calculator this works via interest interest is money that you earn on investments in that case high rates are best or interest is the money that we pay on loans in that case low rates are best which case every problem we have we're going to have to decide am i borrowing money or am i investing money and that's how we're going to pick the basic which one is better so let's look at the two basic types of interest and those are simple and compound they are used for different things simple is what we're going to do today and in our next lesson we're going to talk about compound interest which is used more often however starting with simple we're going to come to a basic equation and everything we do is going to stem from this and that is going to be i equals p r t where i is the interest earned p is the principal whatever we invest or borrow and r is the interest rate i'm going to put annual there because that's important we're going to see this and t is time in years to illustrate what i really mean by time value money i'm going to give you a choice would you rather have one hundred dollars today or would you prefer to have one hundred dollars next year same amount of money different time well i don't know about you but i would prefer to have money today that's basically what we're doing we're trying to figure out today versus next year but let's change this now what would you prefer one hundred dollars today or two hundred dollars next year this is a harder question me personally i'm okay with waiting until next year but you might need the money now that's what's going to do how much does something have to be worth in the future to make it equally valuable so for the rest of the course we're going to be dealing with this question what's better money now or money later if we have less now and more later when are those things going to be the same or equivalent to us we're gonna jump right into a problem question one you deposit a thousand dollars into a bank that pays ten percent simple how much interest would you earn if you left the money in for two years for this whole question we're going to be using the equation i equals prt our p or principal is a thousand dollars that's how much money we're investing today our r sorry about that is going to be 10 simple which is the same as 0.10 and our t is going to vary so part a two years and since t is measured in years t is going to be two in this case i'm going to set this up i equals p r t is one thousand dollars times ten percent times two and when i put that in we've made two hundred dollars in interest let's write that down we have two hundred dollars in interest we have a future value this is something we're going to be talking about a lot of fv equals well we have the one thousand dollars we had and then we add 200 which means now we've got 1200 dollars okay let's go on to part b what if t is six months in this case what we're going to do is translate t into years and we can do this by using our conversions from chapter one there are 12 months in a year so six times months times a year divided by 12 months equals 6 over 12 years or 0.5 years for a lot of these unit conversions in time it's going to be simple to do it in your head six months is half a year but for other questions when we start talking about quarters and days it'll be easier to do an official unit conversion so be aware of that i'm going to cross off those months just so this looks good so let's look at how much interest we have i equals p r t our principal is still a thousand dollars our r is still 0.10 but our time is now 0.5 which means we have made 50 dollars in interest let's try that one more time what if t equals 9 months in this case that's the same as 9 over 12 years or 0.75 you should have i equals 75 one of the important things about simple interest is that we often use things on a daily rate so we end up counting days a lot in the review for chapter one there's a video on how to use the date calculator for your ba two plus i encourage you to check that out so what we're going to do is go from march 3rd to november the 7th so march 3rd on our calculator is going to be march that's the third month 03 third day and it doesn't matter what year we choose so i'm going to choose 20 because that's this year november 7th well that's going to be the 11th month the 7th day and again i'm going to go with 2020. going over to our calculator i'm going to go to this date function which is above 1 and set my first date as 3.0320 enter scroll down my second date is 11.07 enter i'm going down to dvd which was days between days and i'm going to press compute that tells me that it's 249 days so in that case i have t is 249 days and in order to change that into years i'm going to remember that one year is 365 days we're just always going to stick with 365 days for this class if you're doing something where you need to worry about leap years you'll be using a computer so what i'm going to use is 249 divided by 365 years as my t value i'm going to leave that as a fraction so now i have i equals p r t again for this whole question it's one thousand times 10 times 249 over 365. put that into a calculator and i'm going to do that clearing out of my dates 1000 times 0.1 times 249 divided by 365 that is 68.22 cents okay i'm going to make some notes about dates one of the notes is save all of our digits the best practice is to just use a fraction in our calculator that's why we didn't compute what 249 over 365 is leap year let's write this down every four years we have 366 days and it's even more complicated than that that every 100 years or so we skip the leap year and every thousand dollars we skip the skipping thousand dollars it's thousand years guys okay and i'm going to say in this course we will always use 365. as the base or denominator don't worry about 366. for today for this course we're just going to ignore leap year and i'm going to make sure that no calculations take place over leap year what i would like you to do now is to pause this video and do the next three questions okay you should have for these questions t equals 261 over 365 t equals 123 over 365 and t equals 328 over 365. that should give you the following interest calculations 71.50 and 70 cents and 89 and 86 cents one thing i'm gonna note every time we do something like this that is not what i was trying to do let me try that again eh good enough okay here our interest is linear if we get one hundred dollars after one year we get two hundred dollars after two year and three hundred dollars after three year now that we know how to find the interest we're going to solve for other variables first we're going to start with finding the principal on december the 1st your oneyear term deposit comes due when you collect the principal plus 120 in interest the term deposit paid six percent simple interest how much money did you deposit let's start with our equation everything we do starts with this i equals prt a linear equation solving for p means moving r and t to the other side p equals i divided by rt i is 102 dollars p well that's what we're looking for r that's going to be six percent or 0.06 and t is one year putting that together we end up with p equals 120 divided by 0.06 times one or one twenty divided by point zero six is two thousand dollars even so we invested two thousand dollars let's try that one more time 18 months ago you purchased a bond that paid 7.5 simple interest you cashed on the bond and received the principal plus 337 dollars and 50 cents in interest find the principal again pause and work this out okay p equals i divided by r t 337.50 divided by seventy five zero point seven five times one point five putting that all in three thousand dollars now we're going to solve for time on may 31st you decided it was time to start a new life in the palm trees you emptied out your bank account you received your principal of 1750 an interest of dollars and 50 cents how long had your money been in the bank if the account paid interest at five percent simple so let's write this down again i equals p r t when we solve for t we end up with i divided by p times r so let's look at all the things we have i p equals p rt our interest is going to be 437.50 our principal is 1750. our rate is five percent simple and time well that's what we're going to solve for so now i put this into my equation t equals i divided by p times r i'm going to put this into the calculator so you can see how i do that 437.5 divided by 1750 and i like to press equals and then divide by 0.05 and i end up with 5. and t is always measured in years does it matter that it's may 31st not really let's do this again question 5. on your 65th birthday you eagerly cash in one of your rrsps or retirement savings plan you receive a total of four thousand two hundred ninety five dollars your original investment was three thousand and your interest was paid at seven percent simple how many months was your money in the rrsp this is a slightly more complicated problem because we don't have our interest instead we have a future value of four thousand two hundred and ninety five dollars that is principal plus interest together our principal is three thousand dollars three thousand dollars plus what equals four thousand two hundred five well we know that we must have made 1295 in interest which is 4295 minus 3 000. our interest rate is seven percent and our t is what we're looking for and we're looking for it in months which we're going to get to at the end i'm going to scroll up a little bit and start again with t by our formula before t equals p over sorry i over p times r i will fix that so when i put that in i end up with 1 295 divided by 3 000 times 0.07 let's look at that on the calculator one two nine five divided by three thousand dollars equals and divide that by .07 and i usually like to do my division in two steps like that and i end up with six point one six six six six seven and remember this is in years six and a bit years to get this into months the way we want well i'm going to have to remember that one year is 12 months writing down this formal calculation helps us to make sure that we divide and multiply properly so i'm going to multiply this times 12 and once i do that you'll see that it is exactly 74 months finally in time we're going to look at this question how long will it take to double your money at eight percent simple well i've got so let's start with i equals p r t i know that r is eight percent and i know that t is what i'm looking for but i don't know i or p so my tip is going to be pick any p just like we did in chapter one we don't know a number we can make something up because everything is proportional i always use one hundred dollars when i can a thousand one all good answer if i invest a hundred dollars then to double it makes i going to be also a hundred dollars or future value is 200 100 plus 100 so if i make a hundred dollars in interest i've doubled it so i've got t equals i over p times r or 100 divided by 100 times 0.08 notice that the 100 is the same on the top on the bottom no matter what number i chose it would end up that way so all i have to do is divide take point zero eight and say one divided by that there's a handy button for this on the calculator 12.5 years now we're going to solve for r same equation exact same thing except this time i equals p rt we're solving for r when we rearrange this we get r equals i divided by p times t on march the sixth you deposit three thousand dollars into a bank account you withdraw the principal and interest totaling three thousand one hundred twenty three dollars and 29 cents on december the 31st what interest rate was paid so what we're going to do is see which things we need to do here we deposited three thousand dollars that's the principle our interest is going to be 123.29 or the future value minus the principal three thousand one hundred twenty three dollars and twenty nine cents minus three thousand dollars i'm just gonna rehighlight that r well that's what we are solving for at this time and t i'm going to put this in already but i would like you guys to take the time pause if you'd like and show that you can do in the calculator finding out that march the 6th to december 31st is 300 days i'm gonna remind you that date one is march the sixth third month sixth day uh let's pretend it's 2020. some people like to present it's 2 000 then you don't have to put anything in at all and it goes until december 31st and you're computing days between days so you can go ahead and do that on your own let's put this in r equals 123.29 divided by 3 000 times 300 over 365. this is a little more tricky to do i'm going to show you how to do this on the calculator if you're familiar with algebra you might want to simplify this expression but what i'm going to do is start with the bottom putting this into the calculator 300 days divided by 365 equals i'm gonna multiply that by three thousand dollars that's the denominator now what i'm going to do is use that 1 over x button to put it on the bottom and multiply it by 123.29 that gives me almost exactly five percent that's a nice even number forgetting about the round off one more on december 16 2011 you withdrew your entire christmas fund of 2098.63 from your account you deposited 2 000 on february 19th 2011. what simple interest was paid i want you guys to pause writing that down and then i will show you the answer ready here's the answer we end up with six percent make sure that you can count those days and get 300 days if not this is a really good thing to talk to me about during lab okay finally we're ready to solve for the future value the future value is the principal plus the interest how much money we have in the future you've decided to start a new car fund you deposit six thousand dollars into an account paying 10 simple how much money will you have in 50 months okay so let's look at this future value is principal plus i i equals p r t that means that future value is principal plus principal times r t what we can do is factor out this p and we get 1 plus r t this is a formula that we're going to see a lot of and if i want to go backwards because we're going to see this p equals fv divided by 1 plus rt these are new equations that we're going to see are sometimes easier to use in this case i never need to solve for i so f b p r t future value is what i'm trying to find the present value is 6 000 r is 10 and t is 50 months which is 50 over 12 years and i'm going to leave that as 50 over 12. so the future value equals the principal times 1 plus 0.1 times 50 over 12. i'm going to put that into the calculator now let's pull up our calculator and i like to work from the inside out and you can use your brackets to do this any way you want 50 divided by 12 is this times 10 percent add 1 equals now i'm going to multiply that by 6 000 and i end up with 8 500 i don't have the interest here it's easy to tell that the interest is going to be future value minus principal which is eighty five hundred dollars minus six thousand dollars is twenty five hundred but it's good to know we don't need that intermediate value okay let's do another one like this on december 31st you were paid a loan to the hammerhead finance and loan company you repaid six thousand dollars which was principal and interest on a fiveyear loan at 10 simple how much money did you borrow well in this case i don't know i or p i need to use this future value one p equals f v divided by one plus r t so let's write that down p f b r and t principles what i'm trying to find the future value is six thousand dollars because that was principal plus interest the interest rate is ten percent and the time was five years putting that into our equation here i get p equals six thousand dollars divided by one plus zero point one times five this time i'm going to simplify the denominator i think that ends up being easier to put into a calculator well point one times five is point five so i end up with six thousand divided by one point five well that is exactly four thousand dollars so that's how much we borrowed i'm going to do a little calculator note here 1 plus 0.10 times 5 with our brackets the way they should be multiplication before addition is 1 plus 0.5 is 1.5 if i do this wrong one plus 0.1 addition first and then multiply it by 5. that's chain mode i end up with 1.1 times 5 which is 5.5 this is wrong this is not the way we should be doing things so pay attention to the algebra and how you put things in the calculator it's okay to use extra steps hi and welcome to lesson 8 compound interest let's start by remembering simple interest when we talk about simple interest we are only sorry i'm going to race we only earn interest on the principal so only on the principle do we earn interest with compound interest it's different what's happening with compound interest is every time we get interest we add that back to the principal and we earn interest on it let's look at what these look like as a graph okay simple interest looks like a line so i'm just going to uh do this there we go so this is simple interest and what we're looking at here is the future value and over here we've got time the more time we spend the more money we get compound interest is a little bit different instead of being a straight line it's going to end up looking like an exponential curve i have to draw it in this way there we go exponential versus linear exponential grows really really fast over the long term well simple interest a linear curve stays the same that's the difference between it so what we're going to do is look at a very simple example so let's invest a thousand dollars at 25 simple one note you're going to see throughout these lectures and throughout this entire course i often use really big interest rates no bank out there is paying 25 simple but big interest rates make the math and the arithmetic easier to see and that's why we use it not because there's an investment that actually gets 25 simple so let's do that for a year in that case our future value is going to be principal times 1 plus rt our principal was a thousand dollars one plus 0.25 times one once i dump that into a calculator i get two hundred and fifty dollars okay let's reinvest so we're gonna take that money and we're going to put it in for another year now our future value is going to be 1250 times 1.25 that's the same as up here and that gives me one thousand five hundred sixty two dollars and fifty cents okay what about simple for two years so if i just did this for two years instead of taking that money out and then reinvesting i would end up with a thousand dollars one plus point two five times two is fifteen hundred dollars so in this case i've got sixty two extra dollars we have an extra 62 dollars because we took the money out and reinvested and otherwise we got interest on the interest and our interest to remember after the first year was 250 so if i look at that 250 dollars times one uh yeah let's go sorry 0.25 and times one that ends up being sixty two dollars and fifty cents so what i've ended up with is exactly the interest on the interest scrolling down that leads us to a formula so after many years when i'm compounding this way every year i'm taking it out and i'm reinvesting after one year i have a thousand times 1.25 two years three years well let's multiply it by 1.25 again and i do that a bunch of times so after n years where n is a big number or any number future value equals one thousand 1.25 to the power of n i'm multiplying this together n times that's an exponent so now i have an exponential equation let's look more about how often we compound how often do we compound in that example we compounded annually and that means once a year so something like a gic will be annual interest semiannually that means twice a year that is going to be what we're going to see later on the course is mortgages in canada are compounded sempi annually quarterly quarterly is something that you haven't probably seen a lot but what is used a lot in business that means four times per year or every three months which is confusing three months and a quarter because three times four equals 12 months in a year quarterly is how businesses file their reports and do their financial statements monthly this is probably i'm not what you've seen the most and i'm just going to write that 12 times per year and this is something like your credit card or your bank account this is one of the most common monthly and then we have weekly this isn't really used very much but it's nice to know i'm actually going to put biweekly because we're going to see that in mortgages that's 26 times per year or every two weeks and a lot of you if you are working will be paid biweekly or every two weeks in which case you need to know that i'm going to add in daily that's every day some bank accounts work that way et cetera i could compound a thousand times a year we don't do that very often but it's possible okay we compound and compounding means to compute interest add it to the principle okay so we compute it and we add it to the principal how many times per year i'm going to come up with m times per year i'm also going to write this actually i'm not going to say p let's say c y on the calculator and we're going to see this later on but the calculator uses that i'm going to write in some m's i'm going to scroll up here and i'm going to write m equals 1 m equals 2 m equals 4 for quarterly's m equals 12 for monthly m equals 52 m equals 26 biweekly and m equals 365 because i'm ignoring leap year that's probably all the ones you will see okay let's do some terminology nominal that's the english word for in name only and we call that j with a little m subscript and i'm just going to write in name only because we don't use it to compute so let's look at an example of nominal so my bank pays a very large j12 a nominal rate of 24 that means it's a monthly rate so the interest is paid into my bank account once per month this actually means how much per month two percent 24 over 12 is two percent per month so nominal is not what were you going to use in our computations 24 isn't going to go into our math 2 is and this is called the periodic rate i'm going to rewrite that that's .02 and that's called the periodic rate and that's the rate per period over that time this is a formula it's fairly easy to remember but when in doubt look something up so nominal is j m then the periodic is i and we call it i equals j m divided by m so if our nominal was j 12 equals 24 then i equals 24 over 12 equals two percent i think we have most everything we need now to be able to share the formula for compound interest and this is the important one you'll probably end up memorizing it but you can always look at it on tests and this is going to be fv equals pv 1 plus i to the power of n explain what these things mean fb we've seen that that's called future value when we talk about compound interest we use pv to be the opposite of future value is present value what we have now and that's the same as p for principle they're the same thing i is the periodic rate so that would be j m over m if we have that and n is the number of periods so the number of months or weeks depending on how we're compounding it okay let's start with question number one we're going to invest 100 for one year with a nominal rate of 24 and now we're going to look at a whole bunch of different kinds of compounding so starting with m m is how many times per year we compound for annually this is one for semiannually this is two what i would like you to do is keep on pausing this video and fill things out so fill out quarterly and monthly now okay hopefully you paused and came up with four quarters per year or 12 months per year now i'm going to write in the nominal rate annual means j1 equals 24 semiannual j2 equals 24 pause hopefully you have written in j4 equals 24 and j12 equals 24 for the periodic rate what we do is we divide it so remember i'm going to write up here i equals j m over m so if m is 1 we're just dividing by 1. that makes this really easy semiannual we're going to divide it by 2 so 24 divided by 2 is 12 percent you guys try it pause hopefully you have i equals six percent that's 24 over four and i equals two percent or 24 divided by 12. how many periods are in a year well how many years are in a year that's actually fairly easy one how many years how sorry how many half years are in a year that's going to be two how many quarters in a year four quarters in a year and 12 months in a year so now we're going to do our future value computations i'm going to write over here fv is 100 one plus .24 to the power of one because it's one year that gives me 124 dollars for semiannual well i take that hundred dollars and it's one plus i that's 1.12 but it's happening twice when i compound it twice i get 125. and 45.44 your turn well hopefully you paused it and came up with fb is 100 1.06 to the power of 4 which is 126 dollars and 25 cents and finally 126.82 cents which is the same as 100 1.02 to the power of 12. look at these one thing you should notice is that the future value is increasing the more you compound the bigger it gets if you want to know the limit the absolute biggest it can be we'll talk about that a little bit later but you can use your calculator to compute that fairly nicely so the more we compound the more money we get up to a certain point compounding makes a huge difference in our equation over here we use i not that nominal rate we only use the 24 when we're talking about annual okay let's start with question two you have five thousand dollars and you deposit the money in a mutual fund that has an average return of nine percent compounded annually how much will you have when you retire in 25 years okay so let's look at all the elements of our equation i'm going to rewrite the compound interest equation future value equals present value 1 plus i to the power of m future value is the thing we're trying to find present value here that's 5 000 dollars average return of nine percent that's going to be one because it says annual that annual means it's j1 equals nine percent or 0.09 that means that i is going to be 9 divided by 1 which is just 0.09 that's the good thing about annual and why people use them let's change colors so we can see it a little better n is going to be 25 years here n is counting years because it's the same as annual those things go together if it was a monthly we would talk about months so our future value actually let's write this at the bottom we end up with future value equals five thousand one plus nine percent which is 1.09 to the power of 25. i'm just going to show this on the calculator because sometimes it can get difficult 5000 times 1.09 to the power of that's this y to the power of x and then i write 25 and i should get 43 000 it's a big number if you're getting the wrong answer and i'd like you to try this it's a good chance that your settings are wrong so go back to week zero look at the video on how to do your settings and make sure that it's on aos mode not chn just to check what if i had done simple interest i would have started with five thousand dollars and i would have added one plus nine percent times 25 years dumping that into a calculator i would have had sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty dollars what would you prefer forty three thousand sixteen thousand this is definitely better to practice this i'm gonna give you a nice little bonus we do with your age so that's 65 or whatever retirement date you want minus your age and i'm gonna say let's use j1 equals six percent that's a more conservative estimate of how you can do in the market over the long term okay let's do another one you deposit ten thousand dollars at j4 equals twelve percent for 54 months how much money will you have let's go back to finding all of our items our present value what we start with is 10 000 j4 that's a quarterly nominal rate is 12 or 0.12 that means that i equals 0.12 divided by 4. or three percent that's what we're going to use in our calculation n n is 54 months but we don't want it to be monthly we want it to be quarterly so we're going to use a unit conversion just like we did in chapter one to change it from months into quarters and i'm going to do this the long way once you're more comfortable with it you can do this quickly you can sometimes do it in your head but i'm going to go very slowly i'm going to note that one year is equal to 12 months now i cross off my months i'm also going to note that one year and i put that on the bottom right because i want to cancel things off is equal to four quarters so what i have here is 54 times 4 divided by 12 quarters or 18 quarters i'm going to write this one more time you might look at me and say hey but you already told me that there are three months and a quarter that's right 54 divided by 3 is 18 quarters either way one of the strange things is that quarters seem to be hard it's hard to remember it's three months your brain thinks quarter four it should be four months that's incorrect okay back to our equation future value is present value one plus i to the power of n present value is ten thousand dollars uh i was three percent n is eighteen quarters and that gives us seventeen thousand twenty four dollars and thirty three cents that's how much money i have how much interest did i make can use the same thing we did before interest is the difference between how much money we have and how much money we started with in other words i have seventeen thousand dollars and some change i started with ten thousand dollars so now i must have made seven thousand and twenty four dollars and thirty three cents in interest question four you would like to save twenty thousand dollars so you can take a year off in 42 months how much should you deposit today if money earns four percent compounded semiannually okay let's note that we have the same formula we start every single example with this time we're trying to solve for present value not future value so i'm going to divide both sides by 1 plus i to the n and come up with this formula present value equals future value over 1 plus i to the n that's important it's a formula that you are going to see many times we'll go put a box around it let's look at what we have in this problem we're trying to find a future value of twenty thousand dollars we have a semiannual interest rate of four percent which means that i is going to be 0.04 over two or two percent n is 42 months and i want to get that into half years most people can remember quite easily that one half year is exactly six months so in the end we end up with seven half years going back to this equation our present value equation pv equals twenty thousand dollars divided by 1.02 to the power of seven put that in i'm going to go with 1.02 to the power of seven solve for that and use that one over x button multiply it by twenty thousand dollars and i end up with one thousand sorry seventeen thousand four hundred eleven dollars and twenty cents one more question how much money do you need to invest to earn a thousand dollars in interest in 18 months if the interest rate is eight percent compounded quarterly this is going to be a weird one because we don't know the present value or the future value instead all we know is the difference between those things is a thousand dollars that's why this is a tricky question uh quarterly n is 18 months and i'm going to go ahead and say that six quarters but if you need some help getting from months to quarters go back and watch the other videos and do a proper unit conversion i'm going to use a few of these equations future value equals present value plus interest and present value equals future value over 1 plus i to the n putting those together i end up with present value equals future value still don't know what that is uh what was my interest rate eight percent well let's just remember that it's eight percent quarterly so it's two percent as our periodic rate and this is going in for six quarters okay put this together and i know what fb is so what i'm going to do is substitute this into that i'm going to write that again pv equals pv plus i and i is a thousand dollars divided by 1.02 to the sixth this looks confusing but we can solve this with algebra with algebra i know i'm gonna multiply both sides by 1.02 to the sixth and i could work out what that is but i've decided to leave it for the moment and i get 1.02 to the power of 6 times present value equals present value plus one thousand well that's easier for me to handle moving this around i end up with 1.02 to the power of 6 minus one times the present value equals a thousand dollars well mul divide both sides and then dump that into a calculator and we get 7926.29 i'm just going to show you over here on the calculator i'm going to go with 1.02 to the power of six minus one equals a big thing i'm gonna store that store one clear and you can notice when i press recall one there it is so now i'm gonna say a thousand that is ten thousand let's do one i hope you were having better luck with your real calculators as opposed to the silly emulator recall one and we get the same thing i have over there ba two plus calculator time it's time to learn about tvm time value money and you'll see that on your calculator and if you look at the instruction manual that came with it you'll see all the things that i'm doing we're going to illustrate this with a an example as usual and you're going to see this chart written again and again and again typed out hand written all over the place i'm going to be writing the same thing every single time so mclean's magazine estimates that it will cost 130 000 for a fouryear university education when children born this year reach university in 18 years you have ten thousand dollars to invest today what annual rate is required to reach 130 000 i'm going to write this in as an equation we know our present value future value equation is future value is present value 1 plus i to the power of n the future value i want here is and thirty thousand dollars that equals present value sorry we know what that present value is it's ten thousand dollars one plus i and i don't know what i is to the power of 18. that's a difficult equation because i'm going to have to take an 18th root which i can do with the calculator however it's easier to use the tvm functions on your calculator and that is this line over here n i y p v p m t f v and i'm going to c n i y p v p m t f v i'm going to enter it in in the order that i like to put it in the calculator n is the number of periods n i y p y c y talk about that in a second pv pmt fv n is 18. so what i'm going to do is write this underneath 18. iy that's what i'm going to try to find cpt if you remember means compute pycy that just means m so m here is how many times per year and i'm looking for an annual rate that means that my pyc way is y is one i'm going to show you how to enter that in a second present value i started with ten thousand dollars payment we're going to talk about this later on in chapter five we'll talk about annuities and then i'm going to explain what it is the important thing is to put zero in for future value i'm going to put in 130 000. to make it balanced correctly and not get an error we want a present value and future value needs to be negative i'm just going to make that negative and we're going to talk about that a little bit more later let's put this in to the calculator the way you do this is you type 18 first then you press n i y will leave p y c y that's above the interest rate so i go second interest rate and it says p y equals one one enter if you want you can scroll down and see that py and cy are both there we'll explain the difference later but they're both one present value is ten thousand dollars let's go enter not enter sorry present value payment is zero so i press zero payment and i'm trying to get 130 thousand dollars and again i said i had to make that negative so now i say compute i y and i come up with iy which is the nominal rate is 15.31498 percent let's see what happens if i put 130 000 positive into my future value now when i compute i y i get an error so you know that you made a mistake if i want to check out what's in there i press recall and then the number now i can say oh i wanted that to be negative and now it is in correctly okay part b how much do you need to invest if you can only expect a rate of return of j two equals 12 percent so i'm going to write everything again well and i'm going to fill in the things i know from before how much do i need to invest that means i'm computing the present value and my future value still needs to be that hundred and thirty thousand dollars payment is zero for this chapter pycy however is now two to show that it's a semiannual rate iy this is important we put the nominal in there we're putting our nominal rate in for iy because the calculator knows to divide it by 2 to come up with 0.06 we also put this in in percent not in decimal so it's 12 and not 0.12 and well it's going to be 18 years times twice a year that's 36. important to note so let's put those things in i type 36 n 12 i y i go second i y and now i set make two enter scroll down a couple times and it's two i'm pressing clear a few times to get rid of that now pv i'm going to leave that alone payment still zero future value i'm going to say recall future value it's the same so i don't need to reenter it if you're doing the same problem clearing everything i go compute present value and i come up with 15956.30 and i could have done this with a formula pretty simply that would have been fv over 1.06 because that's i to the power of 36. you can confirm that that is the same thing but the calculator is easier and faster final part you deposit twelve thousand dollars and invest in bonds that pay six percent compounded semiannually how old will your child be when they can start university what we're trying to do here is solve for n so let's write down all of the items that we're looking for p y c y present value payment future value i like to change colors but truly it doesn't matter note that i'm computing n six percent computed semiannually present value is now twelve thousand dollars payment is still zero and my future value remains 130 thousand dollars so let's put that in six i y second pres p y cy is the same because i haven't changed yet twelve thousand dollars is now what i started with and i'll press recall future value is still negative 130. let's compute n well it says n equals 80.606 and that's in half years so to get that back into years i'm going to have to divide by 2. that is about 40.3 years so not really ideal let's play around a little bit i'm going to go back to my future value 130 000 and make it positive instead of negative now let's compute n error five good thing to know your errors when you get an error five it's probably a sign error you can also get an error too and you might end up with a negative n we'll see that later on if you get a negative n you also made a mistake and you know to fix your mistake i'm just going to know what the formula for this is if i was trying to solve this it would be 12 000 1.03 to the power of n equals 130 000 to solve this i'm going to need to use logarithms so if you remember your logarithms really well go ahead and do that i'm going to stick with using my ba ii plus calculator today we're going to talk about equivalent effective and average rates first i'm going to define one term because we're going to see this a lot effective rate just means an annual rate and we already know that means that it is j with an underscore of one or compounded annually so when we use that word that's all we mean is an annual rate comp pounded sorry let's put it once a year equivalent rate is our other term an equivalent really means that things are the same and i'm going to put that in quotes mathematically equivalent and we often use some curly brackets to mean equivalent that means things that are the same in the way that we care about sometimes you will see as well because the curly can be approximate three lines instead of two but it means the same in the way we care about in terms of interest rates the thing we care about the most is how much money we get out of them we don't care how often the bank compounds we care that they give the same future value let's say we put a hundred dollars in each one and after a year we have the same future value that means they're equivalent because as long as we care as far as we are concerned we don't care how often the bank is doing accounting we care that we get the same amount of money and we usually measure after a year because that means that whether it's monthly biweekly daily we're going to get the same result let's jump right into a problem the humongous bank believes in offering its customers choices a banker offers you two different options for your investments the premium growth account offers interest at j2 equals 10 i'm just going to write that here so we can see better and the accelerator is an effective rate of 10.25 what should we choose well what we're going to do is invest 100 in each just like we said before and you could put any amount here i just find 100 really useful and we're going to see that most of the reason is because 100 makes the math easy so in each account so let's start i'm going to scroll down a little to j2 equals 10 that's the premium uh spell premium correctly okay so after one year we have a future value of 100 times 1.05 because 5 is half of 10 to the power of 2 because there's two half years in a year which means at the end of the day i have 110 dollars and 25 cents now let's look at the next one so that's going to be j1 equals 10.25 percent and that is called the accelerator so at the end of one year we have 100 and here because it's only compounded once a year we don't have to divide that j to get an i and we put that to the power of one which means at the end we have a hundred and ten dollars and twenty five cents so which one is better well it makes no difference whatsoever they're the same or they are equivalent so i'm going to write that in a few different ways j2 equals 10 is equivalent to j1 equals 10.25 percent j2 equals 10 percent is effectively you'll see this given a lot effectively means the same as but here we're meaning it as equivalent to the effective rate of 10.25 percent when we put the word effective in we don't need to put that one in because it is assumed you're also going to see the term apr or annual percent return we're not going to use that overly in this course but know that that means the same thing and either way we are going to get 10.25 interest per year okay let's talk about converting rates with your ba2 plus calculator this is going to be the easiest way to do converting between equivalent weights because it's already given in our calculator to do this we're going to use the iconv or interest conversion worksheet you get to that by pressing 2nd and finding interest conversion which lives over the number 2. and that stands for interest conversion so i go second then i type in interest conversion and we've got three things in here and at this point you should be getting used to entering things in your ba two plus calculator enter things compute one thing and there's three things here so if you see nom i'm gonna scroll down eff that stands for effective scroll down one more time and we get cy and that stands for the nominal rate so that's j n whatever it is the effective rate i'm going to write that in the effective rate is j1 and cy is n whatever the subscript is so let's convert from at 10.25 sorry let's do j2 equals 10 percent in that case to convert it what i'm going to do is see why let's go back to nominal it's 10 enter scroll down eff i'm going to scroll down again because i don't care about that cy so let's put num equals 10 cy equals 2 and then we type in enter and now we scroll back up to nominal effective sorry and press compute 10.25 and that's what we had everything here goes through effective so i'm going to go on a longwinded metaphor let's pretend we have our train system the train system is based in vancouver if you want to get to nanaimo you have to stop in vancouver if you want to get to prince george you're routing through vancouver this is something in the north and then we have kelowna so these are four cities in british columbia and everything is going to pass through that middle one that's the effective rate j1 so if i want to go from j2 that was 10.10 and i want to go to let's say a monthly rate over here i have to convert into effective and then i have to convert to monthly let's say i want to go from a quarterly rate to a monthly rate i'm going to have to go convert from quarterly to effective and then over to monthly so we're always going back and forth but we're always routing through that middle to practice we're going to convert a whole bunch of these things just using the calculator i'm not going to do everything on camera because that's incredibly boring in my opinion so i'm going to let you fill in some of it but let's start with j1 equals 12. so what i'm going to do that's an effective rate remember so i'm going to set eff equals 12. and i want to convert that to semiannual so that means that cy is two and now i go down to nominal and i press compute and i get 11.66 percent and that's a j2 let's do it again for quarterly we go up to cy we change to four and now we recompute the nominal and we get j4 equals 11.49 etc percent now let's do one more monthly i change that to 12 i change nominal by using my compute button and i get j 12 equals 11.3865 i'm just going to put some dot dot dots so i don't have to round fairly simple so now let's do j2 equals eight percent so i'm going to go back up and i don't have to clear this but i don't i want to so what i'm going to do is press 2nd clear and that sets everything back to the base you don't need to do it because you can overwrite but it's useful so this time i'm going to start with a nominal and that's 8. i start with a nominal rate of eight percent and i change my cy to be two because it's semiannual now i go to the effective and that's what i'm computing j1 is 8.16 now that i have the effective rate i can find the quarterly and monthly so to find quarterly i set that to be 4 and my nominal is now 7.92 one more cy is 12. nominal is 7.86 i'm just going to put some dot dot dots one thing to notice our rates are changing in size this is a smaller number because we're compounding more often which we know gives us more interest a smaller interest rate gets us the same amount of number as the bigger so in this case these two numbers are going to be bigger than 10 percent and this number is going to be smaller than 10 percent i'd like you guys to pause the video and continue to fill out the table i'm going to unpause and everything will be magically filled in see like magic it's all nicely filled in so make sure that you get the same answers as me mortgages charge interest on a semiannual basis but payments are usually made monthly change a mortgage rate of j two equals seven percent to a rate compounded monthly we're going to come back to this again when we start talking about mortgages this is one of the big differences between banking in canada and banking in the united states canadian banks compound mortgages semiannually they don't really though they actually advertise semiannual rates but compound usually using an equivalent rate every time you make a payment that's opposed as opposed to american banks that report with monthly rates that's how they advertise this wasn't always true once upon a time before computers were widespread it was actually compounded every six months so every payment you made before six months no interest was accruing they all went towards principal which was a different type of mortgage and you would end up paying for a different amount of time and paying less interest things are different now that computers make this very simple so if you pay monthly they use an equivalent monthly rate if you pay biweekly and we're going to come to this uh more when we get to mortgages but biweekly is the way a lot of people are paid and that means you're paid 26 times a year then they're going to use the equivalent j26 often people do this because it works out with your payment scheme if you are paid that way okay so what we're going to do is find at the monthly rate and again we did this in the last one j2 goes to j1 goes to j12 we're always going through that effective rate so let's start with j2 equals seven percent and i'm going to use the calculator so we go to second interest conversion our nominal rate is seven my effective rate is what i'm looking for right now i have two go back to the effective rate and it's five 7.1225 not getting rid of any of those decimal places for now now i'm going to change cy to 12 and compute the nominal rate which is around 6.9 there we go okay but let's do it a different way and i'm going to say this is a check because i started at the beginning and said if i start with a hundred dollars how much do i have at the end so i'm gonna start with a hundred dollars and i'm going to invest it at seven percent dividing seven and two gives me three and a half so i do that and i end up with 107 dollars and 12 cents let's do that with the effective rate in the middle here 100 to the 1 is when i round it 107 12. same thing and finally let's do the last one i start with a hundred dollars one point i'm going to put that entire thing in here over 12. i'm going to say 1 plus that to the power of 12. okay i'm going to use the calculator for this because i don't want to round it at all so i'm going to clear and clearing lets me save that number i'm going to divide it by 100 first to make it a percent then i'm going to divide it by 12 and i'm going to add that to one now i'm going to take that to the power of 12 and multiply it by a hundred dollars and i get the same thing 107 dollars and 12 cents or 12 and a quarter they're all the same not only are they all the same when i was did the rounding there notice that i had these this is 7.122 the amount of interest i get is the effective rate the effective rate is exactly the interest you get on a hundred dollars if you don't want to divide by a hundred do it on a dollar that will give you seven point one two two five cents but it's easy enough to see it in percent let's do one more your credit card charges interest at one and a half percent per month find the effective rate credit cards one thing to remember is unless you're told differently all credit cards are monthly this is a piece of what we call domain knowledge it's knowledge that you really should have a question will not necessarily tell you that credit cards are monthly so that's something you need to know let's find the effective rate so first i can learn per means periodic rate anytime you see that word per month you know that that's the periodic rate at or per so that's the periodic rate so i equals 0.015 that means that j 12 equals 0.015 times 12 or 18 that's a lot that's more than one and a half it looks small when you say it monthly but you do have to end up multiplying that so let's see how much we have after one year and this is the same thing that we've been doing we start with a hundred dollars and we put it at well we know that it's 015 to the power of 12. so 100 times 1.015 to the power of 12. and that is going to give me 119.56 the effective rate or j1 it's 19.56 and you can check this using the interest conversion worksheet in part two of this lesson we're going to talk about average rates the big idea on this unit is that our interest rates are not stable they change over time and this is what happens when you invest in something like the stock market or mutual funds the rate is not fixed for a 10year investment it's going up and down with the market let's say not over time but over the course of our investment in this case i don't really care what it's doing every single month i care what it's doing on average and just so you know there's lots of types of averages when i talk about an average rate of return i'm definitely not talking about taking all the numbers adding them and dividing by the number of rates or the arithmetic mean when you take statistics you'll learn more about that but here what i care about is how much i get on average so if i invested at that average rate i want the same present value giving the same future value or they are equivalent so we're looking here at equivalent rates as usual the best way to learn a concept is to actually go through an example so let's start with example number five from the lesson premium savings bonds have the following rates all annual in the first year you make two percent in the second year you make five percent in the third year twelve in the fourth year fifteen percent and by year five you're making twenty four percent per year and i'm just going to do an aside these are exaggerated rates so that we can do the arithmetic easily not because i know of an investment that pays 24 so the first thing we're gonna do is figure out how much a thousand dollar investment would be worth at the end of the fifth year and we can do this with thousand dollars a hundred dollars anything but the question says a thousand so after one year well we start with a thousand and after one year we say 1.02 to the power of one that's how much money we have after the first year let's see how much that is 1 000 times 1.02 so i've made 20 dollars in interest okay now let's look at that second year in the second year we make five percent interest so i take everything i did before i'm going to put brackets around it though that isn't necessary and i'm going to multiply that by 1.05 to the power of 1. so now i have 15 30. i think i did that wrong so i'm going to stop following along with the calculator right now and now i'm going to say 1.12 to the power of 1 so this is the second third fourth year 1.15 finally 1.24 so let's do the entire thing with the calculator thousand times 1.02 times 1.05 indeed i had made a mistake there one times 1.12 at the end of the third year we have 199 dollars in interest fourth year we have 13.79 and finally a whopping let's put a one there at 1 710 and 52 cents and i'm going to leave this whole unrounded number okay so that's how much money i have that's my future value and i'm going to write the whole unrounded number down because i'm going to use this in the next part when we use things it's best not to round them store one i like to put a one in square brackets to remind myself of where i stored that in my calculator so now let's look at the average rate the average effective rate is the rate i would need to get to that future value so it's i where let's look at this if i take a thousand dollars and i go one plus i to the power of five years equals one seven one oh and i'm gonna put in all those decimal points this is solvable all i need to do is use a fifth root or 1 to the power of point something to the power of 0.2 but i'm not going to do that i'm going to use the calculator because as we've seen that tvm button on our calculator is really really useful that's a v okay n is five years the rate is what i'm trying to do it's effective so one i start with a thousand and i end with remember this has to be negative and that's so our equation can balance correctly so let's go into that and i'm going to leave make this negative and put it straight into the future value 1000 is the present value 0 is our payment our interest rate is what we're going to find make sure pycy is 1. nice and our n is 5. in that case i worked backwards but usually i work forwards so let's compute i y and we end up with 11.33 percent so i averaged 11.33 on this investment that means that on average even though sometimes we were making two percent and sometimes 24 had we invested at point three three percent for five years we would end up with the same thing so they're effective now i'm gonna write down a bad idea i'm gonna write bad idea first so you don't get a still of this and end up with a mistake two percent five percent 12 15 24 well there's five years we divide that all by five and what do we get eleven point six percent that is not the answer it doesn't work that way at all when we're talking about average rates we're talking about a particular kind of average a single number that is equivalent we're not talking about the arithmetic mean or that type of app let's just do a little one to illustrate what's going on our investment earns a hundred percent return in the first year and loses 50 percent in the second year what is the effective rate of return over two years in this case we don't have a number so let's make something up you've probably noticed by now that when i have to make something up i start with a hundred dollars some people use one dollar some people use a thousand you could use 312 dollars and 52 cents but that seems a little difficult for me so let's start with a hundred dollars at the end of the first year our future value is now a hundred dollars and it's earned a hundred percent return so that means it's one plus one that's our markup or percent change and that means that now we have two hundred dollars at the end of year two it's lost money it's lost fifty percent this is the same as a markdown we haven't overly talked about negative interest rates but negative interest rates happen a lot especially in the stock market we lose money over time hopefully we make more money than we lose but from month to month we might lose that's a negative interest rate this is a rate of negative fifty percent when i dump that in i end up with a hundred dollars so what's my average rate present value is 100 and at the end of two years i still have a hundred dollars that means that we averaged zero percent interest so this investment was equally as good as taking your money putting it in a box and putting it under your bed in general we say that we've lost money on something with a zero percent interest because we have inflation going on where money is worth less over time in 1989 to buy a chocolate bar might have cost me about 50 cents now a chocolate bar probably costs about a dollar 75 that's a huge change over time money is worth less and when you take econ you'll learn more about that how that is going to change things finally question 7 a mutual fund had returns of 12 compounded monthly in the first year 18 compounded annually in the second year and four percent compounded quarterly in the third year what would a thousand dollar investment three years ago be worth today so we can do this in multiple ways i'm going to confess i'm a big fan of algebra so i would probably write this out algebraically well i started with a thousand then i have one plus twelve percent over twelve first year to the power of one multiplied by 1.18 because it's annual and then 1 plus 0.04 divided by 4 quarterly for the third year so that's going to be 4. sorry this is 12 because it was for 12 months that's the way i would think to do this in my head and i would get the right answer however a lot of people most people prefer to use something like a calculator so what we're going to do is look at this by using our ba2 plus calculator and also by keeping track so i'm going to add one extra column and that's the year in the first year we earn 12 percent compounded monthly i'm gonna write j twelve equals twelve percent in the second year we have eighteen percent annual and i'm writing that in and in the third year we have j4 equals 4 and sometimes these can happen for multiple years the textbook whose pdf is up on our website our learning hub class has an example where things take place over multiple years so expect to see that as well okay so the first year that's 12 months and a monthly rate our interest rate is 12 that's a lot of 12s in a row and our present value was a thousand dollars and this is what we're going to compute next in our next year whatever my future value is i'm going to move that over to present value it's annual but it's an 18 interest rate payment is always zero and i'm still going to compute finally i'm going to do this again for four quarters quarterly four and whatever i got here i'm going to put there so let's try this i start and i go 12 for n my interest rate also 12 and i'm going to make sure my pycy turns to 12 and when you change py cy changes automatically we start with a thousand dollars make sure payment is zero and at the end of the first year we have negative one one two six point eight two five and we store everything i'm gonna make this positive because i'd like my present values to be positive but you don't need to do that i'm going to press present value what i've done here is put this into the present value so now let's clear and start at the beginning n is 1 i y is now 18. pycy is back to one present value i did payment i don't have to put in zero every time but i like to and i go compute future value and now i have 13 26. and that's negative sorry 13 29 and 65 cents i like to make it positive by just pressing that plus minus button and then i'm going to press present value what i've done now is store this in my present value clear that n is now four our interest rate is also four and my pycy has gone to four enter and i clear i've done my present value and payment already so i'm just going to compute the future value and i get 1383 0.648 anytime i see this i'm going to save it so store 1 in case i need it again and you never know when you're going to need it so the answer for a is the future value is 1 383 64 cents and you can go up here and see i've done this on my own off camera and i did get the exact same answer which is nice to know part b what was the average rate compounded monthly of return earned so we're trying to find the average rate one advantage is we already have this future value here so it's monthly for three years that means we're investing this for 36 months i y is what we're going to be looking for p y c y well that's monthly and i start with what i started with at the beginning a thousand dollars and i'm going to end with my future value 1383 dollars and change so let's put that in 36 n let's go to our pycy i already actually set that to be 12. good for me start with a thousand dollars pv zero payment it's always good to recall so i'm gonna say recall future value and know what i have recall is how you check things out so let's compute i y and then we find out that j 12 equals 10.87 and change and that's our average rate so if i had taken a thousand dollars and invested it at 10.87 compounded monthly after three years i would have thirteen hundred dollars okay let's do one more part part c the fun lost a hundred dollars in its fourth year whoops the average effective rate of return for the four years so what we're going to do is look at just that fourth year i don't need to use my tvm buttons we lost a hundred dollars so we started with 13 83 and 64 cents and we lost 100 so we end up with 1283.64 here i'm going to say it doesn't matter as much if we hold on to our rounding because now we're on a specific number and it's always good to hang on to our interest hang on to all those decimal places but it's less important in this particular example so now our future value is going to be always negative our payment's always zero we started out with a thousand dollars and we invested it and this is effective so it's annual over four years and our interest rate is what we're looking for so let's start n is four iy we can leave alone pycy now changes to one our present value is still a thousand dollars but our end or future value is oh we have to clear out a py negative at the end our future value is now 1200 and change so our interest rate is going to be smaller so we end up with 6.44 percent and that's how we do average interest rates importantly i'm going to say that you should be practicing this there's questions on the online homework as well as questions in the textbook this is a good thing to practice lesson 10 payment plans and making choices let's start with a question and we're going to work through this question and learn how to make decisions using interest rates for your first job after graduation you have decided to accept a contract position the manager is offered to pay you thirty thousand dollars at the end of the first year and thirty five thousand dollars at the end of the second year or to pay you twenty two thousand dollars now twenty thousand dollars at the end of the first year and twenty thousand dollars at the end of the second year which option is better and by how much if interest is at ten percent simple use today as your focal date so let's talk about comparing two choices sorry what we do is we pick a focal date or one is given to us and in the truth it doesn't matter which one we choose the better choice is the better at any time usually or often we use today today is a good focal date because computing it is nice then what we do is we compute all values at this date and then we pick the best one and the best one is the one where either we have the most money or we pay the least money depending what it is what we're going to do to help us is draw what's called a timeline timelines are something we're going to be doing a lot of in this course so i'm going to draw two of them one of them was perfect and one of them was not and i'm gonna put in the times zero is today all the times mentioned in the problem one year two years zero one year two years and i've drawn two of these because i have two options my options are a and b okay let's put in our money i like to say that money into my account is going to be an arrow down so this money goes into my account at one year in option one i get two payments one at a year and one at two years so i get thirty thousand dollars and then i get thirty five thousand dollars two years from now seventy sorry sixty five 000 in total but not for a while in option b i'm getting 22 000 right away 20 000 in a year and another twenty thousand dollars looking at this just so you can see the total here it's sixty five thousand dollars over the two years but i get have to wait a while until i get it in this one it's 40 plus 22 is a little bit less it's 62 000 but the fact that i'm getting some of it today is good so i'm going to use some arrows to show that i'm going to move everything to the focal date circle the focal date that's today and i'm going to move this over when we move something backwards we are starting with a future value and we're ending with a present value so what i'm going to do is find the present value of each of those payments and then add them together so here i've got present value 1 is thousand dollars and it's going backwards one year at simple interest and that was ten percent interest so that's what's happening present value two is thirty five thousand dollars over one plus times one let's just pull the calculator back up uh so let's look at those together 30 000 divided by 1.1 is 27 000 ish here sorry this should be a 2 here because it was 2 years just going to highlight that 2 because it's going 2 years i'm going to store this as well and then i'm going to do my present value 2 is 35 000 divided by 1.2 and that gives me 29 166. so my present value how much this is worth is found by adding those two things up and it's 56 000 so you can use the calculator i've already worked this out ahead of time so you can believe me that it's 56 439.39 let's go on to the second example so i'm finding present values for each thing future value 1 was 22 000 future value two is twenty thousand and future value three was also twenty thousand so present value one well that's just twenty two thousand it's not moving anywhere when something stays still we don't need to worry about interest present value two is going to be that twenty thousand dollars divided by one plus ten percent times one and present value two is going to be the same size payment but it's worth a bit less because i'm multiplying that ten percent times two so my present value for this is going to be adding all those three things together and i'd like you guys to try this in your calculator and you should end up with the same answer as me that is 56848.48 so what would you choose well i don't know about you but i would choose this one let's put a sentence down there and that sentence is option b is worth more in what we call today's dollars by today's interest rate so it is a better option and part of that is big part is that upfront money getting that 22 thousand dollars today is really worth a lot now we're going to talk about a payment scheme and we're going to be doing more of this in lesson 11 but we're going to start now you have two debts coming too a debt of one thousand dollars in six months and another of fifteen hundred dollars at the end of the year interest is charged at twelve percent simple you speak to mr hammerhead the loans manager and discuss several different payment options so let's start with a how much would we have to pay to pay it off today so for this what we do is we start by drawing a timeline so timelines are the way we start a lot of these we say today zero six months and i like to put in simple how many years it is if that because that's easy to put into the calculator and one year from now okay so we owe a thousand dollars and i'm going to put this as an arrow out to show that i have to pay that money it doesn't matter how you put it but we're going to see next time that you need to when you have both incoming money and outgoing money inflows and outflows you do have to pay attention to that type of thing so we'll talk more about that in the next series of videos so we owe a thousand dollars now or in six months and fifteen hundred dollars in a year so somehow we are going to pay the whole thing off today just like we did before we're going to move everything to our focal date and that's today because it says so in the problem so we're going to pay them both so same as we did before let's make that a future value future value one is a thousand future value two is fifteen hundred so present value one is then one thousand over one plus zero point one two times zero point five and present value two is going to be fifteen hundred over one plus zero point one two times one i'm going to simplify this a little bit because it's easier if this goes into my calculator like this and over here it's easier if it goes into my calculator as 1500 over 1.12 so we're going to put that in the calculator together and i put them in at the exact same time and we come out with those two things added together which is going to be two thousand eighty not twenty two thousand sorry guys i'm reading my notes wrong it's twenty two hundred and i'm going to do that by putting that in the calculator as well one thousand divided by 1.06 plus 1500 divided by 1.12 putting that in together i get the same answer we're going to do the exact same one for part b but now we're going to pay in 18 months so we're going to do the same problem different focal date so this time let's draw in this equation i've got today six months or 0.5 years one year and now i'm going to add 1.5 years or 18 months and this isn't a scale your diagrams do not need to be perfect mine certainly are not sorry that i wanted that to go upwards we owe 1 000 at six months we owe fifteen hundred dollars in a year and what we're going to do is pay everything off here so i'm going to move everything over this time i'm moving it to one and a half years so i'm gonna have to do some counting six months to one and a half years i'm going to write this here so i remember one year to one and a half years is 0.5 years now remember this is now a present value and i'm going to be finding future values so fv1 is going to be a thousand but this time i'm moving it forwards in time i'm going to be paying more interest on this loan so it'll be 1000 times one plus zero point one two times one plus fifteen hundred with six months interest uh this is actually i'm not going to even put the one there i'm just going to say future value equals this thing i'm going to simplify it a little and i can put this in the calculator just like this 1000 times 1.12 plus 1500 times 1.06 and that is 27 10. so what would you prefer 2710 in 18 months or 2282 right away well if we wait 18 months we have to pay more interest that's what is happening here the interest is a lot more so if i had the money i'd choose today if i don't have the money then i'm going to choose 18 months because i don't have 2 200 to pay right now let's do another one where we're making choices this time however instead of using simple interest we're now using compound interest however nothing changes just the interest formula everything else is the same so sagir received two offers for property is selling offer one consists of seven hundred thousand dollars immediately and offer two consists of five hundred thousand dollars now and one hundred and ten thousand dollars per year at the end of the next two years money earned six percent compounded semiannually which one is better and how much economic advantage just means which one is better for us economically and that's always how we're saying and by how much that's going to be the difference between the offers so let's write in the offer offer one today and we have one year and two years and for our next offer we've got today one year two years offer one is seven hundred thousand dollars now so i write in seven hundred thousand dollars and an arrow going in to my account and that's it that's actually easy to figure out the present value of offer one i'm putting a one there to mean offer one is just that seven hundred thousand dollars that's how much it's worth offer two is a lot more interesting it's going to be only 500 000 now but there's extra money added we also get 110 000 a year for two years so we get some extra payments an extra twenty thousand dollars in total versus offer one but we have to wait for a while one thing that i like to do when i draw these timelines is write my interest rate right in just so i remember what's going on there so offer one we've gotten that we don't need to do any interest but for offer two it says in today's dollars and that means that focal date is today and that is often the way we do these choices it makes sense to use today's money okay so what we end up with is our present value is going to be well five hundred thousand dollars today is worth five hundred thousand dollars today a hundred and ten thousand dollars in a year is going to be worth 110 000 plus 1.03 and it's one year i'm gonna say that's two half years so to the power of two and my last payment well that's going to be over 1.03 to the power of four put that into the calculator and we will see our answer i'm going to actually do this entire thing feel free to stop the video if you want to just know i'll give you the answer 701 419.13 in the calculator 500 000 plus oops i'm not doing this correctly 500 000 plus 1 one zero one two three divided by 1.03 squared equals plus 110 one two three might have been better now that i look at this for me to store all these numbers so forget me putting it in i can't work the tiny little calculator today it's 701 i did it on a real calculator so this one is better it's a better one or it has a more economic advantage and it's better by exactly one thousand four hundred nineteen dollars and thirteen cents in today's dollars because the present value is worth exactly one thousand four hundred nineteen dollars and thirteen cents more anna poured thousand dollars from a local loan shark on january the first twenty ten at j 12 equals 24 on january 1st 2012 anna paid the loan shark 500 and the loan shark agreed to lower the rate to j12 equals 18 percent how much money will anna owe as of january 1st 2014 and if anna pays the balance how much interest will she have paid so let's go over this question in a little bit of detail we have more complicated things going on than the others because our interest rate is changing this is going to take some more careful planning so i'm going to write january 1st 2010 everything is january 1st so that's okay 2012. let's just extend this and we're going to 2014 and i could say that zero years one year two year three year four year if that's what i would like okay so anna borrowed one thousand dollars so she borrowed it i like to say that it goes into her account and then in 2012 she paid back 500 so we're gonna do this by checking the balance but we're also going to see next time that we could do this as what's called an equation of value so we're going to see this in a couple different ways let's look at january 1st 2014. actually before i do that let's look at the most important thing that's going on here and making it crazy the interest rate changes so in the beginning we have j 12 equals 24 otherwise known as i is 2 that's 24 over 12. in the second half the interest rate changes to only 18 dividing that by 12 it's one and a half percent so things are changing so let's see what happens if we go through her balance on january 1st 2010 anna owes one thousand dollars in 2011 she now owes a thousand dollars plus interest that interest well it's going two years into the future 2 times 12 is 24 months in which case she now owes a thousand times 1.02 to the power of twentyfour so she was sixteen hundred dollars i'm gonna write what she owes but she pays five hundred dollars so she owes less okay so she only owes 11.08 but now it's going to accrue some interest sorry this not 2011 it is 2012 because that's what's happening here in 2014 she now owes 1108 plus another two years of interest but this time she's only being charged one and a half percent per month so this and i'm going to leave it unrounded though that is one of those things that i'm going to have to talk about in a different lecture the truth is some people keep track of all those decimal places and some people don't and in this class i'm going to let you do either 0.015 to the power of 24 equals 15 8 4 51. here we go so that's how much money anna owes on the 14th if she pays it off how much interest should she have paid interest is going to be money paid minus money borrowed and we're going to see this in lots of different ways money in money out money paid money borrowed so anna paid looks like she made a payment of a thousand dollars and she made that payment of 1584.51 sorry she didn't pay a thousand dollars she paid 500 correct but she borrowed a thousand dollars in total which means in the end she paid 1084.51 cents in interest lesson 11 equations of a value we've talked a lot about interest rates compound and simple interest this time we're going to balance everything into an equation an equation of value is a fancy way of saying that we need to balance our account so that means that all of the inflows is the same as all of the outflows when we count for interest in other words all the money in equals all the money out or in other words money borrowed equals money paid those things balance as soon as we add in interest when we do an equation of value we're going to look through a story about either borrowing money or lending out money and we're going to move everything to the same time and then we're going to solve this equation so i'm going to tell you what the basic tools are the first thing we're going to do is draw a timeline those timelines really really help it's hard to do it without we're going to circle the focal date here's a rule simple interest you must be told because the answer is going to be different depending on what you choose as a focal date for compound interest choose the easiest one and we'll talk about what makes it easiest the one that the algebra would be easy is for put in all the monies paying attention to the direction and that really means did i borrow the money did the money go into my bank account or did i pay it back and i lost the money then we're going to set up equation and we're going to find a bunch of pvs and feves in general if we're moving forward in time we find the future value and we multiply if we are moving backwards in time we're finding a present value and we divide it's the same as it was in our partial payments back in chapter one next we're going to solve the equation and next then we're going to state the answer example one today you take out a five thousand dollar loan at ten percent simple interest which is to be repaid with two equal payments at the end of the first year and at the end of the second year find the size of the payments using today as your focal date so let's put in some of our items ten percent simple these questions could deal with simple or compound interest and it's important for us to know which one five thousand dollar loan and then two equal payments so let's start with a timeline there we go nice and neat let's put in our times today is always zero one year and two years so those are the times that are important we borrowed five thousand dollars and we're going to repay x dollars and that's because i have to choose any kind of variable and i choose the letter x that's often what we do it says use today is your focal date so i'm going to go ahead and circle that importantly i have to say whether everything is money in or money out that five thousand dollars is a loan it came into my account well those payments are leaving my account it doesn't matter which way you decide to draw your arrows as long as you're consistent after all five thousand dollars coming into my account means the person who loaned me the money had five thousand dollars leave their account and the payments will come to them as income every question has both people and it can be done either way let's move everything to the focal date and then we set this up so x is the size of the payment and we're going to set this up as money in equals money out or money paid sorry money borrowed equals money paid so let's start with that money that we borrowed we borrowed five thousand dollars and the five thousand dollars isn't moving at all so it gets to stand alone exactly where it is that's going to be equal to this first payment of x that's moving backwards and we know that then we're dividing we're finding a present value and that is x over one plus ten percent simple times one and then we're going to take the present value of this guy again we're moving backwards so that second payment of x is one plus ten percent times two when we come up with something like this it makes a lot of sense to uh simplify before we start to do anything if you love algebra and this is really something you're good at pause now do the albert algebra to solve for x if you're struggling keep on watching okay i'm going to make this a little bit simpler now i have two different fractions on the bottom i'm actually going to move this over a little bit and you will see why i have two denominators so what i'm going to do is multiply both sides by 1.1 and 1.2 and because there's a plus in here i'm gonna multiply everything let's just move this over here 1.1 1.2 perfect now i can do some simplifying there's a 1.1 on the bottom and the top and there's a 1.2 on the top and the bottom this is a good way of clearing out those denominators i'm going to rewrite this expression without doing any arithmetic well that looks a lot nicer next i'm going to actually move those sides over because i personally always like my x to be on the left and the other number to be on the right stew five thousand dollars times one point one times one point two and i get six thousand six hundred dollars when i add these together because remember i'm distributing this through so 1.1 plus 1.2 is 2.3 so i have 2.3 x equals 6 600. i'm going to go ahead and divide both sides by 2.3 and that will clear that 2.3 from the x and what i'm left with is just x over equals six thousand six hundred over two point three six thousand six hundred showing up on my calculator divided by two point three and i get twenty two thousand 869.57 remembering to round up and that is the answer and i'm going to finish by writing a sentence each payment is going to be 2869.57 let's do one more part it's not written in this question but we care about interest in general this is really important we do want to know how much we paid in this case interest is going to be money paid minus money borrowed with no interest calculated and i'm going to say no pv or fv so the money i paid is going to be two payments of 2869.57 and we borrowed five thousand dollars i'm going to clear this because i don't want all those trailing decimal places one of the frustrating things about business math is even though we always end up with fractions of a cent and we carry them through you can't make a payment that's less than a cent so you always have to round when you make a payment so multiply that by two and subtract five thousand and it looks like i paid 739.14 in interest that's how much this loan cost question two today you take out a five thousand dollar loan at ten percent compounded quarterly which is to be repaid with two equal payments at the end of the first year and at the end of the second year a find the size of the payments and b how much interest will be paid if this question looks familiar it should it's the exact same question that we did in question one except that now we have i'm just going to circle two equal payments now instead of having simple interest we have compound interest as before i'm going to start by drawing in my timeline today one year two years but everything here is quarterly so i'm going to say j4 equals 10 which means that i is 10 divided by 4 or 2 and a half percent in case you're wondering how i did that ten percent is point one and i divided that by four so let's use today as our focal date just because that's what we did last time here though we get a lot more leeway in compound interest no matter where you choose your focal date you're going to come up with the exact same answer that means that we could choose something where the equation looks nice in algebra but what we're going to do today is just do the same thing we did before except now we're using the compound interest formula i'm going to state what x is so x is the size of each payment and i'm going to put a note any focal date will do in compound interest this isn't true and simple simple interest is not as elegant and it does matter where we choose the focal date so the two people that are arranged in the in the lending sorry have to choose one together so let's put our money borrowed equals money paid or money in money out our money borrowed was five thousand dollars and our money paid was that first payment of x but it's going back in time one year or four quarters if you're not sure about these payments these measurements go ahead and put those quarters in so this is one quarter two quarters three quarters etc that helps now let's add that second payment also 1.025 but this time it's going eight quarters into the past let's calculate this there are lots and lots of ways to calculate this but i'm going to do just one way what i'm going to do is actually i'm going to move everything over to the other side i'm going to note that x over 1.025 to the 4 is kind of like this fraction times x and now i'm going to use the calculator scroll up a little 1 divided by 1.025 to the power of 4. that's a big long number so i'm going to store it i press store and then 1. and that is 0.9059.x anytime i store something i like to write down what i stored it as so i can get it back let's do the next part 1.02 to the power of 8 and then it was 1 over that so 0.82 and i'm going to store that as 2. and again let's write down that that was stored as two and that whole thing equals five thousand dollars now i can factor out that x so this thing here well that's going to be recall 1 plus we call 2 and it's 1.72666 another big number every time i get to these big messy numbers i like to store them store three so now i have let's scroll up a little 1.72669 x and that's the same as store three and that equals five thousand dollars and now we're back to a similar place where we were i can divide both sides by that so now i have x equals this guy so i have 1.72669 i'm going to clear 5 000 divided by recall 3 is this 2895.70 it's different than we had before and i'm going to end this with a sentence each payment is 2895 and 70 cents interest is the same way so we paid well money paid minus money borrowed in interest same thing here only we have a different payment we borrowed five thousand dollars so i'm going to clear this just so that i don't have to worry about those trailing decimal places though if you use the decimal places it's not the end of the world okay we paid 791.40 in interest that's not dramatically different than before but if i'm going to scroll up to question 1 we paid 7.39 so that's a lot more in general that's going to be true the longer a time period we invest for the less we're going to pay in interest charges with simple and the more interest in compound if we're investing the money compound is going to be better in the long term because we end up with more money question three you must repay a debt of six thousand dollars at six percent simple borrowed today the finance company has agreed to allow you to make three yearly payments with the first payment in one year the first two payments will be equal and the third payment will be five hundred dollars more than the first two payments find the size of the payments using three years from now as your focal date first this is a simple interest question which means it's important that we note the focal date because we don't really have a lot of choice let's draw a line in okay our timeline goes from now or zero one year two years three years the focal date is at three years i'm gonna circle that and i'm gonna put everything there we borrowed six thousand dollars i like to show that as six thousand dollars going into your account and we repaid it in three payments at one year two years and three years everything here is going to be ten sorry ten percent six percent simple let's let x be the first payment then we have x here and the second payment is the same and the third payment is five hundred dollars more than the first one so it's x plus five hundred dollars when we have a choice if there's anything with an addition there it is easiest to put it at the focal date so if we could have chosen a focal date i would have chosen this one this time everything is moving forward so we're going to be finding future values for all of our items so we have again money borrowed equals money paid once we account for interest so we borrowed six thousand dollars but we're moving that forward in time six percent three years times six percent because it's going three years into the future that's going to be the same as this x is moving two years into the future and this x is moving one year into the future and finally our last payment is staying the same i'm going to put that in brackets just so we know it all sorts together i'm going to simplify this a little and then like i often do i'm going to move all the x's to the same side so here once i simplify this i have 1.18 times 6 000 equals 1.12 x plus yeah 1.12 x plus 1.06 x plus x plus 500. moving all the x's together 1.12 x plus 1.06 x plus x equals 1.18 times 6 000 and i'm going to do that in a second and then i have this minus 500 because it really switched sides there adding these things together 1.12 plus 1.06 plus 1. and remember when it's just x it's the same as 1x this is 3.18 x equals 1.18 times 6 000 plus sorry minus 500 is 6580 okay i am going to divide both sides switch colors because we might as well by 3.18 and we end up with x equals 6 5 8 0 is showing up divided by 3.18 is going to be two thousand sixty nine dollars and eighteen cents and this is the first payment but if i scroll just a little to look at our timeline we had three payments the second payment was also x and the third payment was x plus 500 so it's going to be 2569.18 those are the payments now let's look at the interest money paid minus money borrowed well we paid one payment of two thousand sixty nine dollars and eighteen cents another payment of two thousand sixty nine dollars and eighteen cents a payment of two five six nine point one eight and we borrowed and put that all in a bracket six thousand dollars which means once we dump that into a calculator which i'm not going to do on screen we end up with 707 dollars and 54 cents that's the interest i'm gonna note that sometimes we call this the cost of borrowing this was how much the loan cost us over the three years we paid 707.50 in interest question four is the trickiest one of this whole bunch because now we're going to have multiple inflows as well as multiple outflows you borrowed thousand three thousand dollars from your line of credit eight months ago and a further five thousand dollars three months ago you arranged with the bank to pay off the line of credit with two payments the first payment six months from today will be twice as large as the second payment made one year from today the bank charges you nine percent interest compounded monthly suggested focal date six months from today find the size of each payment and then find out how much interest you paid i'm going to say it is a suggested focal date because with compound interest it actually doesn't matter we can choose whichever one we want so i'm going to draw in a timeline and start by putting in some months i usually like to put today right at the beginning and now i'm gonna highlight every date we have eight months ago three months ago six months from today one year from today those are all the points we have a go means in the past so i would put this down as minus eight months and we also have minus three months don't worry about it being to scale this timeline is meant to help me not to be super accurate six months 12 months okay we do know that the bank is going to charge us nine percent compounded monthly i'm just going to write that over here j 12 equals 9 which means i is going to be 0.09 over 12 is 0.0075 and this is a compound interest problem let's let x be one of the payment let's let it be the second payment and i've chosen that you could choose any one you want because the first one is twice as large as the second so that way it makes sense to have x to be the second payment so let's put in the money we borrowed we borrowed three thousand dollars eight months ago again that's going into our account and we borrowed more money an extra five thousand dollars three months ago we arranged to pay off the bank line with two payments and those are at six months from today i'm actually going to change the color there so we can see that it's a different side and one at 12 months from today we said this was the second payment x which means that 2x is the first payment suggested focal date is six months from today but it could be anything today doesn't make sense because there's no payment happening today so i'm going to stick with that six months but with compound interest it's actually your choice now i'm going to move everything backwards remembering we divide when we go backwards we multiply when we go forwards money borrowed equals money paid so let's start with the money that we borrowed i'm gonna scroll up a little so we've got some extra space we borrowed three thousand dollars and actually let's take a moment before we really get started and write in those times eight months ago to six months from today is eight plus six is fourteen months three months ago to six months from today is six plus three is nine months six months to this that's zero and 12 months from today six months from today that's six months sometimes it helps to have those n values written in already so we've got three thousand dollars is moving 14 months into the future that five thousand dollars is moving nine months into the future now that 2x it isn't doing anything but the x is moving backwards and it's moving six months into the past there's lots of ways to solve this equation i'm going to just do one way and i'm going to use the calculator heavily so first i'm going to rewrite this by moving the x's to the left side and i'm going to note that this is 2 plus 1 over 1.0075 to the power of 6. and then i have this whole mess and i'm going to put that in the calculator in a minute there's lots of clever algebra you could do by using rules of exponents but i'm not going to do that in this class but if that seems like something that you can do go ahead first let's calculate this guy so that is i'm going to go backwards 1.0075 to the power of 6. and then i'm going to take 1 over that and add 2. and just like before i'm going to save this store 1. so this is 2.95615 x and i'm going to print store one there that equals i'm going to put the entire second side in the calculator 3 000 times 1.0075 to the power of 14 plus 5 000 times 1.008 to the power of 9. i get 8678.63 i'm going to store that though in the next line once we divide out by this guy over here i'm going to have this number 8600 ish divided by whatever i stored under one and i get 2 935 dollars now at any time if you're having trouble making this algebra work this is a good reason to come talk to me or do some of the algebra work provided online talking to me is always going to help that is the second payment so let's do the first one as well that's 2x well i'm going to clear it because i don't want to worry about those decimal places but it is not overly concerning 5871.56 is the first payment now let's do the interest so again money paid minus money borrowed so we paid in this side 29 35.78 and we paid 5871.56 i'm gonna put that in brackets the money we borrowed was those two payments together and i'm putting those in brackets to show that we're gonna add those first three thousand and five thousand so we borrowed eight thousand dollars running that through a calculator we come up with 807.34 and again we call that the cost of borrowing today we're going to start talking about annuities the key to annuities is that we're taking a compound interest problem and we're adding a payment what is an annuity i'm going to write out this definition and then read it out loud an annuity is a sequence of payments at regular intervals for set time and to make it easier all the payments are equal let's go straight into a few examples one example is saving so what if i put a hundred dollars a month into the bank for three years that's one example how about another example i'm living off of credit and every year or every semester that's twice a year or semiannually i am going to borrow five thousand dollars for living expenses this is a particular example of what we call accumulation the key here is that the balance is growing it gets bigger every month so my bank balance is higher every year every month and my debt is growing so every six months my debt is a little bit bigger let's look at some more examples of a different type of annuity uh i have a mortgage of three hundred thousand dollars every month i pay two thousand dollars and here's the second one i saved money to take a year off every quarter that's four times a year i take six thousand dollars out of savings and in this case i have a second kind of annuity this is called an amortization big fancy word which we're going to see a lot of but the gist is the balance is shrinking it gets smaller every month every period so here my debt is lower every month so every time i make a payment i have less money owing on my mortgage in the second example my bank balance is shrinking by six thousand dollars and that was a misspelled bank bank balance is shrinking so those are two kinds of things accumulation growing amortization shrinking two kinds of mortgages mortgages are divided into even more type of things so let's look at when the payment happens if it's at the end of the month or the end of the quarter or the end of the year we call that an ordinary annuity because ordinarily we pay at the end of the month oops so here we have end goes with ordinary we also have beginning so in this one actually let's give an example i pay my credit card bill at the end of the month usually when you're paying back money you pay back at the end because it seems silly to pay back the day that you borrow it when we have the beginning of the month we call that an annuity do beginning due and you can call that a begin annuity even though it's technically called an annuity due and often with a savings program the day you decide to start saving you actually start saving that's the day i'm going to put the money in and that means it's going to be begin i'm going to put this in to show you the calculator buttons and this will make more sense a little bit later when we talk about how to do this okay we've got one more step to go over and that's how often do i compound and how often do i pay so py we've seen this before this is payments per year and cy we're going to go over this in your calculator that's compounding periods per year in a simple annuity those things are the same so i deposit monthly in my bank account interest is compounded monthly that's the easiest type that's why we call it simple then we've got general the opposite of simple is general and those things are different and in the end of this unit we're going to see a lot of mortgages mortgages compound semiannually in canada but usually people pay monthly so those are the different types of uh annuities by now you've seen me write this down a lot of times these are the things that go on that tvm row of your calculator i'm just going to quickly show that we've got this tvm button row here that we've seen when we talked about compound interest py is going to be the payments per year so how many times per year do we pay this is the compounding so this is the m from j m it's how many times we compound per year n is the number of payments this we're going to get to when p y and cy are different n is a little bit harder to do we're going to talk about that in the next lesson i y is the nominal rate same as it was in compound interest rate present value is well that's the balance the beginning i'm going to put a little plus sign here to say when the present value is positive the payment is going to be positive when we accumulate and negative when we amortize so balance growing it's a plus balance shrinking it's a negative and in this case the future value is always going to be negative just to make things complicated we can always do it the opposite way so we could say that if you wanted to say your debt was a negative at the beginning then you'd add a plus because you're digging yourself out of that hole and in that case every single thing is opposite begin when begin is off that's the ending mode and begin is on and that is the begin mode and we're gonna go over that and how to use that on the calculator later starting with example one you decide to begin a savings plan starting in one year you will deposit a hundred dollars each year into an account that pays j1 equals 12 percent interest how much will you have in three years how much of that is interest let's start by drawing a timeline when you're first beginning it's really useful to draw in these timelines once you've done it for a while these basic annuities don't need them anymore but we will talk about more advanced ones so let's say that we start with no money then we're going to deposit a hundred dollars i'm putting the arrow down to show that that money is going into my account what we're doing is evaluating this at the last minute at time three algebraically using the compound interest formula that's the same as saying i've got a hundred dollars that i invest for looks like two years i've got a hundred dollars that i invest for one year and then i've got an extra hundred dollars so when we put those together i can evaluate how many of how much money i have at the end of the time that is 337 dollars and 44 cents please try this in your calculator if you would like three payments i can do that but let's say i had 100 payments i'm not going to calculate a hundred different things that's why i'm going to use the payment button for annuities so let's look at our types of annuities so the first thing i want to look at is are we accumulating or are we amortizing so here every month every year i have a little bit more money so i'm accumulating and that's because the balance is growing next i always want to look at well is it ordinary or do and those are funny words so ordinary is at the end of the year and due is at the beginning of the year here you can see and getting my first payment at the end of the first year at one not at zero so this is ordinary and finally i've got simple versus general and i'm going to actually just write that that is at the beginning end of the first year simple in general well my payments i put in a payment every year and my compounding period it compounds annually j1 equals 12 percent so those things are the same that makes this a simple ordinary annuity and now i'm going to put this in the calculator so let's start at the beginning i said that the payments were once a year and it was compounding once a year those are both one n well n here is three years because there are three payments the interest rate is 12. i start with no money this is very common in a savings and i'm going to put in a hundred dollars every year i'm putting a plus sign because my balance is growing this is an accumulation my future value i'm going to compute that but i'm going to hope that it's negative at the end begin is going to be off and we'll worry about how to use that on the calculator in the next lesson so let's calculate this i'm going to put everything in starting with pycy i make sure that that is 1 it is n is 3 our iy again was 12 present value i put in 0. now i'm going to actually put in that payment of 100 and i'm left with computing the future value and i get negative 337.44 which is exactly the same that we got by algebra often in an accumulation present value is going to be zero because we assume that we start with no money if we had money in our account we'll deal with that next lesson it's just a matter of putting a number into pv let's calculate the interest interest is money out minus money in in a savings situation how much money did i have at the end well that was 337.44 money in that was three payments of a hundred dollars when i run that through a calculator or do it in my head i get thirty seven dollars and forty four cents that's how much interest i earned over the three years 37 dollars and 44 cents example two financial planners estimate you will require an income of 2500 per month to retire you dial a psychic and discover that you're going to live exactly 15 years how much money will you need to retire if your first withdrawal will be in one month interest is going to be 9 compounded monthly so let's draw a bit of a timeline here start with the line and i'm going to start with today and then write in one month i haven't left myself a huge amount of room and i'm not going to do the whole thing i'm going to go up to here and say that's 180 months or 15 years and then here is 179 months let's start putting in some things i'm going to put some money in now i have to put some money in and i don't know what that is then i'm going to take out 2500 every single month starting one month from today and ending exactly 15 years from today where i take out my last payment and then i am going to not no longer need any money at the end of the day i don't have any money left that's important because otherwise i couldn't calculate this so let's look at this i'm putting in a bunch of money now and at the end i have zero in this case my balance is definitely shrinking so i would call this an amortization looking at my chart you can see that i'm taking those payments out at the end of the month and one thing is if it's unclear we treat it at the end of the month that's what we mean by ordinary that's the normal course of events finally we've got our py and cys so i'm taking out monthly payments and i'm compounding monthly those are the same and that's because i have j12 equals nine let's put this into the calculator and you should get used to drawing this out because we do this for every example okay in this case i said p y and c y were both 12. i can write 12 12 or i could write those together either way it's going for 15 years and that is 180 months and i'm just going to put in and that's 15 times 12. our interest rate is 9. and i'm going to start out well that's what i'm trying to find i don't know how much money i start out with but i'm going to take money out so i'm going to make this payment negative because my balance is shrinking my future value i said that should be negative as well but it's actually zero so it's a negative zero it's coming at the end of the month so begin is off so let's put this in i'm going to show you by pressing recall i still have everything in for my last example i can override overwrite that just start putting it in or i can press second clear tvm and then if you look at it everything is now zero but pycy will still need changing they don't clear when i clear that if i change p y to 12 notice that c y changes as well that's very handy for us when we're working on a simple annuity n is 180 i y is nine the present value is what i'm computing 2500 negative is the payment and future value is zero so i'll compute the present value and we get a very big number i need to have two hundred and forty six thousand four hundred and eighty three dollars and fifty two cents uh to retire today that's great if i have that much money later on we're going to talk about how you would go about trying to save that much money which makes a lot more sense so do the interest calculation we call that interest when we borrow something we call that cost of financing cost of borrowing you're going to see this a lot and that's going to be money out minus money in or the money we pay minus the money borrowed there's lots of way of doing interest but in the end you should get a positive number because it doesn't make sense to have negative five dollars of interest so in this case let's look at this question our interest payment is going to be well i took out 180 payments of 2500 and we deposited 246 483.52 and i'm going to round that so if i do this i go 180 times 2500 oops minus two four six four eight three point five two equals two hundred and three thousand dollars so we actually made quite a lot of interest and that's because we had a fairly good interest rate of nine percent but also this was invested for 15 years that's a long time for money to compound example three you've just purchased a new house for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars you can afford to pay twenty six hundred dollars per month on your mortgage how long will it take you to pay off your house if interest is calculated at twelve percent compounded monthly let's just take a second to draw this i borrowed 250 000 that's going into our account and then we're going to start paying payments of 2600. those are going to come out at the end of the month monthly for a bunch of time and months and what we're going to do is find that n so firstly i borrowed money and every month i pay it back my balance is shrinking when i repay money which means that this is an amortization i'm paying at the end of the month so this is an ordinary annuity also i'm paying monthly and i'm compounding monthly because i have j12 equals 12 so this is a simple ordinary amortization let's take all the numbers from here and put them in in this case some people really like to see this as a negative number under your present value because you've borrowed that that's your debt i prefer to make everything positive in present present value so i'm going to continue to do that and then because my balance is shrinking that 2600 becomes negative my future value well it doesn't say but assume that i'm paying off all that money so my future value should be zero in the end my begin is off because it's at the end of the month j12 well everything was 12 and the interest rate was 12 what i'm trying to compute is n now just like in compound interest problems with these annuities i can calculate n i y pv payment or future value as long as i know four out of five of these things i can compute the other one using a calculator here let's just put this into our calculator so our pycy still says 12 and i'm going to compute 12 is the interest rate 250 000 for the present value i'm making my payments of negative 2600 and my future value will be zero at the end when i compute n i get 327 months and that means 327 big payments plus one little baby payment at the end and we're going to talk about those final payments later on in the course and just so we know that's around 27.3 years i'm going to be paying off this mortgage for a while i'm going to do one thing i'm going to make my pa payment positive and i'm going to recompute n notice that n is a negative number in this case n is negative 67.709 that makes very little sense it says i'm going to pay off my mortgage in negative five and a half years negative years negative time that doesn't make a lot of sense if you see a negative n means that you put an entry error and wrong when you see an error or you see something that makes no sense like a negative n you know that you've made an input error and you've pressed the wrong button example four your new car loan has payments of 499 at the end of each month for five years to pay a 25 pay for a 25 000 car what rate of interest is being charged what is the effective rate what is the cost of financing so let's look through this one as well we borrowed 25 000 and every month we're going to pay back 4.99 etc and that's going to go on for 60 months or 5 years every month the amount of money we owe on that car is shrinking that makes this one also an amortization we are always making our payments at the end of each month and it says that right in the problem so it is an ordinary annuity finally simple general well that's a little more tricky because this question is asking two things so let's do this with just a monthly rate and then we're going to do this again and see what happens if we treat this as a general annuity so let's start with py and cy both being 12 because we're making those monthly payments 60 of them we're trying to find the interest rate we started by owing 25 000 and we're making payments of 4.99 those are negative because our balance is shrinking at the end we owe nothing on the car and we're paying at the end of the month so we go into here it's clear and our pycy should still be 12. our n is going to be 60 our interest rate is what we're trying to find we're borrowing 25 000 and making payments of negative 4.99 and at the end of the day we'll own no money when i compute the interest rate i get 7.33 now there's a few things we can do i could take this interest rate and store it and then use that interest conversion worksheet that we talked about in the last section so the nominal let's put recall 1 enter now i go down i'm going to find my effective rate but i need my cy to be 12. i'm going to compute that and i find out that i have 7.5875 percent but i can treat this separately i'm gonna do this as a general annuity because we're going to start doing this in our next lesson i'm still gonna pay 12 times a year but now i'm going to compound one time a year n is 60 everything else stays the same so what i'm doing is just changing one thing in the calculator so let's clear out of this one go to second py py is 12 but now i'm going to go down and change cy to be one so when i scroll here you can see 12 1 those are different clear out of that worksheet compute the interest rate and now i get 7.5875 exactly what i got through the interest conversion worksheet so general annuities seem complicated however in the end we can do them fairly easily given that we have a good financial calculator finally let's do the cost of financing cost of financing is fancy for interest so cost of financing or cost of borrowing is a fancy way of saying interest when we borrow we say our interest is going to be the money paid minus money borrowed so in this case how much did i pay well we paid 499 dollars 60 times and borrowed 25 000 we can throw that into a calculator which i did off camera and i ended up with 4 940 that's the cost of financing one more note on this cars the sticker price on this car is actually a bigger money a bigger number let's say this car is 29 940 with zero percent financing where did i get that number well that number was 499 times 60. if a car dealership advertises zero percent financing usually this is what they mean the car is actually 29 000 or you get nine hundred and forty dollar cash discount that's for paying cash right away the real moral here is you're not getting something for nothing so that zero percent interest really means that the cost is actually 25 000 lesson 13 more annuities today we're going to look at different types of annuities simple versus general ordinary versus do for completeness sake here are the formulae that you can use to do annuities in this course we're going to be using a preprogrammed ba 2 plus calculator but if you are a person who loves algebra go ahead knock yourself out these formulas are also in the textbook first we're going to start with what we like to call five finger problems a five finger problem just means you have a problem where pv and fv and payment are not zero so we've got a present value and a future value going on i want to start with a car lease you decide to lease a new bmw automobile the vehicle costs thirty thousand dollars new and you are required to pay all taxes at the beginning of the lease the lease payments are six hundred dollars per month for three years and you know the lease in company charges interest at six percent compounded monthly i'm just going to write j12 equals six percent what is the residual value of the car and how much interest do we pay over the lifetime of the lease so let's pause for a moment and talk about car leases in car lease you don't actually buy the car all you're doing is renting it this way we pay less per month than if we bought the car outright but the problem is or the advantage is we don't get a car at the end this is great if three years after getting a car you want to trade up to a new car a lease is often the way to go at the end of the lease if you want to you can buy the car for its residual value cars depreciate over time depreciate means they're worth less than when they began a threeyearold car three even a threeyearold bmw is not going to cost thirty thousand dollars it will cost less to calculate that residual value we find out what the balance is or how much is owing at the end of those three years so let's look at this problem the balance or how much we owe starts at 30 000 but it goes down every month as we make payments that makes this an amortization but it's an amortization where fv is not going to be zero the lease payments are 600 and unless you're told that the payments are at the very beginning we usually assume that the payments are at the end of the month any payment we make at the very beginning well that goes with payments and taxes and that's how leasing often works here we're paying monthly and the interest rate is a monthly interest rate so that makes this a simple this is a simple ordinary amortization but it's different than what we've done before because the future value and the present value are not both zero let's look at the numbers in this problem the vehicle cost thirty thousand dollars originally that thirty thousand dollars is the present value of the car i like to leave this one positive we make six hundred dollar payments that's minus because the balance is shrinking the payments are at the end of the month and they are for three years so three times 12 is 36 payments and those payments and compounding are monthly the interest rate is six percent our future value is what we're trying to find we're trying to figure out what we owe on the car at the end of the three years this will have been set up by the car company so that that's the value of the car and if we choose not to buy the car somebody else might want to buy our vehicle off lease so let's scroll down and calculate this so we start as usual by going to the pycy they are not the same so we have to check py equals 12 and now they're both exactly the same n is 36. the interest rate is six our present value is thirty thousand and we're making six hundred dollar payments negative now we're going to compute the future value future value here is negative that really means that a threeyearold car is only worth 12 cents 298.75 we want to pay the car that is how much we have to pay at the end of the lease if we don't want to pay the car buy the car we can walk away at this point and we've just spent that money to rent the car over time and then someone else can step in and buy a threeyearold car for twelve thousand two hundred ninety eight dollars and seventy five cents that is the residual value let's pretend that we actually bought the car how much interest did we pay over the lifetime of this lease well our interest is always amount paid versus amount borrowed amount or money borrowed scrolling up over here well we paid taxes we didn't borrow that we don't have to worry about that we made 36 payments of six hundred dollars and we paid off that residual value how much did we borrow that was thirty thousand dollars which means that our interest was not very much it was three thousand eight hundred ninety eight dollars and seventy five cents for our bottom of the line new bmw two you are saving for your son's postsecondary education in 10 years you have 27 000 in an resp account and plan to add a thousand dollars at the end of the year for the next 10 years how much money will your son have when he goes to school in 10 years if you receive a return a 4.8 percent compounded annually on the investments this is another fivefingered problem but it's different than the last one and that's because we are accumulating money we have twenty seven thousand now and it keeps on rising it starts at twenty thousand twenty seven thousand and at the end we will have more again if we're not told it's going to be ordinary but here it says end that's a key word that we're looking for an ordinary annuity finally we have we're going to make annual payments i'm just going to put that in here and we have it compounded annually so let's put that one down right over here for cy now let's go back to the beginning and put in all of the information we start 10 years n equals 10. 27 000. well that's how much money we have at the very beginning we're gonna add a thousand dollars at the end of each year this is a plus one thousand because our balance is growing the payment is adding to the present value how much money will we have well that means future value is compute and we know that this is ordinary so we keep begin off iy 4.8 and now we have enough information to begin putting this into the calculator we start with second py and we put in one check that py and cy are both the same n is ten i y was four point eight our present value that we started with was twenty seven thousand dollars our payment is one thousand dollars per year and we're computing the future value that gives us 55 000 610.68 cents i'm just going to show you that that algebra equation that we did at the beginning that actually works the same way so if i use that equation i've got payment 1 plus i to the power of n minus 1 over i and then i'm going to add in that present value i'm going to calculate that 27 000 separately trying that in a calculator you'll get the same answer so when we do one of these five fingered problems what we really have is two problems that are adding together we have an ordinary simple annuity with the present value equals zero and we have a compound interest problem and we add those together one of the advantages of a financial calculator is we don't have to explicitly do this general annuities you are shopping for a hundred thousand dollar mortgage and the bank has quoted you a rate of j two equals six percent you will make monthly payments for twenty years how much will your payments be again this is very typical of canadian mortgages we usually have c y equals two and p y equals 12. that makes this a general annuity because we have a mortgage we're taking a hundred thousand dollar loan that's our balance at the very beginning we want our balance to shrink it's an amortization and unlike a lease it doesn't say what our n value is how much we'll owe at the end it should be zero unless you're told otherwise assume that we pay off all of our loans completely our rate is j2 equals six percent and it's a mortgage so we're going to make the payment at the end of the month any money that we spend at the very beginning that's part of a down payment so this is an ordinary general amortization we've filled that in most of this while i've been talking and payment well that's what i'm trying to find finally we just have n and that's going to be 20 times 12 that's important n always counts payments payments per year not compounding period so we're going to count how many payments we make over the lifetime of the mortgage which in the end is going to be 240 payments let's run this through we go into py and we set that equal to 12. when i scroll down you can see that cy has changed so i have to set it to be different when i scroll up you'll see when you set cy py doesn't change but when you set py cy changes i always scroll around to make sure that everything has worked correctly 100 000 present value zero is our future value compute that payment and i get an answer of 712 dollars and 19 cents we're gonna round out a little bit at the end let's talk a little bit more about general annuities when we're using those formulas what we do is we convert our interest rate to an equivalent one so that we have p y equals c y so what i would do here is i would say i've got j 2 equals 6 percent and i want to convert to j 12 equals something i'm going to do that so we go to second interest conversion our nominal rate is 6. cy is 2 i find that effective rate 6.09 so let's write what the effective rate is then i take that effective rate change cy again and go back to the nominal rate so this is what i would use in the calculation no rounding saving that entire thing that's how it works in a spreadsheet like excel and that's how it works with the formula we are lucky that we have a calculator that does that it's doing that under the hood and that's why we set it correctly so that we can use our technology correctly the important thing to always remember is that n counts payments not compounding periods so that's because things go together so if for example let's say a fiveyear mortgage monthly payments and j2 equals let's go with nine percent n is going to be 12 times 5 60 payments and it's not going to be 2 times 5 equals 10 compounding periods and that's because your calculator is actually changing that interest rate i'm gonna put a big x on this so that everybody knows that that's not there question four you want to have accumulated four thousand dollars for your european trip four years from now if interest is six point four percent compounded monthly find the size of the quarterly deposits required for four years if deposits are made at the beginning of each quarter this time we're going to go through our question and fill out what's happening as we go you want to have accumulated well to me that makes this seem like an accumulation and it is we are saving money when we save money start with something positive add something positive end up with something negative what we want to accumulate is four thousand dollars think of that negative as in i'm gonna withdraw it four years from now i'm gonna put four years under n but we're gonna have to change that once we find out what p y and cy are if interest is 6.4 percent compounded monthly 6.4 compounded monthly find the size of the quarterly deposits well py is four since those two are different we're working on a general annuity find the size of the quarterly deposits required for four years if deposits are made at the beginning of each quarter well beginning to me that looks like do and it is it's begin on so what i'm going to do is put begin on it doesn't say how much money i started with so we're going to assume we start with nothing our payment well that's what i'm going to compute so we have an accumulation that is a general annuity due let's go through the entry on this and i'm going to show you how to turn begin on in the calculator first let's go into our py and change it to 4 but now our cy has changed so set it to b12 again i like to scroll around the arrows a few times and make sure that everything is set the way i want before i clear out n was four years so n is going to be four years times four payments per year that means we're making 16 payments 16. the interest rate is 6.4 the present value well we start with nothing payment that's what i'm trying to find and my future value is four thousand dollars i'm making that a negative because i will withdraw it begin above the payment button you'll see bgn that stands for begin so we go second payment or begin and then we press second set that turns begin mode on when begin mode is on you'll see that begin in the top of the calculator to turn it off you do the same thing second begin second set that set toggles through begin and end so here we've got begin now all i have to do is compute that payment and the payment is going to be 217.70 i'm going to write that down second payment begin begin lives over the payment because it refers to the payment second set which lives above the enter you'll be doing this a lot end is the default mode and you can see that when we have end nothing shows up here when begin is on that makes it an annuity due five you deposit one thousand dollars at the end of each quarter into an account that pays j4 equals ten percent find the future value in one year let's go through this question we are depositing a thousand dollars so our balance is growing and we're depositing that at the end of each quarter end or begin off let's draw that in we put a thousand dollars in at the end of each quarter and at the end how much money do we have we're going to assume we start with nothing j4 equals 10 percent 4 10 and we're making quarterly payments first of all we're accumulating money our balance is growing we're making our payments at the end of the month so this is an ordinary annuity finally py equals cy this is just a simple ordinary annuity same as we have had many times before look at my calculator note that begin is still on from the last thing i did so i'm going to start by going second begin second set and clearing that making sure it's not on there then i'm going to fill in everything in the calculator making sure that py and cy are the same uh n is four quarters in one year 10 iy our payment is a thousand dollars and we started with nothing and i'm computing how much money we have at the end i get a future value of four one five two point five two that's how much money i have at the end let's do it again b you make the deposits at the beginning of the quarter how much money will you have at the end of the year draw this in and show you that it looks very similar except one payment comes in right now at today and the last payment comes in at three quarters and we're still trying to find the future value at one year i'm still accumulating but now this is an annuity do it's still simple in fact everything else remains exactly the same as it was before the only difference is this begin toggle i usually write on to mean beginners on off for end but you can write begin and end or do in ordinary everything's still in my calculator so all i have to do is go second payment sorry i have now set that payment wrong a thousand dollar payment second begin second set to turn it on now everything is exactly the same and all i have to do is compute that future value which is similar let's scroll down and write down our future value 4256.32 cents it's similar but it's bigger that's because our payments had a little bit more time to grow because i started earlier how much money do i have in three months what about in three months this time i'm going to take my initial answer from a and see what happens three months after the scenario from a ends so at the fifth quarter so i'm going to just use my equations here instead of the compound using the calculator but you can do whichever you would like to do so we've got four thousand one hundred fifty two dollars and fifty two cents and we're going to invest that at two and a half percent per quarter that's ten divided by four for only one quarter when i run that through a calculator i end up with four thousand two hundred and fifty six dollars and thirty three cents this is round off error from the fact that i rounded this 4 152 in fact when you take your ordinary annuity and multiply it by one plus i you get the same value as the annuity do question six you begin a savings plan at the beginning of each month you deposit 250 dollars into an account that pays j12 equals nine percent how much money will you have after five years this is a savings or accumulation i'm going to go ahead and put in my signs present value and payment will be positive future value will be negative at the beginning of each month begin is on that makes this an annuity do you deposit 250 balance is growing and it's the beginning of each month so our payment is monthly into an account that pays j12 equals nine percent j 12 equals nine percent p y and cy are the same that makes this a simple annuity do and it's an accumulation how much money will you have after five years well five times 12 is 60. we make 60 payments it doesn't say anything about starting with money but it does ask how much we'll have at the end notice that my calculator says begin already so i could change that if i didn't want it second begin second set i want the begin to be turned on let's go into py and set it to be 12. check that cy is also 12 and clear out 60 is n 9 is iy 0 is present value 250 is payment and i'm going to compute the future value which is 18 997 and 45 cents so i have 18 997 dollars and 45 cents let's see how much interest we made that's going to be money out how much money we took out minus how much money we deposited so when i put this in i took out eighteen thousand nine hundred and eighty seven dollars and forty five cents and we put in sixty payments of two hundred and fifty dollars so 60 times 250 well that was 15 000 dollars which means that we have 3997.45 cents that we've made in interest we looked at a lot of different types of annuities today we've seen annuities that are accumulation and amortization annuities that are ordinary and annuities that are due as well as simple and general annuities i'm going to conclude by writing in all of our calculator things again py counts the number of payments cy counts the number of compounding periods the important thing here is that n is going to be p y times years so i'm going to put that in a different color n counts payments not compounding periods when we have something like a j m we put that in i y and the m is the same as the compounding period when these things are the same that's called simple and when they're not the same we call that general present value i like to always make it positive our future value then can just go ahead and be negative our payment is going to be positive when our balance is growing and negative when our balance is shrinking and that's going to be an accumulation or an amortization we can do this opposite minus minus plus and then this would end up being a plus i'm going to go ahead and say there is an exception to this but in general present value and future value tend to be the opposite in the simple situations we go over in this class begin when begin is on it's an annuity due and we begin as off it's an ordinary and when it's off we call that end mode you can see there's an end showing up on my calculator again when we do an annuity we always look is it an accumulation or is it an amortization is it ordinary is it due is it simple or is it general these are the three questions we ask ourselves when we start doing an annuity problem lesson 14 deferred and backtoback annuities today we're going to do a series of twostep problems these problems are going to have two parts to them in some of them the first part is going to be a compound interest problem we call that a deferred annuity and in some of them the first and the second are both going to be different types of annuities we call those backtoback annuities let's jump right in with a problem you plan to retire in 21 years you will need 25 annual payments of thirty thousand dollars with the first payment to be received in twenty one years interest is calculated at ten percent effective and this is of course an approximation because interest rates won't stay the same for 46 years but we usually pretend they will in order to do calculations a how much money should we set aside for our retirement i've started this with a timeline and i've already drawn it in it has two parts to it one let's go to 21 years when our first payment happens and then it keeps on going until our last payment which is going to be at 45 because that will give us 25 annual payments one at one one at two all the way to twenty five today we're going to put some money in so let's put some money in this today and then i'm going to circle this because this is a very key point we're going to invest it for 21 years and then we're going to start pulling money out so we have two problems here problem one is a compound interest problem and problem two is an annuity it's not just any type of the annuity it's an annuity due because it starts right at the beginning at 21 and it is possible to set this up so that it starts at 20 but in this case it seems to make more sense to start at 21. so compound interest let's look at our values we start off with i don't know how much money i make payments of well nothing because it's a compound interest problem at the end of the day i have some money i don't exactly know how much let's change this color here to make it more exciting at the beginning of this annuity which is exactly at 21 i have however much money i saved in the first compound interest problem my payments well those are going to be 30 000 and i'm going to make that negative because we can see that they're coming out of our account i'm going to start writing 30k so i don't have to write a bunch of zeros and our future value well that's gonna be zero unless we're told otherwise always assume that we have no money left at the end of one of these problems so we have to solve these one at a time and here we have two unknowns here two and here we only have one unknown so we're gonna start with two because we only have the one unknown so let's start by drawing in our calculator buttons okay all nicely drawn very fast we're going to start with number two so i'm going to put a 2 in here in this whole problem our py and cy are both one that makes these a simple annuity because everything in sight is annual and our interest rate is 10. this annuity goes on for 25 years or 25 payments i want to figure out what the present value is my payment will be thirty thousand dollars and my future value is zero it's an annuity due so i need to make sure that begin is turned on i usually like to do that first so let's turn that on here and now let's put in the rest p y and c y are both one again i always check that they both entered properly interest rate is 10 present value is what i'm going to find should i get that 25n yep i have these in the wrong order i'm gonna go ahead and fix that because it's going to confuse me better i y present value our payment is thirty thousand dollars negative and our future value ends up being zero so we're going to compute that present value and we get 299.542.32 what that means is the day we retire i'm going to say we could be you we need to have saved a lot of money 299 542 and 32 cents that could be around thirty thousand dollars so let's look at saving that much so what we're going to do now is part one of our problem so part one let's just scroll up to look at that is a compound interest problem where i'm trying to figure out how much money to put in zero payments begin doesn't matter when the payment is zero dollars it doesn't matter if i put zero dollars in my account at the beginning or the end of the year so i can just leave that alone we know that n is 21. future value is 299 000. the easiest way to do this is while it's showing up on my screen i press that negative sign and now i just press future value and it's stored in there so let's go ahead and change everything begin doesn't matter so i'm going to leave it pycy should stay the same n is now 21. our interest rate recall iy is still 10. our payment is zero that's an important one remember our future value has changed so let's compute that present value and we find out that we need to invest 40 000 477 and 32 cents right now if we do that we put 40 000 in today we will have enough so that we can have 30 000 a year for twenty five years so thirty thousand per year that is great in part a of this question we figured out that if we can save forty thousand dollars right now put that in the bank today then we're fine to retire the problem is i don't actually have forty thousand dollars to invest so instead of making one payment right here at the beginning what we're going to do is put 21 payments in starting today so i'm gonna put in a payment every year and we're talk and save slowly over 21 years so that i will be able to get that thirty thousand dollars at the end let's look at this again as a twostep problem step one this is now an annuity do and it's an accumulation because we're saving it's also still going to be simple because j1 is still 10 and py is going to be 1 for everything so everything in sight will be simple so now i've got an annuity due that is an accumulation i'm not going to save any money at the beginning but i am going to start putting in payments and at the end i will have well we actually know that so put a pin in that for one minute let's look at number two this is the same thing and i'm going to write here that this is an amortization often these backtoback problems are one accumulation followed by an amortization a retirement scheme has us save save saving spend spend spending so we know at the end we have nothing we know what the payments are they are thirty thousand dollars and they're negative because it's an amortization and actually we know what the money is that we should be saving it is 299 000. because we've done that already so that's really useful that means that we've already done half this problem in general it's important to save all of our intermediate values so if i go back to that future value we're going to use that i'm going to store that in one just so i have it just in case even though we've already done the second annuity i'm going to still rewrite this so we can see everything all together remember it was a 21year annuity we were computing the present value we were taking 30 000 out zero begin was on we computed that and we got 299 etc then we're going to go ahead and do number one this is also a simple annuity p y and cy equals 1. now our n is still 25 and our interest rate is 10 but our present value is going to be zero and we're going to be computing those intermediate payments the amount of money we need is still negative 299.54 and begin is still on so looking at this it's almost exactly what we did last time only we're switching the present value and future value we can just go ahead and check our pycy we know that stays the same n should still be 25 our iy has stayed the same but our present value is now zero and our payment is what we're going to find so future value is still negative 299 and you can see there that that begin is on so i'm going to compute the payment 4 254 and 70 cents that's not so bad that's how much money we need to save annually starting today so let's write that down so if we have 4 200 and we think we can come up with that every year we will have enough to retire let's start looking at some interest let's look at interest instead of just part a i'm actually going to start with b sorry start with a our interest is going to be the money out minus money n so we took out 30 000 and we did 25 of those payments and we put in well we know how much we put in we put in exactly forty thousand four seven seven and thirty two cents note nowhere do i see that intermediate 299 thousand dollars that's because i didn't actually withdraw or deposit that i left it in the bank so it doesn't end up being part of this interest calculation 30 000 times 25 well that's 750 000 and let's subtract 4477 and 32 cents well i've made quite a lot of interest there 709 522 and 68 cents and that's because i have a lot of time we have 45 years on this scenario that's a lot of time to save and we end up with a lot of interest especially at 10 which would probably be an average in b this is almost going to be the same except now i'm still putting in that same 30 000 times 25 but i'm putting in 21 payments of 4 200. so looking at this let's go back to 30 000 times 25 we're going to subtract 21 times 4254.7 and that leaves us with 660 651 and 30 cents not as much as an a because we didn't put the money in the whole time but still quite a lot of money i'm leaving this last part up to you i would like you to finish this question noting that the answers are at the back knowing that in this case instead of making our payments starting today we're going to start in one year our last payment goes in at 21 and our 30 000 payments still come out at the same time in this case let's put our last 30 000 payment this is going to be an ordinary annuity and the second one is going to be an annuity due so the second annuity stays exactly like it was before but this time the first one is an ordinary annuity the answers are going to be they're in the handout at the beginning of this chapter and we will go over this in lab you are saving money for your retirement starting in six months and for five years you invest fifteen hundred dollars every six months in a mutual fund that pays six percent compounded semiannually after five years the rate drops to four point eight percent compounded quarterly and you decide to deposit a thousand dollars every quarter for another five years how much money will you have at the end of the ten years this is another backtoback annuity but in this one they're both going to be accumulations because we keep on saving we're never going to amortize or take money out of that account that's good to note in our first one it is going to be every half year and we're going to start in six months one year 1.5 all the way 4.5 so for every six months we're going to start depositing money i'm going to draw that in we're going to deposit 1500 and our last deposit is going to go in right at that five years after this it's going to drop to quarterly so let's do a quarter half three quarters six years etc etc all the way up to 10 years and that's a quarter less than that so nine and three quarter of a year here we're going to be putting in a thousand dollars each quarter and it's going to be at the end of the quarter because we're not putting it in twice at a time when we're not told we're always putting it in at the end let's look at our two annuities one this is still an annuity but because it starts six months from now it's an ordinary annuity okay we start with no money we put in fifteen hundred dollars every six months and at the end we have something let's look at the second one over here at the beginning of the second five years and this is the important time we have some money the present value of that second annuity is equal to the future value of the first and this is almost always true in backtoback annuities because this one starts at the end of the quarter it's still an ordinary annuity now we have payments of a thousand dollars and at the end we have money looking over here we've got two unknowns future value and present value so we can't do anything here we have only one unknown that's why we're going to start with number one okay we're gonna put everything in our calculator and i'm gonna start with one i like to label these so i know which one is which in this case the payments are semiannual and the compounding looks like it's semiannual and you can even write the compounding up here on the timeline if you think that makes things easier j4 equals 4.8 i think it does so in here i'm gonna put six percent and my n is going to be five years times twice a year so ten my present value well that's going to be zero because i start with nothing but we're putting fifteen hundred dollars in the future value that's what we're going to try to find and begin is off so let's go through the calculator i'm going to start by turning off the begin because this is an ordinary annuity now we're going to set py and you are welcome to fast forward if you're tired of watching me put stuff in a calculator fascinating zero present value 1500 that's positive because we're accumulating and i'm going to compute our future value so 17 000 ish i'm going to write that right in i'm going to store this because i might need it for later i don't know i i personally do but you wouldn't know it's always good to store those intermediate values now let's start setting up annuity number two this one is quarterly payments but also quarterly compounding and our interest rate is 4.8 it's going to be five times four so we've got 20 payments and our present value is 17 195 and 81 cents payment is a thousand future value is a compute and our begin is still going to be off so let's put input things into the calculator make this positive now that's the present value starting at the side i have p y c y is 4 our n is now 20 important 4.8 is the interest rate the present value we've done payment is a thousand and the future value is what we're trying to compute we end up with an answer of 44 000 dollars forty four thousand two hundred and eighty one dollars and eighty three cents that's how much money we have let's pretend we take that out of the bank let's find out how much interest we made so our interest is money out minus money in in this case we took out our savings our life savings of forty four thousand two hundred eighty one dollars and eighty three cents we put in 10 payments of 1500 and we put in 20 payments of a thousand running that through a calculator we've actually made quite a lot of interest which is ninety two hundred dollars so nine thousand two hundred eighty one dollars and eighty three cents follow along on your calculator to make sure you get the right answers question three you would like to save enough to take a two year sabbatical in 15 years starting today you make your first of 180 monthly deposits of 500 into an account that pays j12 equals nine percent write that in here one month after making your last deposit you take your first of 24 monthly payments find the size of these payments this is again a backtoback annuity problem so i'm going to reiterate the important things that we need to do one is we have to draw a timeline and having a focal date and circling it right here on it is going to be really important in getting this right i'm going to take the time to identify our annuities and store all of our intermediate values and an important thing is to pay really close attention to the begin and end on our calculator so let's start by drawing in things first of all 15 years is when we start and it's a two year sabbatical so and we're going to start making monthly everything is monthly that's okay we can just put in little dashes for months and we know what that means starting today i'm going to make my first payment so i'm going to say that this is right away and it is five hundred dollars if i start today then i'm going to end one month before 15 years from now that's going to give me the right number of payments which is 180. because i'm starting right away i'm going to note that this is an annuity deal and that's annuity number one for new need number two well one month after i make my last deposit that's going to be exactly at 15 i'm going to start taking out my 24 monthly payments and those well i don't know what they are but i do know that at the end of this i'm not going to have any money so this is also an annuity due let's look at the steps of these and these are both simple annuities and what we have is we have an accumulation we accumulate accumulate save save save and then we spend spend spend knowing this is going to get our signs correct starting well i'm going to assume because i didn't say anything about this i have no money at the beginning we could have started with something and then it would be as easy as putting that number in i'm going to start making payments of 500 and at the end i will have something second annuity i'm going to start with well that same something i had last time because those are at the same points this is two my payment in this annuity is going to be something and my future value at the end will be zero because i'm going to spend all of that money two unknowns here one unknown here means i should start with one you'll probably get sick of drawing the same thing out over and over again but i've found when i don't write it and when i don't do it in the right order which i occasionally do i start making mistakes so putting everything in the calculator writing it out really helps us not make mistakes i'm gonna start with annuity one everything here is going to be monthly my n well that's 180 because it's written in there and that's 15 times 12. the interest rate is 9 for the entire time start with nothing and i put in 500 and then we're going to figure out the future value begin is on i'm going to go ahead and start filling in the second annuity as well and i like to sometimes set these up before i even start so everything is very quick 24 monthly payments my present value is going to be this number i'll put that in there and here that's what i'm going to be computing and i'll end up with nothing and it's still an annuity due starting with this and again fast forward if you're really good at putting stuff in your calculator 12 i check that that's correct uh n is 180 i y is 9. present value zero payment is five hundred dollars future value is what i'm computing and begin mode is not on so let's go to set make sure that begin mode is on now i can compute the future value and what i'm going to end up with is let's use a different color why not i apologize if you are colorblind and cannot see all my beautiful colors it's okay 190 000 621 and 91 cents i'm gonna store this again store one because i might need it later but i'm also going to just go ahead and plus minus put that right into present value that's very useful okay let's do the second annuity 12 should stay the same but n is now 24. i usually press recall and then i y to make sure that it's correct and then i haven't done anything recall present value is correct recall payment well i don't even know about payment so i'm going to leave that alone and i'm going to make sure that my future value is zero begin is still on so compute the payment i get 8 643.68 so we need actually not we need we will have eight thousand six four three point sixty eight sixty nine per month that's a pretty good amount to live off of let's look at part b i've actually just copied everything we just did and i'm going to redo it except now two months after making our last deposit that means instead of having a payment come out here at 15 our first payment comes out one month later and our last payment comes out here what does that do well that makes this an ordinary annuity let's erase that and i'm going to use another color this time it's an ordinary annuity what else changes the first part doesn't change at all still in amortization everything is the same except for this begin right over here all we're going to do to make this different is change this to off i'm going to highlight these changes that's it all we've done here is change one button that means that everything is already properly stored in my calculator so if i go to second begin second set and turn that begin mode off and now i'm going to recompute that payment with everything identical i get the correct answer we will have eight thousand seven hundred eight dollars and fifty one cents per month if we start one month later so these questions are almost the same the only difference was in that begin on or begin off let's summarize what we've done today on backtoback and deferred annuities these are twostep problems in order to get them correct we are going to have to take our time and write things out having graded about 5000 tests testing this draw a timeline when people don't draw a timeline and take the time to label it correctly they usually make a mistake circle that focal date that's an important day let's identify those annuities and those annuities the first one can often be a compound interest problem we do it in the same way we just have payment equals zero so we look for the problem with only one unknown and that's the one we're going to solve first if we have something with two unknowns then we should solve that one second because we won't be able to do it an important point we're going to store those intermediate values with their decimals because we keep those unless we're taking money out and putting it in a different bank we can carry all those decimals with us pay really close attention to begin and end so write that down on your piece of paper put that in your calculator make sure you do that think about your counting and at the end of the day an important thing is to remember that interest is the money you withdraw minus the money that you put in that's the same as money paid minus money borrowed out and in are just expressions but if we're borrowing money we usually write it this way intermediate values don't go in here that's an important thing to note and actually i'm going to write one more thing round your payments because we're going to put in a bunch of payments but we have to round to the nearest set because we can't put in a half a cent lesson 15 bonds perpetuities and stocks we're going to start by learning about coupon bonds and i should put a date on this when governments and companies want to raise money sometimes they issue things called bonds this bond has a face value of one thousand dollars and i'm going to explain what that means as we go what that means is you buy actually i'm gonna write down the coupon rate is at six percent okay you buy this bond for one thousand dollars for however long the time period is every six months and bonds tend to be semiannual you get a coupon payment or your interest is calculated and sent to you so we're not compounding the interest the person who owns the bond is getting that interest i've written this as an oldfashioned coupon bond where there's literally a bunch of coupons and when you pull them off you get money at the end of the time period and that here is going to be in december 2025 you get your thousand dollars back so the money the interest is being calculated every six months and you get that so this bond has a face value of a thousand dollars a coupon rate of six percent compounded semiannually and it has a maturity of 10 years that means that for 10 years you get these payments what's the semiannual coupon payment for this we're just coming up with the interest after one half year or the simple interest so the coupon payment is really the interest accrued in one period or here it's going to be six months and i'm going to say that often bonds are semiannual so our interest here is going to be i equals prt because we're just using simple interest our interest is going to be the principal that's a thousand dollars the rate well that's just going to be the periodic rate so if it's six percent divided by two and t well that's where that divided by two comes from so six months for one or is it 0.06 times a half that's 30 and that's where i got this 30 up here so every six months you get a check in the mail for 30 dollars let's look at this bond in a timeline so this goes on for 10 years and every six months we get a payment so i'm gonna put in a payment of thirty dollars thirty dollars every six months starting from there we get thirty dollars at the very end we still get thirty dollars but we also get a thousand dollars this is in fact an ordinary annuity how much did we pay for this originally we paid one thousand dollars the face value the interesting thing here comes when we don't keep it for the full 10 years bonds are financial instrument just like stocks and we can sell them on the open market on the bond market in this case it's usually useful to calculate what we call fair market value so fair market value how much somebody else would pay for the bond so right now it's three years later so that means i'm just gonna write in seven years are left anybody can go and buy a similar bond the same type of bond at eight percent so how much do you think somebody would pay for our bond which is in fact at six percent so this is what we're going to be computing so looking at this we have the exact same timeline except for the fact that we only have seven years remaining three years have already happened so the timeline here just has to do with the fact that there's only seven years left looking at this this is an ordinary annuity ordinary begin is off it's also simple because looks like our interest rate is eight percent compounded semiannually and our coupon payments are semiannual that makes this a simple ordinary annuity i'm going to go through and calculate all of this and i'm going to note this iy isn't six anymore it's changed to what the market is so that's important you're using your new interest rate and that's how many coupon payments are left and that is well we have seven years of twice a year payments 14 payments left present value is what we're trying to compute that's going to be our fair market value the payment well that was that thirty dollars and future value that's the thousand dollars we get at the end this is important these two are going to have the same sign you can make them both positive or both negative but they have to have the same sign i'm just going to write down some notes on this so you remember payments left present value is fair market value that's what we're computing almost always this is our new rate the payment that's the old rate times the face value or future value it's kind of nice that the face value and future value both have the same initials i would say ordinarily this is an ordinary annuity i can't see very many opportunities where it isn't and i am going to put in a little note here that these have the same sign they're either both positive or they're both negative and you can choose which it is but they have to be the same so let's just bump that in so we go into pycy make sure it's 2 14 8 percent our payment is 30 and a thousand dollars is the future value so now all i'm going to do is compute that present value and i get that the fair market value is 840 894 dollars and 37 cents it's less than a thousand and that's because anybody can get forty dollar payment that's eight percent divided by two times a thousand if anybody can get a payment of forty dollars why would they want our payment of only thirty dollars the answer is only if the price is discounted let's try one more how much is the bond worth if you sell it in four years and the interest rate for similar bonds is five percent compounded semiannually that means anybody buying a similar bond has a coupon payment of a thousand dollars times 0.05 over 2 which is 25 so our 30 bond should be worth more now four years means six years left which makes our n six times two means we have 12 payments again our py and cy are two our interest rate has gone down to five present value is what we're going to compute and our payment and future value stay the same and still an ordinary annuity so all i'm going to change here because i have everything already in my calculator is 12 and 5 i way and we can always go recall and then press something to make sure it is correct now i'm just going to recompute that present value and i find out that the fair market value has gone up it's actually 1051.29 which makes sense we've locked in at a higher rate that makes it more valuable than bonds that are selling right now a perpetuity is an annuity that goes on forever how does this work this works by paying out only the interest which leaves the principal untouched our payment here is going to be just like the bond the amount of interest accrued in one period so if we have a periodic rate of i as we often do and we have a principle of pv in the bank we end up with this payment equals pv times i and i'm just going to note that this is just like a bond payment and just like a bond payment that payment is coming out of the bank so what we're doing is we're looking at the interest that accrues every month or year or six months we're taking all that interest and we're spending it i'm going to take this equation and i'm going to solve for pv by dividing both sides by i remembering i can't be zero or this doesn't make any sense whatsoever here i've got two important equations and you will have these on tests these are called the ordinary perpetuity formulas okay a wealthy bcit alumnus has decided to make an endowment to the school of business to fund an annual scholarship for the best business math student she will donate fifteen thousand dollars and the funds will be invested at six point six percent effective how much will the annual scholarship be the first scholarships in one year so we're gonna deposit fifteen 000 and then every year we're going to take out the interest when are we going to stop never this goes on in perpetuity which means forever we've got j1 equals 6.6 percent well that's the same as a periodic rate of 6.6 percent a year here using the formulas from above our payment is going to be 15 000 times 0.066 which gives us 990 dollars b if they decide to give out the first scholarship today instead of next year how much will the alumnus have to donate to keep the exact same scholarship from part a i'm going to draw this in one more time now we're going to put in something and immediately we're going to take out 990 dollars this is a one year 990 etc forever and forever in perpetuity this is a different type of perpetuity it's called unsurprisingly a perpetuity do perpetuity do starts today so the first payment is immediate just like with an annuity do so we are going to need how much money well we need from our earlier one this much to start in a year so it's payment over i plus one extra payment of 990 for right now let's put that in so we're going to need 990 dollars over 6.6 plus 9.90 that is well it's 15 000 that's what we needed before plus 990. so 15 990. that's the perpetuity due formula i'm going to rewrite this one present value equals payment over i plus payment moving this around and solving for payment which i encourage you to do as an algebra exercise but you don't need to if you try to solve this for payment using some factoring you end up with this payment equals i times present value or present value times i divided by 1 plus i you're taking it back one period in time these are the perpetuity do formula so let's just write that down and using these we can do everything we want if she decides to keep her endowment at 15 000 how much will the annual scholarship be if the first scholarship is today so this is asking us to find payment of a perpetuity due so that's going to be this equation over here i'm going to write this down i times present value divided by 1 plus i which is 0.066 times that fifteen thousand dollars divided by 1.066 let's actually look at this 15 000 times 0.066 that's that 990 we had before and we're gonna divide it by one year of interest that gives us 928 and 71 cents it's going to be less because we have one less year to accrue interest the win it all lottery offers you two choices for a grand prize either cash prize of 1.5 million dollars or seven thousand dollars per month forever with the first payment today what should you select if interest is six percent monthly so we've got two methods here i'm going to use the first method and then i'm going to try the second one let's find the pv of both options well option one so let's go a 1.5 million dollars has a pv of well that's 1.5 million dollars it's just getting that money up front now let's look at option b that was seven thousand dollars a month starting today that is a perpetuity due and our i is going to be well six percent monthly is a half a percent per month and our payment is seven thousand so our present value is going to be payment over i plus payment which is the same as seven thousand dollars divided by 0.005 plus 7 000 which gives us you can do that on your calculator follow along i've done this already and it gives me about 1.4 million dollars so i don't know about you i choose this i prefer to have 1.5 million dollars right away than something that has a present value of only 1.4 million dollars but let's try this again so let's do method two if i invest that 1.5 million dollars in a perpetuity due so if i took that 1.5 million dollars and i put it in the bank and i pulled out money every single month forever how much money would that be so if we took that cash and put it in this is kind of a stranger method but the interesting thing is that we're going to end up with a similar answer so i'm just going to use this formula i is still .005 my present value is 1.5 million and i'm going to divide that by 1.005 so let's just do that over here 1.5 million times 0.005 and i'm going to divide that by 1.005 and it looks like i've got a payment as 7 4 6 2 and 69 cents and this is better so i prefer 7 400 a month to 7 000 a month the important thing is that no matter what we do a is going to be the better option that's most of what there is to perpetuities but perpetuities could get complicated we can get deferred perpetuities that means perpetuities that start maybe 10 years from now or after an annuity so we can combine perpetuities uh with an annuity or a compound interest problem to get something way more complicated we can also get general perpetuities so when p y and c y are different this becomes really complicated so what we're going to do is do a calculator cheat it's a cheat or a trick because our calculator isn't really supposed to do this but we can make this work by pretending that n is very big so really we want our money to last forever but if we made our money it lasts for a thousand years we're going to be okay the round off between this is almost nothing so let's do part c again in part c i'm going to do the calculator buttons so in part c we had something where the annual rate was 6.6 percent our payments were annual and our compounding period was annual but we could change that i'm gonna make this last a thousand years putting in a bunch of nines will also work if your n is too too big you might end up stalling out your calculator so a thousand years seems to get pretty good results our present value was fifteen thousand dollars our payment that's what we were computing we're pretending we run out of money that's the important thing and it's due so here is an important thing it's not going to be zero we're pretending it's zero everything else is the same i'm going to go with 1000 years so if we had py was 12 and would be 12 000. so just multiply your py by a thousand and that seems to not jam out the calculator so let's go through this make our py and cy1 n is a thousand years six point six is our interest our present value was fifteen thousand dollars our payment was nothing and our future value was zero and begin is on so let's compute what the payment was and this was question one part c that payment was going to be exactly what we got 928 and 71 cents stocks or dividend stocks this is a coupon bond basically that just goes on forever so this is a combination of bonds in the first first part of this lesson and perpetuities from the second part so i'm just gonna simplify totally simplify the stock process obviously it's always more complicated so to simplify we're always going to sell right after we get a dividend payment why do we do this that makes this ordinary if i do it that way then i'm only calculating ordinary perpetuities and that's always going to be easier two now here's the big if assume that our dividends are a constant number and this is a really big if if you guys have know anything about the stock market you know that stocks go up and down the dividends will change as the company does better or worse because dividends are part of the profits and that is not going to be a constant but for the purpose of assessing fair market value we say hey the payment that's going on right now will probably go on forever at the easiest stocks are really just the easiest simple ordinary perpetuities you purchase some preferred shares that have a semiannual dividend of a dollar 25. how much should you pay for the shares if the interest is five percent compounded semiannually and the first dividend is in six months this is going to be a simple ordinary perpetuity so our interest rate is five percent compounded semiannually or two and a half percent and this is a simple ordinary perpetuity one note i've put in some semiannual ones here to make it more similar to the ones that we did earlier in general stocks tend to be quarterly so expect to see quarterly payments and compounding so let's look at this our fair market value is the present value which makes it payment over i in this case that's going to be a dollar 25 divided by 0.025 or let's work this out 1.25 divided by .025 50 so those stocks are worth fifty dollars each and every six months you get a check in the mail for a dollar twenty five let's try it again you purchase the shares in question four for fifty dollars each i'm gonna write in in each and then interest rate rises to eight percent compounded semiannually how much would you make or lose and here it's going to be per stock because we don't know how many stocks there are our new fair market value as the stock market has changed is going to be a dollar 25 over our new periodic interest rate eight percent divided by two is 0.04 which gives us 31.25 that's how much each stock is worth so that means we have a loss i'm putting in brackets here capital because this is a capital loss of 50 minus 31.25 per stock or 18.75 per share or per stock why don't i say capital because if i have actually held on to the stock for a while i've gotten a bunch of payments and we don't use those payments when we're computing the profit and loss that's more for tax reasons and i'm not going to get into that just know here we're only looking at the value not of those dividends how much money would you make or lose if the interest rate was now six percent effective and we're just still going to assume the first dividend is in six months that makes this an ordinary perpetuity but it's no longer going to be simple because we get payments twice a year but we compound once a year so now this is going to be a general perpetuity anytime it's general uh we are allowed to convert that interest rate using interest conversion but it's easier just to use the calculator again future value is zero and n is going to be a thousand years which is 2 000 payments it's two times a thousand and why do i do that multiplying by two it really does mean that the round off is less than a cent in almost all cases and we don't get into trouble for using what's really an approximation method or a trick going into here i'm going to start with my pycy set my py to 2 my cy has changed so i'll make that different i always like to scroll around there make sure i did it properly our n is now 2 000 and our interest rate is 6. present value is what i'm computing a dollar 25 is the payment and i need to make sure that i put in 0 for the future value compute the present value and now i get a fair market value of 42.28 cents per share which is still a loss because i bought them for 50 so i'm taking a loss and that's going to end up being well let's make this negative and add a fifty seven dollars and 72 cents per share is our loss lesson 16 mortgages and amortization part one the key to today's work is that balance is decreasing in a mortgage that's why it's called amortization it's when we are paying off a loan conventionally mortgages are paying off a building or a house but this could be anything paying off a car loan an rv a boat any makes sense what we're going to do first is go over some of the vocabulary first we have balance how much do we owe at a given time next we have principal how much of the mortgage we have paid off with those two we have this formula the balance that's how much we owe right now plus the principal how much we've paid off is the amount of the original mortgage how much we borrowed originally next we have interest and we should be very familiar with this one so far the interest is all the other money we paid so we have all the money we paid minus the interest is the money we borrowed or original mortgage for example i bought a house that cost six hundred thousand dollars with a down payment of a hundred thousand dollars i've made two hundred thousand dollars worth of payments and today the balance is four hundred and fifty thousand dollars the original mortgage was for five hundred thousand dollars because one hundred thousand was money i paid in cash and it's not part of this in any way so principal paid is going to be 50 000 because it's worth 450 000 today i'm going to use k for thousand that's how much principle we've paid interest is the rest of the stuff the interest that we've paid is going to be 150 000 finally the balance today well we know that that's 450 000. i'm gonna put some abbreviations in because our calculator uses these balance is bell int is interest p r n is principal and the original mortgage i'm going to call that the pv because it's the present value of our equation more things to talk about we've talked about this word before but we have to redefine amortization the amortization is the full length of the loan typically 20 to 25 years so that's over the entire lifetime this is different than the term of the loan the term is the length of time that the interest rate is fixed and the payments are fixed we usually say it's between three and seven years it's almost always five years over this term you know what your payments are and you've locked in at an interest rate at the end of the term the interest rate could change and odds are it will change let's start with an example you've just purchased a new house and taken a mortgage for a hundred thousand dollars the interest rate is 12 compounded monthly and you will make payments for 25 years find the size of the monthly payment so here we're going to assume that the amortization is 25 years and so we're going to work out our payments as if we're paying for 25 years we know though that our term is probably shorter after five years interest rates will have gone up or down depending on what's going on in the world so let's fill out our calculator our mortgage is for a hundred thousand dollars i like to make my present value positive but some people really like to make them negative to show that they're borrowing money either one is fine with me as long as your present value and your payment are opposite signs your future value though should always be zero because when you pay off a loan you pay it off completely unless you're told otherwise with a mortgage any money you pay at the beginning is considered part of the down payment so we're always going to treat this as an ordinary annuity in this case our interest rate is 12 compounded monthly and we're going to make payments let's assume those are monthly payments because that's typical for 25 years so 25 times 12 is 300 years in general you're going to see that mortgages in canada tend to be general annuities but for now we're going to stick with something fairly simple so let's work this out start with pycy make that 12 already seem to be there 300 is our month our interest rate is 12 high interest rate we borrowed a hundred thousand dollars that's our payment our present value and our future value is zero so when i compute payment i end up with this number this is really important you can't pay 22.4 cents if we round it down a little at the end of 25 years we'd owe the bank money the bank is not okay with that so with our payment we're always going to round up sometimes to the next cent and then our payment would be and we're going to do this negative 1053.23 or even next dollar sometimes we might even round up to the next hundred dollars in this case it says in the next cent sent is two decimal places we're going to be using our calculator to do a lot of the work for us so we need it to be correct in order to do that we're going to have to reenter our payment it's a really important step 1053.23 press payment and then press compute n now you'll notice i've got a negative n that's because i forgot that negative sign on purpose but still if your n makes no sense you know you made a mistake let's go back to that payment and make it negative and when i recompute the n now i should get something a tiny tiny bit smaller nine four nine eight seven so you're looking for something that's a tiny bit smaller than 300 or your original n that means you're going to make 299 payments of the same size and one ittybitty little payment that will be different let's talk about amortization tables or schedule an amortization schedule is just a list of all the payments that you make along with the balance at the end of that period and the principle and interest that are part of that there were three methods of constructing these and we're going to actually look at all three the first one we're going to do is by hand the second is using the builtin amortization table in the ba2 plus calculator and thirdly excel or another computer program spreadsheets are wonderful for this sort of thing so we're going to look at them all so let's start by doing one by hand and we are not going to do this whole thing because i for one do not have the patience at the beginning we owed a hundred thousand dollars we put that here under loan balance the interest that we paid on this was a thousand dollars i found that by remembering that i is 12 over 12 equals 0.01 so the interest of the first month is going to be the balance times i which is a thousand dollars so i take that thousand dollars let's work that out here i multiply that by .01 and it says that sorry it was a hundred thousand dollars times .01 and i owe an extra thousand dollars so now i owe a thousand a hundred and one thousand dollars i made payment of a thousand fifty three twenty three we already worked that out which means that a thousand of that was interest and 53 it was principal this plus this equals this my new balance is then a hundred thousand dollars minus the amount of principal i paid 53 dollars and 23 cents so now we owe 99 946.77 so i'm going to start off this row that way 99 how much interest do i owe on that well let's multiply it by 0.01 and it says i owe 999.46 i'm rounding here at every step normally a computer is going to do this and every bank has its own rounding procedure my payment is the same because we have even payments in an annuity i'm gonna write that all down all the same which means the principal well if i make this negative and then add my payment 1053.23 it looks like i actually paid off 53.76 leaving me with a new balance of minus and then let's add how much we owed nine nine nine four six point seven seven and that is now we owe nine nine eight nine three and one cent perfect that is our amortization table in order to find the balance of the loan after three periods i could continue on doing this by hand but that is tedious and frustrating so we're gonna move on to method number three and i'm gonna do the rest of this with excel using excel i haven't done anything too fancy here except copy over the exact same thing we had but now into excel so i'm going to make sure that i have the correct interest rate i have to convert this for xl so i'm going to say that if j12 is 12 then i is 0.01 we started with a hundred thousand dollars and we then that thousand was actually a hundred thousand times the interest rate for you guys who are excel aficionados pressing f4 here means that we've fixed that so that interest rate stays the same for the whole problem enter our payment that's fixed and our principal that's going to be well how much we paid minus the interest and our new balance is going to be that hundred thousand dollars minus the amount of principal we paid off here what i owe at the beginning of month two is what i owe at the end of month one so now i can fill down so i'm going to take all of these and fill them all the way down so that i'm filling out the entire thing at once one thing to be careful of is sometimes excel will fill incorrectly so i'm just going to make sure everything is working exactly according to plan once i do this you can see that here i've got the balance at the end of the third period so let's go back to our question and say that we have a balance of 99 838 and 71 cents let's do another method so here what we're going to do is use the amortization schedule on the calculator so above the present value is the amortization button so second amortization what i'm going to do is say let's look at the third row if i want to look at the third row i say from p1 equals 3 that means the beginning of the third row and i go 3 enter from to the end of the third row 3 and enter the balance is now everything else i'm going to read off the balance is 99838.71 the principal we've paid is negative 54299 that's 30 and the interest that we've paid is negative 998.93 when we add these things up together you'll see that they are exactly that 1053 and 23 cents negative because our payment is negative it's decreasing the balance that's the same thing that we got via excel well we've already done part d here the principal was 54 30 and the interest was 998.93 so now let's look at how much we paid in the first year again we're going to do two methods for this and i'm not going to do it by hand because that's a lot of work which seems a little silly so going back to here i'm going to sum everything the loan balance doesn't make sense to add but i'm going to go some bracket and then i highlight everything i've paid that's going to add all those numbers up together my payments well it looks like i've made 12 000 worth of payments how much principal have i paid off well all those add up together and now my new balance would be this 9938 so let's make everything her bold because that will look a lot nicer so if we look here you can see that at the end of year one then we have the balance is nine nine three two four point nine one that's the balance at the end of year one how much interest did we pay over the entire year we paid 11 963 of interest and we only paid off 675 dollars worth of principal that's what happens when we have a very high interest rate 12 percent so how much did we pay in the first year in the first year we made 12 payments of 1053 and 23 cents and we could see that in our excel so let's clear out of this menu 12 times 1053.23 we made 12 638.76 worth of payments so now let's look at our amortization schedule on the calculator so second amortization when i'm doing the entire first year that says from the beginning of the first month so let's change that to 1 to the end of the year the end of the 12th month p2 equals 12 that's one year well how much did we pay our balance that's part h was 99324.91 our interest was a lot again 11963.67 and the principal we paid off was 675 looking back at our excel you can see that this is exactly the same the principal paid 675.09 those are the same numbers balance 99324 91 same thing and when we go to the interest paid that's going to be 11963.67 so again we're getting the exact same answers no matter which method we use how much interest did we pay in the third year the easiest way to do this is the amortization table built into our calculator the third year starts in the 25th month and it ends in the 36th month that's because the second year ends at 24. so the next one starts and we say at the beginning so let's go up here so p1 must be 25 p2 is 36 that's three years so over those three years we paid less interest than we did in the first two years in the first year but we still paid 11 781.58 cents worth of interest finally let's find our last payment so what i mean by that is we have 299 payments that are exactly 1053 and 23 cents and we have one littler payment the more we round the more different that is there's a several different ways that we can find this i'm going to call this the harder method that's find the balance at the end of the 299th month add one month of interest this is actually not that bad if we do it in excel that's the harder method easier is to use our calculator so pretend we overpaid and use p2 equals 300. it is going to be much easier if i just show you let's go into our amortization and p1 it doesn't matter what p1 is because i'm only looking at the balance but let's say let's only look at that final month so p1 is 300 p2 is 300 that last month and now i'm going to look at it balance is negative 11.01 that means we overpaid by eleven dollars had we paid a thousand fifty three and twenty three cents we would have overpaid by this so we really should have paid well that regular payment minus 1101 let's do that so that's already negative so if i just say plus 1053.23 i should have paid 11 1042.22 let's do that again with excel because excel is actually a really good method so all i've done here in excel is instead of putting in that total i just copied it down one more month and then another month going to the end and we could hide all those rows which might be a smart thing to do at the end of the 299th month i owe a thousand dollars 31 1031 and 91 cents let's just pull these down a little bit more so i owe 10 and 32 cents worth of interest that means that i should only make a payment of 1031.91 plus 10.32 or 1042.22 pulling these down a little bit more you can see that now i owe no money at the end that's the same answer we got before alternatively if i just copied what i had before and this changed up to 1054 like that 1053 you can see that i would have overpaid by one cent either way this is the answer for the final payment let's end with a little bit more vocabulary because you'll see these if you start looking at mortgages or doing your own research a fixed rate mortgage is one where the interest rate stays the same for the entire term typically five years the opposite of that is called a variable rate mortgage in a variable rate mortgage the payment is fixed but interest varies according to the prime rate that's fixed by the bank of canada in general a fixed rate mortgage is very stable it's safe you know exactly what will happen at the end of the five years variable rate is risky if interest rates go up you could end up owing more in your mortgage but if interest rates go down well that will be better for you because you will owe less then we've got the vert closed versus open mortgages in a closed mortgage if you try to prepay or pay off your entire mortgage or change your payments there will be a penalty on that so even if you sell your house midterm there's a penalty in an open mortgage you can do whatever you'd like you could make extra payments sometimes you can make smaller payments if you need you can pay off the entire mortgage whenever you'd like typically because you have a lot more freedom in this mortgage you might have a higher interest rate finally i've said this before the down payment is not part of your mortgage it's the money that you pay right away i'm going to say that a very typical one is 20 it can be more or less in canada if you have at least a 20 down payment to not borrow that money then you don't have to pay what's called mortgage insurance where you're taking out an insurance policy on the mortgage and that goes to the cmhc that's a canadian institute 20 percent means less fees 15 you pay more fees lesson 17 mortgages and amortization part two we're going to jump right in with the problem but this time it's going to be a general annuity as canadian mortgages tend to be banks will apply the thirty percent rule no more than thirty percent of your gross income may be used for your mortgage payment if your gross income is three thousand three hundred thirty three dollars and thirty three cents you're looking for a fiveyear term on a 25year amortization and banks are charging j2 equals six percent find the maximum size of the payment and the maximum mortgage what this means is that the size of the mortgage you can get really depends on your income banks are going to evaluate several factors one of them is your income and one of them is your debt to credit ratio how much other debt you have and how much access to credit you have if your gross income is three hundred and thirty three dollars and thirty three cents per month and we can use thirty percent of that for a mortgage payment then our maximum mortgage payment is going to be a thousand dollars so that's the biggest mortgage payment we can afford if we end up having to pay two thousand dollars we wouldn't be able to afford it when we try to calculate our maximum mortgage we're going to use that as our payment let's fill in the rest of our annuity in a canadian mortgage we're typically looking at a general annuity cy tends to be 2 and py is 12 because we're paying a monthly our semiannual interest rate is six percent we're going to have this be a fiveyear term the 25year amortization when we're calculating that that's just going to be a 25 years because we're going to pay it off in 25 years in five years we're going to have to reevaluate and figure out what's going on we're going to try to figure out a present value here and our future value is always zero begin is off because any money we borrow or pay at the very beginning is part of the down payment so let's start with that 12 and cy is two notice when i enter that p y and cy are now different n is 300 our interest rate is six our payment is one thousand dollars making that negative and our future value is zero so when i compute the present value we can see that we can afford to borrow 156 297.23 which is a reasonable sized mortgage that's our maximum mortgage but if we have some cash to put towards a down payment we could buy a house that cost two hundred thousand if we had about forty four thousand dollars down payment so we'd have to put some money down but we can afford to borrow 156 thousand so let's say we got this size mortgage and i'm going to leave it as is but in reality would probably round that number to 23 cents so let's look at what happens at the end of this mortgage well we're not at the end of the mortgage right now we're at the end of the term let's say five years has gone by let's look to see what happens there's a few different methods method one is going to be to use the amortization and that's going to be my preferred way of doing things if we go into that second pv amortization and p1 is now going to be it's the end of the five years so p1 is one and the end of the five years p2 will be 60. so if i go down now my balance is 140 for 12 and 28 cents method number two well we could just set n equals 60 and compute the future value and that would be the exact same thing method three because we always have another method is to use excel let's look at this with excel you might recognize this as the same type of sheet that we looked at in lesson 16. this is an amortization table or an amortization schedule for our mortgage except excel does not deal with general annuities as well as our calculator does so i put in my semiannual rate and i converted it to effective using the effect command then i had to switch it to a j12 using the nominal command finally i divided it by 12 and that's the interest that i used you can see that one so i took my loan balance i found the interest i put in my payment is a constant principal again is just payment minus the interest and finally whatever i have is going to be what i started with minus the principal paid is our new balance in the next month i just pull my loan balance down from the previous month at the beginning this is exactly my amortization schedule and now i can look up any payment i want i've used a very interesting thing in excel where i've frozen the pane so if you'll notice i'm just scrolling down and i'm going to scroll down to month 60. at the end of the 60th month i have oh 140 412 dollars and 28 cents that's exactly what we got on the calculator which is helpful after five years the interest rate has increased to j2 equals eight percent what's the size of our new payment so what's happened here is five years have gone by five years have passed which means that i have 20 years left and my new present value is actually going to be well this number 144 12 28 cents don't worry so much about the decimal and rounding here if you're sticking with the same bank you don't have to do an intermediate rounding step but if you take your mortgage over to another bank you would what i'm going to do is take this and just press pv and now if we look over here recall present value is exactly what i want it to be that's going to be my new mortgage so all we have to do is fill out the exact same table we know that our present value is how much money we owe our interest rate has increased to j2 equals eight percent and we're still going to make monthly payments we have 20 years left so that's 240 payments we're going to try to find our payment at the end of those 20 years hopefully we have paid everything off again this is an ordinary annuity so let's look at this our pycy are the same as they should be but now we only have 240 months left but our interest rate is eight our future value is the same we've reset our let's make sure that future value is zero so let's compute our new payment our new payment is going to be 11 63 and 12 cents here we're going to assume that we're going to have to round up so i'm going to reenter that so let's put that in 11 63 2 oops let's make that our new payment and just to check i recompute the n and i get just under 240 that's what i was looking 1166 that is just wrong oops let's reenter that payment with the rounded amount 1163.12 and that's negative let's press payment there we go and recompute our n our n is now just under 240 which is what we want to be so we're going to always round up and reenter and now we know our new payments let's go ahead and update our excel sheet so our excel sheet now says this is 11 63 and 12 cents let's press enter and then let's just spread this down make sure that it stays the same sometimes excel starts to count upwards that's probably enough because we're only doing this for a year let's go back to that 60 years and now we can see that we're paying this differently of course i have to change my interest rate as well so let's just stop doing this in excel let's do it again five years later the interest rate stays the same but we can actually afford an extra 12 000 on the mortgage assuming we will amortize the balance over the remaining 15 years what is the payment so what i'm going to do is put in an extra payment so we're going to use the amortization again and figure out what happens after five years one thing to remember the calculator doesn't remember the first five years those have been wiped out it thinks it's a 20year notebook so p1 equals 1 and p2 equals 60. so we're doing exactly what we did in the last step except now our balance is less 122 671.40 but we're also going to pay some money that's an extra 12 000 that we can afford to pay so if we can afford to pay an extra twelve thousand now it's only a hundred and ten thousand i'm going to go ahead and make that the present value so now i'm looking at a 15 year mortgage that starts at a hundred and ten thousand our payment is what we're going to be computing but again we're going to pay it off and it's always an ordinary annuity i'm making monthly payments it's compounded semiannually and our interest rate stays at eight that many years sorry months 15 times 12 is going to be 180 months so let's go ahead and work that out second py is 12 and 2 that stays the same let's change our n to 180 our present value i've already changed our iy stays the same and so all i have to do is compute the payment which is now 1049 and 34 cents because remember we're rounding up and i'm going to go ahead there and reenter negative payment and now i recompute the n and it's just under 180 which is exactly what i want to do let's look at this mortgage as a timeline so if i have six percent and then eight percent what i have is a 25year amortization broken up into fiveyear terms originally how much did i borrow i borrowed 156 297 and i like to treat that as arrow in because that was money that i was getting from the bank my payments come out of my accounts and there are payments of a thousand i make about 60 of those exactly 60 of those with the last one coming out at year five at that point my balance or how much i owe is around 140 000. then i start making more payments i've raised my payments because the interest rate has gotten higher so i make a bunch of payments of 1163 and 12 cents and my last one comes out exactly at the 12 10 year anniversary of my mortgage at this point i'm gonna make one extra special at the same time deposit of twelve thousand dollars comes out of my account it goes on to my mortgage so my balance goes for to 110 671 after i make that 12 thousand dollar payment now i'm going to make some more payments so i keep on going and now i'm going to go all the way to the end because uh five of these is a lot and each of these payments is going to be 1049 and 34 cents so when i made that extra prepayment against the principal which i'm usually allowed to do at the anniversary date or when i renew my mortgage it reduced my payments so that's how much i did now let's figure out what the interest was on this mortgage okay well the interest was money paid minus money borrowed and i'm going to uh let's ignore the fact that that last month is a little bit tinier what we paid is going to be 60 payments of a thousand dollars plus 60 payments of 11 63 and 12 cents plus 180 payments of 1049 and 34 cents plus 12 000 and that's really going to be 179 plus one extra one but we're not going to worry about that tiny little extra how much did we borrow where original borrowing was a hundred and fifty six thousand two hundred ninety seven dollars and twenty three cents so in the end we paid a hundred and seventy four thousand three hundred seventy one dollars and seventeen cents in interest that's a lot but borrowing is expensive let's go back to part d we made that twelve thousand dollar prepayment and we used that money in order to lower our payments but what if we could afford the payment that we used to be paying that is we can afford to still pay 1163 and 12 cents that's how much we were used to it still fits into our budget our present value if you remember let's go back to recall present value remember at that time we owed 110 671 on our mortgage interest rate was eight percent and we're making monthly payments and compounding semiannually if i change my payment to 1163.12 a higher payment than i need i should be able to pay off my mortgage faster so let's compute the payment so compute payment that is not what i meant to do compute future compute n is what we're looking for so our new n is 149.64 months so 149 full months and then one small payment if i divide that by 12 we find out that's about 12 and a half years so we can save two and a half years pay it off faster and in the end we're going to be paying less of a mortgage if we do this example three let's do the exact same thing again this time your gross income is five thousand dollars per month that's your income before taxes the rate is now j2 equals eight percent let's write that in as we go and we're looking for a threeyear term and a 20year amortization 20 years and everything is monthly that means we have 240 months on our mortgage we can afford as our maximum payment well thirty percent of that five thousand dollars so let's multiply that by thirty percent and now we know we can afford fifteen hundred dollars and you can do this on a calculator so i'm gonna go ahead and write in that my payment is fifteen hundred dollars we're always going to pay it off and complete always an ordinary annuity and here because it doesn't say we're doing monthly payments let's compute our p y and cy stay the same through this whole lesson so i don't have to worry about that but i do have to reset n i y present value let's skip payment is 1500 and the future value is zero so when i compute my present value it turns out i can afford or you can afford 181 000 and 20 181 000 81 and 24 cents that's the size of our mortgage after three years you renew your mortgage at the same rate but are able to make a ten thousand dollar payment like we did last time we're going to run through two scenarios first we're just going to assume that we're going to amortize over the remaining 17 years this means our payments will decrease freeing up cash flow for other things our other option which we'll do next is keep our payments the same and then our time will decrease both of which are all right so let's see how much money we owe after three years we owe well that's going to be p2 equals 36. so p1 is 1 p2 is 36 or 3 years well we owe and sixty eight thousand dollars and forty cents so at the end of three years we owe 168 000 we're going to make a 10 000 payment so i'm going to take that number i just pressed clear one time to make it just the number itself i'm going to subtract 10 000 and that is going to be my new present value so let's write that in 158 441 and 40 cents i'm going to recompute my payment everything else stays the same except for my n because i have 17 times 12 is 204 payments left so let's change that n to 204 and recompute the payment and i get 14 10.95 because i'm rounding that up now let's say we wanted to keep our payments the same we know we can afford fifteen hundred dollars even though we owe 158 441 we have a lower balance and we could get away with a lower payment but we don't want to everything's going to stay the same except for the n which i'm now going to recompute monthly payments seminal compounding etc etc so let's make our payment back to 1500 which is higher than the 1410 that we needed now when i compute n i get n is smaller 180 it's a little over 15 years 15 years it's 15 years and a tiny little bit so we've now saved two years off of our mortgage we've also saved interest i'm not going to go through and compute the exact number of interest here i'm going to do that in excel instead i've gone ahead and made this into an excel sheet we started with a hundred and eighty one thousand eighty one dollars and twenty four cents then we paid fifteen hundred dollars a month eight percent interest if we scroll down note that i made one very large payment of ten thousand eleven thousand five hundred dollars instead of fifteen hundred an extra ten thousand dollars at the end of that month the third year 36 months we owed 158 441 dollars and 40 cents the next month over in column a here the lower payments i lowered my payment to 14 10.95 here i left my payments the same notice that my balance is shrinking faster on this side let's zoom down all those months until the 218th month that's about 18 years where i make one smaller payment of 780 for the last one i just added the interest to the balance owing and that is 218. going down over here we pay for two more years and my this one is only about 70 cents less than the other ones and in the end we've paid 170 751 dollars in interest over here with lower payments but we've only paid 153 000 over here so our difference is almost twenty thousand dollars worth of interest in that case it does make more sense to keep a higher payment
