00:01 - i'm dr mike murphy
00:03 - i earned my phd in computer science from
00:05 - clemson university
00:06 - and i teach computer science and
00:08 - information systems at coastal carolina
00:10 - university
00:11 - located in conway south carolina in this
00:16 - lecture
00:16 - i'm going to introduce basic security
00:18 - principles
00:19 - and begin discussing information system
00:22 - security
00:24 - i'm going to begin by defining what we
00:26 - mean by security
00:28 - discuss how security from the physical
00:30 - world evolved
00:32 - into the information world talk about
00:35 - something called the cia triad
00:37 - which establishes the principles of
00:39 - information security that we typically
00:41 - use for evaluating systems and then talk
00:44 - about some of the fundamental
00:45 - limitations and trade-offs
00:47 - between both security and functionality
00:51 - and between principles in the cia triad
00:56 - so what do we mean by security
01:00 - this is something of a challenging
01:02 - question
01:04 - because we all have an intuitive concept
01:08 - of what it means to be secure but it's
01:10 - sometimes difficult
01:12 - to formalize this concept into something
01:14 - that we can study and something that we
01:16 - can evaluate
01:18 - for example we feel secure locked inside
01:22 - our own houses or perhaps locked inside
01:25 - our own vehicles but
01:29 - what exactly are we protecting ourselves
01:31 - against
01:33 - what exactly makes us secure versus
01:36 - not secure
01:40 - we look back through history we can see
01:42 - many examples
01:44 - of mankind's quest to build secure
01:47 - environments in which to live in which
01:50 - to work
01:52 - or to guard assets
01:56 - to guard entries into areas
01:59 - and so forth in this photograph for
02:02 - example
02:04 - we can see out here the island fort
02:07 - known as fort sumter which guarded the
02:10 - entrance to charleston harbor
02:12 - in south carolina and provided
02:16 - a secure barrier
02:19 - equipped with cannons to attempt to
02:22 - deter enemy ships from sailing into the
02:25 - harbor
02:27 - now this photograph was taken from fort
02:30 - moultrie
02:31 - which sits at the sites of one of the
02:33 - earliest forts
02:35 - securing charleston harbor and fort
02:38 - moultrie
02:39 - went through several renovations
02:41 - including an early to mid 20th century
02:44 - renovation
02:45 - where it was equipped with more modern
02:47 - weaponry
02:48 - again to guard the harbor against
02:51 - unauthorized shipping that might enter
02:53 - or invasion from a foreign force
03:01 - so a simple definition of security is
03:04 - protection
03:04 - protection from harm this basic idea
03:08 - is as old as society itself the idea of
03:11 - being protected from an attack
03:14 - the idea that we can have some kind of
03:16 - resistance to theft
03:18 - malicious injury and other harms that
03:20 - might befall us
03:23 - in the most basic form we're discussing
03:26 - physical security
03:27 - keeping out those who would do us harm
03:32 - and for many thousands of years physical
03:35 - security was the only concern that we
03:37 - really had
03:38 - we didn't have information processing
03:40 - systems to worry about
03:44 - so physical security really focuses on
03:46 - protection of assets or people from
03:48 - intruders
03:49 - or other types of malicious entities
03:51 - that might attempt to gain access
03:55 - now we can also extend this definition a
03:58 - little bit to say protection
04:00 - from the elements protection from
04:02 - natural forces
04:04 - wind or rain or flooding
04:07 - but for simplicity we're going to focus
04:09 - for the moment
04:10 - on intruders and the focus physical
04:14 - security
04:15 - is typically about building walls about
04:17 - excluding
04:18 - access to different resources or
04:21 - different areas
04:22 - by unauthorized parties here for example
04:25 - is a wall
04:26 - on fort moultrie on sullivan's island
04:30 - and this wall is designed
04:33 - for several purposes one of which is
04:36 - that if someone is invading by land
04:39 - it would be difficult to scale this wall
04:41 - it would provide
04:42 - a means to slow down an invader and
04:45 - thereby
04:47 - have an atta have a chance to launch a
04:50 - counter attack
04:52 - now this wall also directly faces the
04:54 - ocean
04:55 - and can be used as a bit of a sea wall
04:58 - during storms and hurricanes
05:01 - but the principle is the same we're
05:02 - trying to keep out
05:04 - unauthorized parties whether those be
05:06 - other people
05:07 - or water
05:12 - so that makes sense we have physical
05:14 - security protecting ourselves from harm
05:18 - what about information systems what
05:20 - happens when we take
05:21 - a bunch of computer systems bunch of
05:23 - information processing systems
05:25 - databases different servers business
05:28 - applications
05:30 - what happens when we have these types of
05:32 - applications
05:34 - we do have a physical security component
05:36 - in the sense that
05:38 - we don't want someone breaking in and
05:39 - stealing the physical server
05:43 - but we also have some additional issues
05:45 - because the path to be able to get into
05:47 - a server
05:48 - is not purely a physical one there's
05:50 - also an electronic
05:52 - information driven pathway
05:56 - usually the internet or system connected
05:58 - to a network that would enable someone
06:00 - to have access
06:02 - to a server for example and in many
06:05 - cases we want to provide access to these
06:08 - resources
06:09 - remotely to users we want to restrict
06:12 - that
06:12 - access to legitimate users
06:16 - so we need to extend our definition of
06:19 - protection from harm
06:20 - in order to apply to these different
06:23 - information systems
06:25 - and we typically think about three main
06:27 - categories of harm
06:29 - that could befall an information system
06:32 - the first of these is theft of
06:33 - information
06:34 - a lot of information processing systems
06:37 - contain personal information
06:39 - corporate secrets and other types of
06:41 - data that we don't want unauthorized
06:44 - people having access to
06:46 - if this information is stolen for
06:48 - example it could be used to launch
06:50 - identity theft
06:51 - or to have insights into a company's
06:54 - next product
06:54 - and possibly even steal a company's idea
06:57 - before they have a chance to
06:59 - develop that product we're also
07:02 - concerned about alteration of
07:03 - information
07:04 - this could be as simple as someone
07:06 - breaking in and defacing a website
07:08 - or it could be as complex as someone
07:10 - going in
07:11 - altering database records to cover up
07:14 - fraud
07:15 - or other types of financial crimes
07:19 - we also concern ourselves with denial of
07:21 - service or dos
07:23 - this is when systems are attacked in
07:25 - such a way
07:26 - that they are busy responding to the
07:28 - attackers and they in fact become
07:30 - so busy responding to the attackers that
07:33 - they can no longer provide service to
07:35 - their legitimate users
07:40 - so secure systems must guard against
07:43 - these problems
07:44 - they must ensure that confidential data
07:47 - remain confidential
07:49 - that the data are not changed by
07:51 - unauthorized users
07:52 - or changed by authorized users acting in
07:55 - malicious ways
07:56 - with malicious intent such as someone
07:58 - inside the company trying to steal
08:00 - information
08:01 - or trying to commit fraud and the
08:04 - systems must remain
08:05 - operational reachable and functional
08:09 - or collectively we say available
08:13 - for legitimate users so availability
08:15 - we're concerned about the system being
08:17 - up and running
08:18 - being accessible and functioning
08:21 - correctly
08:22 - for the users who are authorized to use
08:24 - that system
08:28 - these three principles form what's
08:29 - called the cia triad in security
08:32 - and that stands for confidentiality
08:34 - integrity
08:35 - and availability in an information
08:38 - system we are especially concerned with
08:41 - these three things
08:42 - we're concerned with ensuring the
08:44 - confidentiality of the system where the
08:45 - data on that system
08:47 - the integrity of the data and the system
08:49 - itself as well as the availability of
08:52 - that system
08:53 - to legitimate users we don't mind
08:55 - denying availability to illegitimate
08:57 - users
08:58 - we want to maintain availability for
09:00 - legitimate users
09:04 - so confidentiality let's start with the
09:06 - first principle in the cia triad
09:08 - this is the principle of protecting data
09:10 - from unauthorized access
09:12 - or disclosure as i mentioned before
09:15 - there are some types of data that are
09:17 - used in business that are used in
09:18 - industry that are used in government
09:20 - that are sensitive social security
09:22 - numbers for example
09:24 - can be used to facilitate identity theft
09:27 - medical records are considered to be
09:29 - confidential
09:30 - in order to protect a person's privacy
09:33 - in terms of the types of illnesses
09:35 - they've had to deal with the types of
09:36 - medical histories
09:38 - that they have corporate secrets
09:41 - so secrets about upcoming products
09:43 - products under development
09:46 - pricing models things such as
09:50 - even the margins or the amount of profit
09:53 - that a company makes on a particular
09:55 - product
09:56 - we also have military intelligence what
09:59 - kind of information has the military
10:01 - gathered
10:02 - we might want to keep that information
10:04 - secret in order to protect
10:05 - operatives in the field as well as to
10:08 - avoid embarrassment
10:09 - or tipping off an enemy that we might
10:11 - know some information about them
10:15 - there are some attackers who focus on
10:17 - trying to steal
10:18 - sensitive information folks involved
10:21 - with identity theft for example whether
10:23 - it be persons committing identity theft
10:25 - or reselling information to other people
10:28 - who commit identity theft
10:29 - are an issue in addition some folks will
10:33 - try to steal sensitive corporate
10:35 - information
10:36 - and sell that to other companies that
10:38 - are attempting to gain an advantage
10:40 - over the victim corporation
10:45 - the second principle of the cia triad
10:47 - integrity
10:48 - is the principle of ensuring that
10:50 - unauthorized or undetected changes to
10:52 - data
10:53 - or system configurations do not occur
10:56 - there are types of attacks that attempt
10:58 - to alter records or falsify information
11:01 - often in furtherance of other criminal
11:03 - activities such as fraud
11:06 - other attacks however attempt to take
11:08 - over servers entirely
11:10 - they might deface a content such as
11:13 - websites
11:14 - send unsolicited messages turn a server
11:17 - into a machine that's simply sending
11:19 - spam to everyone
11:20 - or distribute illegal content such as
11:22 - child pornography
11:24 - or copyrighted materials many other
11:27 - types of
11:28 - malicious uses can also be found for
11:30 - compromised systems
11:34 - and the third principle of the cia triad
11:37 - is that of availability
11:39 - and this is the principle of ensuring
11:41 - that systems stay online
11:43 - and the data and services provided by
11:45 - those systems remain accessible
11:47 - to authorized users some attackers
11:50 - attempt to disable corporate government
11:52 - or other systems
11:54 - in a bid to try to disrupt the
11:56 - operations of that entity
11:59 - this type of attack known as a denial of
12:02 - service attack
12:03 - is relatively common and occurs
12:06 - most often when servers are flooded with
12:09 - requests
12:10 - that prevent legitimate users from being
12:13 - served
12:17 - now we have these principles of the cia
12:19 - triad but it's important to understand
12:21 - that there are also some fundamental
12:23 - limitations
12:24 - that go along with our security
12:26 - principles
12:27 - for example one of the most fundamental
12:30 - if not
12:30 - the most fundamental trade-off exists
12:33 - between security and functionality
12:37 - and this trade-off works as follows if i
12:39 - implement a system that's extremely
12:41 - secure that has a very strict security
12:43 - policy
12:45 - it may not be truly available to
12:49 - legitimate users
12:51 - for example i could define a corporate
12:53 - security policy that says certain types
12:55 - of business information
12:57 - simply cannot be stored electronically
12:59 - they have to be stored
13:01 - in paper form or
13:05 - similarly that certain types of
13:07 - information can be stored electronically
13:09 - but cannot be stored in a database that
13:11 - can be queried by
13:12 - people in the company well if that
13:15 - information is central
13:17 - to the operation of the business the
13:19 - inability of employees to radically
13:21 - readily access that information could be
13:25 - detrimental to the business itself
13:28 - the opposite extreme if i have a highly
13:31 - functional system that pays no attention
13:33 - to security
13:34 - there's a high chance that that system
13:36 - will be compromised sooner or later
13:38 - and that could potentially have serious
13:40 - ramifications to the company
13:42 - both in terms of lost profits and in
13:45 - terms of liability
13:46 - and the potential of facing lawsuits
13:48 - which could a smaller company
13:53 - similarly there are trade-offs between
13:55 - the principles in the cia triat
13:58 - if one designs a system and focuses on
14:01 - only one of the principles in the cia
14:04 - triad
14:05 - that system may not conform very well to
14:09 - the
14:09 - other principles in the cia triad for
14:12 - example
14:13 - a great way to secure a database system
14:16 - in terms of confidentiality
14:18 - is to unplug that system and store it in
14:20 - a vault somewhere in a bank
14:22 - where it can be physically secured it
14:24 - would be very difficult for someone to
14:26 - break in and steal information off that
14:28 - system
14:29 - unfortunately however it would also be
14:32 - impossible
14:33 - for authorized users to gain access to
14:35 - that system
14:36 - and that system would have zero
14:38 - availability
14:40 - the opposite extreme one can easily
14:43 - configure a server
14:44 - to provide high availability by simply
14:46 - allowing that server to let anyone who
14:48 - wants to use it
14:49 - access it and possibly change
14:51 - information on it
14:54 - however that high availability system
14:57 - will allow any information that saved on
14:59 - it to be easily accessed by anyone
15:02 - thereby compromising confidentiality
15:06 - and if the configuration of that system
15:08 - allows people to change the information
15:10 - on it easily
15:11 - that will compromise the integrity quite
15:13 - quickly so there are
15:15 - limitations to security and fundamental
15:17 - trade-offs
15:18 - that have to be considered between the
15:21 - principles in the cia triad
15:24 - so to summarize our main goal with
15:27 - security
15:28 - is to provide protection from harm and
15:32 - in the context of information systems
15:34 - we're really focused on the principles
15:36 - of the cia triad
15:38 - confidentiality integrity and
15:40 - availability
15:42 - fundamental trade-offs exist between
15:44 - security and functionality
15:46 - as well as between the principles of the
15:49 - cia triad
15:50 - there is no magic bullet to security and
15:53 - there
15:54 - is no simple product that we can simply
15:57 - buy
15:58 - to make a system immediately secure
16:01 - there are a number of trade-offs that
16:02 - have to be considered
16:03 - there are a number of things that have
16:04 - to be thought about in order to design a
16:07 - system
16:08 - that attempts to maximize the principles
16:10 - on the cia triad
16:11 - including the availability to authorized
16:13 - users

17:04 - i'm dr mike murphy i earned my phd in
17:07 - computer science from clemson university
17:09 - and i teach computer science and
17:11 - information systems at coastal carolina
17:13 - university
17:14 - located in conway south carolina
17:19 - in this lecture i'm going to discuss
17:21 - threats vulnerabilities
17:22 - and controls and how these things apply
17:25 - to computer security
17:29 - i'm going to begin by defining each of
17:30 - these terms threats vulnerabilities
17:33 - controls along with a silly example of
17:35 - each
17:36 - and then talk about some of the
17:37 - trade-offs involved in implementing
17:39 - controls
17:43 - recall from the introduction to security
17:46 - lecture the cia triad
17:48 - the stands for confidentiality integrity
17:51 - and availability these are the three
17:53 - principles to which we want
17:55 - a system to adhere in order for that
17:58 - system to be secure
18:02 - threats are possible dangers that could
18:06 - compromise the confidentiality
18:08 - integrity or availability of a computer
18:10 - system or service
18:12 - threats could be malicious in other
18:14 - words they could be intentional threats
18:16 - such as someone trying to hack into the
18:18 - system
18:19 - or someone trying to damage the system
18:21 - or they could be accidental threats such
18:23 - as a power outage
18:25 - or a natural disaster these threats may
18:28 - be external
18:29 - in other words this could be an attacker
18:32 - coming over the internet and trying to
18:33 - attack a server
18:35 - or these could be internal threats this
18:37 - could be an employee
18:39 - involved in fraudulent activities such
18:41 - as money laundering or
18:43 - or theft
18:46 - or embezzlement or some type of
18:50 - activity like that so we could have
18:52 - external threats we can have internal
18:53 - threats
18:54 - and those threats could be malicious or
18:56 - those threats could simply be accidental
19:00 - in identifying a threat we want to ask
19:03 - ourselves how a system could be
19:04 - compromised
19:05 - in other words what are ways that the
19:07 - confidentiality
19:08 - integrity and or availability of the
19:10 - system could be reduced
19:12 - what are forces that can come and
19:15 - potentially damage these things
19:19 - remember that not all the threats are
19:20 - necessarily malicious
19:22 - and not all the threats are necessarily
19:23 - external it's possible to have an
19:26 - internal threat this could be a
19:28 - malicious internal threat such as
19:30 - a corrupt employee or it could be an
19:33 - accidental internal threat such as a
19:35 - problem with a circuit breaker in the
19:37 - building
19:38 - there's all kinds of different types of
19:40 - threats that have to be considered
19:41 - and not all of them are necessarily
19:45 - malicious
19:46 - not all of them are necessarily outside
19:48 - the company
19:49 - or outside the organization
19:53 - so i've come up with a really silly
19:55 - example and this is an
19:56 - incredibly silly example but
20:00 - it allows us to illustrate some of the
20:02 - issues at hand
20:03 - without having to worry about technical
20:05 - details
20:07 - so in this silly example i have a small
20:09 - object specifically a pen
20:12 - and my cat has this tendency of taking
20:15 - small objects like pens
20:17 - and kicking them off tables and turning
20:19 - them into toys and sometimes kicking
20:21 - them on the refrigerator
20:23 - or under the stove
20:26 - and when he does this of course with a
20:29 - small object
20:30 - i have to go and find the object in
20:32 - order to restore its availability to me
20:36 - it's also possible for the cat to chew
20:38 - on on objects like pens and so forth he
20:40 - doesn't really do that so much
20:42 - he does like to chew on paper though so
20:46 - we have a pen the cat can threaten the
20:49 - pen
20:50 - and the outcome of that threat could be
20:53 - denying the availability of the pen
20:56 - because it's been kicked up under the
20:57 - refrigerator
21:00 - so here we have the cat threatening the
21:02 - pen
21:04 - uh actually i think he was more
21:06 - interested in napping at this
21:07 - at this point but with a cat we have a
21:10 - pen
21:11 - there's our potential threat
21:14 - now the difference between a threat and
21:16 - vulnerability
21:18 - is that vulnerabilities are weaknesses
21:21 - in a system that permit a threat to be
21:22 - realized
21:24 - compromising the confidential integrity
21:26 - and or availability of the system so the
21:30 - threat
21:30 - is the potential harm that could come to
21:32 - the system or the potential force
21:34 - that could affect the system the
21:36 - vulnerability is the weakness in the
21:38 - system that allows that
21:39 - threat to get in and materialize
21:43 - a critical vulnerability is a flaw that
21:45 - can be exploited by an attacker with the
21:48 - correct tools
21:49 - or by the correct situation in other
21:51 - words this is a vulnerability that we
21:53 - know
21:53 - exists in the system we know there are
21:55 - tools to exploit the vulnerability
21:58 - and we know that all it takes is someone
21:59 - accessing that particular vulnerability
22:02 - with those particular tools
22:04 - to launch a successful attack
22:09 - so when we look to identify
22:10 - vulnerabilities we've identified threats
22:15 - what we need to do is we need to decide
22:17 - how those threats can potentially affect
22:19 - the system
22:20 - in other words what weaknesses are
22:22 - present in the system
22:24 - that enable that threat to materialize
22:26 - into some kind of dysfunction
22:28 - into some kind of theft of information
22:30 - into some kind of damage to the system
22:33 - or into some kind of denial of service
22:34 - situation some type of availability
22:36 - removal or reduction
22:40 - a subtle difference between
22:41 - vulnerabilities and threats okay threats
22:43 - give us
22:46 - sort of big picture things that could
22:49 - come
22:49 - in and potentially damage the system the
22:52 - vulnerability is an
22:54 - avenue that those threats can take
22:57 - in order to actually damage the system
23:00 - so subtle difference they are related
23:04 - but basically a vulnerability allows a
23:06 - threat to materialize
23:09 - so in our silly example perhaps this
23:11 - will make it a little bit clearer
23:14 - why is the cat able to threaten the pen
23:16 - okay we have the cat who wants to grab
23:18 - the pen take it kick it under the
23:19 - refrigerator
23:20 - that's the thread what makes the pen
23:23 - vulnerable to that thread well it's
23:26 - actually the pen's characteristics it's
23:28 - a small
23:29 - object it is a small and light object
23:32 - and the cat is much bigger than the pen
23:35 - the cat has the strength to move the pen
23:38 - the pen is about the right size and
23:40 - shape to be batted around with the paw
23:42 - and so the light weight of the pen
23:45 - allows the cat to manipulate it easily
23:48 - if the cat is able to reach the pen grab
23:51 - the pen
23:52 - kick it off a table and start batting it
23:54 - around the floor
23:56 - then that becomes a critical
23:57 - vulnerability because the pen is just
23:59 - sitting there
24:00 - it's readily accessible the cat can take
24:02 - it and
24:03 - turn it into a toy
24:06 - so you can see here we have the pen
24:10 - and the pen is not very large not very
24:13 - heavy
24:14 - compared to the cat and so it's actually
24:17 - the small
24:18 - size of this object relative to the cat
24:20 - that enables the cat to threaten it
24:26 - okay so if we have these threats and we
24:29 - have vulnerabilities
24:30 - to potential threats what measures can
24:33 - we take what steps can we take
24:36 - to try to mitigate those threats to try
24:38 - to close those vulnerabilities
24:41 - and the answer is we have what are
24:43 - called controls or security controls
24:45 - and these are safeguards that are
24:47 - implemented to close vulnerabilities and
24:49 - mitigate threats
24:50 - in order to protect the confidentiality
24:53 - integrity and availability of the system
24:56 - so controls can be physical they can be
24:58 - procedural they can be technical
25:00 - a very simple control that you're
25:02 - probably
25:04 - using on a regular basis is simply
25:06 - locking a door
25:08 - locking the door to your house your
25:09 - apartment locking the door to your car
25:12 - that's a very simple physical control it
25:14 - denies access to someone simply opening
25:17 - the door
25:18 - and using very little effort to gain
25:21 - access
25:22 - we can also have procedural controls for
25:25 - example
25:26 - for example when handling money it is
25:29 - possible to have a procedure that says
25:31 - that two employees
25:33 - have to be present this way one employee
25:36 - has a harder time
25:37 - simply skimming some money out of the
25:39 - drawer skimming some money out of the
25:41 - safe
25:43 - in the security of information field
25:47 - or in computer security these controls
25:50 - can be technical
25:52 - we can have system policies in place
25:54 - that prevent certain actions
25:56 - we can require data to be encrypted so
25:59 - we have
25:59 - these different controls that we can
26:01 - implement
26:02 - in order to try to protect the system
26:08 - in order to identify controls
26:11 - we need to ask ourselves what kind of
26:14 - vulnerabilities there are
26:15 - to the types of threats that we've
26:17 - determined exist
26:19 - and how can those vulnerabilities be
26:21 - closed or how can we mitigate the
26:23 - threats
26:24 - what safeguards can we put in place to
26:26 - make the system less vulnerable to
26:28 - specific threat
26:29 - what types of protective measures can we
26:31 - take
26:34 - so let's take our silly example again
26:37 - there are a couple of ways
26:39 - that we could make the pen less
26:41 - vulnerable to the cat
26:44 - one way is that we could increase the
26:46 - size or weight of the pen so that the
26:48 - cat couldn't move it
26:49 - so we could make the pen four feet long
26:51 - and weigh 20 pounds
26:53 - and then the cat is not going to be able
26:55 - to move the pen that would be a way of
26:56 - directly closing the vulnerability
27:00 - unfortunately that choice would have
27:02 - some side effects it would be fairly
27:03 - difficult to write with a twenty pound
27:06 - four foot long pen we could secure the
27:09 - pen
27:10 - where the cat couldn't reach it so we
27:11 - could close the vulnerability by
27:13 - preventing its exploitation
27:16 - this is a fairly simple approach and
27:18 - it's one i'll talk about a little bit
27:20 - more in
27:20 - in a moment and it has certain benefits
27:24 - as long as it's implemented correctly
27:28 - another solution would be to

i'm dr mike murphy i earned my phd in computer science from clemson university and i teach computer science and information systems at coastal carolina university located in conway south carolina in this lecture i'm going to introduce basic security principles and begin discussing information system security i'm going to begin by defining what we mean by security discuss how security from the physical world evolved into the information world talk about something called the cia triad which establishes the principles of information security that we typically use for evaluating systems and then talk about some of the fundamental limitations and tradeoffs between both security and functionality and between principles in the cia triad so what do we mean by security this is something of a challenging question because we all have an intuitive concept of what it means to be secure but it's sometimes difficult to formalize this concept into something that we can study and something that we can evaluate for example we feel secure locked inside our own houses or perhaps locked inside our own vehicles but what exactly are we protecting ourselves against what exactly makes us secure versus not secure we look back through history we can see many examples of mankind's quest to build secure environments in which to live in which to work or to guard assets to guard entries into areas and so forth in this photograph for example we can see out here the island fort known as fort sumter which guarded the entrance to charleston harbor in south carolina and provided a secure barrier equipped with cannons to attempt to deter enemy ships from sailing into the harbor now this photograph was taken from fort moultrie which sits at the sites of one of the earliest forts securing charleston harbor and fort moultrie went through several renovations including an early to mid 20th century renovation where it was equipped with more modern weaponry again to guard the harbor against unauthorized shipping that might enter or invasion from a foreign force so a simple definition of security is protection protection from harm this basic idea is as old as society itself the idea of being protected from an attack the idea that we can have some kind of resistance to theft malicious injury and other harms that might befall us in the most basic form we're discussing physical security keeping out those who would do us harm and for many thousands of years physical security was the only concern that we really had we didn't have information processing systems to worry about so physical security really focuses on protection of assets or people from intruders or other types of malicious entities that might attempt to gain access now we can also extend this definition a little bit to say protection from the elements protection from natural forces wind or rain or flooding but for simplicity we're going to focus for the moment on intruders and the focus physical security is typically about building walls about excluding access to different resources or different areas by unauthorized parties here for example is a wall on fort moultrie on sullivan's island and this wall is designed for several purposes one of which is that if someone is invading by land it would be difficult to scale this wall it would provide a means to slow down an invader and thereby have an atta have a chance to launch a counter attack now this wall also directly faces the ocean and can be used as a bit of a sea wall during storms and hurricanes but the principle is the same we're trying to keep out unauthorized parties whether those be other people or water so that makes sense we have physical security protecting ourselves from harm what about information systems what happens when we take a bunch of computer systems bunch of information processing systems databases different servers business applications what happens when we have these types of applications we do have a physical security component in the sense that we don't want someone breaking in and stealing the physical server but we also have some additional issues because the path to be able to get into a server is not purely a physical one there's also an electronic information driven pathway usually the internet or system connected to a network that would enable someone to have access to a server for example and in many cases we want to provide access to these resources remotely to users we want to restrict that access to legitimate users so we need to extend our definition of protection from harm in order to apply to these different information systems and we typically think about three main categories of harm that could befall an information system the first of these is theft of information a lot of information processing systems contain personal information corporate secrets and other types of data that we don't want unauthorized people having access to if this information is stolen for example it could be used to launch identity theft or to have insights into a company's next product and possibly even steal a company's idea before they have a chance to develop that product we're also concerned about alteration of information this could be as simple as someone breaking in and defacing a website or it could be as complex as someone going in altering database records to cover up fraud or other types of financial crimes we also concern ourselves with denial of service or dos this is when systems are attacked in such a way that they are busy responding to the attackers and they in fact become so busy responding to the attackers that they can no longer provide service to their legitimate users so secure systems must guard against these problems they must ensure that confidential data remain confidential that the data are not changed by unauthorized users or changed by authorized users acting in malicious ways with malicious intent such as someone inside the company trying to steal information or trying to commit fraud and the systems must remain operational reachable and functional or collectively we say available for legitimate users so availability we're concerned about the system being up and running being accessible and functioning correctly for the users who are authorized to use that system these three principles form what's called the cia triad in security and that stands for confidentiality integrity and availability in an information system we are especially concerned with these three things we're concerned with ensuring the confidentiality of the system where the data on that system the integrity of the data and the system itself as well as the availability of that system to legitimate users we don't mind denying availability to illegitimate users we want to maintain availability for legitimate users so confidentiality let's start with the first principle in the cia triad this is the principle of protecting data from unauthorized access or disclosure as i mentioned before there are some types of data that are used in business that are used in industry that are used in government that are sensitive social security numbers for example can be used to facilitate identity theft medical records are considered to be confidential in order to protect a person's privacy in terms of the types of illnesses they've had to deal with the types of medical histories that they have corporate secrets so secrets about upcoming products products under development pricing models things such as even the margins or the amount of profit that a company makes on a particular product we also have military intelligence what kind of information has the military gathered we might want to keep that information secret in order to protect operatives in the field as well as to avoid embarrassment or tipping off an enemy that we might know some information about them there are some attackers who focus on trying to steal sensitive information folks involved with identity theft for example whether it be persons committing identity theft or reselling information to other people who commit identity theft are an issue in addition some folks will try to steal sensitive corporate information and sell that to other companies that are attempting to gain an advantage over the victim corporation the second principle of the cia triad integrity is the principle of ensuring that unauthorized or undetected changes to data or system configurations do not occur there are types of attacks that attempt to alter records or falsify information often in furtherance of other criminal activities such as fraud other attacks however attempt to take over servers entirely they might deface a content such as websites send unsolicited messages turn a server into a machine that's simply sending spam to everyone or distribute illegal content such as child pornography or copyrighted materials many other types of malicious uses can also be found for compromised systems and the third principle of the cia triad is that of availability and this is the principle of ensuring that systems stay online and the data and services provided by those systems remain accessible to authorized users some attackers attempt to disable corporate government or other systems in a bid to try to disrupt the operations of that entity this type of attack known as a denial of service attack is relatively common and occurs most often when servers are flooded with requests that prevent legitimate users from being served now we have these principles of the cia triad but it's important to understand that there are also some fundamental limitations that go along with our security principles for example one of the most fundamental if not the most fundamental tradeoff exists between security and functionality and this tradeoff works as follows if i implement a system that's extremely secure that has a very strict security policy it may not be truly available to legitimate users for example i could define a corporate security policy that says certain types of business information simply cannot be stored electronically they have to be stored in paper form or similarly that certain types of information can be stored electronically but cannot be stored in a database that can be queried by people in the company well if that information is central to the operation of the business the inability of employees to radically readily access that information could be detrimental to the business itself the opposite extreme if i have a highly functional system that pays no attention to security there's a high chance that that system will be compromised sooner or later and that could potentially have serious ramifications to the company both in terms of lost profits and in terms of liability and the potential of facing lawsuits which could a smaller company similarly there are tradeoffs between the principles in the cia triat if one designs a system and focuses on only one of the principles in the cia triad that system may not conform very well to the other principles in the cia triad for example a great way to secure a database system in terms of confidentiality is to unplug that system and store it in a vault somewhere in a bank where it can be physically secured it would be very difficult for someone to break in and steal information off that system unfortunately however it would also be impossible for authorized users to gain access to that system and that system would have zero availability the opposite extreme one can easily configure a server to provide high availability by simply allowing that server to let anyone who wants to use it access it and possibly change information on it however that high availability system will allow any information that saved on it to be easily accessed by anyone thereby compromising confidentiality and if the configuration of that system allows people to change the information on it easily that will compromise the integrity quite quickly so there are limitations to security and fundamental tradeoffs that have to be considered between the principles in the cia triad so to summarize our main goal with security is to provide protection from harm and in the context of information systems we're really focused on the principles of the cia triad confidentiality integrity and availability fundamental tradeoffs exist between security and functionality as well as between the principles of the cia triad there is no magic bullet to security and there is no simple product that we can simply buy to make a system immediately secure there are a number of tradeoffs that have to be considered there are a number of things that have to be thought about in order to design a system that attempts to maximize the principles on the cia triad including the availability to authorized users thank you for

computer science and information systems at coastal carolina university located in conway south carolina in this lecture i'm going to discuss threats vulnerabilities and controls and how these things apply to computer security i'm going to begin by defining each of these terms threats vulnerabilities controls along with a silly example of each and then talk about some of the tradeoffs involved in implementing controls recall from the introduction to security lecture the cia triad the stands for confidentiality integrity and availability these are the three principles to which we want a system to adhere in order for that system to be secure threats are possible dangers that could compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of a computer system or service threats could be malicious in other words they could be intentional threats such as someone trying to hack into the system or someone trying to damage the system or they could be accidental threats such as a power outage or a natural disaster these threats may be external in other words this could be an attacker coming over the internet and trying to attack a server or these could be internal threats this could be an employee involved in fraudulent activities such as money laundering or or theft or embezzlement or some type of activity like that so we could have external threats we can have internal threats and those threats could be malicious or those threats could simply be accidental in identifying a threat we want to ask ourselves how a system could be compromised in other words what are ways that the confidentiality integrity and or availability of the system could be reduced what are forces that can come and potentially damage these things remember that not all the threats are necessarily malicious and not all the threats are necessarily external it's possible to have an internal threat this could be a malicious internal threat such as a corrupt employee or it could be an accidental internal threat such as a problem with a circuit breaker in the building there's all kinds of different types of threats that have to be considered and not all of them are necessarily malicious not all of them are necessarily outside the company or outside the organization so i've come up with a really silly example and this is an incredibly silly example but it allows us to illustrate some of the issues at hand without having to worry about technical details so in this silly example i have a small object specifically a pen and my cat has this tendency of taking small objects like pens and kicking them off tables and turning them into toys and sometimes kicking them on the refrigerator or under the stove and when he does this of course with a small object i have to go and find the object in order to restore its availability to me it's also possible for the cat to chew on on objects like pens and so forth he doesn't really do that so much he does like to chew on paper though so we have a pen the cat can threaten the pen and the outcome of that threat could be denying the availability of the pen because it's been kicked up under the refrigerator so here we have the cat threatening the pen uh actually i think he was more interested in napping at this at this point but with a cat we have a pen there's our potential threat now the difference between a threat and vulnerability is that vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system that permit a threat to be realized compromising the confidential integrity and or availability of the system so the threat is the potential harm that could come to the system or the potential force that could affect the system the vulnerability is the weakness in the system that allows that threat to get in and materialize a critical vulnerability is a flaw that can be exploited by an attacker with the correct tools or by the correct situation in other words this is a vulnerability that we know exists in the system we know there are tools to exploit the vulnerability and we know that all it takes is someone accessing that particular vulnerability with those particular tools to launch a successful attack so when we look to identify vulnerabilities we've identified threats what we need to do is we need to decide how those threats can potentially affect the system in other words what weaknesses are present in the system that enable that threat to materialize into some kind of dysfunction into some kind of theft of information into some kind of damage to the system or into some kind of denial of service situation some type of availability removal or reduction a subtle difference between vulnerabilities and threats okay threats give us sort of big picture things that could come in and potentially damage the system the vulnerability is an avenue that those threats can take in order to actually damage the system so subtle difference they are related but basically a vulnerability allows a threat to materialize so in our silly example perhaps this will make it a little bit clearer why is the cat able to threaten the pen okay we have the cat who wants to grab the pen take it kick it under the refrigerator that's the thread what makes the pen vulnerable to that thread well it's actually the pen's characteristics it's a small object it is a small and light object and the cat is much bigger than the pen the cat has the strength to move the pen the pen is about the right size and shape to be batted around with the paw and so the light weight of the pen allows the cat to manipulate it easily if the cat is able to reach the pen grab the pen kick it off a table and start batting it around the floor then that becomes a critical vulnerability because the pen is just sitting there it's readily accessible the cat can take it and turn it into a toy so you can see here we have the pen and the pen is not very large not very heavy compared to the cat and so it's actually the small size of this object relative to the cat that enables the cat to threaten it okay so if we have these threats and we have vulnerabilities to potential threats what measures can we take what steps can we take to try to mitigate those threats to try to close those vulnerabilities and the answer is we have what are called controls or security controls and these are safeguards that are implemented to close vulnerabilities and mitigate threats in order to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of the system so controls can be physical they can be procedural they can be technical a very simple control that you're probably using on a regular basis is simply locking a door locking the door to your house your apartment locking the door to your car that's a very simple physical control it denies access to someone simply opening the door and using very little effort to gain access we can also have procedural controls for example for example when handling money it is possible to have a procedure that says that two employees have to be present this way one employee has a harder time simply skimming some money out of the drawer skimming some money out of the safe in the security of information field or in computer security these controls can be technical we can have system policies in place that prevent certain actions we can require data to be encrypted so we have these different controls that we can implement in order to try to protect the system in order to identify controls we need to ask ourselves what kind of vulnerabilities there are to the types of threats that we've determined exist and how can those vulnerabilities be closed or how can we mitigate the threats what safeguards can we put in place to make the system less vulnerable to specific threat what types of protective measures can we take so let's take our silly example again there are a couple of ways that we could make the pen less vulnerable to the cat one way is that we could increase the size or weight of the pen so that the cat couldn't move it so we could make the pen four feet long and weigh 20 pounds and then the cat is not going to be able to move the pen that would be a way of directly closing the vulnerability unfortunately that choice would have some side effects it would be fairly difficult to write with a twenty pound four foot long pen we could secure the pen where the cat couldn't reach it so we could close the vulnerability by preventing its exploitation this is a fairly simple approach and it's one i'll talk about a little bit more in in a moment
