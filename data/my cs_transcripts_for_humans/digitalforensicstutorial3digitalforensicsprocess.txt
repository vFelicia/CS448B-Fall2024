00:08 - consists of three main stages
00:11 - the first proactive step in any digital
00:13 - forensic investigation is that of
00:15 - acquisition
00:16 - the inherent problem with digital media
00:18 - is that it is readily modified
00:20 - even just by accessing files for this
00:23 - reason analysts obtain a big copy of the
00:26 - media using specialist tools which stop
00:28 - modification occurring
00:30 - working from a copy is one of the
00:32 - fundamental steps to making a forensic
00:34 - investigation audit able and acceptable
00:36 - to a court
00:38 - another fundamental part of the process
00:40 - is the ability to verify the accuracy of
00:42 - the evidence produced
00:43 - acquisition and verification are key
00:45 - concepts in preparing digital media for
00:48 - investigation
00:50 - prior to the availability of very large
00:52 - storage capacity the acquisition process
00:54 - usually consisted of creating a bit
00:56 - perfect copy of the digital media
00:58 - evidence
01:00 - this is usually conducted with the media
01:02 - connected to a right blocking device
01:03 - which stops it from being modified
01:05 - during the process
01:07 - after being acquired the physical media
01:09 - is placed in secure storage the forensic
01:11 - analyst conducts the forensic
01:13 - investigation on the copy
01:15 - the aim of working on a copy of the
01:17 - evidence is to leave the original media
01:19 - intact
01:20 - which allows for any evidence to be
01:21 - verified proven accurate at a later date
01:26 - write blockers can take two forms
01:28 - hardware or software
01:30 - you can see a picture of a hardware
01:31 - right blocker to the right
01:33 - the hardware devices are more reliable
01:36 - stopping all right commands from
01:37 - reaching the digital media
01:40 - software writer blockers are less
01:41 - reliable and tend to be proprietary
01:45 - acquired media is usually refereed to as
01:47 - an image
01:48 - they are stored in a number of open and
01:49 - proprietary formats
01:52 - the popular in case software employs a
01:54 - proprietary
01:55 - compressible in case evidence file
01:57 - format eeff
01:59 - other open formats such as raw i.e a
02:02 - simple bit copy
02:03 - are used by programs such as ftk imager
02:07 - during acquisition forensic tools create
02:09 - a verification hash of the media
02:11 - this allows an analyst to later confirm
02:13 - that the image and its contents are
02:15 - accurate
02:16 - see verification below for example
02:19 - the in case evidence file format stores
02:22 - a hash for every 64 k of data along with
02:24 - an appended md5 hash of the entire media
02:29 - the second stage of digital forensics is
02:31 - analysis
02:32 - analysis of digital media requires an
02:35 - instinct for rooting out evidence and
02:36 - the use of your intuition to connect the
02:38 - dots
02:40 - in the field of digital forensics
02:41 - analysis can take two forms
02:44 - evidence recovery where the analyst
02:46 - identifies information relevant to the
02:47 - investigation and presents it in a
02:49 - neutral
02:50 - form expert analysis
02:53 - following on from evidence recovery the
02:55 - analyst draws expert conclusions from
02:57 - the information
02:58 - perhaps constructing a timeline of
03:00 - events or connects various pieces of
03:02 - evidence together
03:04 - expert analysis can vary wildly from
03:06 - simple factual conclusions to a more
03:08 - speculative assessment of what recovered
03:10 - evidence represents
03:12 - in criminal cases the latter is
03:14 - generally avoided at the analyst level
03:17 - by comparison in civil corporate
03:19 - investigation the latter is more common
03:21 - this is due to the fact that managers
03:23 - often do not have the technical
03:24 - understanding to draw conclusions that
03:26 - law enforcement personnel might have
03:29 - when conducting an investigation it is
03:31 - important to remember who will be
03:32 - receiving the evidence you collect and
03:34 - performing an analysis that meets their
03:36 - requirements and needs
03:39 - reporting is a key final phase to any
03:41 - investigation
03:42 - a skilled investigator aims to balance
03:44 - the technical facts against their own

03:47 - whilst presenting it in layman terms
