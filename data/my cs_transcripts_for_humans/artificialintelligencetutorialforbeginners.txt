00:00 - hey I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk
00:01 - about artificial intelligence did you
00:04 - know that there are seven senses in our
00:06 - bodies not five the first five you
00:09 - probably already know your sight your
00:11 - hearing your sense of smell your sense
00:14 - of taste and touch and the other two you
00:17 - might be come as a surprise to you they
00:19 - are both proprioception which is how you
00:22 - know where your body is in space and
00:24 - your vestibular system which is your
00:26 - sense of balance and those seven things
00:28 - together make up how you perceive the
00:30 - world now computers in order to do the
00:32 - work that they do also need to perceive
00:35 - the world and they use those same seven
00:37 - senses so vision for example you may be
00:39 - able to take a picture or a video and
00:41 - that would be a perception of a computer
00:44 - but it might also be a picture of using
00:47 - a telescope or using a microscope to see
00:49 - something that our eyes would never be
00:51 - able to perceive without the help of
00:53 - technology it might also see wavelengths
00:55 - of light that we can't see such as
00:57 - ultraviolet light that other animals can
01:00 - perceive humans have a sense of smell
01:01 - that we use to sense a motion and to
01:04 - know what's happening around us so for
01:05 - example if you walk home and you walk in
01:08 - the door and you smell cookies you
01:10 - probably feel really good if you walk in
01:12 - and you smell fire you might feel
01:14 - worried a computer can also smell it can
01:17 - have a fire detector that's connected to
01:20 - the fire department so before you even
01:22 - get home the fire department has already
01:24 - come that computer system can detect the
01:26 - chemical signature of fire and keep you
01:29 - safe you may have gone through an
01:30 - airport and if you bring food through
01:32 - that airport they need to test it and
01:34 - see that the chemicals are the things
01:35 - that they should find in food and not
01:37 - something that's illegal for an airplane
01:38 - so they'll bring out a little pad and
01:40 - they'll rub it on the food and that is
01:42 - the way a computer might taste so
01:44 - another sense we have is touch and for
01:46 - us it seems very natural we can pick up
01:48 - a pen we can pick up a phone we can pick
01:50 - up a heavy brick and we know exactly how
01:53 - much force we need in order to pick up
01:55 - each one of those objects one of the
01:57 - challenges that computers and robotics
01:59 - have is knowing how much force it takes
02:01 - to pick up a single object so when you
02:03 - have when you see that six-month-old
02:04 - picking up Cheerios they're learning how
02:06 - not only to move their
02:08 - in that way but how much force it takes
02:10 - so that you can get the cheerio and grab
02:12 - it for it with just enough force that
02:14 - you don't crush it so robotics are still
02:17 - learning some of those systems of touch
02:19 - a computer can hear things both at a
02:22 - higher and lower range than than we can
02:24 - hear and it can hear at a faster or
02:28 - slower rate so some sounds computer can
02:31 - perceive and analyze and we have to see
02:33 - it on a graph because it's just too fast
02:36 - for our ears to hear that vestibular
02:38 - system that sense of balance that's a
02:39 - challenge for computers right now that
02:41 - they have to be able to orient
02:43 - themselves in space and you're probably
02:44 - thinking like a robot right like it's
02:47 - trying to walk and we know that
02:48 - computers don't really do that well yet
02:50 - those robotics yet but we have that
02:52 - sensor right here in our phones where we
02:54 - can play video games and that has that
02:56 - orientation in space and your GPS knows
02:59 - if you're going east or west or north or
03:01 - south and that's that's proprioception
03:03 - that's knowing where it is in space so
03:05 - we also have that with the vestibular
03:07 - system that sense of balance that's
03:09 - where robots really struggle is can they
03:11 - walk up the stairs that's a challenge
03:13 - for a robot because it requires a lot of
03:15 - different sensors and motors to work
03:17 - together very finely together where the
03:20 - timing has to work out just right where
03:22 - it can adapt and we're really good at
03:24 - adapting computers aren't as good at
03:26 - adapting what they are good at is
03:27 - finding patterns so when you have this
03:29 - whole these seven senses and they all
03:31 - come together we can put computer
03:33 - processing behind it and we can do
03:35 - amazing things
03:36 - [Music]
03:47 - hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk
03:49 - about artificial intelligence last time
03:51 - we talked about sensors and perception
03:53 - both for computers and for humans but
03:56 - what happens with that data once it
03:58 - comes through a sensor determines
03:59 - whether or not it's processed with a
04:01 - traditional computer or with an
04:03 - artificial intelligence system let me
04:05 - give you an example imagine that you're
04:07 - planning a birthday party at a roller
04:08 - rink and you want to spend $200 to rent
04:12 - out the rink and they also charge six
04:14 - dollars and fifty cents per person that
04:16 - comes to the rink you could put that in
04:17 - as $200 plus six dollars and fifty cents
04:21 - times the number of people or six 50p
04:25 - that's traditional computing where we
04:28 - have a function and we run some numbers
04:29 - through it and we get an output the
04:31 - amount that you're going to pay for the
04:32 - birthday party in artificial
04:34 - intelligence we do it a little bit
04:35 - differently we start with the input and
04:38 - we have the output and we don't figure
04:40 - out the middle the computer figures out
04:43 - how to get from the input to the output
04:46 - how it gets that is by successive
04:48 - approximation that means it gets closer
04:50 - and closer every time it'll try to come
04:52 - up with some numbers that make those
04:54 - variables work out to calculate what the
04:58 - rate will be over time so if you're an
05:00 - AI system you get the input of four
05:02 - people and the cost is two hundred and
05:04 - twenty six dollars ten people two
05:06 - hundred and sixty-five 14 people two
05:08 - hundred and ninety-one
05:09 - twenty people three hundred and thirty
05:11 - so in traditional computing we give the
05:13 - computer a math problem and it plugs in
05:16 - the numbers and gives us an output in
05:17 - artificially intelligent programs we
05:20 - have an input and we have an output we
05:22 - have a lot of pairs of data that those
05:24 - values and it uses its own math to
05:27 - determine how the pattern should evolve
05:29 - here's another example we've we are
05:32 - shopping for our party and we're going
05:34 - to the grocery store as you walk in the
05:36 - door the door opens mmm and as you walk
05:39 - through it closes again you now that is
05:42 - a sensor it knows that you're there it
05:44 - opened for you but it doesn't know that
05:46 - you are you if you walk through that
05:48 - same door and the door opens and it says
05:51 - hello Charlotte and as you're checking
05:53 - out you scan that card so that you get
05:55 - your coupons
05:56 - well that data is being used by the
05:57 - company that you're purchasing from
06:00 - so let's say you scan that card and
06:02 - immediately some coupons come out and
06:04 - therefore about the same thing that
06:05 - you're buying right now if you're buying
06:07 - a cake mix you're probably getting
06:08 - coupons for other brands of cake mixes
06:10 - if you're buying three pints of Ben and
06:12 - Jerry's you're probably getting a coupon
06:14 - for buying four or more and and that's
06:16 - not an artificially intelligent system
06:18 - necessarily that's just that input
06:20 - versus output comparing what happens is
06:23 - if it knows you're having a birthday
06:25 - party and you get coupons in the mail
06:26 - next week that offer presents that would
06:29 - be tailored to your family that's an
06:31 - artificial intelligence system well how
06:32 - does it do that
06:33 - well it does it with a lot a lot a lot
06:37 - of data so if you walk through the door
06:40 - that's a sensor not a I if you get
06:43 - personalized information using lots of
06:45 - data that's a neural network hi I'm
06:59 - Charlotte and I'm here to talk about
07:00 - artificial intelligence did you know
07:03 - there are five big ideas and AI they are
07:05 - perception representation and reasoning
07:07 - learning from data natural interaction
07:10 - and societal impact number one is
07:13 - perception
07:14 - perception is when a computer uses
07:16 - sensors to gather data and then extracts
07:18 - meaning from those signals number two
07:21 - representation and reasoning
07:23 - representation is when a computer builds
07:25 - its own world so that it can understand
07:28 - just like a Google map that's an example
07:30 - of a representation of how the computer
07:32 - perceives the world then it can apply
07:34 - reasoning to that representation for
07:37 - example to take you on the correct bike
07:39 - path or to route you via uber number
07:42 - three learning from data computers use a
07:45 - lot of data to do the processing that
07:47 - allows them to think artificially that's
07:50 - artificial intelligence almost all AI
07:52 - systems are made from a lot a lot of
07:56 - data number four natural interaction
07:59 - natural interaction is when we've
08:00 - trained an AI system to interact
08:02 - naturally with the people around it that
08:04 - means that you can trust Google
08:06 - Translate to say the words that you're
08:09 - saying in another language or perhaps
08:11 - you use facial recognition and you trust
08:13 - that that's
08:14 - we'll only let the correct people into
08:15 - the building number five societal impact
08:18 - ai affects our world in positive and
08:21 - negative ways
08:22 - ai makes it so that no one in the world
08:24 - starves but we also have to make sure to
08:26 - guard against implicit bias and make
08:29 - sure that the computer algorithms that
08:30 - we write are fair for everyone so these
08:33 - are the five big ideas in AI perception
08:36 - representation and reasoning learning
08:37 - from data natural interaction and
08:39 - societal impact watch more videos to
08:42 - learn more in depth about each of these
08:43 - ideas hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to
08:56 - talk about artificial intelligence have
08:58 - you heard of recommender systems
08:59 - recommender systems are AI computer
09:02 - algorithms that track your habits your
09:04 - likes and dislikes your beliefs how much
09:06 - money you have and where you are at any
09:08 - given time these recommender systems
09:10 - help you to choose music and video that
09:12 - you would enjoy based on the things
09:14 - you've watched in the past or people
09:15 - like you have watched in the past the
09:18 - ads that you see on the internet in
09:20 - social media and on apps if you've ever
09:22 - had that feeling like you thought about
09:23 - it and it appeared it's probably because
09:25 - people like you have enjoyed those same
09:27 - types of things or maybe you've clicked
09:29 - on an email link and now it's
09:31 - recommending things that you would like
09:32 - recommender systems provide coupons for
09:35 - you and they know which products you're
09:37 - likely to buy even if you've never
09:38 - purchased from that company before
09:40 - recommender systems are also used in
09:42 - sentencing and bail in the justice
09:44 - system so the judges know whether or not
09:47 - you're likely to reoffending companies
09:49 - use recommender systems to know whether
09:51 - or not you're a risk and your credit may
09:54 - be influenced by these recommender
09:55 - systems that are used by companies even
09:58 - elections and the news you see can be
10:00 - influenced by recommender systems which
10:02 - changes how people think about the world
10:04 - these recommender systems are built by
10:06 - data aggregators companies like Palantir
10:09 - data dog and first data who are spending
10:12 - billions of dollars and earning billions
10:15 - more to take these tiny bits of data
10:17 - about you every email you read every
10:20 - webpage you visit every social media app
10:22 - that you use your the location data from
10:25 - your phone when you watch or listen to
10:27 - any
10:28 - thing on your television these data
10:29 - aggregator companies bring all of that
10:31 - data together to build a very specific
10:33 - profile of people like you we need to
10:36 - ensure that these data aggregation
10:38 - companies reduce bias that they show
10:40 - appropriate content to adults and
10:42 - children and that everyone knows how to
10:45 - protect themselves we may have data that
10:47 - they don't want to share that's personal
10:49 - we need to make sure that data
10:50 - aggregation companies and recommender
10:52 - systems benefit all people hi I'm
11:05 - Charlotte and I work in artificial
11:07 - intelligence or AI AI is a computing
11:10 - tool that helps people use data to solve
11:12 - problems doctors use AI to find new
11:15 - medicines lives can be saved when planes
11:17 - trains and cars navigate themselves AI
11:20 - can be used to improve harvests for
11:22 - farmers or to protect the environment
11:23 - did you know we have satellites that
11:26 - monitor zebras from space reading their
11:29 - stripes like a barcode the uses of AI
11:31 - can go way beyond making awesome new
11:34 - movies and video games this kind of
11:36 - computer programming personalizes
11:37 - experiences for you like when your phone
11:40 - recommends a new song that you might
11:41 - enjoy based on what you've listened to
11:43 - before or predicts the next word you
11:45 - might want to use in a text snapchat
11:47 - filters are AI and it can be used to
11:49 - create learning experiences that work
11:51 - for every student it's all around us and
11:54 - AI is powerful when you see something
11:56 - wrong in the world you can use
11:58 - artificial intelligence as a tool to
12:00 - solve big problems in ways that
12:02 - individual people could never imagine
12:04 - like giving the internet to people in
12:06 - places where there aren't even roads or
12:08 - making sure that elderly population
12:10 - isn't lonely with robot companions AI
12:13 - can even remove human bias from
12:15 - decisions so hiring for jobs is
12:17 - equitable and people are paid fairly for
12:19 - the work they do we need you to learn
12:22 - computer science and use artificial
12:24 - intelligence to create systems that make
12:26 - the world a better place plus it's
12:28 - really fun be a creator of technology
12:31 - not just a consumer whatever career
12:33 - you're interested in AI can help you do
12:36 - your job better and you can start
12:37 - learning today with a simple web search
12:45 - hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk
12:46 - about artificial intelligence last time
12:49 - we learned about recommender systems and
12:51 - data aggregators
12:52 - how do those systems work they work by
12:54 - AI sorting algorithms that help us to
12:56 - identify and match what we're looking
12:58 - for here's an example perhaps you want
13:01 - to listen to a podcast and you've
13:02 - listened to several before and the
13:04 - recommender system can recommend future
13:07 - podcasts that you might enjoy we can
13:08 - also use AI sorting algorithms for
13:10 - health diagnosis and facial recognition
13:12 - these AI sorting algorithms need to be
13:15 - both sensitive so we don't skip
13:17 - important data and specific so that you
13:20 - don't find things that aren't there so
13:22 - here's an example let's say that you
13:24 - want to search for Dalmatians these
13:26 - black and white dogs right a sensitive
13:28 - algorithm would find the dog on a white
13:30 - rug or find that small dog on a big fire
13:33 - truck and a specific algorithm doesn't
13:35 - find cows doesn't find children in a dog
13:38 - costume it doesn't find zebras it just
13:41 - finds Dalmatians you can have a system
13:44 - that has false negatives and false
13:45 - positives a false negative is when an
13:48 - item is defined as no match when it
13:50 - should be such as if a sick person is
13:53 - told they're okay a false positive is
13:56 - when an item is identified as a match
13:57 - and it is not such as if a healthy
14:00 - person is told they're sick both false
14:02 - negatives and false positives are bad
14:05 - for example if we treat someone who's
14:07 - not sick they may have pain and expense
14:10 - when they didn't need to if we don't
14:12 - treat someone who is sick then they may
14:15 - get sicker so it's important that we
14:17 - refine these AI sorting algorithms to
14:19 - balance between the sensitive and the
14:22 - specific to eliminate both false
14:24 - negatives and false positives and not
14:27 - everything is black and white
14:28 - usually we need results that are on a
14:30 - spectrum so even in medicine or labeling
14:34 - that podcast that we want to listen to
14:36 - we need a balance of the algorithm
14:39 - finding narrowing down what we need and
14:42 - a human deciding those final steps
14:44 - here's an example let's look at some
14:46 - pictures
14:47 - what is swimming is it these kids in the
14:50 - competition is it kids playing at the
14:53 - beach how about if they're riding on
14:55 - rafts how about these surfers
14:58 - what about water polo how about this
15:01 - fish which of these would you label is
15:03 - swimming we have to decide it might be a
15:05 - spectrum maybe we're looking for a
15:07 - certain type of swimming you can play
15:09 - with this crowd-sourced google comm then
15:12 - we can explore more about AI sorting
15:14 - algorithms and how they're used for
15:15 - identification hi I'm Charlotte and I'm
15:28 - here to talk about artificial
15:29 - intelligence did you know that one of
15:32 - the primary goals of AI systems is to
15:34 - interact naturally with people these are
15:37 - AI systems that learn human patterns of
15:39 - speech are gestures and are effects and
15:41 - then our program to respond
15:42 - appropriately natural interaction may be
15:45 - used to create interfaces that feel
15:46 - normal to us so that we feel comfortable
15:48 - using the technology or to process human
15:51 - movement and speech patterns that keep
15:52 - us safe
15:53 - there are three common areas of natural
15:56 - interaction the first is speech anything
15:58 - to do with talking
15:59 - the second is gestures hand and body
16:01 - movements and the third is FX tiny
16:04 - movements and inflections that cause us
16:06 - to feel something like how we believe an
16:08 - actor on the movie screen so the first
16:11 - area speech could be text-to-speech
16:13 - could be speech to text it could be do
16:16 - Google duplex making a phone call on
16:18 - your behalf or the person on the other
16:19 - end doesn't even know that a computer
16:21 - has called them it could be autocorrect
16:23 - when you were sending a text it could be
16:25 - Gmail that fills in your email and with
16:28 - the speech patterns that you've used in
16:29 - the past and it can be a screen reader
16:31 - where someone has sent you a document
16:33 - and it reads it out loud to you speech
16:36 - also includes translation but don't use
16:38 - it for your homework because the culture
16:40 - and the nuance is lost it's okay in a
16:42 - pinch though if you're trying to talk
16:44 - with someone in another language
16:45 - the second area of natural interaction
16:47 - is gesture recognition this is any way
16:50 - that you move your hands or your body to
16:53 - communicate the most popular least
16:55 - expensive technology that you may have
16:57 - encountered is the Xbox Kinect where
16:59 - you're dancing or playing a sport and
17:01 - your movement is recognized on this
17:04 - computer screen you can also see
17:06 - sometimes in movies where they resize a
17:08 - window something like that where you're
17:10 - just showing with your body
17:11 - not quite here yet but it's coming soon
17:14 - also these gesture recognition systems
17:17 - can recognize patterns in how people
17:19 - move their bodies to identify a
17:20 - shoplifter or to protect a crowd from
17:22 - someone who may be violent the third
17:25 - area of natural interaction is affective
17:27 - computing that's with an A and it's the
17:30 - study of how computers can process human
17:32 - emotions this is our tone of voice the
17:34 - tiny movements that we make to convey
17:36 - how we're feeling and our facial
17:38 - features that show that we're happy
17:39 - we're sad were angry were excited we
17:42 - often think of this in our mouths but
17:44 - you can see it in the eyes to look right
17:49 - you try it and we can use these gesture
17:52 - recognition systems with effective
17:55 - computing to tell if a driver is getting
17:57 - sleepy if they're texting if they've
17:58 - been drinking and that'll keep people
18:00 - safe on the roads natural interaction is
18:03 - an area of computer science research
18:04 - that makes AI systems accessible to
18:06 - everyone and it processes this the
18:09 - things that we do automatically like
18:10 - tone of voice and positioning of our
18:12 - bodies into a format that computers can
18:14 - understand then programmers can write
18:16 - systems they interact with us in a way
18:18 - that makes us comfortable and safe hi
18:31 - I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about
18:33 - artificial intelligence did you know
18:35 - that computer systems build
18:36 - representations of the world and then
18:39 - perform reasoning on them a
18:40 - representation is a way to describe a
18:42 - system using the relevant features think
18:45 - of a subway map we don't show the trees
18:47 - and the cross streets we only show where
18:49 - the subway can stop and we apply
18:51 - reasoning that to that by planning your
18:53 - route figuring out where you need to go
18:55 - to get from MIT to the Red Sox game red
18:58 - line to Green Line an AI system uses
19:01 - computer vision to construct your
19:03 - representation and then performs
19:05 - reasoning on that that our choices
19:06 - within that representation for example
19:09 - the Cosmo robot the robot has computer
19:12 - vision and can identify things like
19:13 - blocks it can identify you by name it
19:17 - can identify your dog or your cat and it
19:19 - knows where it is on the table then it
19:22 - can perform reasoning such as picking up
19:24 - a block
19:25 - saying your name or playing a game with
19:27 - you you can also have representations of
19:31 - things that don't see like the BOK BOTS
19:33 - or Google Doodle where you can play with
19:35 - music there are features in this music
19:38 - those features are things like the note
19:40 - duration the type of instrument that's
19:42 - playing the pitch of that and all of
19:44 - those things together make up a
19:46 - representation of the music you can
19:48 - think of that like sheet music and what
19:50 - comes next is the reasoning that we can
19:53 - apply so that we can make Bach like
19:56 - music following the same patterns that
19:58 - we identified in the features or let's
20:01 - say you want to create an application to
20:02 - help you find the perfect Girl Scout
20:04 - Troop for you we can identify features
20:06 - that would make that possible such as
20:08 - what grade level the girl is going to be
20:10 - the location of the troop meetings the
20:12 - times that work for your family and then
20:15 - we can actually say things like whether
20:17 - or not this troop often does stem
20:19 - activities or if they like outdoor
20:21 - adventures or service projects and then
20:23 - we can put weights to those so that we
20:25 - can say you know I want to weight
20:27 - outdoor adventurers higher than I want
20:30 - to rate service projects and I can find
20:32 - a troop that's just right for me you can
20:34 - try out representation and reasoning
20:36 - using Google's deep dream generator you
20:39 - can apply an artistic style to an image
20:41 - that you upload and see how the
20:44 - representation takes the features of
20:46 - that art and applies it to your image
20:48 - try it today it's fun it's practical
20:50 - it's cool
20:55 - [Music]
21:01 - hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk
21:03 - about artificial intelligence when you
21:05 - hear AI do you think killer robot that's
21:09 - an archetype it's like if I ask you to
21:12 - think of a word that starts with C do
21:14 - you think of cat that first leave of
21:16 - your brain often isn't true and it often
21:19 - hides things that we've grown up with
21:20 - like maybe you're not a racist but
21:23 - you've grown up in a system that has
21:24 - racism you might exhibit some behaviors
21:28 - that you have to overcome you have to
21:30 - dispel the myths that are the archetypes
21:32 - in your brain and AI is that way the
21:35 - killer robots are not what you think
21:37 - AI is not weaponized and the vast
21:39 - majority of AI is just algorithms with
21:42 - data in computers but we've grown up
21:44 - with stories like Robbie lost in space
21:47 - Hal 3000 the hound from Fahrenheit 451
21:50 - The Terminator The Matrix and Detroit
21:53 - become human depending on what
21:55 - generation you are in and we think that
21:57 - those are AI but our overlords are not
22:00 - coming there's no evidence that we have
22:03 - artificial general intelligence these
22:05 - computer systems are not making plans on
22:07 - their own there they don't have any
22:09 - autonomy they don't have emotion they're
22:11 - not alive they are only as good or as
22:13 - bad as the tasks it's human creators
22:17 - assigned to be accomplished but people
22:19 - are building autonomous lethal robotics
22:22 - on their own these are computer vision
22:24 - and navigation systems that can move
22:27 - independently and target selectively
22:29 - they do have the capacity to kill
22:31 - through onboard weapons so if you take a
22:34 - robot like Boston Dynamics spot or the
22:37 - parkour robot that you see here and you
22:40 - can see that it moves in some ways
22:41 - better or faster than than humans can it
22:45 - has a limitation its battery and some of
22:47 - the navigation is remote controlled but
22:50 - it can navigate difficult terrain it can
22:52 - jump it can go into dangerous areas and
22:54 - these robots are being designed to do
22:56 - good work for people like search and
22:58 - rescue dealing with landmines fighting
23:01 - fires working in dangerous construction
23:03 - sites or cleaning up nuclear waste but
23:07 - we also have soldiers in Arizona that
23:10 - are flying drones in the Middle East
23:11 - there are limiting
23:13 - targets remotely then they're going home
23:15 - to dinner some people say that
23:17 - autonomous lethal robotics will save
23:19 - soldiers lives we know that military
23:21 - technology moves into our local police
23:23 - forces so we need to ensure that
23:25 - autonomous lethal robotics are regulated
23:28 - through ethical political and
23:30 - legislative processes the most important
23:32 - thing is that you're informed the AI can
23:35 - be used in this way by people making
23:37 - decisions in 1980 we had blinding laser
23:40 - weapons they were banned from the
23:43 - battlefield across the world in 1997 we
23:46 - banned chemical weapons and even before
23:48 - that in 1928 we had the Geneva
23:50 - Convention so political action and
23:52 - treaties can work once you get the cat
23:54 - out of the bag like nuclear it's really
23:56 - hard to stuff it back in so what we need
23:58 - to do is share your awareness of
24:00 - autonomous lethal robotics write to your
24:02 - representatives and make some noise we
24:04 - can create common-sense legislative
24:06 - protections so that people aren't
24:08 - allowed to build and deploy systems that
24:10 - decide life and death on our behalf and
24:11 - we can use AI for positive change hi I'm
24:25 - Charlotte and I'm here to talk about
24:26 - artificial intelligence have you heard
24:28 - in the news about deep fakes it's where
24:30 - you very carefully place one person in a
24:33 - video with another person using
24:35 - artificial intelligence it is real but
24:38 - there's a lot of misconceptions about
24:39 - this technology first you take a
24:42 - person's face and you mark the points
24:44 - around their face like their chin the
24:46 - corners of their mouth or the corners of
24:48 - their eyes and then you can map those
24:49 - points to another person so that you can
24:52 - swap out one person for another you can
24:55 - see this on a technology like snapchat
24:57 - where you're adding maybe a goatee to
25:00 - someone's face or you're putting food on
25:02 - their head a funny example of seeing
25:04 - this technology in action in a deep fake
25:06 - is the video full house of moustaches
25:09 - check it out
25:10 - the big worry about the deep fake
25:12 - technology is that fake news could
25:15 - result in this you could have a
25:16 - politician saying something that they
25:18 - didn't really say and have that be
25:19 - broadcast but the reality is that so far
25:22 - this has only been used for comedy or to
25:25 - show that what the technology
25:26 - can do here are three things to reassure
25:28 - you the first is that politicians are
25:31 - very interested in creating legislation
25:33 - that protects them from deep fake
25:35 - technology they don't want to be seen
25:36 - saying something that they didn't
25:38 - actually say the second is that
25:40 - technology companies are identifying
25:42 - videos that are created with this
25:44 - technology and then can remove them
25:45 - automatically and the third is that
25:47 - people are thinking critically about
25:48 - these technologies and they are aware
25:50 - that they're happening probably because
25:52 - there's some funny content out there so
25:54 - stay vigilant have fun and be aware of
25:56 - deep fakes hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here
26:07 - to talk about artificial intelligence
26:08 - have you heard of word vectors how about
26:12 - natural language processing today we're
26:14 - going to talk about those ideas natural
26:16 - language processing is the way a
26:18 - computer understands what you say out
26:20 - loud in a regular voice it's part of
26:22 - natural interaction your phone is very
26:24 - good at understanding and translating
26:26 - what you say out loud to written
26:28 - communication even tricky homophones
26:30 - like poor not having enough money and
26:32 - poor like pouring your juice or telling
26:35 - a tale versus a mouse's tail you can try
26:38 - this on your phone or in translating and
26:40 - by speaking out loud and having a
26:42 - document right for you your phone does
26:44 - not understand the words that you're
26:46 - saying but it does know associations
26:49 - between words for example llama llama is
26:52 - very closely associated to alpaca it's
26:55 - also closely associated to farm it's
26:57 - also associated with clothing or stuffed
27:00 - animals it's not as associated with the
27:03 - word tire for example so llama can be
27:07 - related to a lot of different things
27:08 - that aren't just related to Farms but
27:10 - what we have to determine for natural
27:12 - language processing is how similar a
27:14 - word is in the text compared to other
27:17 - words that are found in text and if you
27:20 - search the whole internet you could make
27:21 - a lot of comparisons it used to be on
27:24 - the SAT that you'd be asked analogy
27:26 - questions like popcorn is to butter as
27:30 - fries are to what and you might say
27:33 - ketchup or mayonnaise but you probably
27:34 - wouldn't say Tiger right there are words
27:37 - that are more closely or less closely
27:39 - related to one another
27:40 - and we can rate the closeness of words
27:43 - using math you've done this too probably
27:45 - with a game called 20 questions but a
27:48 - computer asks about 300 questions and we
27:51 - can sort these words like llama into
27:53 - categories we can say it's an animal yes
27:56 - or no yes
27:57 - is it a computer no is it a cooking word
28:02 - I don't think so let's go with no how
28:05 - about farming yes
28:07 - how about clothing also yes so as we
28:09 - choose those yes and no values we can
28:12 - say that words are more or less closely
28:14 - related than one another and give them a
28:16 - mathematical value then we can do math
28:18 - on them like man is to King as woman is
28:22 - to hopefully we get Queen right but we
28:25 - can do King - man and get some value
28:29 - that's like royalty and we could do
28:32 - royalty plus woman and come up with
28:34 - Queen that's how these word vectors work
28:37 - they make associations and we can do
28:39 - math on them to find what words are
28:40 - related you can play with this too with
28:43 - word similarity calm give it a check
28:45 - check out you can even see words in
28:48 - different languages and how they're
28:49 - related and then maybe you'll see how
28:51 - closely llama is related to alpaca if
28:53 - you want to get into the meat of this
28:55 - word Tyvek is the place to go that is
28:58 - more for people who are very technical
29:00 - but you can play with word vectors as
29:02 - well hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to
29:13 - talk about artificial intelligence last
29:16 - time we talked about word vectors let's
29:18 - talk about a bigger concept vector
29:20 - representation how a computer can
29:22 - recognize an object based on the
29:25 - features that it has
29:26 - or those attributes for example think
29:29 - about the game 20 questions perhaps
29:31 - you're starting with is it an animal yes
29:34 - or no if it is an animal is it a farm
29:38 - animal yes or no is it a livestock
29:42 - animal yes or no right we could ask all
29:44 - kinds of questions to learn about what
29:46 - type of animal we're trying to identify
29:48 - those attributes are the vectors that AI
29:52 - system can use
29:53 - to identify unique individuals so for
29:56 - example dog breeds we might have short
29:58 - or long hair we might have weight under
30:00 - fifty pounds we might have whether or
30:02 - not it's used for hunting or sporting
30:04 - these representations are vectors that
30:07 - are often in fancy places like arrays or
30:10 - multi-dimensional spaces
30:12 - but you can think of them on a
30:13 - spreadsheet could I ask a question and
30:15 - say yes or no those zeros and ones build
30:18 - a unique identifier for each thing we're
30:21 - trying to represent so we can break down
30:23 - dogs into large and small we can break
30:27 - them down into their hair type we can
30:29 - break them down into what type of work
30:31 - that they do until we get a unique
30:34 - number for each one of them although
30:36 - zeros and ones add up and the more that
30:38 - we see the same types of ones and zeros
30:41 - the closer those dogs all are together
30:43 - like our sporting dogs might all be
30:45 - larger dogs with shorter hair or our toy
30:49 - dogs might all have smaller bodies right
30:52 - we can start to compare those features
30:54 - those representations to identify them
30:57 - uniquely the closer the numbers are the
30:59 - more related they are and this is how
31:01 - computer systems break down something
31:04 - really difficult like what is a dog to
31:07 - break it down into individual features
31:09 - and then they can represent that
31:10 - digitally in order to build a
31:12 - representation of the world

Cleaned transcript:

hey I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence did you know that there are seven senses in our bodies not five the first five you probably already know your sight your hearing your sense of smell your sense of taste and touch and the other two you might be come as a surprise to you they are both proprioception which is how you know where your body is in space and your vestibular system which is your sense of balance and those seven things together make up how you perceive the world now computers in order to do the work that they do also need to perceive the world and they use those same seven senses so vision for example you may be able to take a picture or a video and that would be a perception of a computer but it might also be a picture of using a telescope or using a microscope to see something that our eyes would never be able to perceive without the help of technology it might also see wavelengths of light that we can't see such as ultraviolet light that other animals can perceive humans have a sense of smell that we use to sense a motion and to know what's happening around us so for example if you walk home and you walk in the door and you smell cookies you probably feel really good if you walk in and you smell fire you might feel worried a computer can also smell it can have a fire detector that's connected to the fire department so before you even get home the fire department has already come that computer system can detect the chemical signature of fire and keep you safe you may have gone through an airport and if you bring food through that airport they need to test it and see that the chemicals are the things that they should find in food and not something that's illegal for an airplane so they'll bring out a little pad and they'll rub it on the food and that is the way a computer might taste so another sense we have is touch and for us it seems very natural we can pick up a pen we can pick up a phone we can pick up a heavy brick and we know exactly how much force we need in order to pick up each one of those objects one of the challenges that computers and robotics have is knowing how much force it takes to pick up a single object so when you have when you see that sixmonthold picking up Cheerios they're learning how not only to move their in that way but how much force it takes so that you can get the cheerio and grab it for it with just enough force that you don't crush it so robotics are still learning some of those systems of touch a computer can hear things both at a higher and lower range than than we can hear and it can hear at a faster or slower rate so some sounds computer can perceive and analyze and we have to see it on a graph because it's just too fast for our ears to hear that vestibular system that sense of balance that's a challenge for computers right now that they have to be able to orient themselves in space and you're probably thinking like a robot right like it's trying to walk and we know that computers don't really do that well yet those robotics yet but we have that sensor right here in our phones where we can play video games and that has that orientation in space and your GPS knows if you're going east or west or north or south and that's that's proprioception that's knowing where it is in space so we also have that with the vestibular system that sense of balance that's where robots really struggle is can they walk up the stairs that's a challenge for a robot because it requires a lot of different sensors and motors to work together very finely together where the timing has to work out just right where it can adapt and we're really good at adapting computers aren't as good at adapting what they are good at is finding patterns so when you have this whole these seven senses and they all come together we can put computer processing behind it and we can do amazing things hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence last time we talked about sensors and perception both for computers and for humans but what happens with that data once it comes through a sensor determines whether or not it's processed with a traditional computer or with an artificial intelligence system let me give you an example imagine that you're planning a birthday party at a roller rink and you want to spend $200 to rent out the rink and they also charge six dollars and fifty cents per person that comes to the rink you could put that in as $200 plus six dollars and fifty cents times the number of people or six 50p that's traditional computing where we have a function and we run some numbers through it and we get an output the amount that you're going to pay for the birthday party in artificial intelligence we do it a little bit differently we start with the input and we have the output and we don't figure out the middle the computer figures out how to get from the input to the output how it gets that is by successive approximation that means it gets closer and closer every time it'll try to come up with some numbers that make those variables work out to calculate what the rate will be over time so if you're an AI system you get the input of four people and the cost is two hundred and twenty six dollars ten people two hundred and sixtyfive 14 people two hundred and ninetyone twenty people three hundred and thirty so in traditional computing we give the computer a math problem and it plugs in the numbers and gives us an output in artificially intelligent programs we have an input and we have an output we have a lot of pairs of data that those values and it uses its own math to determine how the pattern should evolve here's another example we've we are shopping for our party and we're going to the grocery store as you walk in the door the door opens mmm and as you walk through it closes again you now that is a sensor it knows that you're there it opened for you but it doesn't know that you are you if you walk through that same door and the door opens and it says hello Charlotte and as you're checking out you scan that card so that you get your coupons well that data is being used by the company that you're purchasing from so let's say you scan that card and immediately some coupons come out and therefore about the same thing that you're buying right now if you're buying a cake mix you're probably getting coupons for other brands of cake mixes if you're buying three pints of Ben and Jerry's you're probably getting a coupon for buying four or more and and that's not an artificially intelligent system necessarily that's just that input versus output comparing what happens is if it knows you're having a birthday party and you get coupons in the mail next week that offer presents that would be tailored to your family that's an artificial intelligence system well how does it do that well it does it with a lot a lot a lot of data so if you walk through the door that's a sensor not a I if you get personalized information using lots of data that's a neural network hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence did you know there are five big ideas and AI they are perception representation and reasoning learning from data natural interaction and societal impact number one is perception perception is when a computer uses sensors to gather data and then extracts meaning from those signals number two representation and reasoning representation is when a computer builds its own world so that it can understand just like a Google map that's an example of a representation of how the computer perceives the world then it can apply reasoning to that representation for example to take you on the correct bike path or to route you via uber number three learning from data computers use a lot of data to do the processing that allows them to think artificially that's artificial intelligence almost all AI systems are made from a lot a lot of data number four natural interaction natural interaction is when we've trained an AI system to interact naturally with the people around it that means that you can trust Google Translate to say the words that you're saying in another language or perhaps you use facial recognition and you trust that that's we'll only let the correct people into the building number five societal impact ai affects our world in positive and negative ways ai makes it so that no one in the world starves but we also have to make sure to guard against implicit bias and make sure that the computer algorithms that we write are fair for everyone so these are the five big ideas in AI perception representation and reasoning learning from data natural interaction and societal impact watch more videos to learn more in depth about each of these ideas hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence have you heard of recommender systems recommender systems are AI computer algorithms that track your habits your likes and dislikes your beliefs how much money you have and where you are at any given time these recommender systems help you to choose music and video that you would enjoy based on the things you've watched in the past or people like you have watched in the past the ads that you see on the internet in social media and on apps if you've ever had that feeling like you thought about it and it appeared it's probably because people like you have enjoyed those same types of things or maybe you've clicked on an email link and now it's recommending things that you would like recommender systems provide coupons for you and they know which products you're likely to buy even if you've never purchased from that company before recommender systems are also used in sentencing and bail in the justice system so the judges know whether or not you're likely to reoffending companies use recommender systems to know whether or not you're a risk and your credit may be influenced by these recommender systems that are used by companies even elections and the news you see can be influenced by recommender systems which changes how people think about the world these recommender systems are built by data aggregators companies like Palantir data dog and first data who are spending billions of dollars and earning billions more to take these tiny bits of data about you every email you read every webpage you visit every social media app that you use your the location data from your phone when you watch or listen to any thing on your television these data aggregator companies bring all of that data together to build a very specific profile of people like you we need to ensure that these data aggregation companies reduce bias that they show appropriate content to adults and children and that everyone knows how to protect themselves we may have data that they don't want to share that's personal we need to make sure that data aggregation companies and recommender systems benefit all people hi I'm Charlotte and I work in artificial intelligence or AI AI is a computing tool that helps people use data to solve problems doctors use AI to find new medicines lives can be saved when planes trains and cars navigate themselves AI can be used to improve harvests for farmers or to protect the environment did you know we have satellites that monitor zebras from space reading their stripes like a barcode the uses of AI can go way beyond making awesome new movies and video games this kind of computer programming personalizes experiences for you like when your phone recommends a new song that you might enjoy based on what you've listened to before or predicts the next word you might want to use in a text snapchat filters are AI and it can be used to create learning experiences that work for every student it's all around us and AI is powerful when you see something wrong in the world you can use artificial intelligence as a tool to solve big problems in ways that individual people could never imagine like giving the internet to people in places where there aren't even roads or making sure that elderly population isn't lonely with robot companions AI can even remove human bias from decisions so hiring for jobs is equitable and people are paid fairly for the work they do we need you to learn computer science and use artificial intelligence to create systems that make the world a better place plus it's really fun be a creator of technology not just a consumer whatever career you're interested in AI can help you do your job better and you can start learning today with a simple web search hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence last time we learned about recommender systems and data aggregators how do those systems work they work by AI sorting algorithms that help us to identify and match what we're looking for here's an example perhaps you want to listen to a podcast and you've listened to several before and the recommender system can recommend future podcasts that you might enjoy we can also use AI sorting algorithms for health diagnosis and facial recognition these AI sorting algorithms need to be both sensitive so we don't skip important data and specific so that you don't find things that aren't there so here's an example let's say that you want to search for Dalmatians these black and white dogs right a sensitive algorithm would find the dog on a white rug or find that small dog on a big fire truck and a specific algorithm doesn't find cows doesn't find children in a dog costume it doesn't find zebras it just finds Dalmatians you can have a system that has false negatives and false positives a false negative is when an item is defined as no match when it should be such as if a sick person is told they're okay a false positive is when an item is identified as a match and it is not such as if a healthy person is told they're sick both false negatives and false positives are bad for example if we treat someone who's not sick they may have pain and expense when they didn't need to if we don't treat someone who is sick then they may get sicker so it's important that we refine these AI sorting algorithms to balance between the sensitive and the specific to eliminate both false negatives and false positives and not everything is black and white usually we need results that are on a spectrum so even in medicine or labeling that podcast that we want to listen to we need a balance of the algorithm finding narrowing down what we need and a human deciding those final steps here's an example let's look at some pictures what is swimming is it these kids in the competition is it kids playing at the beach how about if they're riding on rafts how about these surfers what about water polo how about this fish which of these would you label is swimming we have to decide it might be a spectrum maybe we're looking for a certain type of swimming you can play with this crowdsourced google comm then we can explore more about AI sorting algorithms and how they're used for identification hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence did you know that one of the primary goals of AI systems is to interact naturally with people these are AI systems that learn human patterns of speech are gestures and are effects and then our program to respond appropriately natural interaction may be used to create interfaces that feel normal to us so that we feel comfortable using the technology or to process human movement and speech patterns that keep us safe there are three common areas of natural interaction the first is speech anything to do with talking the second is gestures hand and body movements and the third is FX tiny movements and inflections that cause us to feel something like how we believe an actor on the movie screen so the first area speech could be texttospeech could be speech to text it could be do Google duplex making a phone call on your behalf or the person on the other end doesn't even know that a computer has called them it could be autocorrect when you were sending a text it could be Gmail that fills in your email and with the speech patterns that you've used in the past and it can be a screen reader where someone has sent you a document and it reads it out loud to you speech also includes translation but don't use it for your homework because the culture and the nuance is lost it's okay in a pinch though if you're trying to talk with someone in another language the second area of natural interaction is gesture recognition this is any way that you move your hands or your body to communicate the most popular least expensive technology that you may have encountered is the Xbox Kinect where you're dancing or playing a sport and your movement is recognized on this computer screen you can also see sometimes in movies where they resize a window something like that where you're just showing with your body not quite here yet but it's coming soon also these gesture recognition systems can recognize patterns in how people move their bodies to identify a shoplifter or to protect a crowd from someone who may be violent the third area of natural interaction is affective computing that's with an A and it's the study of how computers can process human emotions this is our tone of voice the tiny movements that we make to convey how we're feeling and our facial features that show that we're happy we're sad were angry were excited we often think of this in our mouths but you can see it in the eyes to look right you try it and we can use these gesture recognition systems with effective computing to tell if a driver is getting sleepy if they're texting if they've been drinking and that'll keep people safe on the roads natural interaction is an area of computer science research that makes AI systems accessible to everyone and it processes this the things that we do automatically like tone of voice and positioning of our bodies into a format that computers can understand then programmers can write systems they interact with us in a way that makes us comfortable and safe hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence did you know that computer systems build representations of the world and then perform reasoning on them a representation is a way to describe a system using the relevant features think of a subway map we don't show the trees and the cross streets we only show where the subway can stop and we apply reasoning that to that by planning your route figuring out where you need to go to get from MIT to the Red Sox game red line to Green Line an AI system uses computer vision to construct your representation and then performs reasoning on that that our choices within that representation for example the Cosmo robot the robot has computer vision and can identify things like blocks it can identify you by name it can identify your dog or your cat and it knows where it is on the table then it can perform reasoning such as picking up a block saying your name or playing a game with you you can also have representations of things that don't see like the BOK BOTS or Google Doodle where you can play with music there are features in this music those features are things like the note duration the type of instrument that's playing the pitch of that and all of those things together make up a representation of the music you can think of that like sheet music and what comes next is the reasoning that we can apply so that we can make Bach like music following the same patterns that we identified in the features or let's say you want to create an application to help you find the perfect Girl Scout Troop for you we can identify features that would make that possible such as what grade level the girl is going to be the location of the troop meetings the times that work for your family and then we can actually say things like whether or not this troop often does stem activities or if they like outdoor adventures or service projects and then we can put weights to those so that we can say you know I want to weight outdoor adventurers higher than I want to rate service projects and I can find a troop that's just right for me you can try out representation and reasoning using Google's deep dream generator you can apply an artistic style to an image that you upload and see how the representation takes the features of that art and applies it to your image try it today it's fun it's practical it's cool hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence when you hear AI do you think killer robot that's an archetype it's like if I ask you to think of a word that starts with C do you think of cat that first leave of your brain often isn't true and it often hides things that we've grown up with like maybe you're not a racist but you've grown up in a system that has racism you might exhibit some behaviors that you have to overcome you have to dispel the myths that are the archetypes in your brain and AI is that way the killer robots are not what you think AI is not weaponized and the vast majority of AI is just algorithms with data in computers but we've grown up with stories like Robbie lost in space Hal 3000 the hound from Fahrenheit 451 The Terminator The Matrix and Detroit become human depending on what generation you are in and we think that those are AI but our overlords are not coming there's no evidence that we have artificial general intelligence these computer systems are not making plans on their own there they don't have any autonomy they don't have emotion they're not alive they are only as good or as bad as the tasks it's human creators assigned to be accomplished but people are building autonomous lethal robotics on their own these are computer vision and navigation systems that can move independently and target selectively they do have the capacity to kill through onboard weapons so if you take a robot like Boston Dynamics spot or the parkour robot that you see here and you can see that it moves in some ways better or faster than than humans can it has a limitation its battery and some of the navigation is remote controlled but it can navigate difficult terrain it can jump it can go into dangerous areas and these robots are being designed to do good work for people like search and rescue dealing with landmines fighting fires working in dangerous construction sites or cleaning up nuclear waste but we also have soldiers in Arizona that are flying drones in the Middle East there are limiting targets remotely then they're going home to dinner some people say that autonomous lethal robotics will save soldiers lives we know that military technology moves into our local police forces so we need to ensure that autonomous lethal robotics are regulated through ethical political and legislative processes the most important thing is that you're informed the AI can be used in this way by people making decisions in 1980 we had blinding laser weapons they were banned from the battlefield across the world in 1997 we banned chemical weapons and even before that in 1928 we had the Geneva Convention so political action and treaties can work once you get the cat out of the bag like nuclear it's really hard to stuff it back in so what we need to do is share your awareness of autonomous lethal robotics write to your representatives and make some noise we can create commonsense legislative protections so that people aren't allowed to build and deploy systems that decide life and death on our behalf and we can use AI for positive change hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence have you heard in the news about deep fakes it's where you very carefully place one person in a video with another person using artificial intelligence it is real but there's a lot of misconceptions about this technology first you take a person's face and you mark the points around their face like their chin the corners of their mouth or the corners of their eyes and then you can map those points to another person so that you can swap out one person for another you can see this on a technology like snapchat where you're adding maybe a goatee to someone's face or you're putting food on their head a funny example of seeing this technology in action in a deep fake is the video full house of moustaches check it out the big worry about the deep fake technology is that fake news could result in this you could have a politician saying something that they didn't really say and have that be broadcast but the reality is that so far this has only been used for comedy or to show that what the technology can do here are three things to reassure you the first is that politicians are very interested in creating legislation that protects them from deep fake technology they don't want to be seen saying something that they didn't actually say the second is that technology companies are identifying videos that are created with this technology and then can remove them automatically and the third is that people are thinking critically about these technologies and they are aware that they're happening probably because there's some funny content out there so stay vigilant have fun and be aware of deep fakes hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence have you heard of word vectors how about natural language processing today we're going to talk about those ideas natural language processing is the way a computer understands what you say out loud in a regular voice it's part of natural interaction your phone is very good at understanding and translating what you say out loud to written communication even tricky homophones like poor not having enough money and poor like pouring your juice or telling a tale versus a mouse's tail you can try this on your phone or in translating and by speaking out loud and having a document right for you your phone does not understand the words that you're saying but it does know associations between words for example llama llama is very closely associated to alpaca it's also closely associated to farm it's also associated with clothing or stuffed animals it's not as associated with the word tire for example so llama can be related to a lot of different things that aren't just related to Farms but what we have to determine for natural language processing is how similar a word is in the text compared to other words that are found in text and if you search the whole internet you could make a lot of comparisons it used to be on the SAT that you'd be asked analogy questions like popcorn is to butter as fries are to what and you might say ketchup or mayonnaise but you probably wouldn't say Tiger right there are words that are more closely or less closely related to one another and we can rate the closeness of words using math you've done this too probably with a game called 20 questions but a computer asks about 300 questions and we can sort these words like llama into categories we can say it's an animal yes or no yes is it a computer no is it a cooking word I don't think so let's go with no how about farming yes how about clothing also yes so as we choose those yes and no values we can say that words are more or less closely related than one another and give them a mathematical value then we can do math on them like man is to King as woman is to hopefully we get Queen right but we can do King man and get some value that's like royalty and we could do royalty plus woman and come up with Queen that's how these word vectors work they make associations and we can do math on them to find what words are related you can play with this too with word similarity calm give it a check check out you can even see words in different languages and how they're related and then maybe you'll see how closely llama is related to alpaca if you want to get into the meat of this word Tyvek is the place to go that is more for people who are very technical but you can play with word vectors as well hi I'm Charlotte and I'm here to talk about artificial intelligence last time we talked about word vectors let's talk about a bigger concept vector representation how a computer can recognize an object based on the features that it has or those attributes for example think about the game 20 questions perhaps you're starting with is it an animal yes or no if it is an animal is it a farm animal yes or no is it a livestock animal yes or no right we could ask all kinds of questions to learn about what type of animal we're trying to identify those attributes are the vectors that AI system can use to identify unique individuals so for example dog breeds we might have short or long hair we might have weight under fifty pounds we might have whether or not it's used for hunting or sporting these representations are vectors that are often in fancy places like arrays or multidimensional spaces but you can think of them on a spreadsheet could I ask a question and say yes or no those zeros and ones build a unique identifier for each thing we're trying to represent so we can break down dogs into large and small we can break them down into their hair type we can break them down into what type of work that they do until we get a unique number for each one of them although zeros and ones add up and the more that we see the same types of ones and zeros the closer those dogs all are together like our sporting dogs might all be larger dogs with shorter hair or our toy dogs might all have smaller bodies right we can start to compare those features those representations to identify them uniquely the closer the numbers are the more related they are and this is how computer systems break down something really difficult like what is a dog to break it down into individual features and then they can represent that digitally in order to build a representation of the world
