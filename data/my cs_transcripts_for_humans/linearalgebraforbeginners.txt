00:00 - okay so welcome to the first lecture on
00:02 - the vectors course this is the basics
00:05 - vectors versus scalars vector notation
00:07 - addition and scaling and properties
00:10 - alright so begin at the beginning let's
00:13 - list some scalar quantities think about
00:15 - mass duration length temperature charge
00:19 - these physical quantities are all well
00:21 - described with a single number really
00:24 - they just have a magnitude although some
00:26 - of them may go negative so it's a
00:28 - magnitude and a sign but still just a
00:30 - simple number is adequate to describe
00:32 - these things
00:33 - how about vector quantities what what's
00:36 - different about vector quantities well
00:38 - think about these things force velocity
00:40 - and therefore acceleration or momentum
00:42 - these things also have a strength or a
00:46 - magnitude however so let's put that down
00:50 - they have a magnitude however they also
00:53 - have a direction more than just a sign
00:56 - they have a full on direction in
00:58 - three-dimensional space so it's not
01:00 - enough to know that a force is three
01:01 - Newtons I want to know in which
01:03 - direction is that force applied and that
01:06 - then is the difference between a vector
01:07 - and a scalar quantity we're going to
01:09 - think about how we manipulate them all
01:11 - right so first off the notation that
01:14 - we're going to use when we talk about
01:17 - our vectors what I'm going to do is I'm
01:19 - going to use a symbol such as the letter
01:23 - A so let's write that out but I'm going
01:26 - to underline it so an underlined symbol
01:29 - indicates a vector rather than a simple
01:31 - number and when I need to specify that
01:34 - vector I'm going to write it we're going
01:35 - to be three-dimensional I'm going to
01:36 - write the three numbers in a column form
01:39 - like this and now if you haven't seen a
01:41 - vector specified before what does it
01:43 - mean well think of the Cartesian axes
01:46 - the X the X Y z axes think in this case
01:51 - about coming out from the origin to in
01:56 - the direction of X and 1 in the
02:00 - direction of Y and 3 in the direction of
02:03 - said what we're going to do is we're
02:04 - going to think of our vector as
02:07 - an arrow an arrow that comes from the
02:10 - origin to this point in space and that
02:12 - arrow itself whether or not it comes
02:14 - from the origin that that direction and
02:16 - that length of arrow is our
02:19 - visualization of the vector so let me
02:22 - just change color to green and go ahead
02:26 - and draw the tip of my arrow there there
02:28 - we are so the vector is coming towards
02:30 - us out of the screen and it has those
02:33 - particular three components - 1 3 other
02:37 - people may use other notations for
02:38 - example align over the the symbol a is
02:42 - commonly used when people write out the
02:45 - components that may choose to do it as a
02:46 - row like this or even using pointy
02:49 - brackets like this now all these
02:52 - notations are basically getting at the
02:55 - same thing you'll be able to read
02:56 - textbooks or look online and see these
02:58 - things and understand what they mean but
03:00 - within this course of videos we're just
03:04 - going to use the notation that I've
03:06 - introduced above so I'll erase those for
03:08 - now now the simplest thing that you
03:11 - might want to do if you have a couple of
03:13 - vectors is to add them up so let's think
03:16 - about that vector addition what does it
03:17 - mean so let's give ourselves a second
03:19 - vector B we'll make it 5 minus 2 0 let's
03:23 - say I want to add these two vectors
03:25 - together so we'll write that out I
03:27 - simply want to add a on the line plus B
03:30 - underline does that mean let's just
03:31 - substitute in 2 3 added on 2 5 minus 2 0
03:37 - now what we do is we simply add the
03:40 - first component component of vector a to
03:43 - the first component of vector B and so
03:45 - on down the list very very simple so
03:47 - we're adding 2 plus 5 we're going to add
03:51 - 1 plus -2 and 3 plus 0 and we just tidy
03:56 - that up so that's going to be 7 and
03:59 - minus 1 and 3 now how about scaling a
04:05 - vector ok so what we can do is we can
04:09 - multiply a vector by a simple number and
04:13 - correspondingly we'll just end up
04:15 - multiplying each of its components so
04:17 - let's take an example 3 9 -
04:20 - 12 what we notice is each of the three
04:23 - components is a multiple of three we can
04:25 - just take that common factor out in
04:27 - front and write this instead as 3 times
04:29 - 1 3 minus 4 same thing alright or
04:34 - equivalently someone might give us a
04:36 - vector that's already written in this
04:38 - form it could be let's see 3 over 2 on 2
04:42 - 2 4 minus 4 let's make it one alright
04:45 - and we can just multiply that in in a
04:48 - component by component basis so we just
04:51 - write ourselves a new column of course 3
04:53 - times 2 is 3 3 times minus 4 is minus 6
04:57 - and 3 over 2 times 1 is 3 over 2 okay so
05:03 - there we are
05:04 - we can scale our vectors by a number in
05:07 - this simple way so with these
05:09 - definitions of addition and scaling can
05:12 - we say anything about the properties
05:14 - okay
05:14 - so if I have two regular numbers a and B
05:17 - then of course a plus B is the same as B
05:19 - plus a I'm not saying anything fancy
05:21 - here it's as simple as I don't know 7
05:23 - plus minus 3 is equal to minus 3 plus 7
05:26 - obviously it is we know that now if we
05:29 - think about the same statement for
05:31 - vectors a plus B vector B is it the same
05:34 - as vector B plus a well it must be let's
05:37 - just write at an example 7 0 minus 1 3 1
05:40 - 2 is it equal to 3 1 2 vector plus the
05:45 - vector 7 0 7 0 minus 1 of course it is
05:51 - because of the way we've defined vector
05:53 - addition as just being the addition of
05:56 - each element to the corresponding
05:58 - element and this property is called
06:00 - being commutative okay so vector
06:04 - addition is commutative how about this
06:06 - second example
06:08 - if we have three basic quantities
06:10 - ordinary numbers then if we have a plus
06:12 - B plus C it's the same as a plus B plus
06:15 - C it doesn't matter the order that we do
06:17 - them in is that going to be true for
06:19 - vectors well of course it is going to
06:21 - have to be true to fit vectors because
06:23 - the way we define vector addition is to
06:26 - add each component to the corresponding
06:28 - component it's just addition so this is
06:30 - also 4
06:32 - vectors let's write out what we mean we
06:36 - mean that vector a plus B plus C as a
06:40 - previously worked out thing is equal to
06:42 - vector A plus vector B and then add on C
06:49 - it doesn't matter the order we do these
06:50 - things all right and there's a name for
06:53 - that property
06:53 - it's called being associative so - all
07:02 - right so vector addition has that
07:05 - property also
07:06 - now let's thinking about our scaling
07:07 - property if we have ordinary numbers
07:09 - again
07:10 - then we could take some scale factor K
07:12 - and multiply it into a plus B and it
07:14 - would just give us K times a plus K
07:16 - times B again I'm not saying anything
07:18 - that isn't utterly obvious here say for
07:20 - example I don't know 2 into 1 plus -3 is
07:25 - equal to 2 times 1 plus 2 times minus 3
07:30 - of course it is so how about for vectors
07:32 - is it true that some scale factor K
07:34 - times the sum vector A plus vector B a
07:37 - plus B and that's stress that this scale
07:40 - factor is just a pure number then yes
07:43 - indeed it's going to be just K times a
07:46 - plus K times B so just to just to stress
07:51 - what we're doing here let's copy down
07:52 - this sum of two vectors we were playing
07:55 - with up here this 7 zero minus one thing
07:58 - plus three one to put it inside curly
08:00 - brackets maybe for a variety doesn't
08:02 - have to be curly brackets multiply it by
08:04 - some factor let's have three over two
08:07 - had that before unimaginative there we
08:08 - are what are they going to be it's just
08:10 - gonna be three over two times the first
08:12 - vector seven zero 1 and then plus three
08:16 - over two times the second vector three
08:18 - one two
08:19 - okay so everything as you kind of would
08:23 - expect it works out it must and this
08:25 - latter property is called being
08:27 - distributed distributive excuse me so
08:30 - scaling is distributive over addition
08:33 - and that's the end of our first video
08:39 - welcome to the second of these videos
08:41 - we're going to look here at the vector
08:43 - dot product also called the scalar
08:45 - product we'll look at also the magnitude
08:46 - of a vector and the meaning of unit
08:48 - vectors the geometric meaning of the dot
08:50 - product and finding the angle between
08:52 - vectors using the dot product okay
08:56 - so the dot product is a way of combining
08:59 - two vectors in order to produce a number
09:03 - a simple number a scalar
09:04 - hence the alternate name scalar product
09:06 - let's give ourselves a couple of vectors
09:08 - let's have a will vector a can be four
09:11 - minus four let's have two one and we'll
09:15 - have a vector B which can be three one
09:22 - three and we're going to do the dot
09:25 - product of these two guys so we write
09:28 - that as vector a a nice a nice clear
09:31 - central dot vector B and then we write
09:33 - that out as the two column vectors and
09:37 - we need to understand how we compute the
09:40 - dot product and the answer is we're
09:42 - simply going to multiply each component
09:45 - by its opposite number and then add them
09:46 - up so we're going to multiply the first
09:49 - component minus 4 by 3 and then add that
09:52 - to the second component to multiply by
09:55 - its opposite number 1 and finally the
09:57 - third components 1 and 3 so that's minus
10:00 - 4 times 2 by 3 add it on to 2 times by 1
10:08 - add it on to 1 times 2 by 3 so minus 12
10:13 - plus 2 Plus 3 that's going to be minus
10:18 - minus 7
10:21 - all right there's the dot product worked
10:23 - out pretty straightforward and of course
10:25 - as you can see it can be a minus number
10:26 - can be zero can be a positive number but
10:29 - it's a simple pure number okay so now
10:33 - let's see what happens if we do the dot
10:35 - product of a vector with itself let's do
10:37 - a dotted with itself so there's gonna be
10:39 - minus four to one dotted with minus four
10:42 - to one now of course because we're
10:45 - multiplying each component by itself
10:47 - that will always be a positive number
10:49 - 16:4 pop months four by minus 4 + 2 - 2
10:52 - 4 + 1 1 is 1 and so it's going to add up
10:55 - to 21 it must add up to a positive
10:56 - number it's made of three positive
10:58 - numbers summed I want to introduce a
11:01 - second vector called a hat it's related
11:04 - to a just by scaling it and we're gonna
11:06 - scale it by one over the square root of
11:09 - the earlier dot product with itself so 1
11:12 - over square root 21 and then just - 4 -
11:15 - 1 as before so it says the scaled
11:18 - version of a what's interesting about it
11:20 - well now let's see what happens if we
11:22 - take the dot product of a hat with a hat
11:26 - with itself so we're going to get 1 over
11:29 - square root of 21 times 1 over a square
11:32 - root of 21 which is 1 over 21 and then
11:36 - of course we're going to get a dotted
11:38 - with a the original dot product we did
11:41 - which is just 21 as we know so of course
11:44 - the dot product of a hat with itself is
11:46 - just 1 that means that a hat has a
11:49 - special property it's what's called a
11:52 - unit vector unity being of course a
11:55 - fancy word for the number 1 so when we
11:57 - scale a vector so that it when dotted
11:59 - with itself it comes out as 1 then it is
12:02 - a unit vector
12:03 - meanwhile in general for a vector the
12:06 - square root of the dot product with
12:08 - itself has the name magnitude this is
12:11 - the magnitude of a vector and it is also
12:14 - magnitude it is also the length of the
12:17 - arrow if we think in terms of a vector
12:21 - as a physical displacement an arrow that
12:25 - lives in three-dimensional space then it
12:26 - would be the length of that arrow as you
12:28 - can see from Pythagoras
12:29 - okay now then a different thing the dot
12:32 - product between two vectors has an
12:34 - alternative definition which we can show
12:36 - is the same as the definition we've been
12:39 - using so far a dot B is also the
12:42 - magnitude of a time's the magnitude of B
12:44 - times cause of some angle and what is
12:47 - that angle it's actually just the angle
12:50 - between the two vectors between their
12:52 - directions so here I'm drawing a vector
12:55 - a going in one direction and almost in
12:57 - the opposite direction vector B and then
12:59 - the angle in question would be this
13:02 - angle that we see between the two
13:04 - vectors when we draw them coming from a
13:06 - common point of origin okay so it's
13:08 - important to understand then that this
13:10 - angle can be more than 90 degrees here's
13:13 - what it isn't here's a mistake that's
13:15 - sometimes made by people as they start
13:17 - to play with vectors they want the angle
13:20 - for some reason they want it to be less
13:22 - than 90 degrees so they try and contrive
13:24 - this by putting the vectors together in
13:26 - a way that will give them less than 90
13:28 - degrees like this for example and then
13:31 - we could try and draw an angle between
13:34 - these two lines let's see like that
13:37 - shoes out red to show that it's not
13:39 - correct what we should have is the two
13:42 - vectors coming from a common origin then
13:44 - we see that the angle between them can
13:45 - be more or less than 90 degrees if it
13:47 - was exactly 90 degrees then of course
13:49 - the dot product would be 0 because cos
13:52 - of 90 is 0 that's has interesting
13:55 - consequences but right now let's work
13:57 - out the angle between a couple of
13:58 - vectors let's give ourselves a we'll
14:00 - make it 1 0 minus 1 and B we're going to
14:04 - make it 4 1 minus 1 and we'll do the dot
14:09 - product between those guys so first
14:10 - we'll work out the dot product actually
14:13 - let's make it minus 1 so it can be minus
14:15 - 1 0 minus 1 I think they'll come out
14:17 - better so we have minus 4 from minus 1
14:19 - times 4 we have 0 times 1 is 0 and we
14:21 - have minus 1 times minus 1 is 1 so it's
14:23 - gonna be minus 3 for the total dot
14:26 - product between these two guys but we
14:28 - also need to find out the magnitude fair
14:30 - enough my tangent of a is gonna be the
14:31 - square root of minus 1 times minus 1 is
14:33 - 1 and again 1 so that would be the
14:36 - square root of 2 nice straightforward
14:39 - meanwhile the magnitude of B is going to
14:42 - be 4 4 6
14:44 - plus one plus one it's gonna be 18 the
14:48 - square root of 18 but I think we can do
14:51 - better than that
14:52 - square root of 18 is actually square
14:54 - root of 9 times the square root of 2 and
14:57 - that means it's 3 times the square root
14:59 - of 2 okay now we've got everything we
15:01 - need let's pull down a copy of that that
15:04 - definition they're relating a dot B to
15:07 - its magnitudes in the angle and fill in
15:09 - what we know for this particular choice
15:12 - of a and B we've got minus 3 is
15:14 - therefore equal to root 2 times 3 root 2
15:19 - times cos of the angle that we're after
15:22 - so now we just need to rearrange that
15:24 - means that cos of the angle is going to
15:27 - be 2 equal to minus 3 divided by well
15:31 - we've got 2 lots of root 2 so stress
15:33 - mere 3 times 2 and if we simplify that
15:35 - down it's just me minus 1/2 now we may
15:38 - just remember oil so use a calculator to
15:40 - find out this means that the angle in
15:43 - question is in fact going to be simply
15:46 - 120 degrees or you can use radians if
15:48 - you prefer radians so there we are
15:50 - that's the answer the angle between
15:51 - these two vectors 120 degrees and that's
15:54 - it for the second video in this video
15:57 - we're going to see how to calculate
15:59 - something called the cross product of
16:01 - two vectors it's also called the vector
16:03 - product because the output is a new
16:05 - vector and we'll see how to test that
16:07 - the answer is correct
16:08 - so here I've written a cross B is equal
16:12 - to C and notice that the symbol for the
16:14 - cross product is just the multiplication
16:16 - symbol that you're familiar with from
16:18 - basic arithmetic I've given the vector a
16:21 - a particular form this two three four
16:23 - column vector and similarly B is written
16:27 - as four five six so we're going to go
16:29 - ahead and find out what is the cross
16:31 - product of these two vectors C because
16:33 - it's a vector we'll need to do some
16:35 - working for each of the three components
16:37 - now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
16:39 - paste up some arm some structure to help
16:41 - us work through the problem so don't
16:43 - worry because there's gonna look like a
16:45 - lot but you don't need to write all this
16:47 - out every time you want to do a cross
16:48 - product I'm just putting it here so we
16:50 - can really spell out the process okay so
16:53 - let's go ahead and work out the first
16:54 - component of the output vector C
16:57 - strangely enough what we're going to do
16:58 - is we're going to ignore the first
17:00 - component of vectors a and B so I'm just
17:02 - going to cross those out those aren't
17:04 - used and what we're going to do is we're
17:06 - going to multiply a certain of the other
17:08 - components what we're going to do is
17:09 - we're going to multiply the second
17:11 - component of vector a with the third
17:13 - component of vector B I call that the
17:15 - falling diagonal because when we draw it
17:18 - like this we start high and then go low
17:20 - and then we're going to subtract off the
17:23 - multiple of the rising diagonal four and
17:26 - six here the last component of vector a
17:28 - and the middle component of vector B so
17:31 - what we have here is 21 that seven
17:34 - threes a 21-6 fours are 24 that's minus
17:37 - three we can go ahead now and write that
17:40 - in as our first our -3 now let's move to
17:43 - the second element of the output vector
17:45 - C again we'll start by ignoring the
17:49 - second component of the to source
17:51 - vectors a and B we can cross those off
17:53 - and again we are going to multiply some
17:55 - diagonals but what's different here is
17:57 - we start with the rising diagonal 4
18:00 - times 5 the last component of vector a
18:03 - times the first component of vector B
18:06 - the rising diagonal 5 4 2 20 and then we
18:09 - subtract off the falling diagonal so 2 7
18:13 - to 14 and that's going to give us 6 so
18:16 - we can put that in now let's move to the
18:19 - third and final component as before we
18:21 - start by noting that we will ignore the
18:24 - third component of the to source vectors
18:27 - and we're going to need some diagonals
18:29 - it's the same pattern as the first
18:31 - falling diagonal first so 2 times 6 and
18:34 - subtract which is 12 and then subtract
18:37 - off the rising diagonal five threes of
18:39 - 15 all right so that's going to be -3
18:43 - pop that in we see that we have quite a
18:46 - simple vector here there's a common
18:47 - factor of 3 let's bring that out 3 then
18:50 - minus 1 2 minus 1 that is our vector C
18:56 - that is a cross B notice again the
18:58 - pattern it was the falling diagonal
19:00 - minus the rising diagonal for the first
19:03 - component and then the rising diagonal
19:06 - minus the falling diagonal for the
19:08 - second component and then for the third
19:10 - it was
19:10 - back to the same pattern as for the
19:12 - first now these look a bit like letters
19:14 - to me they look a bit like a V the
19:16 - middle one perhaps an N and the final
19:18 - one a V I like to remember that as a
19:21 - little sentence which is vowels never
19:26 - vary because in my opinion vowels don't
19:30 - vary very much his evolved this one
19:32 - doesn't vary at all because it's stuffed
19:33 - in a museum however if you compare it to
19:36 - some other vowels which I found these on
19:38 - the internet I think they are all pretty
19:40 - much identical and it see a big
19:42 - difference there so for me voles never
19:43 - vary if for you they do seem to vary
19:46 - then think of a different way of
19:47 - remembering it but the important thing
19:49 - is that the first thing is the falling
19:51 - diagonal and then subtract the rising
19:53 - diagonal of V shape and it alternates
19:56 - okay how to check your cross product has
19:59 - been worked out correctly this is really
20:01 - useful stuff so let's give ourselves
20:02 - another example we have two three one
20:05 - and then we'll have let's say three
20:07 - seven minus one is get a minus in there
20:09 - and that's going to be equal to
20:10 - something we'll work it out in a minute
20:12 - for now I'll put X Y Zed now how am I
20:16 - going to test once I found those x y&z
20:18 - that I haven't made some kind of slip I
20:20 - mean there's a lot of mental arithmetic
20:22 - if we don't write it all out we're gonna
20:23 - be doing a bunch of multiplications I
20:25 - could easily slip up how am I gonna test
20:28 - that it turns out there's a very
20:30 - interesting property of the vector C
20:32 - that we get out after the operation if
20:35 - we've done it correctly that is as I've
20:37 - written here that a dot dot product with
20:41 - vector C is zero and so is B so either
20:43 - of the input vectors a and B dotted with
20:47 - the correct cross product C should give
20:49 - us zero and that's great because the dot
20:51 - product is very easy to work out even by
20:53 - eye as a check let's go ahead and do it
20:55 - so I've copied it down here we're going
20:57 - to want to work down our various
20:59 - components let's do the first component
21:01 - of C so what do we do we ignore the
21:04 - first components of a and B and we do
21:06 - the falling diagonals that's going to be
21:08 - three times minus one and we subtract
21:10 - the rising diagonals one times seven
21:12 - such as just let's just write that out
21:16 - normally I wouldn't bother to write all
21:18 - this out but let's go ahead and do it as
21:19 - minus three minus seven and so that's
21:22 - going to be minus ten as our first
21:24 - component now we work out second
21:26 - component we ignore the second component
21:28 - on the input vectors will do the rising
21:30 - diagonal one times three and subtract
21:32 - the falling diagonal two times minus one
21:35 - so what have we got we've got three here
21:39 - minus minus 2 and so that's going to
21:43 - give us five and then finally the third
21:45 - component ignore the third component of
21:46 - the input vectors do the falling
21:48 - diagonal 2 times 7 7 2 2 14 subtract the
21:51 - rising diagonal three threes and 9 so
21:54 - we're going to have for our final
21:57 - component 14 minus 9 which is another 5
22:01 - aha
22:01 - so that's quite a simple vector has a
22:04 - common factor of 5 in there if we wanted
22:08 - to write it out that way now let's test
22:10 - that guy versus the a and B vectors to
22:15 - see if it passed passes our test or have
22:17 - we made a slip so let's just be
22:20 - completely explicit about that we're
22:22 - going to start by testing the dot
22:24 - product of the vector a with our
22:28 - hopefully correct that cross product C
22:30 - I'll write it out two three one dot
22:33 - product - 10 5 5 what's that going to be
22:37 - equal to minus 20 and then three fives
22:40 - of 15 and then one five is five aha it
22:43 - does equal zero
22:44 - that's correct that's a very very
22:47 - encouraging thing but for real
22:49 - thoroughness we're going to test the
22:50 - other one as well so this is B dot C
22:53 - let's check that out so that's three
22:55 - seven minus one dotted with again - 10 5
22:59 - 5 this time is going to be minus minus
23:02 - 30 from three times minus ten and then 7
23:05 - 5 2 35 and minus 5 from the last element
23:09 - zero again aha so it has in fact passed
23:12 - both of our tests and we're not very
23:14 - confident that's correct this is a great
23:16 - test to do one word of warning though
23:17 - the one thing it won't pick up is if
23:20 - you've done your rising and falling
23:21 - diagonals in exactly the wrong way round
23:23 - by starting with the wrong pattern
23:26 - so do remember the VNV pattern and this
23:30 - test will check for any particular slips
23:32 - in your multiplications and that's the
23:35 - end of the video okay so in this short
23:40 - video I'm just going to look at four
23:42 - more examples of the cross product for
23:44 - practice and here they are okay so
23:46 - here's the first one we want the first
23:48 - element of this cross product so we
23:50 - ignore the first elements of the to
23:53 - source vectors we do the falling
23:55 - diagonal 3 times 0 that's 0 and we
23:58 - subtract the rising diagonal 7 times
24:01 - minus 1 that is minus 7 so we're
24:03 - subtracting minus 7 that means we'll get
24:05 - plus 7 so the first element here is NBS
24:07 - 7 ok so now we want the second element
24:10 - that means we ignore the second element
24:12 - of the to source factors we do however
24:14 - the rising diagonal first 70s 14 minus 1
24:18 - times 0 0 so that's 14 so the second one
24:21 - was the rising diagonal first if you
24:23 - follow me and then finally to get the
24:25 - third component we ignore the third
24:27 - component of the source vectors and we
24:29 - do the falling diagonal 1 times minus 1
24:31 - is minus 1 minus 3 to 6 so that is minus
24:35 - 7 okay so there's our solution 7 14
24:41 - minus 7 but is that correct or have we
24:44 - made a slip it's a good time to check
24:47 - the old dot product tricked so if we
24:49 - call this a cross B equals C then we
24:52 - should find that if we do the dot
24:53 - product of one of the input vectors say
24:55 - B with C then it should be 0 let's check
24:58 - that 7 2 2 14 minus 1 times 14 is minus
25:01 - 14 0 times minus 7 is zero so that's 14
25:04 - minus 14 is correct let's do the other
25:05 - one it's harder so 1 times 7 is 7
25:08 - 3 times 14 is 42 so that's 49 in total
25:13 - and then the final term here 7 7 2 49
25:17 - but that was with a minus number so
25:20 - we've got in fact 14 8 49 minus 49 is 0
25:24 - so another one of those dot products is
25:27 - correctly 0 so what we found out is that
25:29 - a dot C and B dot C are both equal to 0
25:35 - as they must be so when
25:38 - very confident that we have the right
25:39 - cross product there let's do another one
25:42 - okay so we're going to want the first
25:46 - element so we ignore the first element
25:47 - of the to source vectors and we do eight
25:51 - threes are 83 - 24 - 2 - x - 2 so that's
25:56 - 22 let's do the next elements so we
25:59 - ignore the middle element so we do the
26:00 - rising diagonal 4 - 0 8 - 8 that's just
26:03 - going to be 0 and then finally we ignore
26:06 - the bottom elements and we do the
26:07 - falling diagonal - the rising diagonal 1
26:10 - minus 12 is minus 11 so there's our
26:14 - solution 22 0 minus 11 we notice we
26:17 - could take 11 out of that as a common
26:20 - factor that would make them the next
26:21 - stage very easy but let's just let's do
26:23 - it the hard way and do the dot product
26:26 - so 4 times 22 is 88 1 times 0 0 and
26:30 - minus 88 and actually pretty easy to
26:31 - confirm that 0 let's do the other one 1
26:34 - times 22 is 22 3 times 0 and again 2
26:37 - times minus 11 again 0 so that's fine
26:40 - that one's passed its checks as well
26:43 - onto the third one okay so this time I
26:47 - think I might take a common factor out
26:48 - just to show us doing that because I see
26:51 - that this 25 5 15 chap is going to lead
26:55 - to some pretty big numbers but maybe I
26:57 - don't need to do that I can just take
26:58 - the common factor of 5 out of the first
27:01 - vector we're calling it vector a so
27:03 - that's just 5 1-3 and then I go ahead
27:06 - and write vector B which can't be
27:08 - simplified is just 1 3 minus 2 will do
27:11 - this cross cross spot excuse me will do
27:13 - this cross product and then we'll put
27:15 - the factor of 5 in at the end that's
27:17 - fine to do it that way round okay so
27:20 - let's go ahead and write that out
27:21 - there's our factor of 5 and here's our
27:23 - cross product so the first element of
27:26 - our cross product we can or the first
27:27 - elements of the to source factors we do
27:29 - the falling diagonal that gives us a
27:31 - minus 2 we subtract the rising diagonal
27:33 - that's a minus 9 so that's minus 2 plus
27:36 - 9 that's going to give us a 7 and now
27:40 - the middle element we ignore the middle
27:41 - elements on the to source factors we do
27:43 - the rising diagonal this time gives us
27:45 - minus 3 we subtract the falling diagonal
27:48 - that gives us minus 10 which means we're
27:50 - gonna have to add on 10 so that's minus
27:52 - 3 plus 10 it's another 7 okay and then
27:56 - finally the third element we ignore the
27:58 - 3rd elements on the source factor we do
28:00 - the falling diagonal that's five threes
28:03 - of 15 and we subtract the rising
28:05 - diagonal one that's going to give us
28:07 - another 14 so in fact a really simple
28:11 - vector here cuz we could take out a
28:12 - factor of 7 if we want to but let's
28:16 - check those dot products do it before or
28:19 - after we take out the factor of 7 it's
28:21 - pretty easy that's gonna be 4 times 7
28:24 - minus and minus 2 times 14 yes that goes
28:28 - to 0 let's do this one just quickly
28:31 - 35 and another 7 is 42 but minus 3 times
28:37 - 14 is exactly minus 42 so that one is
28:40 - also satisfied we've passed our checks
28:43 - that looks pretty good we can leave it
28:45 - like this or if we want we can take out
28:47 - that factor of 7 and do 35 times 1 1 2
28:51 - very simple very nice back to there ok
28:55 - let's come here now come down to the
28:57 - bottom and look at the final one we
28:58 - notice is actually the cross product of
29:00 - a vector with itself it's the same
29:02 - vector here so what are we going to get
29:03 - well we can just easily enough work it
29:05 - out we ignore the first two elements and
29:08 - we do 4 + 2 times minus 4 and minus 4
29:11 - times 2 so it's something minus itself
29:13 - that's just gonna give us a 0 obviously
29:15 - and let's keep going if we ignore the
29:19 - middle terms and do the rising diagonal
29:21 - minus the falling diagonal again threes
29:23 - and minus 4s
29:25 - the same product so something minus
29:27 - itself
29:28 - 0 and it's gonna be the same for the
29:30 - final element so the cross product of a
29:32 - vector with itself is always going to be
29:36 - the zero vector now it's important not
29:39 - to write that just as the scalar 0
29:42 - because it is a different object it's
29:45 - the vector 0 it's a set of in
29:46 - three-dimensional space three zeros
29:49 - that's what we get when we cross a
29:51 - vector with itself of course this is
29:56 - going to trivially satisfy our condition
29:59 - on the a dot C is equal to 0 and B dot C
30:03 - is equal to 0 that's clear and so I
30:06 - think that's a nice set of four examples
30:09 - done quite quickly there they're not too
30:10 - bad are they so that's the end of the
30:12 - video ok in this video we're going to
30:16 - look again at the cross product but this
30:17 - time we're going to ask about its
30:19 - geometric meaning and its properties and
30:22 - we come to manipulated ok so if some
30:26 - vector C is the cross product of two
30:28 - other vectors a and B we've already seen
30:31 - how to work that out but what we can
30:33 - reasonably now ask is what it does that
30:37 - vector C look like you know if we
30:40 - imagine a particular couple of vectors a
30:42 - and B there in space where is this back
30:46 - to see how is it related to them we know
30:50 - how to work it out but what's its
30:52 - relationship with them how should we
30:54 - think about it and that's what we're
30:57 - gonna we're gonna figure out now so we
30:59 - know that C is a vector so it has two
31:02 - properties it has its magnitude and
31:04 - direction let's think about the
31:05 - magnitude first what is the magnitude of
31:08 - C and how does that relate to a and B
31:11 - what is the length of that vector it's
31:13 - pretty simple the magnitude of C is the
31:16 - magnitude of a time's the magnitude of B
31:18 - times sine of the angle between a and B
31:23 - this is very similar to the dot product
31:25 - except with a sine instead of a course
31:28 - so there we are there's our two vectors
31:31 - a and B and an angle between them and
31:34 - from those magnitudes the lengths of
31:38 - those two vectors and the angle we can
31:39 - work out the magnitude of C note that if
31:42 - we cross a vector with itself the angle
31:44 - will be 0 and so the cross product will
31:46 - be 0
31:47 - just as we've already seen in our
31:49 - examples that was easy enough what about
31:52 - the direction of this new vector C how
31:55 - does that relate okay here's the thing
31:58 - the direction of C is perpendicular
32:01 - sorry for my writing there within
32:03 - writing C is perpendicular to both
32:07 - vectors a and B so it's at right angles
32:12 - to each of those vectors separately and
32:15 - simultaneously what does that look like
32:18 - well actually we can draw it in one of
32:20 - two ways one of which is right and one
32:22 - is wrong let's just do that so here's is
32:25 - I think to a here's I think to B if we
32:28 - draw C like that and make it clear with
32:30 - this little symbol that it's at right
32:32 - angles to those two vectors that would
32:34 - be perpendicular to them both how about
32:36 - this we could also draw it back to a
32:38 - draw back to be again and we could go in
32:40 - the opposite direction
32:42 - simply literally the opposite direction
32:44 - and that would also be perpendicular to
32:46 - these two vectors one of these is
32:49 - actually strictly the correct case and
32:51 - the other is wrong by essentially a
32:54 - minus a minus one multiple what's the
32:58 - way to work that out so let's let's now
33:00 - fear that out there's actually a rule to
33:02 - remember it by it's called the right
33:04 - hand screw rule so let's draw that out
33:08 - kind of really clearly one more time we
33:11 - have two vectors a and B and we are
33:16 - going to say that a cross B is equal to
33:19 - some vector C that's fine
33:22 - so what we do is we put on the line
33:25 - along which we know si must lie so this
33:29 - is the line that's perpendicular to both
33:31 - a and B and we simply have to ask
33:33 - ourselves in in this picture does the
33:37 - vector C go upwards or does it go
33:41 - downwards the trick is to write on the
33:44 - angle between a and B and give it a
33:47 - direction so that it's increasing from A
33:50 - to B it's the angle from A to B then you
33:53 - imagine taking your right hand and
33:55 - gripping that line in such a way that
33:59 - your fingers curl in the same direction
34:03 - as the angle increases and then your
34:05 - thumb points in the direction that the
34:09 - in the actual direction of C let's do
34:11 - another example just to really make that
34:15 - clear here's a and B again so we know we
34:19 - need to beat them I've drawn these lying
34:21 - in a plane so we are now trying to draw
34:23 - a line that's perpendicular to that
34:24 - plane vector C must lie in one direction
34:27 - or the other along this line what do we
34:30 - do we draw on the angle we now take our
34:32 - right hand and we imagine gripping that
34:35 - that line we've just drawn in such a way
34:38 - that our fingers curl in the direction
34:41 - in which the angle is increasing so it's
34:44 - like the anti-clockwise direction in
34:46 - this picture and that's and then our
34:48 - thumb points in the correct direction
34:50 - for that vector so it's in fact these
34:53 - are the two opposite cases so that's the
34:56 - rule that allows you to construct the
34:58 - correct direction for your vector
35:01 - geometric geometrically okay then let's
35:05 - just finally wrap up by thinking about
35:07 - the cross product and asking whether it
35:10 - has those properties that we looked at
35:12 - before for our vector addition the
35:15 - commutative property so for example is a
35:17 - cross B equal to B cross a it is not it
35:22 - is not equal to it unlike the top
35:24 - product unlike addition this one
35:27 - Ross product it matters the order and in
35:30 - fact it simply introduces a minus sign
35:33 - if you swap the order of a and B so it's
35:37 - not commutative it nearly is in the
35:39 - sense that it gives you something
35:40 - similar it gives you the same thing up
35:43 - to a minus sign it's important to
35:46 - remember you can just verify that by
35:48 - thinking about how we work out and be
35:50 - with those diagonal products now how
35:53 - about the associative property can we
35:55 - say that a cross B cross C where B and C
35:58 - have already been worked out it's the
36:00 - same as a cross B and then cross C what
36:04 - do we think is that going to work or not
36:06 - in fact it this is the associative
36:09 - property we might ask whether this is
36:13 - true and the answer is no again the
36:16 - cross product does not have this
36:18 - property so the order in which you do
36:21 - your cross product if you have doing the
36:23 - cross product of three vectors does
36:25 - matter we can easily convince ourselves
36:28 - of this just by looking at a
36:30 - particularly convenient example let's
36:33 - just use Cartesian vectors ijk so let's
36:37 - just remind ourselves where these guys
36:38 - lie they're perpendicular to each other
36:40 - I J and K just our unit vectors going in
36:44 - the x y&z direction so suppose we have
36:46 - this guy I cross I cross K if we try
36:49 - evaluating it this way around with the I
36:51 - cross K being worked out first well
36:54 - that's just going to give us in fact
36:57 - minus J which you can confirm with the
36:59 - right hand rule that we just introduced
37:01 - and then that in turn will give us K
37:04 - that's fine so we've worked out in that
37:07 - instance the answer is minus K now let's
37:09 - do it the other way around I cross I if
37:11 - we do that first that's just going to be
37:13 - 0 because I cross I is 0
37:16 - so it's game over already at that point
37:18 - so we can see two radically different
37:19 - answers here just depending on our order
37:22 - finally we could ask about the
37:23 - distributive property so are we allowed
37:26 - to multiply through using the cross
37:29 - product if we
37:32 - if the second object in our cross
37:33 - product is a sum of two vectors can we
37:36 - do this
37:36 - well this at last is something that we
37:41 - are going to be allowed to do it is the
37:42 - distributive property and the cross
37:47 - product operation the vector product
37:49 - does have this property we are allowed
37:52 - to do that but of course we must make
37:53 - sure to make to keep the order the same
37:57 - okay
37:58 - so I think that's everything for this
38:00 - video ok in this lecture we're going to
38:05 - be looking at something called the
38:07 - scalar triple product
38:13 - so what we're dealing with here is
38:15 - taking three vectors and combining them
38:18 - in a certain way in order to yield a
38:21 - single one scalar quantity so three
38:25 - vectors into one scalar scalar triple
38:28 - product suppose we have a we dot it with
38:32 - B which itself is crossed with C that is
38:36 - the scalar triple product of that
38:37 - combination now here I've put brackets
38:39 - to emphasize to do the cross product
38:41 - first but we can just write a dot B
38:46 - cross C without the brackets why because
38:49 - we have to do it in the correct order if
38:51 - we try to do a dot B first and then
38:55 - cross that with C it's a nonsense
38:57 - because that will be a scalar cross
39:00 - product it with a vector doesn't make
39:01 - sense
39:02 - all right then so let's do one we'll
39:04 - make up some vectors let's have a is
39:07 - equal to 3 1 minus 1 and B is equal to 2
39:13 - 0 4 and C is equal to minus 1 minus 2 3
39:21 - ok there are our vectors and let's go
39:24 - ahead and work it out so first we'll
39:26 - need to do the cross product B cross C
39:28 - so let's write that out so I'm bringing
39:30 - these down now remember you can work out
39:32 - the cross product by whatever your
39:34 - favorite method is I'm just going to do
39:37 - it in the method I introduced before
39:38 - which is we ignore the first elements
39:41 - and we do befalling diagonal here zero
39:43 - and subtract the rising diagonal minus 8
39:45 - that gives us the first element of 8
39:47 - then we ignore the middle elements and
39:50 - we do the rising diagonal gives us minus
39:52 - 4 subtract the falling diagonal which is
39:54 - 6 so that's going to give us a minus 10
39:58 - entry and then we ignore the third
40:01 - elements when we do the falling diagonal
40:03 - gives us a minus 4 and subtract 0 so
40:06 - that's going to be minus 4 that is our
40:09 - candidate for our cross product but it's
40:10 - always good to test how do we test a
40:12 - cross product we try dotting it with
40:14 - either of the input vectors and check we
40:17 - get 0 so here we'll get a 2 to 16 and 4
40:20 - minus 4 is minus 16 add it up that is 0
40:23 - and now we try the other combination
40:25 - here we're going to have minus 1 on 8
40:29 - minus 8 and then plus 20 and then minus
40:33 - 12 that does indeed add up to 0
40:37 - it's passed our checks those were just
40:39 - checks but it was good to do them and so
40:41 - we're now very happy that that is the
40:43 - correct cross product to finish the
40:44 - scalar triple product we now just need
40:47 - to dot that with a so let's write it out
40:50 - again
40:50 - I understand minus 4 and do the dot
40:54 - product that's 24 minus 10 plus 4 is
40:59 - going to be 18 that's the answer that's
41:01 - our scalar triple product it could have
41:04 - been a positive number a negative number
41:05 - could have been 0 in this case it's 18
41:07 - now let's do another one so I'll erase
41:11 - this but we'll simply use the same the
41:15 - same three vectors but we'll do them in
41:18 - a different order as our second example
41:21 - so let's do B dotted with C cross a so
41:27 - of course we have to start by doing that
41:29 - C cross a combination first so let me
41:33 - write that down quickly - 1 - 2 3
41:37 - crossed with 3 1 - 1 so we start with
41:43 - the falling diagonal that's gonna be 2
41:46 - and then we subtract 3 that's minus 1
41:48 - and then we have a rising diagonal
41:50 - that's gonna be 9 and subtract 1 that's
41:53 - 8 and then we have a falling diagonal
41:56 - minus 1 and subtract minus 6 so that's
41:59 - going to be 5 in oh ok
42:04 - did I get that cross product correct or
42:06 - not do the dot product test minus 3 is
42:10 - minus 3 8 minus 5 that one's passed
42:14 - let's try this dot product combination
42:16 - as a second check double check 1 minus
42:19 - 16 plus 15 that's also going to come out
42:23 - at 0 so it's passed both of my checks
42:26 - that one is 0 as well we're happy that
42:28 - this is indeed the cross product at C
42:31 - cross a we now need to complete it so
42:33 - what we're doing is um B
42:36 - which was 2:04 dotted with what we found
42:40 - cross product minus one eight five so
42:44 - again go ahead and evaluate this minus
42:46 - two zero and 20 18 again alright so our
42:51 - second example has also given us 18 does
42:55 - this map mean that it doesn't matter in
42:56 - which order we do the elements of the
42:59 - scalar triple product let me just write
43:03 - down the answer to that and then we'll
43:05 - look at it it turns out that for any
43:07 - vectors a B and C then a dot B cross C
43:09 - is equal to B dot C cross a these were
43:14 - the two cases we looked at and it's also
43:16 - equal in fact to C dot a cross B this
43:23 - will always be true in this case it was
43:25 - equal to 18 but these three things would
43:28 - always be equal there are three other
43:29 - combinations we could write down in
43:31 - principle there are three other ways to
43:33 - combine a B and C we could have a dot C
43:36 - cross B or we can have B dot a cross C
43:43 - or we could have C dot B cross a now it
43:48 - turns out that those things are easy to
43:51 - see what their will be because let's
43:53 - just look at the difference from the
43:54 - ones above I've just swapped the order
43:57 - of the cross product and we know that
44:00 - when we Europe's we know that when we
44:02 - swap the order of a cross product we
44:05 - introduce a minus sign so if the top
44:07 - three cases were equal to 18 the bottom
44:10 - three cases must be equal to each other
44:12 - and equal to minus 18 and in general
44:16 - this is the same rule for all scalar
44:20 - triple product you know three of them
44:21 - are equal and three of them are equal to
44:24 - one another but equal to the minus of
44:26 - the first three so to speak and and how
44:28 - can you tell which ones are equal it's
44:30 - helpful to write out this little cycle a
44:32 - B and C written in a circle like this if
44:36 - we are going around in a clockwise
44:38 - direction here B dot C cross a but
44:42 - that's clockwise around our wheel then
44:45 - and here's another one that's got my C
44:48 - dot a cross B those guys all belong
44:51 - together so the guys that are in the
44:53 - clockwise direction all belong together
44:54 - and the anti-clockwise guys they belong
44:57 - together and they're the minus of one
44:59 - another these two groups all right so
45:02 - that's that's I think all we need to do
45:06 - as practice for doing the scalar triple
45:09 - product and knowing what we ought to get
45:11 - let's think about something else I'm
45:13 - going to introduce you to something
45:15 - called the parallelepiped
45:17 - that's why I should say I'm not sure how
45:19 - to pronounce it parallelepiped anyway
45:21 - this guy is a three-dimensional shape
45:23 - but first I'm going to remind you of
45:25 - what a parallelogram looks like so
45:28 - here's a rectangle and here's a
45:30 - parallelogram that we get if we have the
45:35 - pairs of the sides are parallel to each
45:37 - other but they are not a right angle at
45:40 - right angles around the vertex now
45:42 - consider this rectangular box and let's
45:46 - tidy up there we are and consider what
45:49 - happens if we build it out of edges that
45:54 - are in groups of parallel edges but are
45:56 - not all at right angles to each other so
45:59 - let's see if I can draw this reasonably
46:02 - realistically as a three-dimensional
46:04 - object so I'm going to draw this and I'm
46:08 - going to stress which edges are parallel
46:10 - to each other all right here we are okay
46:14 - let me change color so consider these
46:16 - four edges of the object are all
46:20 - parallel to each other in exactly the
46:22 - same way that in our simple
46:23 - parallelogram these opposing edges were
46:26 - parallel and then these four edges are
46:29 - all parallel to one another again in our
46:32 - 3d shape just as these two edges are
46:34 - parallel and then we have another set
46:37 - these four edges here in yellow are also
46:40 - going to be parallel to one another
46:42 - that object is a particular
46:45 - three-dimensional solid it's really a
46:47 - generalization of the of the box in that
46:51 - we're allowing ourselves to have
46:54 - slanting edges if we want to now let's
46:56 - introduce three vectors a B and C to
46:58 - represent these three kinds of edges you
47:00 - see that all the green edges are the
47:02 - same vector a and so on what happens if
47:05 - we do a dot B cross C that it turns out
47:11 - the magnitude of that if we drop the
47:13 - sign then the magnitude is just the
47:15 - volume of this shape so it contains of
47:19 - course the simple case of a rectangular
47:22 - box as a special case but this will work
47:24 - for any parallel parallelepiped that we
47:29 - care to think of although three vectors
47:31 - can always be combined with the scalar
47:33 - triple product to give us the volume and
47:36 - that's the end of the video welcome to
47:40 - the third arm topic in this video series
47:43 - where I'll be introducing the matrix and
47:47 - thinking about what is a matrix product
47:50 - alright
47:52 - so essentially a matrix is nothing more
47:55 - than a grid of numbers simply a grid of
47:59 - numbers that could be positive or
48:01 - negative or fractional or zeroes and
48:04 - when we specify the shape of our grid of
48:09 - numbers or we do so simply by stating
48:11 - how many rows we have and how many
48:15 - columns so we're gonna hear about rows
48:18 - and columns a lot in this video in this
48:22 - video course I'm going to use a
48:24 - particular way of writing a matrix as a
48:28 - symbol and I need to do that I'm going
48:31 - to just use a capital letter
48:34 - and I'm going to the letter is going to
48:38 - be double underlined I'll double
48:41 - underline that simple so here we go
48:43 - a underlined aligned that means the
48:46 - matrix a and how would we write it so
48:50 - that's just like this essentially a grid
48:53 - of numbers and we put it in curvy
48:56 - brackets just to give us some structure
48:57 - so this is three rows two columns that
48:59 - one here's a matrix B let's make it a
49:02 - square matrix let's put in a fraction to
49:05 - show we can -10 0 okay so there are two
49:09 - different examples of a matrix easy
49:11 - enough but it gets more interesting when
49:14 - we try and combine them so I want to
49:16 - talk about matrix multiplication
49:21 - addition is simple and it's just a
49:23 - element by element addition but
49:25 - multiplication is not so simple so
49:30 - here's how we write it the
49:32 - multiplication of matrix a by matrix B
49:35 - is simply written like this a b and it
49:38 - gives us some new matrix c which may be
49:40 - a different shape from both a and b as
49:43 - we'll see let's give ourselves a couple
49:45 - of examples 3 0 minus 1 2 3 4 a matrix B
49:52 - can be just 1 2 0 minus 3 so there are
49:57 - our two matrices here I've chosen them
50:00 - such that a B that multiplication will
50:03 - work it will exist but actually if we
50:05 - try it the other way around it will turn
50:08 - out that the multiplication the multiple
50:10 - of those two matrices doesn't even exist
50:12 - it's not a well-defined thing so this is
50:15 - an extreme case of an operation not
50:18 - being reversible in its order in other
50:20 - words matrix multiplication is not
50:23 - commutative
50:25 - okay so let's just erase that and go
50:31 - ahead and see how the multiplication
50:34 - actually works the trick is to multiply
50:37 - the each row of matrix in the first
50:42 - matrix by each entire column of matrix B
50:49 - what does that mean well let's write out
50:51 - our example 3 to 0 3 minus 4 minus 1
50:55 - minus 1 4 1 0 2 minus 3 now I know that
51:02 - this guy is going to have 3 rows and 2
51:05 - columns the output matrix you'll see why
51:07 - in a bit I'll just put these blanks in
51:09 - for now the question is how to work out
51:12 - each of these numbers let's choose this
51:14 - one first okay now notice this guy's
51:17 - address if you like is Row 1 column 1 of
51:20 - the output matrix C I'm going to need to
51:24 - in order to work this guy out I'll need
51:26 - to look at the whole of Row 1 in the
51:31 - first matrix in matrix a and the whole
51:34 - of column 1 in the matrix B I'll need to
51:38 - combine those guys and how do I get
51:40 - combine them I just multiply element by
51:43 - element as I go along the row and down
51:45 - the column so 3 times 1 just gives me 3
51:49 - and then I add on the next combination 2
51:52 - times 2 is 4 so 3 plus 4 is gonna give
51:56 - me 7 that's how I combine those two I'll
51:59 - jump back here and I'll they raised
52:02 - there and I'll just put in my 7 all
52:07 - right so that's the the general way it
52:09 - works let's go ahead and do the other
52:10 - elements of our matrix C let's do this
52:14 - one notice this is still Row 1 so I want
52:17 - that first row it's now column 2 that's
52:19 - its address all at the second column 3
52:22 - times 0 and 2 times -3 is how I'll work
52:26 - that out and that's just going
52:27 - be minus six so let me jump backwards
52:29 - and arrays my blank symbol and write in
52:34 - -6 okay maybe I went a bit fast let me
52:37 - spell this one out more explicitly okay
52:40 - so here I now have Row 2 column 1 that's
52:44 - the address of that guy I want all of
52:46 - Row 2 and all of column 1 when I look at
52:49 - those guys and I want to multiply along
52:51 - so 0 times 1 and 3 times 2 that's gonna
52:55 - give us just 6 in total when we add them
52:58 - up so let me erase and put in 6 and now
53:02 - this element that's row 2 column 2 so I
53:05 - want all of Row 2 1 all of column 2 I
53:08 - multiply 0 times 0 and 3 times minus 3
53:13 - is minus 9 so that's going to be a minus
53:16 - 9 if I go backwards and just put in
53:18 - minus 9 here now we're finally on to the
53:21 - final third row so we're going to want
53:24 - the third row of a and in this case the
53:26 - first column that's 1 times minus 1 and
53:29 - 4 times 2 is 8 that's gonna be 7 minus 1
53:33 - plus 8 and it finally last row last
53:35 - column 4 times minus 3 is 12 and a 0
53:39 - minus 12
53:41 - all right so there we are that is our
53:45 - matrix product C formed by combining
53:47 - each row in each column it's quite a lot
53:49 - of work and it would be even more if we
53:51 - had bigger matrices but we said that we
53:55 - get something quite different if we try
53:56 - multiplying a and B in the other order
53:59 - so let's go ahead and do that now what
54:02 - if we have 1 0 2 minus 3 that's B 1 2 3
54:06 - 2 0 3 minus 4 so we can try it we try it
54:12 - and multiply Row one by column 1 and we
54:15 - immediately find that we cannot because
54:17 - they are a different length a different
54:19 - list so there is no third element of our
54:22 - row to multiply with our third element
54:25 - of the column just pause the video here
54:27 - and have a look at that and see why that
54:30 - must be impossible for us and so
54:33 - sometimes matrix multiplication is
54:35 - impossible all right let's look at a few
54:39 - little further examples and you may want
54:41 - to pause the video to convince yourself
54:43 - in each case is true is this thing
54:45 - possible for example pause it and think
54:47 - this one is not possible this is not
54:51 - possible again because there are two
54:53 - elements in say the first row of a and
54:56 - three elements in the column single
54:58 - column of B there's no way to do that as
55:01 - a series of element by element products
55:03 - how about this we just have this row
55:06 - matrix and this column matrix can we do
55:08 - that
55:11 - yes this one is perfectly possible
55:13 - actually it just produces a single
55:15 - number in fact it's a bit like it like a
55:19 - a dot product it's the whole of row one
55:24 - times which is the entire matrix and
55:27 - then the whole whole of column one in B
55:30 - this thing is called a row matrix and
55:32 - this other guy is called a column matrix
55:34 - for obvious reasons okay how about this
55:39 - let's have a look at this one what if I
55:41 - swap the order of my row and column I
55:43 - just swap them around can I do that is
55:45 - that going to produce a legitimate
55:47 - matrix actually yes it will this time
55:51 - swapping our two matrices a and B around
55:54 - has produced something which exists it's
55:57 - actually a huge matrix is 3 by 3 it must
56:00 - have three rows and three columns
56:01 - because a has three rows and B has three
56:04 - columns how is it work let's look at
56:05 - that guy for example it's just simply
56:07 - the number there which is Row one is
56:09 - just a number and column two is just a
56:12 - number a single number so we just do
56:14 - that product there's no problem pause
56:15 - the video if it's confusing all right so
56:19 - again the point here is that a times B
56:22 - is generally not equal to B times a even
56:26 - if they both exist they may not be the
56:28 - same they may not even be the same shape
56:30 - however we can go on and ask about the
56:32 - other kinds of properties of the matrix
56:35 - product operation a onto B times C is
56:38 - that the same as a times B onto C does
56:41 - the order matter actually it is the same
56:43 - it does work in other words we have the
56:46 - associative property how about a into B
56:48 - plus C sum of two matrices yes we can
56:51 - have a onto B plus a onto C that is
56:54 - therefore the distributive property
56:58 - matrix multiplication does satisfy those
57:00 - things it's just not commutative okay
57:03 - let me make a bit more room up here in
57:06 - the top of the screen
57:08 - and but one final puzzle up suppose I
57:10 - have this to Row three column matrix and
57:13 - then a mystery matrix M and then I have
57:16 - a simple column matrix of two rows and
57:18 - I'm asking what shape should matrix M be
57:22 - or is it even is it is it possible pause
57:24 - and think about that and in fact it's
57:29 - just a column matrix of three elements
57:31 - you may want to just meditate on that
57:34 - and see that it's correct okay that's
57:36 - the end of this video okay welcome to
57:39 - this video in this one we're going to
57:40 - take a look at how to work out our
57:43 - determinant what is it how can you find
57:46 - determinants of various sizes so a
57:48 - determinant is a scaler it's just a
57:52 - number could be positive could be
57:53 - negative could be zero and it's derived
57:56 - from a square matrix a single number
57:59 - derived from an entire matrix now the
58:04 - determinant of M would be written with M
58:08 - with the modular signs either side of it
58:10 - even though it can be a negative number
58:12 - so here's an example of M and here is
58:15 - how we would write the determinant of M
58:17 - note that we don't bother writing
58:19 - squares straight sides and curved
58:22 - brackets as well there's no point in
58:24 - that it's just enough to have the
58:26 - straight-line sides so let's start with
58:29 - the definition of a 2 by 2 determinant
58:36 - that's the easy case to look at so let's
58:38 - write out a general 2 by 2 just using
58:41 - symbols will have a B C D written inside
58:45 - our straight line sides indicates a
58:47 - determinant it's simply ad minus BC okay
58:52 - so that's the falling diagonal the
58:54 - leading diagonal is also called minus
58:56 - the rising diagonal multiplied together
58:59 - very simple very simple and that is how
59:03 - you can just look at and evaluate a 2 by
59:06 - 2 determinant so for our example one two
59:09 - three four one times four is four
59:11 - subtract off a two times three is six
59:14 - and so that's going to give us minus two
59:18 - is the determinant
59:22 - ok so a 3 by 3 determinant is going to
59:27 - be a bit more work what we do is and we
59:30 - have a 3 by 3 determinant we evaluate it
59:33 - by breaking it up into a number up to
59:38 - three smaller determinants each of which
59:41 - is a 2x2 and for that we have our
59:43 - definition for immediate evaluation so
59:46 - we break up
59:47 - bigger determinants into little ones and
59:49 - then evaluate them I'm going to write
59:51 - out something here that's like a
59:52 - chessboard but instead of black and
59:54 - white
59:55 - I have pluses and minuses you'll see why
59:57 - in a moment the thing to notice though
59:59 - is that we alternate plus minus plus
60:01 - minus along each row and each column in
60:04 - this 3x3 grid ok so now let's work out a
60:09 - 3 by 3 determinant again I will just use
60:13 - general symbols a b c d e f g h i right
60:20 - now first I have to choose a row or a
60:23 - column I'm going to choose this top row
60:25 - for the first example and I'm gonna work
60:28 - along this row and I'm gonna start with
60:30 - the a symbol now I go and I look on my
60:34 - chart and I see that there's a plus sign
60:35 - in that in that slot of my grid that
60:39 - means I put down plus a and now what I
60:42 - do is I ignore the whole row and the
60:45 - whole column that a is in and I look at
60:48 - the remaining four numbers and I write a
60:51 - little determinant just made out of
60:53 - those guys in the same order they appear
60:55 - so EF is going to be in my main
61:00 - determinant there and H I those are the
61:02 - remaining four guys in the same order
61:05 - they appear now be the next term that
61:07 - has a minus sign according to my chart
61:10 - so I will put in minus B and multiply it
61:14 - by again are smaller two-by-two
61:16 - determinant the one I get if I delete
61:18 - the row and the column would be in it
61:20 - and look at the remaining guys
61:22 - D F G I and I just I just write those
61:28 - guys out in the same order they appear
61:30 - as a small two-by-two determinant
61:33 - finally there see
61:35 - see appears with a plus sign according
61:37 - to my chart so I need to put down plus C
61:41 - and I need to multiply by well we delete
61:46 - the row and column with C in it and we
61:49 - just see the remaining determinant D E G
61:54 - H so I simply imagine that that row and
61:58 - column was not there and then that's
62:01 - what the determine becomes and then of
62:04 - course those 2 by 2 determinants I can
62:06 - just write down what they are using my
62:09 - rule of multiplying down the diagonal
62:12 - and up subtracting the anti diagonal ok
62:17 - there we are
62:18 - so that is in general what a 3 by 3
62:21 - determinant evaluates to but it's not
62:24 - the only way to do it let's write it out
62:26 - again and this time choose let's choose
62:29 - a column and a different one let's
62:31 - choose this column I'm also allowed to
62:33 - work down this so I would start with B
62:36 - as my first term and I delete the row
62:38 - and column with it in and I'd see what
62:40 - are the remaining terms and write them D
62:44 - F G I except I've forgotten something
62:49 - there's a minus sign attached to that
62:51 - particular entry so that should actually
62:53 - have been minus B all right and then
62:57 - similarly plus E and I delete the row
63:00 - and column which has unit and then I
63:04 - just make a 2 by 2 determinant from in
63:06 - this case would be the corner elements
63:08 - AC g I and I'd finally minus H and
63:13 - either own column with H in it make a 2
63:17 - by 2 determinant determinant of what's
63:19 - left AC DF ok and of course I could then
63:26 - write out these 2 by 2 determinants
63:28 - explicitly but the point is it will get
63:31 - give me the same answer let's do an
63:33 - example and see why we would choose one
63:35 - method or the other so here just some
63:38 - random numbers I'm making up let's stick
63:39 - then n is 3 by 3
63:41 - first off let's work along the top row
63:43 - and as what as we did in our first it
63:47 - that's going to be three let's put in
63:50 - the full determinant here and then minus
63:53 - one and again the determinant I get by
63:55 - excluding the top row and middle column
63:57 - and then plus two that's going to be 7 0
64:02 - 5 minus 1 and I can go ahead and I can
64:06 - work out explicitly what this comes out
64:09 - at as you can see I'm doing here and in
64:12 - fact it will be 12 plus 20 minus 14 and
64:16 - it comes out as 18 so there we are we've
64:18 - worked out a 3x3 but we could have done
64:21 - it in a different way let's say we went
64:23 - along this bottom row that's fine so
64:26 - then it will be 5 and I will be left
64:29 - with 1/2 0 4 for my mini terminal and
64:32 - the next element alone a minus sign and
64:34 - it was a minus number anyway
64:36 - minus minus 1 there's going to be 3 - 7
64:39 - 4 that's just to see how we've done that
64:42 - 3 2 7 4 by deleting the bottom row and
64:45 - middle column of that now what about the
64:48 - third element here well we actually have
64:51 - a 0 plus 0 times some determinant I
64:54 - don't even care what that is because
64:56 - it's been multiplied by 0 that's the
64:58 - beauty of it so I've got 5 into 4 minus
65:00 - 0 and then we're going to have 4 3 to 12
65:04 - - 14 that's going to give us 20 minus 2
65:07 - is 18 same answer as before
65:10 - ok what about if we have even bigger
65:14 - determinants than our 3x3 example that
65:16 - if we have if we go bigger still we for
65:20 - example a 4x4 we're just going to break
65:23 - it up into a number of three by threes
65:25 - and each of those would have to be
65:27 - broken up into two by twos lots of work
65:29 - so here we are here's a general 4x4 we
65:33 - are going to expand it along a row or
65:37 - column let's say we want to expand it
65:39 - along this row for example and we'll
65:42 - take in turn ABCD and we'll need to know
65:45 - what sign to use so here's our
65:47 - checkerboard or a chessboard pattern of
65:49 - pluses and minuses
65:50 - just extend it out now to a four by four
65:53 - and you can see the rule here is that if
65:56 - you like if the row number plus the
65:57 - column number is an Eve
66:00 - number then there's gonna be a plus sign
66:02 - and if it's odd it's gonna be a minus
66:04 - sign you can confirm that for yourself
66:06 - look at this one it's gonna be at row
66:08 - two and column three and that's five and
66:11 - so that's a minus
66:12 - that's one way to remember it or just
66:14 - draw it out anyway we're going to use
66:16 - that rule so we go ahead and we write
66:18 - plus a and now we need to do the entire
66:21 - 3 by 3 determinant that we get when we
66:24 - delete the row and column with a unit so
66:27 - we just write out that little square
66:29 - block that we see it's quite easy to
66:31 - copy across and now we're gonna have
66:33 - minus B and we need to delete the row
66:36 - and column and then transcribe across
66:39 - the elements that are left as a three by
66:41 - three just being careful not to make any
66:43 - slips and you see that we're gonna
66:48 - continue to so let's delete this just be
66:50 - completely explicit I'll finish the job
66:52 - off so I think I hope it's obvious what
66:54 - we're doing we aren't a + C and now
66:57 - we're going to just have EF h i j l and
67:02 - m n p and then finally minus d on to
67:09 - what we get if we delete the top row and
67:11 - rightmost column which is left over then
67:14 - EF g IJ k and oh there we are that's how
67:19 - we handle a four by four each of these
67:21 - three by threes would then have to be
67:22 - evaluated and so on so a lot of work and
67:25 - that's the end of the video okay welcome
67:28 - to this fifth topic which is eigenvalues
67:30 - and eigenvectors will introduce the
67:33 - problem and we'll see how to find
67:35 - eigenvalues finding eigenvectors is for
67:38 - the next video so suppose that we are
67:40 - given a square matrix
67:46 - just some matrix but we are told that M
67:51 - multiplied by V is equal to lambda
67:53 - multiplied by V for some scalar just
67:57 - some number lambda and for some column
68:02 - matrix V and a column matrix of course
68:07 - the same as a vector
68:08 - I will just say vector from now on okay
68:12 - so this scalar lambda could be positive
68:14 - negative or zero meanwhile this vector V
68:17 - could be anything except the trivial
68:21 - boring case of just zeros it's something
68:24 - other than that our challenge then is
68:26 - that we're going to be given a square
68:27 - matrix N and we have to look for any
68:30 - scalar lambda and vector V that
68:33 - satisfies the equation and such a scalar
68:36 - is called an eigenvalue and such a
68:38 - vector is called an eigenvector so in
68:41 - that language M multiplied by some
68:44 - eigenvector gives us back that
68:46 - eigenvector just multiplied by a scalar
68:49 - the eigenvalue okay so first off let's
68:53 - notice that if we are given a candidate
68:57 - our possible eigen vector V to try
69:00 - perhaps for a multiple choice then it's
69:02 - easy to test we'll just go ahead and try
69:05 - it so here's a square matrix a 2 by 2 2
69:08 - 4 1 minus 1 and suppose we write down V
69:14 - is equal to 1 minus 1 and this is
69:19 - suggested as a possible eigenvector well
69:23 - then we would just test it out to see if
69:26 - it matches our equation we try
69:29 - multiplying M by V so here we go 2 4 1
69:32 - minus 1 and V is 1 minus 1 it's a column
69:36 - and so we do Rho times column that's 2
69:39 - and minus 4 is minus 2
69:41 - again row and column that's gonna be one
69:44 - plus one is two and we notice we can
69:47 - take out minus 2 as a factor and then it
69:49 - will be the vector at left is one minus
69:52 - one but it is just V so minus 2 is
69:54 - indeed a scalar that multiplies V and
69:58 - we've succeeded in proving that V is our
70:01 - eigenvector and our eigen value that
70:03 - goes with it
70:03 - is minus 2 okay so that's great if we're
70:07 - given I can vectors to check out but
70:09 - what if we're not given any eigen
70:11 - vectors or eigen values then we must
70:14 - find any possible eigen values for
70:16 - ourselves there could be more than one
70:17 - and for each we must find the
70:20 - corresponding eigen vector V and in this
70:24 - first video we're just going to be
70:26 - finding those eigen values ok so here's
70:29 - a little bit of quick manipulation and
70:32 - aside we know that our equation is MV is
70:34 - equal to lambda V I can certainly just
70:37 - bring it all to the left hand side and
70:38 - write MV minus lambda V is equal to 0
70:42 - sometimes I don't want to write that as
70:43 - vector 0 but now let's do something
70:45 - interesting let's insert the identity
70:48 - matrix which won't change the equation
70:50 - but it will be important for the next
70:52 - step and the minus lambda times the
70:56 - identity times V is equal to vector 0
71:03 - the identity doesn't change the equation
71:04 - but now I can factor out both those two
71:07 - matrices the M and the minus lambda
71:10 - times the identity that's a matrix I can
71:13 - factor those out and it allows me to
71:14 - write that in line now that if form of
71:17 - the equation it turns out this can only
71:20 - be solved for any interesting V any the
71:23 - other than just zeros if the following
71:27 - equation is true which we can easily
71:29 - prove but we're not going to prove in
71:31 - this video M minus lambda times the
71:34 - identity the determinant of that is
71:36 - equal to 0 so we're gonna have plenty of
71:38 - time to think about that but let me just
71:39 - put a green box around it because that
71:43 - is the fundamental equation we're going
71:45 - to use this will allow
71:49 - to find all the eigen values that
71:54 - satisfy our basic eigenvalue equation so
71:58 - let's do an example it's the best thing
72:00 - let's do em as a 2 4 this was one we had
72:03 - before - 4 - one little square matrix
72:06 - and so let's write down what this lands
72:09 - at times the identity is for a 2 by 2
72:11 - it's going to be lambda 0 0 lambda very
72:14 - simple and so this matrix that's the
72:16 - difference of the two of them 2 minus
72:18 - lambda 4 1 minus 1 minus lambda just the
72:22 - difference of those two things as a
72:24 - determinant is equal to 0 that's all so
72:28 - there we have it we've just subtracted
72:30 - lambda off the down the diagonal but now
72:33 - we need solve this so we just write out
72:34 - the determinant 2 minus lambda x minus 1
72:37 - minus lambda down the diagonal minus 4
72:39 - the off diagonal is equal to 0 all right
72:43 - so we expand this out
72:48 - plus lambda squared minus four equals
72:51 - zero
72:52 - let's come over here for a bit more
72:54 - space tidy that up a bit
72:56 - what if we got lambda squared minus
72:59 - lambda minus six is equal to zero can we
73:05 - solve this actually it's quite easy to
73:06 - factor that's going to be lambda minus 3
73:12 - into lambda plus 2 is equal to 0 so
73:16 - that's true if either lambda is equal to
73:19 - 3 or it's equal to minus 2 and those are
73:23 - our two eigenvalues we found them using
73:27 - that equation in the square box let's
73:30 - crack on and do one with a 3x3 matrix M
73:37 - here we go
73:39 - matrix M is equal to let's have -2 1 3 1
73:43 - minus 1 0 and minus 1 1 2 I've worked
73:47 - that while I checked that before and it
73:49 - will work for us nicely now let's
73:52 - remember of course the rule from the
73:55 - previous screen and we just need to
73:58 - apply that so let's go ahead and write
74:01 - it
74:05 - right our determinant out we need to
74:07 - have minus two minus lambda and then
74:10 - just 1 and minus 1 and then 1 minus 1
74:13 - minus lambda and 3 0 to minus lambda I'm
74:19 - just subtracting lambdas down the
74:21 - diagonal making it a determinant setting
74:23 - equal to 0 now I'm gonna work along this
74:26 - row because it's got a zero in it so
74:27 - that makes me like it a bit more as a
74:29 - determinant the first number is gonna be
74:32 - minus 1 why because it's a 1 and let me
74:35 - just quickly write out our little lookup
74:36 - table of pluses and minuses for doing
74:38 - determinants so it was a 1 and then it
74:41 - picked up a minus sign and then we have
74:43 - the mini determinant that's made out of
74:45 - those four terms so that's 1 3 1 & 2
74:49 - minus lambda all right and then the next
74:53 - term is gonna be plus and then it's
74:55 - gonna be the term itself is minus 1
74:57 - minus lambda and the mini determinant
75:00 - that we get when we exclude that row and
75:03 - that column is just made out of the
75:05 - corner terms that's gonna be minus 2
75:08 - minus lambda and 3 & 1 & 2 minus lambda
75:13 - and that's it because the zero term
75:17 - gives us nothing
75:17 - so there's only those two mini
75:19 - determinants let's write them out minus
75:21 - 1/2 times and then 3 times 1 is 3 expand
75:25 - that one out then this one has the term
75:28 - in front minus of 1 plus lambda and then
75:31 - we have to expand out the determinant
75:32 - minus 2 minus lambda times 2 minus
75:37 - lambda down the lead diagonal minus
75:39 - minus 3 is plus 3 there we are
75:41 - is equal to 0 and then we just need to
75:43 - tidy that up we need to clean it up a
75:45 - bit that's going to be minus of minus
75:48 - lambda minus 1 for the first term let's
75:51 - turn that it one into pluses multiply it
75:53 - through by the minus 1 and here we have
75:55 - minus let's make that lambda plus 1
75:57 - write it that way around and then tidy
75:59 - up inside here we expand it out minus 4
76:02 - plus 2 lambda minus 2 lambda
76:06 - plus lambda squared and this three is
76:08 - equal to zero need to keep on working to
76:11 - tidy that a bit more this term here is
76:12 - in fact going to be just I see the
76:14 - lambdas cancel out lambda squared minus
76:17 - one that's very nice that's come down
76:18 - very very neatly so now we can really
76:21 - tie to that up and we can take out a
76:23 - common factor of lambda plus one and the
76:26 - first term was just that so there's one
76:28 - for that and the second term we've just
76:30 - found is lambda squared minus one pause
76:34 - the video and check you agree that
76:35 - that's tied it up version of the
76:37 - equation now the way that can be 0 is
76:39 - either the first term is 0 which
76:41 - requires lambda is equal to minus one so
76:43 - there's one eigenvalue for us that's one
76:45 - option one of our eigen values has been
76:48 - found or the second term here has to be
76:52 - 0 so let's do a bit more work with that
76:54 - what we're saying is to neaten that up
76:56 - we're saying that two minus lambda
77:00 - squared is equal to 0 in other words
77:03 - lambda squared is equal to 2 and so
77:06 - lambda is going to be plus or minus
77:09 - square root of 2 that's two more eigen
77:12 - values three in all that we found for
77:15 - this three by three matrix and in the
77:18 - next video we'll see how to take each of
77:21 - these values and derive the
77:23 - corresponding vector this is the second
77:26 - of two videos that looks at eigenvalues
77:29 - and eigenvectors in the first video we
77:35 - have seen how to find eigenvalues and we
77:39 - write this as lambda for each lambda how
77:42 - do we find the eigenvector an
77:46 - eigenvector that goes with it
77:50 - we know that our fundamental equation
77:53 - that we're working with here is that
77:55 - when matrix M multiplies an eigen vector
77:58 - V it just gives us back that V scaled by
78:01 - lambda and another way to write that is
78:04 - the M minus lambda times the identity
78:06 - multiplied by V is equal to vector zero
78:09 - this is the same equation written two
78:11 - different ways what we need to know now
78:14 - that we have obtained our lambda values
78:17 - we just need to look at one of these
78:19 - equations and figure out an acceptable
78:22 - vector I find that it's more useful to
78:25 - use the form on the right hand side okay
78:29 - let's look at a particular example we'll
78:32 - have the matrix 2 4 1 minus 1 we looked
78:36 - at this before and we found already that
78:38 - its eigenvalues are equal to 3 and minus
78:43 - 2 what we're going to do now is we're
78:48 - going to take those values one at a time
78:50 - and figure out an acceptable eigenvector
78:53 - we're going to write our vector that we
78:56 - need to find as just X and y where we
78:59 - need to find these XY values now take a
79:03 - look at this green underlined equation
79:05 - and in particular the matrix which is a
79:07 - difference of two different matrices m
79:10 - and lambda times the identity now that
79:13 - we have our lambda value of 3 we could
79:16 - write out that difference that
79:17 - difference matrix it's going to be 2
79:20 - minus 3 and then just 4 and then just 1
79:25 - and minus 1 minus 3 there it is we're
79:28 - saying that when that multiplies our
79:29 - vector X Y it gives us 0 0 so let's go
79:35 - ahead and clean this equation up we have
79:37 - minus 1/4 1 minus 4 onto x and y it
79:43 - ought to be explicit about that we can
79:44 - multiply out it means minus X plus 4 y
79:47 - and X minus 4y and that we know is equal
79:52 - to 0-0 now what we immediately notice
79:56 - here is that whilst this this equation
79:59 - between two columns two column vectors
80:02 - is telling us two things it's actually
80:04 - telling us the same equation twice so we
80:07 - can see here that we're saying minus X
80:10 - plus 4y is equal to 0 we're also saying
80:13 - that X minus 4y is equal to 0 that's
80:17 - telling us the same thing is that a
80:19 - problem no that's exactly what we want
80:22 - to see at this stage we should find that
80:25 - when we work on eigenvalue and
80:28 - eigenvector problems based on a 2 by 2
80:30 - matrix then really only one of these
80:33 - rows in the final expression constrains
80:36 - us and the other one doesn't add any new
80:39 - constraint so this is exactly what we
80:41 - want so now how do we go ahead and solve
80:44 - it we're saying that minus x plus 4y is
80:48 - equal to 0 of course we can just
80:51 - rearrange this to say instead that 4y is
80:56 - equal to X not the only constraint we
80:58 - have what we're allowed to do is choose
81:01 - we can choose the simplest values of x
81:09 - and y that will make this work so I'm
81:13 - going to choose Y is equal to 1 and then
81:15 - I'll find that X is equal to 4 and that
81:18 - is a perfectly acceptable eigenvector
81:22 - for one to go with my eigen value
81:26 - we will always have this freedom in
81:29 - choosing the elements of our eigenvector
81:32 - really this freedom simply corresponds
81:34 - to choosing how long the eigenvector is
81:37 - in other words its magnitude because if
81:40 - a particular eigen vector and eigen
81:42 - vector satisfies our equations a scaled
81:46 - version of that same eigenvector will
81:48 - still satisfy with the same eigenvalue
81:52 - now while the eigenvector can have any
81:55 - length we might specifically have been
81:58 - asked for a normalized eigen vector that
82:01 - simply means we need to take the one
82:04 - that we found and scale it to have unit
82:07 - length so in this case since it's for
82:10 - one we need to divide by root 17 to
82:15 - scale to unit length simple as that so
82:19 - there we are
82:20 - that's our eigen vector and a normalized
82:22 - version of it now we still haven't found
82:26 - the eigenvector for the other eigen
82:27 - value which is minus 2 let me just move
82:31 - this off on the screen to make space to
82:33 - do that at the bottom so here we go we
82:36 - do exactly the same procedure we
82:37 - subtract -2 on the diagonal 2 minus
82:40 - minus 2 and 4 and 1 minus 1 minus minus
82:43 - 2 lots of minus is there so let's tidy
82:47 - that up that's going to be 4 4 1 and in
82:53 - fact
82:54 - and then times X Y is equal to 0-0 as
82:58 - before we see that really these this is
83:02 - the same equation twice there's only one
83:03 - constraint and we can read it off simply
83:06 - as X is equal to minus y so if I choose
83:09 - X is equal to 1 for example then I'm
83:12 - going to write down an eigenvector 1
83:14 - minus 1 but if I chosen Y is equal to 1
83:17 - then it would have been minus 1 1 it
83:19 - doesn't matter they're both correct
83:21 - I can vectors to go with a power I can
83:23 - value but if we want to normalize well
83:25 - they need to divide by the magnitude 1
83:27 - over root 2 ok so they're acceptable
83:32 - eigenvectors to go with the eigenvalue
83:34 - minus 2 ok so now let's find the
83:40 - eigenvectors that go with our
83:44 - eigenvalues for our 3 by 3 matrix M
83:47 - which was minus 2 1 3 1 minus 1 0 minus
83:56 - 1 1 2 we looked at that before in the
84:00 - previous video and we found the eigen
84:02 - values which were minus 1 root 2 and
84:09 - minus root 2 and I've put little
84:12 - subscripts on our Landers here so we
84:15 - know which one we're dealing with that's
84:17 - still with lambda 1 first which is the
84:19 - one that has value minus 1 so I'll write
84:24 - over here the little equation that we're
84:26 - using over and over again which is that
84:28 - M minus lambda times the identified
84:30 - identity multiplied by our vector is 0
84:33 - ok we need this difference matrix so we
84:36 - subtract off the diagonal 1 minus minus
84:38 - 1 and then 1 3 1 and minus 1 minus minus
84:43 - 1 and 0 minus 1
84:46 - and to minus minus one and that's on X Y
84:51 - and said because we now need an
84:53 - eigenvector with three elements and it's
84:55 - going to be equal to where simplify the
84:58 - matrix 2 minus 1 1 3 1 0 0 minus 1 and
85:06 - that'll be a 3 that again is on X Y Zed
85:13 - eigen vector is equal to 0 0 0 now what
85:20 - we immediately notice is that as before
85:22 - we don't really have three different
85:24 - equations captured by our matrix
85:27 - equation we only have two in fact this
85:30 - is very obvious in this case because the
85:32 - bottom row is the same as the top row
85:35 - that's not always the case
85:37 - it's not always the case that the rows
85:39 - are actually identical we will always
85:43 - find if we check that there are only
85:45 - really two independent equations when
85:48 - we're dealing with 3x3 eigenvalue
85:51 - problems we only have two equations
85:53 - really now I'm going to highlight this
85:58 - row here 1 0 0 that's just saying in
86:01 - fact but X is equal to 0 now if we take
86:05 - either the top or the bottom runner we
86:08 - have minus X plus y plus 3 Z is equal to
86:12 - 0 or Y is equal to minus 3z ok so now we
86:18 - simply choose any values of y&z X has
86:22 - been dictated to us but any values of I
86:24 - y&z that satisfy these rules so if I
86:29 - choose that is equal to 1 that's going
86:30 - to give me Y is equal to minus 3 and I
86:33 - can straight away then write down as
86:35 - satisfactory eigen vector it will be 0
86:38 - minus 3 1 as simple as that it doesn't
86:42 - matter where the minus sign is I could
86:43 - equivalently
86:45 - chosen said is equal to minus 1 and then
86:47 - I'd have 0 3 minus 1 if I normalize then
86:52 - I'll need 1 over root 10 being 3 squared
86:54 - plus 1 squared and so that is a complete
86:59 - solution for our first wagon vector we
87:02 - found it in simple form and in
87:03 - normalized form this is the eigenvector
87:06 - that goes with eigenvalue minus 1 we can
87:09 - go ahead
87:09 - however and check this eigenvector to
87:12 - make sure that it works so for that
87:15 - we'll simply need to write out our
87:17 - matrix and the original matrix which was
87:24 - minus 2 1 3 1 minus 1 0 minus 1 1 2 we
87:31 - have our vector 0 3 minus 1 we just need
87:35 - to do this song so the first element is
87:38 - going to be minus 2 times 0 and then
87:41 - it's a 3 and I see there's a minus 3 so
87:44 - that does give us 0 and our second
87:46 - element is the only nonzero element will
87:49 - be minus 3 and our third third gives us
87:53 - 1 and we can write that as simply minus
87:57 - 1 on to 0 3 minus 1 and so indeed we
88:03 - found that this vector works with the
88:05 - eigenvalue of minus 1 now we can
88:08 - continue to look at to find the other
88:11 - eigen vectors but first let's take a
88:13 - pause and review the steps involved so
88:18 - we're looking at rules for solving eigen
88:21 - vector problems I can vector problem is
88:23 - where we have a square matrix M and we
88:25 - say that M multiplied by some special
88:28 - eigen vector gives us back that eigen
88:31 - vector times just by a value the eigen
88:34 - value we find the possible eigenvalues
88:37 - using this equation involving a
88:39 - determinant of a difference of two
88:41 - matrices in general there are going to
88:45 - be n solutions for an N by n matrix so
88:49 - two solutions for 2x2 three solutions
88:51 - three solutions for a 3x3 matrix that's
88:55 - because when we write the determinant it
88:57 - will have lambda to the power of n as
89:00 - its highest order so for example we have
89:03 - cubed to deal with when we're working
89:05 - out for 3x3 matrices now having found
89:10 - those eigenvalues we then for each value
89:13 - need to figure out an acceptable
89:15 - eigenvector what we've noticed is that
89:20 - generally we only have to use n minus 1
89:23 - of the rows in the equation that we're
89:25 - working to satisfy and that meant just
89:28 - one row in the case of two-by-two
89:30 - problems and two of the rows in the 3x3
89:33 - problems we had some freedom as to what
89:39 - values to choose for our eigenvector and
89:41 - in fact that freedom corresponds it to
89:43 - just scaling the entire eigenvector to a
89:46 - greater or smaller magnitude and if we
89:50 - were asked to normalize we would simply
89:52 - work it out using whatever values we
89:54 - like the simplest values and scale it at
89:57 - the last step so that it has unit length
90:00 - okay so we've covered a lot of ground
90:02 - for one video and this would be a good
90:05 - place to just stop watching if you like
90:06 - but I would like to carry on and solve
90:09 - the remaining two eigen vectors for our
90:12 - 3x3 example because they involve a
90:14 - square root 2 they're actually a bit
90:16 - more messy and tricky to do and in a way
90:18 - I think that makes for a good
90:19 - interesting example to see so let me go
90:23 - ahead and cut back to the screen that we
90:26 - had before with our matrix M spelt out
90:29 - and our possible eigenvalues and we'll
90:31 - now take the value lambda subscript 2
90:34 - which is square root 2
90:37 - so then as usual we need to subtract
90:40 - that down the diagonal so we'll have
90:41 - minus 2 minus square root 2 1 3 1 minus
90:46 - 1 minus square root 2 0 minus 1 1 2
90:52 - minus square root 2 and that is the
90:55 - thing which when multiplied by our
90:57 - unknown eigenvector XYZ should give us 0
91:00 - 0 0 now one thing we notice here is the
91:04 - rows look all different it looks like
91:06 - we've got three different equations
91:08 - captured in this matrix equation but
91:11 - they are not if we examine them
91:13 - carefully enough we'd find that we can
91:15 - generate one of these rows from the
91:18 - other two and in fact we're only
91:20 - therefore going to need to use two of
91:22 - them you could pause the video and play
91:23 - with it and see if you can show this but
91:25 - it must always be the case unless we've
91:27 - made a slip earlier okay so I see that
91:30 - the middle row has a zero so I'm going
91:32 - to start with that one it says X plus
91:34 - minus 2 minus root 2 times y is equal to
91:38 - 0 and that means that if I choose a
91:41 - simple value for y of 1 then I can
91:43 - immediately say that X moving across is
91:46 - gonna be 1 plus root 2 good so now I'll
91:51 - use the top line which is minus 2 minus
91:54 - root 2 X plus y plus 3z is equal to 0
91:58 - and I'll substitute in the values that
92:00 - I've already picked and inferred so I'm
92:04 - gonna get 1 plus root 2 on 2 minus 2
92:10 - minus root 2 that's the X term plus the
92:12 - y is 1 plus 3z yet to be found is equal
92:16 - to 0 rearranged so put it on one side
92:19 - divided by 1/3 expand this thing out
92:23 - minus 2 minus root 2
92:27 - - 2 root 2 minus 2 plus 1 all right oh
92:35 - and there's a minus sign because we've
92:37 - moved it all to the other side from the
92:39 - Z of course now we need to tie this up
92:42 - but what I notice is that inside the
92:44 - brackets I have a minus 3 and a minus 3
92:47 - root 2 and that will cancel cancel with
92:49 - a factor of a minus in third of front
92:51 - and just give us a very simple
92:53 - expression of 1 plus root 2 so that's
92:56 - our Z term okay we've found a compatible
93:00 - set of x y&z values so we can now write
93:03 - down an accept acceptable eigenvector 1
93:06 - plus root 2 1 1 plus root 2 there we are
93:09 - that is an acceptable eigenvector and
93:12 - here's where we found those numbers that
93:14 - goes with the eigenvalue lambda 2 is
93:17 - equal to the square root 2 note that i
93:19 - used the same subscript 2 on my vector
93:23 - so that i make it clear that lambda
93:25 - subscript 2 goes along with vector
93:28 - subscript 2 so now our only remaining
93:32 - task is to look at the third eigenvalue
93:35 - which was negative root 2 and find a
93:38 - compatible eigenvector for that one so
93:40 - as always what we need to do is take the
93:43 - vector M and subtract that the lambda
93:46 - value we found off down the diagonal and
93:48 - because we're subtracting minus a minus
93:51 - number we can just add it instead of
93:52 - course so that will be minus 2 plus root
93:56 - 2 and then 1 and then 3 and then 1 and
94:00 - minus 1 plus root 2 and 0 and minus 1
94:03 - and 1 and 2 plus root 2 and that matrix
94:08 - when multiplied by unknown eigen vector
94:10 - XY said will give us 0 0 0
94:14 - now as before our middle row looks
94:16 - nicest here it's just telling us that X
94:18 - plus 2-1 put it that way around Y times
94:23 - y is equal to zero that means if I chose
94:26 - Y is equal to one obvious choice then X
94:28 - is equal to one minus root 2 watching
94:31 - for signs now if I take that say the
94:34 - bottom row I can have minus X plus y
94:37 - plus 2 plus 2 root plus 2 plus root 2
94:41 - times Z is equal to 0 but I can
94:44 - substitute in the values I found so that
94:46 - will say that square root 2 minus 1 plus
94:49 - 1 plus 2 plus root 2 Z is equal to 0 ok
94:56 - I've got some work to do to find out the
94:57 - value of Z here
94:58 - I'll start by rearranging just to put 2
95:03 - plus root 2 Z is equal to minus root 2
95:07 - on the other side but I still need to do
95:10 - a bit more work divide both sides I
95:12 - notice I can simplify simplified by a
95:14 - factor of root 2 I can write this as
95:15 - that is minus 1 over root 2 plus 1 pause
95:21 - the video check you agree with me and
95:23 - then I'm not happy with that because I
95:26 - don't want to leave Z as a fraction I
95:28 - could do but that would make a very
95:29 - messy looking I can vector I noticed
95:32 - there's a trick in up I have up my
95:34 - sleeve I know that if I multiply the top
95:37 - and bottom of a fraction like that by
95:39 - root 2 minus 1 it will simplify
95:43 - I will then find that the top of course
95:45 - is 1 minus root 2 but the bottom will be
95:49 - 2 plus root 2 minus root 2 minus 1 and
95:54 - that whole expression just comes down to
95:56 - 1 finally then Z is equal to 1 minus
96:00 - root 2 we've now found our XY and z
96:04 - values that are acceptable so we're
96:06 - seeing saying that vector 3 that goes
96:08 - with the lambda 3 value is 1 minus root
96:11 - 2 1 1
96:12 - - that is an acceptable mic inventor so
96:16 - we're done for our 3x3 matrix M we found
96:19 - that three eigenvalues and for each of
96:21 - them an eigenvector the last two of
96:24 - these which involve the root two were
96:26 - more tricky just because there was more
96:28 - particular COFF more messy expressions
96:30 - but the basic maths is the same every
96:33 - time

Cleaned transcript:

okay so welcome to the first lecture on the vectors course this is the basics vectors versus scalars vector notation addition and scaling and properties alright so begin at the beginning let's list some scalar quantities think about mass duration length temperature charge these physical quantities are all well described with a single number really they just have a magnitude although some of them may go negative so it's a magnitude and a sign but still just a simple number is adequate to describe these things how about vector quantities what what's different about vector quantities well think about these things force velocity and therefore acceleration or momentum these things also have a strength or a magnitude however so let's put that down they have a magnitude however they also have a direction more than just a sign they have a full on direction in threedimensional space so it's not enough to know that a force is three Newtons I want to know in which direction is that force applied and that then is the difference between a vector and a scalar quantity we're going to think about how we manipulate them all right so first off the notation that we're going to use when we talk about our vectors what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a symbol such as the letter A so let's write that out but I'm going to underline it so an underlined symbol indicates a vector rather than a simple number and when I need to specify that vector I'm going to write it we're going to be threedimensional I'm going to write the three numbers in a column form like this and now if you haven't seen a vector specified before what does it mean well think of the Cartesian axes the X the X Y z axes think in this case about coming out from the origin to in the direction of X and 1 in the direction of Y and 3 in the direction of said what we're going to do is we're going to think of our vector as an arrow an arrow that comes from the origin to this point in space and that arrow itself whether or not it comes from the origin that that direction and that length of arrow is our visualization of the vector so let me just change color to green and go ahead and draw the tip of my arrow there there we are so the vector is coming towards us out of the screen and it has those particular three components 1 3 other people may use other notations for example align over the the symbol a is commonly used when people write out the components that may choose to do it as a row like this or even using pointy brackets like this now all these notations are basically getting at the same thing you'll be able to read textbooks or look online and see these things and understand what they mean but within this course of videos we're just going to use the notation that I've introduced above so I'll erase those for now now the simplest thing that you might want to do if you have a couple of vectors is to add them up so let's think about that vector addition what does it mean so let's give ourselves a second vector B we'll make it 5 minus 2 0 let's say I want to add these two vectors together so we'll write that out I simply want to add a on the line plus B underline does that mean let's just substitute in 2 3 added on 2 5 minus 2 0 now what we do is we simply add the first component component of vector a to the first component of vector B and so on down the list very very simple so we're adding 2 plus 5 we're going to add 1 plus 2 and 3 plus 0 and we just tidy that up so that's going to be 7 and minus 1 and 3 now how about scaling a vector ok so what we can do is we can multiply a vector by a simple number and correspondingly we'll just end up multiplying each of its components so let's take an example 3 9 12 what we notice is each of the three components is a multiple of three we can just take that common factor out in front and write this instead as 3 times 1 3 minus 4 same thing alright or equivalently someone might give us a vector that's already written in this form it could be let's see 3 over 2 on 2 2 4 minus 4 let's make it one alright and we can just multiply that in in a component by component basis so we just write ourselves a new column of course 3 times 2 is 3 3 times minus 4 is minus 6 and 3 over 2 times 1 is 3 over 2 okay so there we are we can scale our vectors by a number in this simple way so with these definitions of addition and scaling can we say anything about the properties okay so if I have two regular numbers a and B then of course a plus B is the same as B plus a I'm not saying anything fancy here it's as simple as I don't know 7 plus minus 3 is equal to minus 3 plus 7 obviously it is we know that now if we think about the same statement for vectors a plus B vector B is it the same as vector B plus a well it must be let's just write at an example 7 0 minus 1 3 1 2 is it equal to 3 1 2 vector plus the vector 7 0 7 0 minus 1 of course it is because of the way we've defined vector addition as just being the addition of each element to the corresponding element and this property is called being commutative okay so vector addition is commutative how about this second example if we have three basic quantities ordinary numbers then if we have a plus B plus C it's the same as a plus B plus C it doesn't matter the order that we do them in is that going to be true for vectors well of course it is going to have to be true to fit vectors because the way we define vector addition is to add each component to the corresponding component it's just addition so this is also 4 vectors let's write out what we mean we mean that vector a plus B plus C as a previously worked out thing is equal to vector A plus vector B and then add on C it doesn't matter the order we do these things all right and there's a name for that property it's called being associative so all right so vector addition has that property also now let's thinking about our scaling property if we have ordinary numbers again then we could take some scale factor K and multiply it into a plus B and it would just give us K times a plus K times B again I'm not saying anything that isn't utterly obvious here say for example I don't know 2 into 1 plus 3 is equal to 2 times 1 plus 2 times minus 3 of course it is so how about for vectors is it true that some scale factor K times the sum vector A plus vector B a plus B and that's stress that this scale factor is just a pure number then yes indeed it's going to be just K times a plus K times B so just to just to stress what we're doing here let's copy down this sum of two vectors we were playing with up here this 7 zero minus one thing plus three one to put it inside curly brackets maybe for a variety doesn't have to be curly brackets multiply it by some factor let's have three over two had that before unimaginative there we are what are they going to be it's just gonna be three over two times the first vector seven zero 1 and then plus three over two times the second vector three one two okay so everything as you kind of would expect it works out it must and this latter property is called being distributed distributive excuse me so scaling is distributive over addition and that's the end of our first video welcome to the second of these videos we're going to look here at the vector dot product also called the scalar product we'll look at also the magnitude of a vector and the meaning of unit vectors the geometric meaning of the dot product and finding the angle between vectors using the dot product okay so the dot product is a way of combining two vectors in order to produce a number a simple number a scalar hence the alternate name scalar product let's give ourselves a couple of vectors let's have a will vector a can be four minus four let's have two one and we'll have a vector B which can be three one three and we're going to do the dot product of these two guys so we write that as vector a a nice a nice clear central dot vector B and then we write that out as the two column vectors and we need to understand how we compute the dot product and the answer is we're simply going to multiply each component by its opposite number and then add them up so we're going to multiply the first component minus 4 by 3 and then add that to the second component to multiply by its opposite number 1 and finally the third components 1 and 3 so that's minus 4 times 2 by 3 add it on to 2 times by 1 add it on to 1 times 2 by 3 so minus 12 plus 2 Plus 3 that's going to be minus minus 7 all right there's the dot product worked out pretty straightforward and of course as you can see it can be a minus number can be zero can be a positive number but it's a simple pure number okay so now let's see what happens if we do the dot product of a vector with itself let's do a dotted with itself so there's gonna be minus four to one dotted with minus four to one now of course because we're multiplying each component by itself that will always be a positive number 164 pop months four by minus 4 + 2 2 4 + 1 1 is 1 and so it's going to add up to 21 it must add up to a positive number it's made of three positive numbers summed I want to introduce a second vector called a hat it's related to a just by scaling it and we're gonna scale it by one over the square root of the earlier dot product with itself so 1 over square root 21 and then just 4 1 as before so it says the scaled version of a what's interesting about it well now let's see what happens if we take the dot product of a hat with a hat with itself so we're going to get 1 over square root of 21 times 1 over a square root of 21 which is 1 over 21 and then of course we're going to get a dotted with a the original dot product we did which is just 21 as we know so of course the dot product of a hat with itself is just 1 that means that a hat has a special property it's what's called a unit vector unity being of course a fancy word for the number 1 so when we scale a vector so that it when dotted with itself it comes out as 1 then it is a unit vector meanwhile in general for a vector the square root of the dot product with itself has the name magnitude this is the magnitude of a vector and it is also magnitude it is also the length of the arrow if we think in terms of a vector as a physical displacement an arrow that lives in threedimensional space then it would be the length of that arrow as you can see from Pythagoras okay now then a different thing the dot product between two vectors has an alternative definition which we can show is the same as the definition we've been using so far a dot B is also the magnitude of a time's the magnitude of B times cause of some angle and what is that angle it's actually just the angle between the two vectors between their directions so here I'm drawing a vector a going in one direction and almost in the opposite direction vector B and then the angle in question would be this angle that we see between the two vectors when we draw them coming from a common point of origin okay so it's important to understand then that this angle can be more than 90 degrees here's what it isn't here's a mistake that's sometimes made by people as they start to play with vectors they want the angle for some reason they want it to be less than 90 degrees so they try and contrive this by putting the vectors together in a way that will give them less than 90 degrees like this for example and then we could try and draw an angle between these two lines let's see like that shoes out red to show that it's not correct what we should have is the two vectors coming from a common origin then we see that the angle between them can be more or less than 90 degrees if it was exactly 90 degrees then of course the dot product would be 0 because cos of 90 is 0 that's has interesting consequences but right now let's work out the angle between a couple of vectors let's give ourselves a we'll make it 1 0 minus 1 and B we're going to make it 4 1 minus 1 and we'll do the dot product between those guys so first we'll work out the dot product actually let's make it minus 1 so it can be minus 1 0 minus 1 I think they'll come out better so we have minus 4 from minus 1 times 4 we have 0 times 1 is 0 and we have minus 1 times minus 1 is 1 so it's gonna be minus 3 for the total dot product between these two guys but we also need to find out the magnitude fair enough my tangent of a is gonna be the square root of minus 1 times minus 1 is 1 and again 1 so that would be the square root of 2 nice straightforward meanwhile the magnitude of B is going to be 4 4 6 plus one plus one it's gonna be 18 the square root of 18 but I think we can do better than that square root of 18 is actually square root of 9 times the square root of 2 and that means it's 3 times the square root of 2 okay now we've got everything we need let's pull down a copy of that that definition they're relating a dot B to its magnitudes in the angle and fill in what we know for this particular choice of a and B we've got minus 3 is therefore equal to root 2 times 3 root 2 times cos of the angle that we're after so now we just need to rearrange that means that cos of the angle is going to be 2 equal to minus 3 divided by well we've got 2 lots of root 2 so stress mere 3 times 2 and if we simplify that down it's just me minus 1/2 now we may just remember oil so use a calculator to find out this means that the angle in question is in fact going to be simply 120 degrees or you can use radians if you prefer radians so there we are that's the answer the angle between these two vectors 120 degrees and that's it for the second video in this video we're going to see how to calculate something called the cross product of two vectors it's also called the vector product because the output is a new vector and we'll see how to test that the answer is correct so here I've written a cross B is equal to C and notice that the symbol for the cross product is just the multiplication symbol that you're familiar with from basic arithmetic I've given the vector a a particular form this two three four column vector and similarly B is written as four five six so we're going to go ahead and find out what is the cross product of these two vectors C because it's a vector we'll need to do some working for each of the three components now what I'm going to do is I'm going to paste up some arm some structure to help us work through the problem so don't worry because there's gonna look like a lot but you don't need to write all this out every time you want to do a cross product I'm just putting it here so we can really spell out the process okay so let's go ahead and work out the first component of the output vector C strangely enough what we're going to do is we're going to ignore the first component of vectors a and B so I'm just going to cross those out those aren't used and what we're going to do is we're going to multiply a certain of the other components what we're going to do is we're going to multiply the second component of vector a with the third component of vector B I call that the falling diagonal because when we draw it like this we start high and then go low and then we're going to subtract off the multiple of the rising diagonal four and six here the last component of vector a and the middle component of vector B so what we have here is 21 that seven threes a 216 fours are 24 that's minus three we can go ahead now and write that in as our first our 3 now let's move to the second element of the output vector C again we'll start by ignoring the second component of the to source vectors a and B we can cross those off and again we are going to multiply some diagonals but what's different here is we start with the rising diagonal 4 times 5 the last component of vector a times the first component of vector B the rising diagonal 5 4 2 20 and then we subtract off the falling diagonal so 2 7 to 14 and that's going to give us 6 so we can put that in now let's move to the third and final component as before we start by noting that we will ignore the third component of the to source vectors and we're going to need some diagonals it's the same pattern as the first falling diagonal first so 2 times 6 and subtract which is 12 and then subtract off the rising diagonal five threes of 15 all right so that's going to be 3 pop that in we see that we have quite a simple vector here there's a common factor of 3 let's bring that out 3 then minus 1 2 minus 1 that is our vector C that is a cross B notice again the pattern it was the falling diagonal minus the rising diagonal for the first component and then the rising diagonal minus the falling diagonal for the second component and then for the third it was back to the same pattern as for the first now these look a bit like letters to me they look a bit like a V the middle one perhaps an N and the final one a V I like to remember that as a little sentence which is vowels never vary because in my opinion vowels don't vary very much his evolved this one doesn't vary at all because it's stuffed in a museum however if you compare it to some other vowels which I found these on the internet I think they are all pretty much identical and it see a big difference there so for me voles never vary if for you they do seem to vary then think of a different way of remembering it but the important thing is that the first thing is the falling diagonal and then subtract the rising diagonal of V shape and it alternates okay how to check your cross product has been worked out correctly this is really useful stuff so let's give ourselves another example we have two three one and then we'll have let's say three seven minus one is get a minus in there and that's going to be equal to something we'll work it out in a minute for now I'll put X Y Zed now how am I going to test once I found those x y&z that I haven't made some kind of slip I mean there's a lot of mental arithmetic if we don't write it all out we're gonna be doing a bunch of multiplications I could easily slip up how am I gonna test that it turns out there's a very interesting property of the vector C that we get out after the operation if we've done it correctly that is as I've written here that a dot dot product with vector C is zero and so is B so either of the input vectors a and B dotted with the correct cross product C should give us zero and that's great because the dot product is very easy to work out even by eye as a check let's go ahead and do it so I've copied it down here we're going to want to work down our various components let's do the first component of C so what do we do we ignore the first components of a and B and we do the falling diagonals that's going to be three times minus one and we subtract the rising diagonals one times seven such as just let's just write that out normally I wouldn't bother to write all this out but let's go ahead and do it as minus three minus seven and so that's going to be minus ten as our first component now we work out second component we ignore the second component on the input vectors will do the rising diagonal one times three and subtract the falling diagonal two times minus one so what have we got we've got three here minus minus 2 and so that's going to give us five and then finally the third component ignore the third component of the input vectors do the falling diagonal 2 times 7 7 2 2 14 subtract the rising diagonal three threes and 9 so we're going to have for our final component 14 minus 9 which is another 5 aha so that's quite a simple vector has a common factor of 5 in there if we wanted to write it out that way now let's test that guy versus the a and B vectors to see if it passed passes our test or have we made a slip so let's just be completely explicit about that we're going to start by testing the dot product of the vector a with our hopefully correct that cross product C I'll write it out two three one dot product 10 5 5 what's that going to be equal to minus 20 and then three fives of 15 and then one five is five aha it does equal zero that's correct that's a very very encouraging thing but for real thoroughness we're going to test the other one as well so this is B dot C let's check that out so that's three seven minus one dotted with again 10 5 5 this time is going to be minus minus 30 from three times minus ten and then 7 5 2 35 and minus 5 from the last element zero again aha so it has in fact passed both of our tests and we're not very confident that's correct this is a great test to do one word of warning though the one thing it won't pick up is if you've done your rising and falling diagonals in exactly the wrong way round by starting with the wrong pattern so do remember the VNV pattern and this test will check for any particular slips in your multiplications and that's the end of the video okay so in this short video I'm just going to look at four more examples of the cross product for practice and here they are okay so here's the first one we want the first element of this cross product so we ignore the first elements of the to source vectors we do the falling diagonal 3 times 0 that's 0 and we subtract the rising diagonal 7 times minus 1 that is minus 7 so we're subtracting minus 7 that means we'll get plus 7 so the first element here is NBS 7 ok so now we want the second element that means we ignore the second element of the to source factors we do however the rising diagonal first 70s 14 minus 1 times 0 0 so that's 14 so the second one was the rising diagonal first if you follow me and then finally to get the third component we ignore the third component of the source vectors and we do the falling diagonal 1 times minus 1 is minus 1 minus 3 to 6 so that is minus 7 okay so there's our solution 7 14 minus 7 but is that correct or have we made a slip it's a good time to check the old dot product tricked so if we call this a cross B equals C then we should find that if we do the dot product of one of the input vectors say B with C then it should be 0 let's check that 7 2 2 14 minus 1 times 14 is minus 14 0 times minus 7 is zero so that's 14 minus 14 is correct let's do the other one it's harder so 1 times 7 is 7 3 times 14 is 42 so that's 49 in total and then the final term here 7 7 2 49 but that was with a minus number so we've got in fact 14 8 49 minus 49 is 0 so another one of those dot products is correctly 0 so what we found out is that a dot C and B dot C are both equal to 0 as they must be so when very confident that we have the right cross product there let's do another one okay so we're going to want the first element so we ignore the first element of the to source vectors and we do eight threes are 83 24 2 x 2 so that's 22 let's do the next elements so we ignore the middle element so we do the rising diagonal 4 0 8 8 that's just going to be 0 and then finally we ignore the bottom elements and we do the falling diagonal the rising diagonal 1 minus 12 is minus 11 so there's our solution 22 0 minus 11 we notice we could take 11 out of that as a common factor that would make them the next stage very easy but let's just let's do it the hard way and do the dot product so 4 times 22 is 88 1 times 0 0 and minus 88 and actually pretty easy to confirm that 0 let's do the other one 1 times 22 is 22 3 times 0 and again 2 times minus 11 again 0 so that's fine that one's passed its checks as well onto the third one okay so this time I think I might take a common factor out just to show us doing that because I see that this 25 5 15 chap is going to lead to some pretty big numbers but maybe I don't need to do that I can just take the common factor of 5 out of the first vector we're calling it vector a so that's just 5 13 and then I go ahead and write vector B which can't be simplified is just 1 3 minus 2 will do this cross cross spot excuse me will do this cross product and then we'll put the factor of 5 in at the end that's fine to do it that way round okay so let's go ahead and write that out there's our factor of 5 and here's our cross product so the first element of our cross product we can or the first elements of the to source factors we do the falling diagonal that gives us a minus 2 we subtract the rising diagonal that's a minus 9 so that's minus 2 plus 9 that's going to give us a 7 and now the middle element we ignore the middle elements on the to source factors we do the rising diagonal this time gives us minus 3 we subtract the falling diagonal that gives us minus 10 which means we're gonna have to add on 10 so that's minus 3 plus 10 it's another 7 okay and then finally the third element we ignore the 3rd elements on the source factor we do the falling diagonal that's five threes of 15 and we subtract the rising diagonal one that's going to give us another 14 so in fact a really simple vector here cuz we could take out a factor of 7 if we want to but let's check those dot products do it before or after we take out the factor of 7 it's pretty easy that's gonna be 4 times 7 minus and minus 2 times 14 yes that goes to 0 let's do this one just quickly 35 and another 7 is 42 but minus 3 times 14 is exactly minus 42 so that one is also satisfied we've passed our checks that looks pretty good we can leave it like this or if we want we can take out that factor of 7 and do 35 times 1 1 2 very simple very nice back to there ok let's come here now come down to the bottom and look at the final one we notice is actually the cross product of a vector with itself it's the same vector here so what are we going to get well we can just easily enough work it out we ignore the first two elements and we do 4 + 2 times minus 4 and minus 4 times 2 so it's something minus itself that's just gonna give us a 0 obviously and let's keep going if we ignore the middle terms and do the rising diagonal minus the falling diagonal again threes and minus 4s the same product so something minus itself 0 and it's gonna be the same for the final element so the cross product of a vector with itself is always going to be the zero vector now it's important not to write that just as the scalar 0 because it is a different object it's the vector 0 it's a set of in threedimensional space three zeros that's what we get when we cross a vector with itself of course this is going to trivially satisfy our condition on the a dot C is equal to 0 and B dot C is equal to 0 that's clear and so I think that's a nice set of four examples done quite quickly there they're not too bad are they so that's the end of the video ok in this video we're going to look again at the cross product but this time we're going to ask about its geometric meaning and its properties and we come to manipulated ok so if some vector C is the cross product of two other vectors a and B we've already seen how to work that out but what we can reasonably now ask is what it does that vector C look like you know if we imagine a particular couple of vectors a and B there in space where is this back to see how is it related to them we know how to work it out but what's its relationship with them how should we think about it and that's what we're gonna we're gonna figure out now so we know that C is a vector so it has two properties it has its magnitude and direction let's think about the magnitude first what is the magnitude of C and how does that relate to a and B what is the length of that vector it's pretty simple the magnitude of C is the magnitude of a time's the magnitude of B times sine of the angle between a and B this is very similar to the dot product except with a sine instead of a course so there we are there's our two vectors a and B and an angle between them and from those magnitudes the lengths of those two vectors and the angle we can work out the magnitude of C note that if we cross a vector with itself the angle will be 0 and so the cross product will be 0 just as we've already seen in our examples that was easy enough what about the direction of this new vector C how does that relate okay here's the thing the direction of C is perpendicular sorry for my writing there within writing C is perpendicular to both vectors a and B so it's at right angles to each of those vectors separately and simultaneously what does that look like well actually we can draw it in one of two ways one of which is right and one is wrong let's just do that so here's is I think to a here's I think to B if we draw C like that and make it clear with this little symbol that it's at right angles to those two vectors that would be perpendicular to them both how about this we could also draw it back to a draw back to be again and we could go in the opposite direction simply literally the opposite direction and that would also be perpendicular to these two vectors one of these is actually strictly the correct case and the other is wrong by essentially a minus a minus one multiple what's the way to work that out so let's let's now fear that out there's actually a rule to remember it by it's called the right hand screw rule so let's draw that out kind of really clearly one more time we have two vectors a and B and we are going to say that a cross B is equal to some vector C that's fine so what we do is we put on the line along which we know si must lie so this is the line that's perpendicular to both a and B and we simply have to ask ourselves in in this picture does the vector C go upwards or does it go downwards the trick is to write on the angle between a and B and give it a direction so that it's increasing from A to B it's the angle from A to B then you imagine taking your right hand and gripping that line in such a way that your fingers curl in the same direction as the angle increases and then your thumb points in the direction that the in the actual direction of C let's do another example just to really make that clear here's a and B again so we know we need to beat them I've drawn these lying in a plane so we are now trying to draw a line that's perpendicular to that plane vector C must lie in one direction or the other along this line what do we do we draw on the angle we now take our right hand and we imagine gripping that that line we've just drawn in such a way that our fingers curl in the direction in which the angle is increasing so it's like the anticlockwise direction in this picture and that's and then our thumb points in the correct direction for that vector so it's in fact these are the two opposite cases so that's the rule that allows you to construct the correct direction for your vector geometric geometrically okay then let's just finally wrap up by thinking about the cross product and asking whether it has those properties that we looked at before for our vector addition the commutative property so for example is a cross B equal to B cross a it is not it is not equal to it unlike the top product unlike addition this one Ross product it matters the order and in fact it simply introduces a minus sign if you swap the order of a and B so it's not commutative it nearly is in the sense that it gives you something similar it gives you the same thing up to a minus sign it's important to remember you can just verify that by thinking about how we work out and be with those diagonal products now how about the associative property can we say that a cross B cross C where B and C have already been worked out it's the same as a cross B and then cross C what do we think is that going to work or not in fact it this is the associative property we might ask whether this is true and the answer is no again the cross product does not have this property so the order in which you do your cross product if you have doing the cross product of three vectors does matter we can easily convince ourselves of this just by looking at a particularly convenient example let's just use Cartesian vectors ijk so let's just remind ourselves where these guys lie they're perpendicular to each other I J and K just our unit vectors going in the x y&z direction so suppose we have this guy I cross I cross K if we try evaluating it this way around with the I cross K being worked out first well that's just going to give us in fact minus J which you can confirm with the right hand rule that we just introduced and then that in turn will give us K that's fine so we've worked out in that instance the answer is minus K now let's do it the other way around I cross I if we do that first that's just going to be 0 because I cross I is 0 so it's game over already at that point so we can see two radically different answers here just depending on our order finally we could ask about the distributive property so are we allowed to multiply through using the cross product if we if the second object in our cross product is a sum of two vectors can we do this well this at last is something that we are going to be allowed to do it is the distributive property and the cross product operation the vector product does have this property we are allowed to do that but of course we must make sure to make to keep the order the same okay so I think that's everything for this video ok in this lecture we're going to be looking at something called the scalar triple product so what we're dealing with here is taking three vectors and combining them in a certain way in order to yield a single one scalar quantity so three vectors into one scalar scalar triple product suppose we have a we dot it with B which itself is crossed with C that is the scalar triple product of that combination now here I've put brackets to emphasize to do the cross product first but we can just write a dot B cross C without the brackets why because we have to do it in the correct order if we try to do a dot B first and then cross that with C it's a nonsense because that will be a scalar cross product it with a vector doesn't make sense all right then so let's do one we'll make up some vectors let's have a is equal to 3 1 minus 1 and B is equal to 2 0 4 and C is equal to minus 1 minus 2 3 ok there are our vectors and let's go ahead and work it out so first we'll need to do the cross product B cross C so let's write that out so I'm bringing these down now remember you can work out the cross product by whatever your favorite method is I'm just going to do it in the method I introduced before which is we ignore the first elements and we do befalling diagonal here zero and subtract the rising diagonal minus 8 that gives us the first element of 8 then we ignore the middle elements and we do the rising diagonal gives us minus 4 subtract the falling diagonal which is 6 so that's going to give us a minus 10 entry and then we ignore the third elements when we do the falling diagonal gives us a minus 4 and subtract 0 so that's going to be minus 4 that is our candidate for our cross product but it's always good to test how do we test a cross product we try dotting it with either of the input vectors and check we get 0 so here we'll get a 2 to 16 and 4 minus 4 is minus 16 add it up that is 0 and now we try the other combination here we're going to have minus 1 on 8 minus 8 and then plus 20 and then minus 12 that does indeed add up to 0 it's passed our checks those were just checks but it was good to do them and so we're now very happy that that is the correct cross product to finish the scalar triple product we now just need to dot that with a so let's write it out again I understand minus 4 and do the dot product that's 24 minus 10 plus 4 is going to be 18 that's the answer that's our scalar triple product it could have been a positive number a negative number could have been 0 in this case it's 18 now let's do another one so I'll erase this but we'll simply use the same the same three vectors but we'll do them in a different order as our second example so let's do B dotted with C cross a so of course we have to start by doing that C cross a combination first so let me write that down quickly 1 2 3 crossed with 3 1 1 so we start with the falling diagonal that's gonna be 2 and then we subtract 3 that's minus 1 and then we have a rising diagonal that's gonna be 9 and subtract 1 that's 8 and then we have a falling diagonal minus 1 and subtract minus 6 so that's going to be 5 in oh ok did I get that cross product correct or not do the dot product test minus 3 is minus 3 8 minus 5 that one's passed let's try this dot product combination as a second check double check 1 minus 16 plus 15 that's also going to come out at 0 so it's passed both of my checks that one is 0 as well we're happy that this is indeed the cross product at C cross a we now need to complete it so what we're doing is um B which was 204 dotted with what we found cross product minus one eight five so again go ahead and evaluate this minus two zero and 20 18 again alright so our second example has also given us 18 does this map mean that it doesn't matter in which order we do the elements of the scalar triple product let me just write down the answer to that and then we'll look at it it turns out that for any vectors a B and C then a dot B cross C is equal to B dot C cross a these were the two cases we looked at and it's also equal in fact to C dot a cross B this will always be true in this case it was equal to 18 but these three things would always be equal there are three other combinations we could write down in principle there are three other ways to combine a B and C we could have a dot C cross B or we can have B dot a cross C or we could have C dot B cross a now it turns out that those things are easy to see what their will be because let's just look at the difference from the ones above I've just swapped the order of the cross product and we know that when we Europe's we know that when we swap the order of a cross product we introduce a minus sign so if the top three cases were equal to 18 the bottom three cases must be equal to each other and equal to minus 18 and in general this is the same rule for all scalar triple product you know three of them are equal and three of them are equal to one another but equal to the minus of the first three so to speak and and how can you tell which ones are equal it's helpful to write out this little cycle a B and C written in a circle like this if we are going around in a clockwise direction here B dot C cross a but that's clockwise around our wheel then and here's another one that's got my C dot a cross B those guys all belong together so the guys that are in the clockwise direction all belong together and the anticlockwise guys they belong together and they're the minus of one another these two groups all right so that's that's I think all we need to do as practice for doing the scalar triple product and knowing what we ought to get let's think about something else I'm going to introduce you to something called the parallelepiped that's why I should say I'm not sure how to pronounce it parallelepiped anyway this guy is a threedimensional shape but first I'm going to remind you of what a parallelogram looks like so here's a rectangle and here's a parallelogram that we get if we have the pairs of the sides are parallel to each other but they are not a right angle at right angles around the vertex now consider this rectangular box and let's tidy up there we are and consider what happens if we build it out of edges that are in groups of parallel edges but are not all at right angles to each other so let's see if I can draw this reasonably realistically as a threedimensional object so I'm going to draw this and I'm going to stress which edges are parallel to each other all right here we are okay let me change color so consider these four edges of the object are all parallel to each other in exactly the same way that in our simple parallelogram these opposing edges were parallel and then these four edges are all parallel to one another again in our 3d shape just as these two edges are parallel and then we have another set these four edges here in yellow are also going to be parallel to one another that object is a particular threedimensional solid it's really a generalization of the of the box in that we're allowing ourselves to have slanting edges if we want to now let's introduce three vectors a B and C to represent these three kinds of edges you see that all the green edges are the same vector a and so on what happens if we do a dot B cross C that it turns out the magnitude of that if we drop the sign then the magnitude is just the volume of this shape so it contains of course the simple case of a rectangular box as a special case but this will work for any parallel parallelepiped that we care to think of although three vectors can always be combined with the scalar triple product to give us the volume and that's the end of the video welcome to the third arm topic in this video series where I'll be introducing the matrix and thinking about what is a matrix product alright so essentially a matrix is nothing more than a grid of numbers simply a grid of numbers that could be positive or negative or fractional or zeroes and when we specify the shape of our grid of numbers or we do so simply by stating how many rows we have and how many columns so we're gonna hear about rows and columns a lot in this video in this video course I'm going to use a particular way of writing a matrix as a symbol and I need to do that I'm going to just use a capital letter and I'm going to the letter is going to be double underlined I'll double underline that simple so here we go a underlined aligned that means the matrix a and how would we write it so that's just like this essentially a grid of numbers and we put it in curvy brackets just to give us some structure so this is three rows two columns that one here's a matrix B let's make it a square matrix let's put in a fraction to show we can 10 0 okay so there are two different examples of a matrix easy enough but it gets more interesting when we try and combine them so I want to talk about matrix multiplication addition is simple and it's just a element by element addition but multiplication is not so simple so here's how we write it the multiplication of matrix a by matrix B is simply written like this a b and it gives us some new matrix c which may be a different shape from both a and b as we'll see let's give ourselves a couple of examples 3 0 minus 1 2 3 4 a matrix B can be just 1 2 0 minus 3 so there are our two matrices here I've chosen them such that a B that multiplication will work it will exist but actually if we try it the other way around it will turn out that the multiplication the multiple of those two matrices doesn't even exist it's not a welldefined thing so this is an extreme case of an operation not being reversible in its order in other words matrix multiplication is not commutative okay so let's just erase that and go ahead and see how the multiplication actually works the trick is to multiply the each row of matrix in the first matrix by each entire column of matrix B what does that mean well let's write out our example 3 to 0 3 minus 4 minus 1 minus 1 4 1 0 2 minus 3 now I know that this guy is going to have 3 rows and 2 columns the output matrix you'll see why in a bit I'll just put these blanks in for now the question is how to work out each of these numbers let's choose this one first okay now notice this guy's address if you like is Row 1 column 1 of the output matrix C I'm going to need to in order to work this guy out I'll need to look at the whole of Row 1 in the first matrix in matrix a and the whole of column 1 in the matrix B I'll need to combine those guys and how do I get combine them I just multiply element by element as I go along the row and down the column so 3 times 1 just gives me 3 and then I add on the next combination 2 times 2 is 4 so 3 plus 4 is gonna give me 7 that's how I combine those two I'll jump back here and I'll they raised there and I'll just put in my 7 all right so that's the the general way it works let's go ahead and do the other elements of our matrix C let's do this one notice this is still Row 1 so I want that first row it's now column 2 that's its address all at the second column 3 times 0 and 2 times 3 is how I'll work that out and that's just going be minus six so let me jump backwards and arrays my blank symbol and write in 6 okay maybe I went a bit fast let me spell this one out more explicitly okay so here I now have Row 2 column 1 that's the address of that guy I want all of Row 2 and all of column 1 when I look at those guys and I want to multiply along so 0 times 1 and 3 times 2 that's gonna give us just 6 in total when we add them up so let me erase and put in 6 and now this element that's row 2 column 2 so I want all of Row 2 1 all of column 2 I multiply 0 times 0 and 3 times minus 3 is minus 9 so that's going to be a minus 9 if I go backwards and just put in minus 9 here now we're finally on to the final third row so we're going to want the third row of a and in this case the first column that's 1 times minus 1 and 4 times 2 is 8 that's gonna be 7 minus 1 plus 8 and it finally last row last column 4 times minus 3 is 12 and a 0 minus 12 all right so there we are that is our matrix product C formed by combining each row in each column it's quite a lot of work and it would be even more if we had bigger matrices but we said that we get something quite different if we try multiplying a and B in the other order so let's go ahead and do that now what if we have 1 0 2 minus 3 that's B 1 2 3 2 0 3 minus 4 so we can try it we try it and multiply Row one by column 1 and we immediately find that we cannot because they are a different length a different list so there is no third element of our row to multiply with our third element of the column just pause the video here and have a look at that and see why that must be impossible for us and so sometimes matrix multiplication is impossible all right let's look at a few little further examples and you may want to pause the video to convince yourself in each case is true is this thing possible for example pause it and think this one is not possible this is not possible again because there are two elements in say the first row of a and three elements in the column single column of B there's no way to do that as a series of element by element products how about this we just have this row matrix and this column matrix can we do that yes this one is perfectly possible actually it just produces a single number in fact it's a bit like it like a a dot product it's the whole of row one times which is the entire matrix and then the whole whole of column one in B this thing is called a row matrix and this other guy is called a column matrix for obvious reasons okay how about this let's have a look at this one what if I swap the order of my row and column I just swap them around can I do that is that going to produce a legitimate matrix actually yes it will this time swapping our two matrices a and B around has produced something which exists it's actually a huge matrix is 3 by 3 it must have three rows and three columns because a has three rows and B has three columns how is it work let's look at that guy for example it's just simply the number there which is Row one is just a number and column two is just a number a single number so we just do that product there's no problem pause the video if it's confusing all right so again the point here is that a times B is generally not equal to B times a even if they both exist they may not be the same they may not even be the same shape however we can go on and ask about the other kinds of properties of the matrix product operation a onto B times C is that the same as a times B onto C does the order matter actually it is the same it does work in other words we have the associative property how about a into B plus C sum of two matrices yes we can have a onto B plus a onto C that is therefore the distributive property matrix multiplication does satisfy those things it's just not commutative okay let me make a bit more room up here in the top of the screen and but one final puzzle up suppose I have this to Row three column matrix and then a mystery matrix M and then I have a simple column matrix of two rows and I'm asking what shape should matrix M be or is it even is it is it possible pause and think about that and in fact it's just a column matrix of three elements you may want to just meditate on that and see that it's correct okay that's the end of this video okay welcome to this video in this one we're going to take a look at how to work out our determinant what is it how can you find determinants of various sizes so a determinant is a scaler it's just a number could be positive could be negative could be zero and it's derived from a square matrix a single number derived from an entire matrix now the determinant of M would be written with M with the modular signs either side of it even though it can be a negative number so here's an example of M and here is how we would write the determinant of M note that we don't bother writing squares straight sides and curved brackets as well there's no point in that it's just enough to have the straightline sides so let's start with the definition of a 2 by 2 determinant that's the easy case to look at so let's write out a general 2 by 2 just using symbols will have a B C D written inside our straight line sides indicates a determinant it's simply ad minus BC okay so that's the falling diagonal the leading diagonal is also called minus the rising diagonal multiplied together very simple very simple and that is how you can just look at and evaluate a 2 by 2 determinant so for our example one two three four one times four is four subtract off a two times three is six and so that's going to give us minus two is the determinant ok so a 3 by 3 determinant is going to be a bit more work what we do is and we have a 3 by 3 determinant we evaluate it by breaking it up into a number up to three smaller determinants each of which is a 2x2 and for that we have our definition for immediate evaluation so we break up bigger determinants into little ones and then evaluate them I'm going to write out something here that's like a chessboard but instead of black and white I have pluses and minuses you'll see why in a moment the thing to notice though is that we alternate plus minus plus minus along each row and each column in this 3x3 grid ok so now let's work out a 3 by 3 determinant again I will just use general symbols a b c d e f g h i right now first I have to choose a row or a column I'm going to choose this top row for the first example and I'm gonna work along this row and I'm gonna start with the a symbol now I go and I look on my chart and I see that there's a plus sign in that in that slot of my grid that means I put down plus a and now what I do is I ignore the whole row and the whole column that a is in and I look at the remaining four numbers and I write a little determinant just made out of those guys in the same order they appear so EF is going to be in my main determinant there and H I those are the remaining four guys in the same order they appear now be the next term that has a minus sign according to my chart so I will put in minus B and multiply it by again are smaller twobytwo determinant the one I get if I delete the row and the column would be in it and look at the remaining guys D F G I and I just I just write those guys out in the same order they appear as a small twobytwo determinant finally there see see appears with a plus sign according to my chart so I need to put down plus C and I need to multiply by well we delete the row and column with C in it and we just see the remaining determinant D E G H so I simply imagine that that row and column was not there and then that's what the determine becomes and then of course those 2 by 2 determinants I can just write down what they are using my rule of multiplying down the diagonal and up subtracting the anti diagonal ok there we are so that is in general what a 3 by 3 determinant evaluates to but it's not the only way to do it let's write it out again and this time choose let's choose a column and a different one let's choose this column I'm also allowed to work down this so I would start with B as my first term and I delete the row and column with it in and I'd see what are the remaining terms and write them D F G I except I've forgotten something there's a minus sign attached to that particular entry so that should actually have been minus B all right and then similarly plus E and I delete the row and column which has unit and then I just make a 2 by 2 determinant from in this case would be the corner elements AC g I and I'd finally minus H and either own column with H in it make a 2 by 2 determinant determinant of what's left AC DF ok and of course I could then write out these 2 by 2 determinants explicitly but the point is it will get give me the same answer let's do an example and see why we would choose one method or the other so here just some random numbers I'm making up let's stick then n is 3 by 3 first off let's work along the top row and as what as we did in our first it that's going to be three let's put in the full determinant here and then minus one and again the determinant I get by excluding the top row and middle column and then plus two that's going to be 7 0 5 minus 1 and I can go ahead and I can work out explicitly what this comes out at as you can see I'm doing here and in fact it will be 12 plus 20 minus 14 and it comes out as 18 so there we are we've worked out a 3x3 but we could have done it in a different way let's say we went along this bottom row that's fine so then it will be 5 and I will be left with 1/2 0 4 for my mini terminal and the next element alone a minus sign and it was a minus number anyway minus minus 1 there's going to be 3 7 4 that's just to see how we've done that 3 2 7 4 by deleting the bottom row and middle column of that now what about the third element here well we actually have a 0 plus 0 times some determinant I don't even care what that is because it's been multiplied by 0 that's the beauty of it so I've got 5 into 4 minus 0 and then we're going to have 4 3 to 12 14 that's going to give us 20 minus 2 is 18 same answer as before ok what about if we have even bigger determinants than our 3x3 example that if we have if we go bigger still we for example a 4x4 we're just going to break it up into a number of three by threes and each of those would have to be broken up into two by twos lots of work so here we are here's a general 4x4 we are going to expand it along a row or column let's say we want to expand it along this row for example and we'll take in turn ABCD and we'll need to know what sign to use so here's our checkerboard or a chessboard pattern of pluses and minuses just extend it out now to a four by four and you can see the rule here is that if you like if the row number plus the column number is an Eve number then there's gonna be a plus sign and if it's odd it's gonna be a minus sign you can confirm that for yourself look at this one it's gonna be at row two and column three and that's five and so that's a minus that's one way to remember it or just draw it out anyway we're going to use that rule so we go ahead and we write plus a and now we need to do the entire 3 by 3 determinant that we get when we delete the row and column with a unit so we just write out that little square block that we see it's quite easy to copy across and now we're gonna have minus B and we need to delete the row and column and then transcribe across the elements that are left as a three by three just being careful not to make any slips and you see that we're gonna continue to so let's delete this just be completely explicit I'll finish the job off so I think I hope it's obvious what we're doing we aren't a + C and now we're going to just have EF h i j l and m n p and then finally minus d on to what we get if we delete the top row and rightmost column which is left over then EF g IJ k and oh there we are that's how we handle a four by four each of these three by threes would then have to be evaluated and so on so a lot of work and that's the end of the video okay welcome to this fifth topic which is eigenvalues and eigenvectors will introduce the problem and we'll see how to find eigenvalues finding eigenvectors is for the next video so suppose that we are given a square matrix just some matrix but we are told that M multiplied by V is equal to lambda multiplied by V for some scalar just some number lambda and for some column matrix V and a column matrix of course the same as a vector I will just say vector from now on okay so this scalar lambda could be positive negative or zero meanwhile this vector V could be anything except the trivial boring case of just zeros it's something other than that our challenge then is that we're going to be given a square matrix N and we have to look for any scalar lambda and vector V that satisfies the equation and such a scalar is called an eigenvalue and such a vector is called an eigenvector so in that language M multiplied by some eigenvector gives us back that eigenvector just multiplied by a scalar the eigenvalue okay so first off let's notice that if we are given a candidate our possible eigen vector V to try perhaps for a multiple choice then it's easy to test we'll just go ahead and try it so here's a square matrix a 2 by 2 2 4 1 minus 1 and suppose we write down V is equal to 1 minus 1 and this is suggested as a possible eigenvector well then we would just test it out to see if it matches our equation we try multiplying M by V so here we go 2 4 1 minus 1 and V is 1 minus 1 it's a column and so we do Rho times column that's 2 and minus 4 is minus 2 again row and column that's gonna be one plus one is two and we notice we can take out minus 2 as a factor and then it will be the vector at left is one minus one but it is just V so minus 2 is indeed a scalar that multiplies V and we've succeeded in proving that V is our eigenvector and our eigen value that goes with it is minus 2 okay so that's great if we're given I can vectors to check out but what if we're not given any eigen vectors or eigen values then we must find any possible eigen values for ourselves there could be more than one and for each we must find the corresponding eigen vector V and in this first video we're just going to be finding those eigen values ok so here's a little bit of quick manipulation and aside we know that our equation is MV is equal to lambda V I can certainly just bring it all to the left hand side and write MV minus lambda V is equal to 0 sometimes I don't want to write that as vector 0 but now let's do something interesting let's insert the identity matrix which won't change the equation but it will be important for the next step and the minus lambda times the identity times V is equal to vector 0 the identity doesn't change the equation but now I can factor out both those two matrices the M and the minus lambda times the identity that's a matrix I can factor those out and it allows me to write that in line now that if form of the equation it turns out this can only be solved for any interesting V any the other than just zeros if the following equation is true which we can easily prove but we're not going to prove in this video M minus lambda times the identity the determinant of that is equal to 0 so we're gonna have plenty of time to think about that but let me just put a green box around it because that is the fundamental equation we're going to use this will allow to find all the eigen values that satisfy our basic eigenvalue equation so let's do an example it's the best thing let's do em as a 2 4 this was one we had before 4 one little square matrix and so let's write down what this lands at times the identity is for a 2 by 2 it's going to be lambda 0 0 lambda very simple and so this matrix that's the difference of the two of them 2 minus lambda 4 1 minus 1 minus lambda just the difference of those two things as a determinant is equal to 0 that's all so there we have it we've just subtracted lambda off the down the diagonal but now we need solve this so we just write out the determinant 2 minus lambda x minus 1 minus lambda down the diagonal minus 4 the off diagonal is equal to 0 all right so we expand this out plus lambda squared minus four equals zero let's come over here for a bit more space tidy that up a bit what if we got lambda squared minus lambda minus six is equal to zero can we solve this actually it's quite easy to factor that's going to be lambda minus 3 into lambda plus 2 is equal to 0 so that's true if either lambda is equal to 3 or it's equal to minus 2 and those are our two eigenvalues we found them using that equation in the square box let's crack on and do one with a 3x3 matrix M here we go matrix M is equal to let's have 2 1 3 1 minus 1 0 and minus 1 1 2 I've worked that while I checked that before and it will work for us nicely now let's remember of course the rule from the previous screen and we just need to apply that so let's go ahead and write it right our determinant out we need to have minus two minus lambda and then just 1 and minus 1 and then 1 minus 1 minus lambda and 3 0 to minus lambda I'm just subtracting lambdas down the diagonal making it a determinant setting equal to 0 now I'm gonna work along this row because it's got a zero in it so that makes me like it a bit more as a determinant the first number is gonna be minus 1 why because it's a 1 and let me just quickly write out our little lookup table of pluses and minuses for doing determinants so it was a 1 and then it picked up a minus sign and then we have the mini determinant that's made out of those four terms so that's 1 3 1 & 2 minus lambda all right and then the next term is gonna be plus and then it's gonna be the term itself is minus 1 minus lambda and the mini determinant that we get when we exclude that row and that column is just made out of the corner terms that's gonna be minus 2 minus lambda and 3 & 1 & 2 minus lambda and that's it because the zero term gives us nothing so there's only those two mini determinants let's write them out minus 1/2 times and then 3 times 1 is 3 expand that one out then this one has the term in front minus of 1 plus lambda and then we have to expand out the determinant minus 2 minus lambda times 2 minus lambda down the lead diagonal minus minus 3 is plus 3 there we are is equal to 0 and then we just need to tidy that up we need to clean it up a bit that's going to be minus of minus lambda minus 1 for the first term let's turn that it one into pluses multiply it through by the minus 1 and here we have minus let's make that lambda plus 1 write it that way around and then tidy up inside here we expand it out minus 4 plus 2 lambda minus 2 lambda plus lambda squared and this three is equal to zero need to keep on working to tidy that a bit more this term here is in fact going to be just I see the lambdas cancel out lambda squared minus one that's very nice that's come down very very neatly so now we can really tie to that up and we can take out a common factor of lambda plus one and the first term was just that so there's one for that and the second term we've just found is lambda squared minus one pause the video and check you agree that that's tied it up version of the equation now the way that can be 0 is either the first term is 0 which requires lambda is equal to minus one so there's one eigenvalue for us that's one option one of our eigen values has been found or the second term here has to be 0 so let's do a bit more work with that what we're saying is to neaten that up we're saying that two minus lambda squared is equal to 0 in other words lambda squared is equal to 2 and so lambda is going to be plus or minus square root of 2 that's two more eigen values three in all that we found for this three by three matrix and in the next video we'll see how to take each of these values and derive the corresponding vector this is the second of two videos that looks at eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the first video we have seen how to find eigenvalues and we write this as lambda for each lambda how do we find the eigenvector an eigenvector that goes with it we know that our fundamental equation that we're working with here is that when matrix M multiplies an eigen vector V it just gives us back that V scaled by lambda and another way to write that is the M minus lambda times the identity multiplied by V is equal to vector zero this is the same equation written two different ways what we need to know now that we have obtained our lambda values we just need to look at one of these equations and figure out an acceptable vector I find that it's more useful to use the form on the right hand side okay let's look at a particular example we'll have the matrix 2 4 1 minus 1 we looked at this before and we found already that its eigenvalues are equal to 3 and minus 2 what we're going to do now is we're going to take those values one at a time and figure out an acceptable eigenvector we're going to write our vector that we need to find as just X and y where we need to find these XY values now take a look at this green underlined equation and in particular the matrix which is a difference of two different matrices m and lambda times the identity now that we have our lambda value of 3 we could write out that difference that difference matrix it's going to be 2 minus 3 and then just 4 and then just 1 and minus 1 minus 3 there it is we're saying that when that multiplies our vector X Y it gives us 0 0 so let's go ahead and clean this equation up we have minus 1/4 1 minus 4 onto x and y it ought to be explicit about that we can multiply out it means minus X plus 4 y and X minus 4y and that we know is equal to 00 now what we immediately notice here is that whilst this this equation between two columns two column vectors is telling us two things it's actually telling us the same equation twice so we can see here that we're saying minus X plus 4y is equal to 0 we're also saying that X minus 4y is equal to 0 that's telling us the same thing is that a problem no that's exactly what we want to see at this stage we should find that when we work on eigenvalue and eigenvector problems based on a 2 by 2 matrix then really only one of these rows in the final expression constrains us and the other one doesn't add any new constraint so this is exactly what we want so now how do we go ahead and solve it we're saying that minus x plus 4y is equal to 0 of course we can just rearrange this to say instead that 4y is equal to X not the only constraint we have what we're allowed to do is choose we can choose the simplest values of x and y that will make this work so I'm going to choose Y is equal to 1 and then I'll find that X is equal to 4 and that is a perfectly acceptable eigenvector for one to go with my eigen value we will always have this freedom in choosing the elements of our eigenvector really this freedom simply corresponds to choosing how long the eigenvector is in other words its magnitude because if a particular eigen vector and eigen vector satisfies our equations a scaled version of that same eigenvector will still satisfy with the same eigenvalue now while the eigenvector can have any length we might specifically have been asked for a normalized eigen vector that simply means we need to take the one that we found and scale it to have unit length so in this case since it's for one we need to divide by root 17 to scale to unit length simple as that so there we are that's our eigen vector and a normalized version of it now we still haven't found the eigenvector for the other eigen value which is minus 2 let me just move this off on the screen to make space to do that at the bottom so here we go we do exactly the same procedure we subtract 2 on the diagonal 2 minus minus 2 and 4 and 1 minus 1 minus minus 2 lots of minus is there so let's tidy that up that's going to be 4 4 1 and in fact and then times X Y is equal to 00 as before we see that really these this is the same equation twice there's only one constraint and we can read it off simply as X is equal to minus y so if I choose X is equal to 1 for example then I'm going to write down an eigenvector 1 minus 1 but if I chosen Y is equal to 1 then it would have been minus 1 1 it doesn't matter they're both correct I can vectors to go with a power I can value but if we want to normalize well they need to divide by the magnitude 1 over root 2 ok so they're acceptable eigenvectors to go with the eigenvalue minus 2 ok so now let's find the eigenvectors that go with our eigenvalues for our 3 by 3 matrix M which was minus 2 1 3 1 minus 1 0 minus 1 1 2 we looked at that before in the previous video and we found the eigen values which were minus 1 root 2 and minus root 2 and I've put little subscripts on our Landers here so we know which one we're dealing with that's still with lambda 1 first which is the one that has value minus 1 so I'll write over here the little equation that we're using over and over again which is that M minus lambda times the identified identity multiplied by our vector is 0 ok we need this difference matrix so we subtract off the diagonal 1 minus minus 1 and then 1 3 1 and minus 1 minus minus 1 and 0 minus 1 and to minus minus one and that's on X Y and said because we now need an eigenvector with three elements and it's going to be equal to where simplify the matrix 2 minus 1 1 3 1 0 0 minus 1 and that'll be a 3 that again is on X Y Zed eigen vector is equal to 0 0 0 now what we immediately notice is that as before we don't really have three different equations captured by our matrix equation we only have two in fact this is very obvious in this case because the bottom row is the same as the top row that's not always the case it's not always the case that the rows are actually identical we will always find if we check that there are only really two independent equations when we're dealing with 3x3 eigenvalue problems we only have two equations really now I'm going to highlight this row here 1 0 0 that's just saying in fact but X is equal to 0 now if we take either the top or the bottom runner we have minus X plus y plus 3 Z is equal to 0 or Y is equal to minus 3z ok so now we simply choose any values of y&z X has been dictated to us but any values of I y&z that satisfy these rules so if I choose that is equal to 1 that's going to give me Y is equal to minus 3 and I can straight away then write down as satisfactory eigen vector it will be 0 minus 3 1 as simple as that it doesn't matter where the minus sign is I could equivalently chosen said is equal to minus 1 and then I'd have 0 3 minus 1 if I normalize then I'll need 1 over root 10 being 3 squared plus 1 squared and so that is a complete solution for our first wagon vector we found it in simple form and in normalized form this is the eigenvector that goes with eigenvalue minus 1 we can go ahead however and check this eigenvector to make sure that it works so for that we'll simply need to write out our matrix and the original matrix which was minus 2 1 3 1 minus 1 0 minus 1 1 2 we have our vector 0 3 minus 1 we just need to do this song so the first element is going to be minus 2 times 0 and then it's a 3 and I see there's a minus 3 so that does give us 0 and our second element is the only nonzero element will be minus 3 and our third third gives us 1 and we can write that as simply minus 1 on to 0 3 minus 1 and so indeed we found that this vector works with the eigenvalue of minus 1 now we can continue to look at to find the other eigen vectors but first let's take a pause and review the steps involved so we're looking at rules for solving eigen vector problems I can vector problem is where we have a square matrix M and we say that M multiplied by some special eigen vector gives us back that eigen vector times just by a value the eigen value we find the possible eigenvalues using this equation involving a determinant of a difference of two matrices in general there are going to be n solutions for an N by n matrix so two solutions for 2x2 three solutions three solutions for a 3x3 matrix that's because when we write the determinant it will have lambda to the power of n as its highest order so for example we have cubed to deal with when we're working out for 3x3 matrices now having found those eigenvalues we then for each value need to figure out an acceptable eigenvector what we've noticed is that generally we only have to use n minus 1 of the rows in the equation that we're working to satisfy and that meant just one row in the case of twobytwo problems and two of the rows in the 3x3 problems we had some freedom as to what values to choose for our eigenvector and in fact that freedom corresponds it to just scaling the entire eigenvector to a greater or smaller magnitude and if we were asked to normalize we would simply work it out using whatever values we like the simplest values and scale it at the last step so that it has unit length okay so we've covered a lot of ground for one video and this would be a good place to just stop watching if you like but I would like to carry on and solve the remaining two eigen vectors for our 3x3 example because they involve a square root 2 they're actually a bit more messy and tricky to do and in a way I think that makes for a good interesting example to see so let me go ahead and cut back to the screen that we had before with our matrix M spelt out and our possible eigenvalues and we'll now take the value lambda subscript 2 which is square root 2 so then as usual we need to subtract that down the diagonal so we'll have minus 2 minus square root 2 1 3 1 minus 1 minus square root 2 0 minus 1 1 2 minus square root 2 and that is the thing which when multiplied by our unknown eigenvector XYZ should give us 0 0 0 now one thing we notice here is the rows look all different it looks like we've got three different equations captured in this matrix equation but they are not if we examine them carefully enough we'd find that we can generate one of these rows from the other two and in fact we're only therefore going to need to use two of them you could pause the video and play with it and see if you can show this but it must always be the case unless we've made a slip earlier okay so I see that the middle row has a zero so I'm going to start with that one it says X plus minus 2 minus root 2 times y is equal to 0 and that means that if I choose a simple value for y of 1 then I can immediately say that X moving across is gonna be 1 plus root 2 good so now I'll use the top line which is minus 2 minus root 2 X plus y plus 3z is equal to 0 and I'll substitute in the values that I've already picked and inferred so I'm gonna get 1 plus root 2 on 2 minus 2 minus root 2 that's the X term plus the y is 1 plus 3z yet to be found is equal to 0 rearranged so put it on one side divided by 1/3 expand this thing out minus 2 minus root 2 2 root 2 minus 2 plus 1 all right oh and there's a minus sign because we've moved it all to the other side from the Z of course now we need to tie this up but what I notice is that inside the brackets I have a minus 3 and a minus 3 root 2 and that will cancel cancel with a factor of a minus in third of front and just give us a very simple expression of 1 plus root 2 so that's our Z term okay we've found a compatible set of x y&z values so we can now write down an accept acceptable eigenvector 1 plus root 2 1 1 plus root 2 there we are that is an acceptable eigenvector and here's where we found those numbers that goes with the eigenvalue lambda 2 is equal to the square root 2 note that i used the same subscript 2 on my vector so that i make it clear that lambda subscript 2 goes along with vector subscript 2 so now our only remaining task is to look at the third eigenvalue which was negative root 2 and find a compatible eigenvector for that one so as always what we need to do is take the vector M and subtract that the lambda value we found off down the diagonal and because we're subtracting minus a minus number we can just add it instead of course so that will be minus 2 plus root 2 and then 1 and then 3 and then 1 and minus 1 plus root 2 and 0 and minus 1 and 1 and 2 plus root 2 and that matrix when multiplied by unknown eigen vector XY said will give us 0 0 0 now as before our middle row looks nicest here it's just telling us that X plus 21 put it that way around Y times y is equal to zero that means if I chose Y is equal to one obvious choice then X is equal to one minus root 2 watching for signs now if I take that say the bottom row I can have minus X plus y plus 2 plus 2 root plus 2 plus root 2 times Z is equal to 0 but I can substitute in the values I found so that will say that square root 2 minus 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus root 2 Z is equal to 0 ok I've got some work to do to find out the value of Z here I'll start by rearranging just to put 2 plus root 2 Z is equal to minus root 2 on the other side but I still need to do a bit more work divide both sides I notice I can simplify simplified by a factor of root 2 I can write this as that is minus 1 over root 2 plus 1 pause the video check you agree with me and then I'm not happy with that because I don't want to leave Z as a fraction I could do but that would make a very messy looking I can vector I noticed there's a trick in up I have up my sleeve I know that if I multiply the top and bottom of a fraction like that by root 2 minus 1 it will simplify I will then find that the top of course is 1 minus root 2 but the bottom will be 2 plus root 2 minus root 2 minus 1 and that whole expression just comes down to 1 finally then Z is equal to 1 minus root 2 we've now found our XY and z values that are acceptable so we're seeing saying that vector 3 that goes with the lambda 3 value is 1 minus root 2 1 1 that is an acceptable mic inventor so we're done for our 3x3 matrix M we found that three eigenvalues and for each of them an eigenvector the last two of these which involve the root two were more tricky just because there was more particular COFF more messy expressions but the basic maths is the same every time
