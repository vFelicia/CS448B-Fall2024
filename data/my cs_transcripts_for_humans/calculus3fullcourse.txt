00:06 - calculus
00:07 - 3 calculus 3 takes a look at some
00:11 - different applications and more advanced
00:13 - uses of derivatives and integrals the
00:16 - actual calculus part of
00:18 - finding derivatives and finding
00:19 - integrals we're very comfortable with at
00:21 - this point we know how to do it all
00:23 - now we're going to see some uses of it
00:25 - and
00:26 - chapters five and six we're going to
00:28 - look at together
00:29 - and they look at these things called
00:30 - sequences and series we've got to lay a
00:32 - little bit of foundation with sequence
00:34 - in series first
00:35 - and then we'll start to see how the
00:37 - calculus plays into
00:39 - these so first to start this whole
00:41 - conversation off we're going to talk
00:43 - about sequences
00:44 - as we answer the question how
00:48 - do we work
00:52 - with sequences
01:00 - and really what a sequence is
01:06 - is an ordered
01:10 - list
01:13 - of numbers
01:18 - so for example 1
01:22 - 4 9 16
01:26 - we say the first number is one the
01:28 - second number is four the third number
01:29 - is nine the fourth number is 16
01:31 - they're in order in fact we usually
01:34 - label them
01:35 - a sub 1 is the first number a sub 2
01:39 - is the second number a sub 3
01:42 - is the third number and a sub 4
01:45 - is the fourth number and so on
01:49 - well with calculus we're often
01:51 - interested in the infinite
01:53 - so let's take a look at what is called
01:55 - an infinite
01:58 - sequence
02:03 - the idea of an infinite sequence is the
02:06 - sequence really
02:07 - never ends it starts with the first term
02:09 - then you'll see the second term
02:11 - then you'll see the third term and will
02:13 - keep going on and on and on
02:15 - forever there's no last term there's a
02:18 - first term but no
02:19 - last term and we'll often express the
02:22 - infinite sequence
02:23 - in one of two ways we can use what's
02:26 - called an explicit
02:29 - formula
02:34 - which can define
02:38 - each term
02:42 - you'll often see a sub n is equal to
02:46 - some function that defines each term
02:49 - at that function so if we want the fifth
02:51 - term a
02:52 - sub 5 we would just plug 5 into the
02:56 - function
02:57 - so for example
03:04 - in the sequence i have up above 14916
03:07 - you might notice those are all the
03:09 - perfect squares
03:10 - so we could express that as a sub n
03:14 - equals n squared and then when i want
03:18 - a sub 1 that's in
03:22 - the first term is 1 squared or 1.
03:26 - when i want the second term we plug 2 in
03:28 - we have 2 squared
03:30 - which is 4. when i want the third term
03:34 - we want three squared
03:38 - which is nine we're just plugging the
03:41 - subscript
03:44 - into the function to find out what that
03:46 - term
03:47 - is this way we could quickly find the
03:49 - tenth term by plugging 10
03:51 - in 10 squared is a hundred
03:54 - that's an explicit formula
03:58 - and we could keep going on and on and on
04:00 - with those
04:02 - but another way to express them
04:05 - is what's called a recurrence relation
04:16 - which can define
04:18 - [Music]
04:21 - each term
04:25 - based on a previous
04:28 - term
04:35 - so for example
04:39 - we might say okay the first term is
04:42 - equal to one
04:45 - and then the nth term
04:49 - is equal to the previous term a sub
04:52 - n minus one plus
04:55 - 2 n minus 1.
04:59 - so to get the next term we have to know
05:00 - the previous term and so we can build
05:03 - this
05:03 - recurrence relation one term at a time
05:07 - based on what happened previously so
05:09 - here for example a sub 1 we already know
05:12 - is 1.
05:13 - so a sub 2 the second term
05:17 - is the previous term which is 1
05:20 - plus 2 times the term number which is 2.
05:24 - minus one this makes the second term
05:28 - four
05:31 - if i want the third term a sub three we
05:34 - take the previous term
05:36 - which was four plus two times the term
05:40 - number
05:40 - three minus one
05:44 - and this becomes four plus six minus one
05:46 - which is nine
05:48 - and what you might notice is we're
05:49 - really building the same sequence this
05:51 - is the perfect squares
05:52 - 1 4 9 the next one is going to be
05:56 - 16. so there's different ways to
05:58 - represent the
05:59 - same sequence both explicitly and
06:02 - as a recurrence relation in terms of the
06:05 - previous
06:06 - terms now there are a couple sequences
06:09 - that are very important to us and so
06:11 - we're going to look at them
06:12 - separately
06:16 - we're going to look at what's called the
06:18 - arithmetic sequence
06:26 - and the idea of the arithmetic sequence
06:28 - is we have a common difference
06:36 - added to the previous
06:42 - term
06:47 - so for example i might have the number 5
06:52 - then 8 then 11
06:55 - then 14 and so on
06:58 - and what you see is happening in the
07:00 - sequence is we have a common difference
07:03 - of three that's being added to each term
07:06 - to get to the next term five plus three
07:08 - is eight eight plus three is eleven
07:10 - eleven plus three is fourteen we're
07:12 - adding
07:13 - three to get each term
07:16 - and we can represent an arithmetic
07:18 - sequence here with
07:20 - recursion
07:25 - by saying okay the first term
07:28 - is equal to five
07:32 - so the nth term is equal to the previous
07:36 - term
07:38 - and as we said above we're just going to
07:39 - always add three to the previous term
07:43 - maybe we could generalize this and say
07:46 - the first term
07:47 - is the first term whatever that is
07:51 - and the next term is the previous
07:55 - term plus that common difference
08:02 - although we also know how to express
08:04 - this with an
08:05 - explicit formula
08:12 - the explicit formula is going to be that
08:15 - any given term is equal to
08:19 - what we really have is a linear
08:21 - relationship we're going by three each
08:23 - time we really have a y equals
08:24 - mx plus b situation where we can take
08:27 - the common difference
08:30 - as our slope and we're going to have to
08:33 - say
08:33 - n minus 1
08:38 - plus the y-intercept or the starting
08:40 - value of 5.
08:42 - now we have to do n minus 1 instead of n
08:45 - with this y equals mx plus b
08:47 - because we don't call the first term the
08:49 - zeroth term
08:51 - but the y-intercept is the zeroth term
08:53 - so we're kind of
08:54 - staggered off by one unit
08:58 - so what we really have is our slope or
09:01 - common difference
09:09 - and we have our y-intercept or our
09:12 - starting number
09:20 - often we call that v so maybe generally
09:22 - we would say
09:23 - a sub n is equal to the common
09:25 - difference times n minus
09:27 - 1 plus the first term
09:32 - that's the arithmetic sequence
09:36 - another important sequence though that
09:37 - we work with is called the geometric
09:40 - sequence if the arithmetic sequence has
09:42 - a common difference that's always
09:44 - added the geometric sequence
09:52 - has a common ratio
09:58 - that is multiplied
10:06 - so for example we've got 4
10:11 - negative 12 36
10:15 - negative 108 and
10:18 - so on what you see here is from to move
10:21 - from one term to the next term to the
10:23 - next term
10:24 - we have a common ratio that we're
10:25 - multiplying by
10:27 - we're multiplying each term by negative
10:29 - three to get the next term
10:31 - 4 times negative 3 is negative 12
10:33 - negative 12
10:34 - times negative 3 is 36 and so on
10:39 - well if i wanted to express this with a
10:41 - recurrence relationship
10:45 - we again will say well the first term is
10:48 - equal to four
10:50 - and then to get that oops sorry the
10:52 - first term not the nth term
10:53 - the first term is equal to four and then
10:56 - to get the nth term
11:00 - just take the previous term n minus 1
11:03 - and multiply by that common difference
11:05 - of negative 3.
11:09 - maybe generally we say the first term is
11:12 - the first term and the nth term
11:15 - is that common ratio times the previous
11:18 - term
11:22 - but we can also express this with an
11:24 - explicit formula
11:29 - here we're multiplying by the same
11:31 - number over and over again
11:33 - repeated multiplication we should know
11:36 - is an exponential
11:38 - so we can take our first term
11:41 - times the ratio to the n minus 1 power
11:44 - telling us we multiply by negative 3
11:47 - over and over and over again
11:50 - here we have to do n minus 1 because the
11:52 - 4
11:53 - the first term a sub 1 is not multiplied
11:57 - by negative 3.
11:59 - so if we plug 1 in for the n you'll
12:01 - notice 1 minus 1 is 0
12:03 - negative 3 to the 0 is 1 and we're just
12:05 - left with 4 for the first term
12:08 - so we've got to be careful sometimes
12:09 - with that n minus 1 bit
12:11 - so kind of generally an explicit formula
12:15 - for a geometric sequence
12:16 - is the first number times the ratio to
12:21 - the n
12:21 - minus 1 gives us that geometric sequence
12:25 - we might even label that the 4 is the
12:27 - first term
12:29 - and the 3 is the ratio
12:35 - okay so if that's a geometric sequence
12:38 - we're ready to actually start combining
12:41 - what we know about arithmetic and
12:42 - geometric
12:43 - and also pattern recognition we're going
12:46 - to see
12:47 - if we can build and find
12:51 - explicit
12:55 - formulas
13:00 - and as we do this our general strategy
13:02 - is to just look for patterns
13:09 - and do a little guess and check
13:13 - because sometimes you have to try stuff
13:15 - is the exponent in
13:16 - is it n minus 1 is it in plus 1 let's
13:19 - guess and check a few
13:20 - and see how we do so for example if i
13:24 - have negative one-half
13:26 - comma two-thirds comma negative
13:29 - three-fourths comma four-fifths
13:34 - negative five sixth
13:39 - we're going to break this down and see
13:40 - what we observe
13:42 - first thing i observe is it's
13:46 - alternating
13:49 - it's going from negative to positive to
13:51 - negative to positive
13:53 - to negative and the way we can generate
13:56 - an
13:57 - alternating sequence like this is we
14:00 - just take negative 1
14:01 - raised to an exponent
14:04 - now i always check the first term the
14:06 - first term is negative
14:08 - so if i plug 1 in for n negative 1 to
14:11 - the first power
14:11 - is negative if the first term was
14:14 - positive we'd need to use
14:15 - n plus one so that we shift the negative
14:18 - sign
14:18 - down one so the first thing we saw
14:22 - is that we're alternating
14:26 - second thing i observe here is i just
14:28 - look at the numerators
14:32 - the numerators are counting 1 2
14:35 - 3 4 5
14:38 - and so on
14:43 - well what we see is the first term is a
14:45 - numerator of one the second term has a
14:47 - numerator of two
14:48 - the third is three the fourth is four
14:51 - that's just
14:52 - n the term number is the numerator one
14:55 - two three 4 5.
15:00 - when i look at the denominators
15:04 - they're a little different the
15:05 - denominators go 2 3 4
15:07 - 5 6 2 3 4
15:11 - five six i see the denominators are kind
15:15 - of a shift of one
15:16 - they don't start the first term doesn't
15:18 - start at one the first term starts at
15:20 - two
15:20 - it's always one more than the term
15:23 - number
15:24 - it's n plus one so the fifth term
15:28 - has a denominator of six one more than
15:30 - that
15:32 - and so when i put it all together what
15:34 - we end up with
15:39 - is that the nth term
15:42 - is alternating negative 1 to the n
15:46 - times the numerator of n divided by the
15:49 - denominator of n
15:50 - plus 1. and this becomes the explicit
15:54 - formula
15:56 - for our series
16:00 - let's try another one see if we can
16:02 - continue finding these patterns
16:05 - let's do three-fourths
16:09 - nine-sevenths
16:12 - twenty-seven over ten
16:15 - eighty-one over thirteen
16:20 - and so on
16:25 - if i look just at the numerators again
16:35 - the numerators are three nine
16:38 - twenty seven eighty one
16:44 - what i see is those are powers of three
16:46 - three to the first
16:48 - three to the second three to the third
16:50 - three to the fourth
16:52 - and that exponent is always matching the
16:54 - term numbers so
16:56 - three to the n seems to create my
16:58 - numerators
17:00 - so for the fourth term three to the
17:02 - fourth is eighty-one
17:04 - in the numerator
17:07 - in the denominator
17:11 - we've got 4 7 10 13
17:14 - 4 7 10 13.
17:19 - what i noticed there is we are adding 3
17:23 - to get the next term
17:26 - if we're adding 3 to get the next term
17:29 - what we actually have is an arithmetic
17:31 - sequence
17:32 - my arithmetic sequence says i can take
17:36 - the common difference of three
17:40 - times n minus one
17:43 - plus the starting number of four
17:47 - well let's simplify if i distribute the
17:49 - three three n minus three
17:51 - plus four combining like terms we have
17:54 - three
17:54 - n plus one
17:59 - so when i combine this together any term
18:03 - the numerator is 3 to the n
18:06 - the denominator is 3n plus 1.
18:09 - and we've got an explicit formula for
18:13 - what's going on with this sequence
18:17 - let's do another example then let's try
18:20 - 2 over 2 i know it's not reduced but
18:22 - we're going to go with it
18:24 - negative 4 over 10
18:27 - 12 over 50 and negative
18:30 - 48 over 250
18:37 - and so on
18:40 - again the first thing that i'll notice
18:42 - on something like this is we're going
18:43 - from positive to negative to positive to
18:46 - negative
18:47 - we're alternating again
18:54 - to get an alternating sequence we take
18:56 - negative one to some exponent
19:00 - the problem is is we've got our first
19:03 - term second term third term
19:06 - fourth term notice if we use the term
19:08 - number of 1
19:10 - plugging 1 in for n negative 1 to the
19:13 - first power is negative 1.
19:15 - our first term is not negative our first
19:17 - term is positive
19:19 - we've got the wrong signs we're set up
19:22 - for negative positive negative positive
19:24 - and this one's positive negative
19:26 - positive negative
19:28 - so to shift by 1 we just need to add 1
19:31 - to the exponent
19:32 - now when we plug 1 in we get 1 plus 1 is
19:35 - 2
19:36 - and negative 1 squared is a positive 1
19:38 - and we're set up for a positive negative
19:40 - alternation
19:44 - let's look at the numerators
19:48 - 2 4 12 48
19:56 - to go from 2 to 4 you might notice we
19:58 - multiply by 2
20:00 - but from 4 to 12 we multiply by 3
20:03 - and from 12 to 48 we multiply by four
20:07 - we're multiplying by one more number to
20:09 - get to 48 we have four times three times
20:11 - two
20:13 - to get to twelve we have three times two
20:15 - notice that counting down of
20:17 - multiplication
20:18 - we should recognize that as a factorial
20:21 - to get the fifth term it should be five
20:23 - times four times three times two times
20:25 - one
20:27 - however this doesn't quite work because
20:28 - the first term isn't one the first term
20:30 - is two
20:32 - plugging 1 and 1 factorial is 1 how do
20:34 - we get a 2
20:35 - well let's shift by multiplying that by
20:38 - 2.
20:39 - let's see if that works let's test that
20:41 - out on the third term
20:43 - the third term has a numerator of 12.
20:47 - well 3 factorial is 3 times 2 times 1
20:50 - which is 6
20:51 - times 2 is 12 and it looks like we've
20:54 - got our numerators figured out
20:56 - all that's left to look at then is the
21:00 - denominator
21:02 - the denominators are 2 10 50 250
21:06 - 2 10 50 250
21:09 - and what you might see there is we seem
21:11 - to be multiplying
21:14 - by five every time
21:20 - we know that if we're multiplying by 5
21:22 - every time that's a geometric sequence
21:24 - where we take our first
21:25 - term times the ratio
21:28 - to the n minus 1.
21:32 - and now if we put all of that together
21:36 - we can say the nth term is negative 1 to
21:40 - the n plus 1
21:43 - times 2 n factorial
21:46 - over 2 times 5 to the n minus 1.
21:53 - but one thing you might notice we've got
21:56 - twos in both the numerator and
21:57 - denominator
21:58 - we can divide those twos out so our
22:01 - reduced formula then becomes negative
22:03 - one to the n plus one
22:05 - n factorial over five to the n
22:10 - minus one
22:16 - so that's kind of how we can play and
22:18 - observe patterns in order to
22:20 - find the nth term of any geometric
22:23 - or any sequence really whether it's
22:25 - geometric arithmetic or neither
22:28 - but sometimes we're more interested in
22:31 - as
22:31 - these terms go out as these terms get to
22:34 - the infinitieth
22:35 - term kinda what's the last term
22:38 - approaching we call
22:42 - this the limit
22:47 - of the sequence
22:52 - are the terms getting closer and closer
22:54 - to
22:55 - some number are they asymptotically
22:57 - getting closer to some value
22:59 - or what is
23:03 - the infinitieth
23:07 - term
23:12 - well to do that we will say
23:17 - if the limit
23:20 - as n goes to infinity of a sub
23:23 - n of all the terms is equal to some
23:26 - limit
23:27 - l that means the sequence
23:33 - is approaching
23:41 - l as in
23:45 - becomes large
23:51 - if this happens if it approaches a
23:54 - specific limit we
23:55 - say then the sequence
24:02 - is convergent
24:08 - or the sequence converges to a specific
24:11 - number
24:14 - kind of the opposite case then is if the
24:17 - limit as
24:18 - n goes to infinity of the terms
24:22 - does not approach
24:28 - a value l
24:33 - it is called
24:36 - a divergent
24:40 - sequence
24:45 - let's do some examples
24:52 - got quite a few of these to look at
24:57 - let's take the explicit formula
25:01 - of one minus
25:04 - one half raised to the n power
25:10 - well if we take the limit as n goes to
25:13 - infinity
25:15 - of one minus one half to the n power
25:20 - we end up with one minus and one half
25:23 - times one half times one half is getting
25:25 - smaller and smaller and smaller
25:27 - that's approaching zero and so one minus
25:30 - zero equals one
25:33 - therefore as n gets really large these
25:36 - terms are getting closer and closer to
25:37 - one we can say that this series
25:40 - converges
25:42 - or the sequence converges sorry
25:43 - converges to one
25:50 - let's try the sequence
25:53 - one plus three n
25:56 - well if we take the limit as n goes to
25:58 - infinity
25:59 - of 1 plus 3n
26:05 - well we know that becomes 1 plus 3
26:08 - times as n gets huge it becomes infinity
26:12 - basically these numbers are just going
26:14 - to get bigger and bigger because we're
26:16 - always just adding 3 each time
26:18 - this sequence diverges because it goes
26:22 - off to
26:23 - infinity
26:28 - how about the sequence three n to the
26:31 - fourth minus seven
26:32 - n squared plus five
26:35 - over six minus four n to the fourth
26:41 - well if we took the limit as n goes to
26:44 - infinity
26:45 - of that entire thing
26:48 - we know from our work with limits that
26:50 - the largest exponent is going
26:52 - to take over
26:56 - and that largest exponent is the fourth
26:58 - powers
26:59 - and basically the fourth powers take
27:00 - over and we get three over negative four
27:05 - and this series does converge i'm sorry
27:08 - the sequence does converge
27:13 - to negative three-fourths
27:19 - now we have a good friend named
27:20 - l'hopital that can help us with these
27:22 - as well let's say we've got a sequence
27:26 - that's two to the n power over n squared
27:33 - we would try and take the limit as n
27:35 - goes to infinity of 2 to the n
27:37 - over n squared to see if it approaches a
27:39 - value
27:41 - but the numerator goes off to infinity
27:43 - and the denominator goes off to infinity
27:47 - so what we can do is we can apply
27:49 - l'hopital's rule
27:51 - and take the derivative of the numerator
27:53 - and denominator
27:55 - and see what limit that gives us
27:58 - the derivative of 2 to the n is 2 to the
28:00 - n times the natural log of 2
28:03 - over the derivative of n squared is 2n
28:10 - but those still are each going off to
28:14 - infinity
28:17 - so that doesn't help us so i guess we'll
28:19 - take another
28:20 - derivative so we have the limit as n
28:23 - goes to infinity
28:26 - the derivative of 2 to the n is still 2
28:28 - to the n natural log of two
28:30 - times the constant natural log of two
28:34 - all over the derivative of the
28:35 - denominator which is two
28:39 - and now what you see happening is the
28:41 - numerator
28:42 - natural log of 2 squared that's just a
28:44 - constant divided by 2 that's just a
28:46 - constant but this numerator 2 to the n
28:49 - goes off to infinity we have infinity
28:52 - divided by 2
28:53 - which is still infinity
28:57 - so this series or this sequence diverges
29:02 - the sequence diverges because it goes to
29:05 - infinity
29:09 - let's do one more with our friend
29:11 - l'hopital
29:13 - let's say the nth term is five n squared
29:16 - plus
29:17 - one over e to the n
29:22 - again the numerator is off to infinity
29:24 - and the denominator is off to infinity
29:27 - so we can use l'hopital's rule to say
29:29 - that the limit as n goes to infinity
29:32 - is the derivative 10 n over the
29:35 - derivative e to the n
29:39 - but as n goes to infinity these are
29:40 - still both going off to infinity
29:44 - so we'll do l'hopital's rule again the
29:47 - limit as n goes to infinity
29:49 - of 10 over e to the n
29:54 - and now when we plug infinity in
29:57 - e to the infinity is infinity we're
29:59 - taking 10
30:00 - divided by a very large number
30:04 - basically we end up with zero this
30:07 - sequence
30:08 - converges it's a convergent
30:12 - series
30:17 - now sometimes we can't just take the
30:19 - limit very clearly and see what it's
30:21 - approaching
30:22 - so we need a slightly different strategy
30:25 - and there is another nice strategy that
30:27 - we can use sometimes not always
30:30 - but it works out nice when it does with
30:32 - what are called
30:34 - bounded sequences
30:40 - and the idea of a bounded sequence is
30:43 - all the terms
30:51 - are smaller
30:56 - than a constant
31:02 - that's called bounded
31:05 - above because they're never going to be
31:09 - bigger than this constant number
31:15 - and or
31:19 - all the terms
31:23 - are larger
31:27 - than a constant
31:31 - and that's what we call bounded below
31:43 - for example
31:51 - a sub n equals 1 over n
31:55 - is bounded
31:59 - above by one
32:03 - and below by zero
32:08 - what you see is the first term when we
32:10 - plug one it is one over one
32:12 - which is one then it's one-half
32:16 - one-third one-fourth one-fifth
32:19 - they're gonna get smaller and smaller
32:21 - but they're never gonna get to zero
32:24 - so it's always smaller than one bounded
32:26 - above by one
32:27 - but always bigger than zero bounded
32:29 - below
32:30 - by zero and this idea of being
32:34 - bounded is very useful
32:39 - because of what we call the monotone
32:45 - convergence
32:54 - theorem
32:56 - if we are bounded above
33:02 - means i'm never larger than some number
33:06 - and increasing so i'm always getting
33:10 - larger
33:13 - then the sequence
33:16 - converges
33:21 - kind of visually what we're talking
33:22 - about is let's say we're bounded above
33:26 - by some constants we'll call it c
33:33 - my series is always increasing
33:36 - but it's never going to get bigger than
33:38 - that constant you can see it's going to
33:40 - kind of converge
33:41 - to that constant
33:46 - it's approaching some number
33:50 - and really the opposite is also true
33:53 - if we are
33:58 - bounded below
34:02 - and decreasing
34:07 - then the sequence
34:11 - converges
34:16 - and visually that's almost the same
34:17 - thing we've got some
34:19 - constant c
34:22 - and the series is always decreasing
34:25 - i'm sorry the sequence is always
34:27 - decreasing but it's never going to pass
34:29 - that c
34:30 - it's going to get closer and closer to
34:31 - that c we see it converges
34:36 - at that point
34:39 - let's do one example
34:43 - where we can see this work out
34:48 - let's say a sub n is equal to
34:52 - 4 to the n over n
34:55 - factorial
34:58 - okay what we'll do then is we'll look at
35:02 - the next
35:02 - term to see if it's getting smaller or
35:04 - getting bigger
35:06 - the next term
35:09 - oops the next term a sub n plus one
35:18 - is equal to four to the n plus one
35:22 - over n plus one factorial
35:28 - but we can break that up a little bit 4
35:30 - to the n plus 1
35:31 - is really 4 times 4 to the n
35:37 - over and n plus 1 factorial is really
35:43 - the n factorial
35:46 - or let's if we break it out into its
35:48 - terms the first term
35:50 - is n plus one
35:53 - break it out into its factors not terms
35:56 - times the next term is n then n minus 1
35:58 - n minus 2 that's really n factorial
36:02 - which means we've broken this up into
36:04 - two fractions
36:06 - we have 4 over n plus 1
36:09 - times 4 to the n over n factorial
36:17 - what we see is we're taking the previous
36:20 - term
36:21 - and multiplying it by four over n plus
36:24 - one
36:28 - when we multiply by 4 over n plus 1 with
36:30 - large numbers of
36:31 - n because we're always interested at
36:34 - infinity
36:35 - if n is large 4 over
36:38 - n plus one
36:45 - we're really multiplying by a really
36:46 - small number we're multiplying by four
36:48 - over infinity we're
36:49 - we're not really multiplying by much
36:50 - it's always going to be positive
36:56 - four over n plus one is getting smaller
37:02 - but never negative
37:10 - this means we are bounded
37:14 - below by zero
37:19 - and decreasing
37:24 - each term is smaller than the previous
37:26 - term because we multiply by some
37:28 - fraction
37:29 - four over a large number and it's
37:30 - smaller and smaller and smaller
37:32 - and it's decreasing decreasing
37:34 - decreasing but it's never going to pass
37:35 - zero so therefore by the monotone
37:38 - convergence theorem
37:40 - we know therefore the sequence
37:48 - converges
37:53 - and that's how we can use the monotone
37:55 - convergence
37:56 - theorem so this is a little introduction
38:00 - to sequences to in our next video we're
38:03 - going to look at what we can do with
38:05 - sequences
38:06 - in a little bit more of a useful fashion
38:07 - but today we're just trying to get
38:09 - familiar with using those sequences
38:11 - expressing them as an explicit formula
38:14 - finding out if they converge
38:15 - so take a look at your homework practice
38:17 - a few of these and we'll discuss them
38:19 - more
38:20 - in class now while
38:23 - sequences are very interesting to take a
38:26 - look at what we're
38:26 - more interested in with calculus is what
38:30 - are called
38:31 - series specifically infinite series
38:34 - so our question is going to be how do we
38:37 - work
38:43 - with infinite
38:48 - series
38:52 - and first let's define what exactly we
38:54 - mean by
38:56 - an infinite series
39:02 - basically a series is a sum of a
39:05 - sequence
39:06 - it is a sum
39:09 - of an infinite
39:13 - number of terms
39:16 - and we'll write it with this notation
39:18 - we'll take the sum
39:20 - as our n goes from 1 to infinity
39:23 - of each of the terms a sub n
39:26 - which basically means we take the first
39:28 - term and add the second term and add the
39:31 - third term
39:32 - and just keep adding all the way up
39:35 - to infinity
39:39 - kind of an example of this
39:44 - might be to say that the sum of some
39:47 - number of
39:48 - terms is equal to the sum
39:51 - as n goes from 1 to infinity
39:54 - of maybe n over n plus one
39:59 - so if i want the first sum that's just
40:01 - the sum of the first term
40:03 - the first term is one over one plus one
40:07 - which is really just saying one half
40:10 - or as a decimal 0.5
40:15 - the second sum then says take the first
40:19 - term which was one half and add the
40:22 - second term which now is putting two in
40:25 - for n
40:26 - two over two plus one or
40:29 - one half plus two thirds
40:32 - which is equal to about 1.17
40:36 - and change
40:40 - so if i want the third sum that means
40:41 - we're going to add the first three terms
40:43 - the first term was one half
40:45 - plus the second term was two-thirds plus
40:48 - the third term which is
40:50 - three over three plus one
40:53 - or one half plus two thirds
40:57 - plus three fourths
41:00 - now my sum is equal to about 1.92 and
41:05 - change and we could keep doing this but
41:09 - ultimately what we're interested
41:11 - in is if these are kind of the partial
41:14 - sums
41:15 - the first sum the second sum the third
41:17 - sum we're interested in kind of what
41:19 - happens with the
41:20 - entire sum
41:23 - so we've got these things called the kth
41:26 - partial sum
41:31 - we'll call it s sub k is equal to the
41:34 - sum
41:34 - as n goes from 1 to k instead of
41:38 - infinity
41:39 - of each of the individual terms
41:47 - well if the partial sum
41:54 - diverges goes to infinity
41:58 - then the whole series
42:06 - will diverge as well
42:11 - and if the partial sum
42:16 - converges
42:20 - then the whole sum
42:24 - or the whole series
42:28 - will converge as well
42:34 - let's take a look at what that means in
42:37 - an example
42:44 - we've been talking about the sum as n
42:47 - goes from one to infinity of
42:49 - n over n plus one and
42:53 - uh we found out that the sum of the
42:56 - first
42:56 - term was equal to one half the sum of
43:00 - the second term
43:01 - was one half plus two
43:05 - thirds the sum of the first three terms
43:10 - was one half plus two-thirds
43:13 - plus three-fourths and the sum of the
43:16 - fourth term
43:17 - is one-half plus two-thirds plus
43:21 - three-fourths plus four-fifths
43:24 - and so on and what we're interested in
43:28 - is if we kept going
43:32 - what would we know about the kth sum
43:36 - does it converge or diverge to a
43:38 - specific
43:40 - value well what i notice is
43:43 - if i look at each one of these terms
43:46 - they're either one half or bigger than a
43:50 - half
43:51 - one half or bigger and bigger than a
43:53 - half one-half
43:54 - and bigger and bigger and bigger than a
43:57 - half
43:58 - what i could say is that the first term
44:01 - is greater than equal to one-half times
44:04 - the number of
44:05 - terms which is one therefore the second
44:09 - one is going to be greater than or equal
44:10 - to
44:11 - one-half times the two terms because
44:13 - two-thirds
44:14 - is bigger than the one-half and then the
44:17 - third
44:19 - series is one-half times three
44:22 - we've got one half times the three terms
44:24 - but our answer is going to be bigger and
44:26 - similarly we're going to be bigger than
44:28 - one half times the fourth term
44:30 - which means ultimately the last k
44:33 - is going to be greater than or equal to
44:35 - one half
44:36 - times the k number of terms
44:41 - but here's the catch with that
44:45 - if i were to take the limit of this
44:47 - stuff
44:49 - the limit as that k term
44:52 - goes to infinity of one half of k
44:56 - we know that is equal to infinity
45:00 - because we're just taking one half times
45:02 - a large number it's still a large number
45:05 - therefore we can conclude that this
45:07 - series
45:08 - is unbounded
45:13 - and that the sum as n goes from one to
45:16 - infinity
45:18 - of n over n plus 1 is just going to keep
45:21 - getting larger
45:22 - and larger and larger ultimately
45:27 - this series diverges
45:31 - because the k-th term diverges
45:35 - but this is not always the case
45:39 - let's take a look at another example
45:44 - let's take a look at the sum as n goes
45:47 - from one to infinity
45:49 - of one over n times n
45:52 - plus one
45:58 - to get an idea of an example of what's
46:00 - happening
46:01 - let's take the individual first
46:04 - few sums the first sum is just the first
46:07 - term
46:08 - 1 over 1 times 2.
46:14 - which is one half
46:17 - the second sum is equal to
46:20 - that first term of one half plus one
46:24 - over two times three
46:27 - which turns out to be one-half plus 1
46:30 - 6 which is equal to two-thirds
46:36 - the third sum is the two-thirds the
46:40 - prior sums
46:42 - plus the third term which is one over
46:46 - three times
46:47 - four or two thirds plus
46:50 - one twelfth which is equal to
46:53 - three fourths
46:57 - and with this one you might start to
46:59 - notice a pattern approaching for what
47:01 - each term is equal to
47:03 - can you tell what the fourth sum is
47:05 - going to be
47:06 - 3 4 plus the 1 over four times
47:10 - five is equal to three fourths plus one
47:13 - over
47:13 - twenty which turns out to be four
47:17 - fifths
47:20 - did you catch the pattern the kth term
47:24 - is going to be equal to
47:28 - notice our numerators are always equal
47:31 - to the term number
47:32 - k over the denominators are one more
47:36 - than the term number
47:38 - k plus 1.
47:42 - so this time if i were to take the limit
47:45 - of that stuff
47:47 - as k goes to infinity as we get to the
47:50 - infinitieth
47:50 - term
47:54 - of k over k plus 1
47:57 - we know the ks are going to get really
47:58 - large the plus 1 isn't going to really
48:01 - matter
48:01 - and this is ultimately going to be
48:04 - 1.
48:08 - therefore
48:11 - we know that the sum as n goes from one
48:14 - to infinity not just
48:15 - k of one over n times n plus one
48:21 - is equal to one
48:25 - therefore i know this series converges
48:31 - basically as we get more and more terms
48:34 - added
48:34 - in we're going to get closer and closer
48:37 - to the number one
48:39 - so we converge
48:43 - that's kind of a really brief
48:44 - introduction to deciding if series
48:47 - converge or
48:48 - diverge i want to talk about three
48:50 - special series
48:52 - that come up quite a bit as we work
48:54 - through series
48:55 - and the first one is one of the most
48:58 - famous series of calculus
49:00 - it is called the harmonic
49:03 - series and the harmonic series
49:08 - is the sum as n goes from one to
49:11 - infinity
49:12 - of one over n
49:16 - basically it's one over one or one plus
49:19 - one over two
49:20 - plus one over three plus one over four
49:23 - plus one over five one over six and so
49:26 - on and so forth
49:29 - we should recognize this harmonic series
49:33 - quickly as we continue to study in
49:36 - calculus
49:37 - here well let's take a look at what's
49:40 - happening
49:41 - with that harmonic series
49:45 - first let's take a look at the first sum
49:49 - well the first sum is one over one
49:51 - that's just one
49:54 - the second sum is one plus one over
49:58 - two the third sum
50:01 - is one plus one half plus
50:04 - one third and the fourth sum
50:09 - is one plus one half plus one third
50:12 - plus one fourth
50:16 - and now what i want to do is stop here
50:17 - for a moment
50:19 - and take a look at these last two terms
50:25 - one-third plus one-fourth
50:31 - notice one-third is bigger than
50:33 - one-fourth each term is bigger than the
50:35 - next
50:36 - term after it which means this is bigger
50:38 - than
50:39 - one-fourth plus one-fourth if i replace
50:42 - the one-third with something smaller the
50:44 - one-fourth
50:45 - we end up with something smaller well
50:48 - one-fourth plus one-fourth
50:50 - is one-half
50:56 - so the sum of the first terms
50:59 - is greater than one plus one-half
51:03 - and i'm going to say one-half times two
51:05 - because we've got the first
51:07 - half and then the next one's bigger than
51:10 - another
51:11 - one-half
51:16 - similarly
51:19 - if i kept going all the way down to the
51:23 - eighth sum the eighth sum
51:26 - is one plus one-half plus one-third
51:30 - plus one-fourth plus one-fifth plus
51:33 - one-sixth
51:34 - plus one-seventh plus one-eighth
51:41 - and we've already established that
51:43 - one-third plus one-fourth
51:46 - that part is greater than one-half
51:51 - but what's interesting is if i looked at
51:52 - all the other terms the next four terms
51:56 - what i have is that the one-fifth
51:59 - plus one-sixth plus one-seventh plus
52:02 - 1 8 1 8 being the smallest
52:07 - meaning all four of those are bigger
52:09 - than if they had all been replaced with
52:10 - 1 8 plus 1 8
52:12 - plus 1 8 plus 1 8
52:16 - and 4 8 adds up to one
52:19 - half
52:23 - so the eighth sum is greater than one
52:27 - plus one half
52:31 - times three
52:34 - because we've got a half another half
52:38 - and the next four terms add up to a half
52:41 - and in fact
52:45 - in general if we were to continue
52:49 - this pattern out
52:55 - s sub 2 to the n power
52:58 - it has to be a power of two notice the
53:00 - ones we played with
53:02 - were the fourth power and the eighth
53:03 - power the next one half would come off
53:06 - of the sixteenth
53:07 - power but it will always be greater than
53:10 - one plus one half times
53:14 - whatever that exponent is on the two
53:19 - so for example with the
53:22 - eighth sum eight is two to the third we
53:25 - had
53:26 - three one halves multiplied together
53:29 - which means on the sixteenth there'll be
53:31 - four one-halfs
53:33 - added to the one
53:36 - we said though if we can take the limit
53:38 - as n goes to infinity of the sum
53:42 - which is one plus one half of n
53:46 - this one gets there really slowly but as
53:48 - the n gets larger and larger and larger
53:51 - half of infinity is still infinity and
53:54 - if you add one you still get infinity
53:56 - so therefore the
54:00 - partial sums diverge
54:03 - to infinity which means
54:08 - the big idea in fact let's change colors
54:10 - we'll do this in brown
54:13 - therefore the harmonic
54:16 - series
54:20 - also diverges to
54:24 - infinity
54:27 - the sum is n goes from one to infinity
54:32 - of one over n which is one
54:35 - plus one half plus one-third plus
54:38 - one-fourth
54:39 - and so on
54:42 - is going to equal to infinity the
54:44 - harmonic
54:45 - series diverges this is one of the
54:49 - most important series of calculus and we
54:53 - should recognize that whenever we have
54:54 - the sum of one over n
54:56 - it will always go to infinity very
54:59 - slowly
55:00 - but it still diverges
55:05 - so that's the first important series the
55:07 - harmonics series
55:09 - the second of three important series i
55:11 - want you to see today are what is called
55:13 - the geometric
55:14 - series
55:17 - and it comes from the geometric sequence
55:21 - the geometric sequence was some number
55:25 - then some number times the ratio then
55:29 - some number
55:29 - times the ratio squared because we kept
55:32 - multiplying
55:33 - by that ratio
55:36 - and so the geometric series says we're
55:38 - going to add those all together
55:40 - a plus a times r plus a times r squared
55:42 - plus a times r cubed
55:44 - in other words we're taking the sum as n
55:47 - goes from
55:47 - one to infinity of
55:51 - a times r to the n minus one
55:57 - it turns out and the proof is a lot more
55:59 - involved but it turns out that this
56:02 - geometric series will diverge
56:07 - actually i'll write the series again
56:09 - here because we're going to highlight
56:10 - this is
56:11 - very important the sum as n goes from 1
56:14 - to infinity
56:15 - of a times r to the n minus 1.
56:20 - it will diverge
56:24 - if the absolute value of r the common
56:26 - ratio is greater than or equal to 1.
56:33 - and if the absolute value of the ratio
56:36 - is less than one
56:39 - it converges
56:42 - to whatever a
56:46 - divided by one minus r is
56:49 - so the geometric series which we should
56:52 - recognize
56:54 - diverges if our ratio is greater than or
56:57 - equal to one
56:59 - and it converges if the ratio is less
57:01 - than one
57:06 - let's take a look at some examples
57:09 - let's take a look at the sum as n goes
57:11 - from one to infinity
57:15 - of negative three to the n plus one
57:19 - over four to the n minus one
57:26 - we have to be careful here because this
57:27 - isn't quite a geometric series
57:30 - yet let's take a look at what this
57:32 - series is doing
57:34 - and see if we can convert it into the
57:36 - right
57:37 - form of the geometric series
57:40 - so starting when n is one we end up with
57:44 - negative three squared
57:48 - over four to the zero power
57:53 - plus when n is 2 we have negative 3
57:56 - cubed
57:57 - over 4 to the first power
58:00 - plus we've got negative 3 to the fourth
58:04 - over 4 to the second power and so on and
58:07 - so forth
58:12 - which means what we really have four to
58:14 - the zero is just
58:15 - one so this is really just saying
58:17 - negative three squared
58:20 - plus negative 3 that negative 3 squared
58:24 - gets multiplied
58:27 - by another negative 3 over 4.
58:32 - plus then that negative 3 squared
58:36 - is multiplied this time by a negative 3
58:39 - over
58:39 - 4 twice giving us a total of 4 in the
58:43 - numerator
58:44 - and 2 in the denominator
58:47 - and so on which means really what we
58:51 - have
58:52 - is positive 9 plus 9 times negative 3
58:56 - 4 plus 9 times
59:00 - negative 3 4 squared plus
59:05 - and so on and what we
59:09 - see
59:12 - is the starting value
59:15 - for this series is nine
59:20 - and the ratio that we're being
59:22 - multiplied by
59:24 - is negative three-fourths the negative
59:27 - three-fourths squared
59:28 - the negative three-fourths cubed and so
59:31 - on
59:32 - because that ratio is smaller than 1 the
59:35 - absolute value is smaller than 1
59:38 - we know it converges
59:42 - to the starting value
59:46 - over one plus
59:50 - or actually one minus the ratio which is
59:54 - negative three-fourths
59:57 - well let's clean up that fraction by
59:59 - multiplying by 4 all the way across
60:02 - and we get 36 over 4
60:05 - plus 3 or 36
60:09 - over 7.
60:13 - so this series as it gets closer and
60:16 - closer to infinity
60:18 - is ultimately going to converge to 36
60:21 - sevenths getting closer and closer
60:24 - because the ratio
60:25 - is smaller than one or the absolute
60:27 - value of the ratio
60:32 - let's compare that to the sum as n goes
60:35 - from 1 to infinity
60:36 - of e to the 2n
60:39 - now i could rewrite this
60:43 - because that e to the 2n is really e
60:46 - squared to the n
60:46 - power as the sum as n goes from 1
60:50 - to infinity of e squared raised to the n
60:53 - power what we see here is we're
60:55 - multiplying
60:57 - each term gets multiplied
61:00 - by e squared and then e squared and then
61:03 - times an e
61:04 - squared what we're really doing is we've
61:05 - got a ratio
61:07 - of e squared being multiplied over and
61:10 - over again
61:12 - the problem is e squared is greater than
61:14 - one
61:16 - whenever the ratio is greater than one
61:19 - we know the entire
61:20 - series diverges to infinity
61:27 - so that's the geometric series it
61:30 - diverges if the absolute value of the
61:32 - ratio is greater than one
61:34 - and it converges if the absolute value
61:36 - of the ratio
61:38 - is less than one
61:41 - one last series i want to talk about
61:44 - it's called
61:45 - the telescoping series
61:52 - this one doesn't come up much but when
61:54 - it does it's really nice
61:56 - it is a series
62:00 - where most terms
62:05 - subtract
62:08 - out
62:12 - what i mean is in general
62:16 - we've got the sum as n goes from one to
62:19 - infinity
62:21 - of one term minus the next term
62:25 - that comes after it in other words what
62:28 - you end up with
62:29 - is the first term minus the second term
62:34 - and then when n is two we get plus the
62:37 - second term
62:38 - minus the third term and then when n is
62:41 - three we do plus the third term
62:44 - minus the fourth term and so
62:48 - on and so forth
62:53 - all the way up to basically infinity
62:57 - and what you see happening is the second
62:59 - subtracts out with the
63:01 - next and then the next one subtracts out
63:03 - with the next one
63:04 - and so on until we end up with
63:09 - the kth partial sum is equal to the
63:12 - first term
63:13 - minus the last term
63:18 - well if the limit as
63:21 - k goes to infinity of b sub
63:24 - k converges
63:28 - in other words that last term is
63:29 - approaching a specific number not
63:31 - infinity or negative infinity
63:35 - then the partial sum also converges
63:45 - so if i have a telescoping series where
63:48 - we're subtracting out the next
63:50 - term it's going to basically come out to
63:54 - the first term
63:56 - minus the last term
63:59 - if the limit converges
64:04 - so for example
64:10 - if we're working with the sum as n goes
64:12 - from one to infinity
64:15 - of the cosine of one over n
64:18 - minus the cosine of one over n plus one
64:25 - if i recognize we've got a telescoping
64:27 - series that we're subtracting the cosine
64:29 - of the next
64:30 - term every two terms is going to
64:33 - subtract out
64:34 - all the way down to the kth term which
64:36 - is the cosine of the first term
64:39 - 1 over 1 which is 1 minus the cosine of
64:43 - the last term
64:44 - which is 1 over k plus 1.
64:50 - well if i think about the limit as k
64:53 - goes to infinity of the cosine of one
64:56 - over k
64:57 - plus one
65:02 - ultimately as k gets huge we have one
65:04 - divided by a huge number which is zero
65:07 - and the cosine of 0 is 1.
65:12 - so overall
65:17 - this series converges
65:23 - to the cosine of one
65:27 - minus the very last term at infinity is
65:29 - going to be one
65:34 - and we found the sum of this telescoping
65:37 - series
65:40 - let's do one more
65:44 - let's do the sum as n goes from one
65:48 - to infinity of e to the one over n
65:52 - minus e to the one over n plus one
65:55 - notice we are subtracting the next term
65:58 - n plus one
66:01 - so then i know the k partial sum
66:05 - is e to the one over one or e to the
66:07 - first power
66:09 - everything else subtracts out all the
66:11 - way down down to the last one
66:12 - of e to the one over k plus one
66:18 - so what we think about is what is the
66:19 - limit as k goes to infinity
66:22 - of the last term e to the 1 over k plus
66:25 - 1.
66:29 - well again 1 over k plus 1 ends up going
66:32 - to
66:32 - 1 over infinity which becomes 0 and e to
66:36 - the 0
66:37 - is 1. and so what we find
66:40 - out is if that converges then the entire
66:43 - sum
66:44 - converges the sum
66:47 - is equal to e minus the last term
66:51 - here is approaching one
66:55 - and that gives us our telescoping series
67:00 - so we've taken a look at these infinite
67:02 - series and begun to play with them we
67:05 - talked about the harmonic series
67:06 - geometric series and telescoping series
67:08 - three important series as we continue
67:10 - moving forward
67:12 - and we're playing with this idea of when
67:14 - does it converge and when does it
67:16 - diverge
67:17 - in our future lessons we're going to
67:18 - talk about some tests we can do to get a
67:20 - better idea
67:21 - about when it's converging and diverging
67:23 - but for now take a look at your homework
67:25 - assignment
67:26 - practice those and come to class with
67:29 - questions
67:32 - as we're working with series the big
67:34 - question we're really interested in
67:36 - is does the series go to infinity or
67:38 - does the series add up to a finite
67:41 - number so that's going to be our
67:42 - question that drives us today
67:45 - how do we know
67:51 - if a series converges
67:58 - meaning goes to a specific number or
68:02 - diverges meaning goes to infinity
68:06 - and actually this is the question that's
68:08 - going to keep with us throughout this
68:09 - entire unit
68:11 - does the series converge or does the
68:13 - series diverge we're actually more
68:14 - interested in whether or not it
68:16 - converges or diverges
68:17 - then what it actually adds up to
68:21 - so the first way we can do this and this
68:23 - is really the first
68:24 - test we should always do when trying to
68:26 - decide if a series converges or diverge
68:29 - it's called the divergence test
68:35 - it's a quick test that will tell us if a
68:38 - series diverges
68:40 - or if we're not sure
68:43 - what we do is we consider
68:51 - the sum as n goes from 1
68:56 - to infinity of a sub n we're looking at
68:59 - some series some sum
69:07 - if the limit
69:10 - as n goes to infinity
69:14 - of those individual terms
69:17 - is not equal to zero
69:20 - basically what that means is as we get
69:22 - up to infinity are we
69:24 - adding numbers are we adding zero if
69:26 - we're adding
69:27 - zero it may or may not converge but if
69:30 - we're
69:31 - adding anything else but 0 it's
69:34 - definitely not going to converge because
69:36 - it's always going to be getting bigger
69:38 - and bigger in fact that also works if
69:41 - the limit does not exist or if the limit
69:43 - is infinity
69:46 - then the sum as n goes from one to
69:49 - infinity of a sub n
69:52 - diverges
69:56 - so if the terms aren't ultimately going
69:58 - to zero
69:59 - then the series is not going to converge
70:02 - let's take a look at some examples
70:09 - let's first try the sum as
70:12 - n goes from 1 to infinity of
70:15 - n over three n minus one
70:21 - well to use the divergence test to see
70:23 - what's happening
70:24 - we can take the limit as n goes to
70:26 - infinity of n
70:27 - over three n minus 1
70:30 - and we know that the higher powers the n
70:33 - over 3n are going to take over and
70:36 - that's going to ultimately equal 1
70:37 - 3 which is definitely not equal to 0.
70:41 - in other words once we get out to enough
70:43 - terms we're basically doing plus
70:45 - one-third plus one-third
70:46 - plus one-third plus one-third and that's
70:48 - going to keep getting bigger and bigger
70:51 - so because that does not equal zero
70:54 - therefore we will say this
70:55 - series will diverge
71:03 - any time the limit as n goes to infinity
71:05 - of the individual terms is not
71:07 - zero it will diverge
71:10 - so if we try to find the sum as n goes
71:13 - from one to infinity
71:15 - of the cosine of one over n
71:18 - squared we can do the same thing we'll
71:21 - take the limit as
71:23 - n goes to infinity of the individual
71:25 - terms
71:26 - cosine of 1 over n squared
71:30 - well if n gets huge this becomes 1 over
71:33 - a huge number
71:34 - which basically means we're taking the
71:36 - cosine of 0
71:38 - and we know the cosine of zero is equal
71:40 - to one
71:42 - which again is not equal to zero so
71:44 - eventually we're just doing plus one
71:45 - plus one plus one plus one plus one
71:48 - that's never going to settle out at a
71:49 - number therefore this series
71:53 - as well
71:57 - let's try one more example
72:04 - let's take the sum as n goes from one to
72:08 - infinity of n plus one
72:11 - over n squared minus three n plus one
72:18 - well again our strategy for the
72:19 - divergence test is we're going to see
72:21 - what happens with the limit
72:22 - as n goes to infinity of n plus 1
72:26 - over n squared minus 3n plus 1.
72:30 - here you'll notice the n squared has the
72:33 - highest exponent so it's going to take
72:34 - over
72:35 - which means the denominator is going to
72:37 - become huge and we'll have a small
72:39 - number divided by a huge number
72:42 - which is 0. so now in the end
72:45 - this one is eventually doing plus 0 plus
72:48 - 0 plus 0.
72:50 - but here's the catch about the
72:52 - divergence test
72:53 - if the limit equals 0 that does not
72:57 - mean it converges because sometimes it
73:01 - will converge and sometimes it will
73:03 - diverge
73:04 - so when the limit equals zero we say the
73:07 - test
73:07 - is inconclusive
73:14 - when we're inconclusive we're going to
73:15 - have to do some other testing and that's
73:17 - really what the
73:18 - rest of this chapter is going to be
73:19 - about but for now we're just going to
73:21 - say
73:22 - inconclusive so that's the divergence
73:24 - test
73:25 - if it the limit as n goes to infinity of
73:27 - the individual terms
73:29 - goes to anything but 0 we know it
73:31 - diverges
73:33 - if it equals 0 we don't really know
73:35 - anything
73:37 - so we have another option to test
73:40 - and this is what is called the integral
73:44 - test
73:48 - by the way the integral test only works
73:53 - if all the terms
73:56 - are positive
74:01 - if we have negative terms the integral
74:03 - test will not
74:05 - work so alternating series don't work
74:07 - even if there's one term that's negative
74:09 - the integral test won't work
74:11 - but if all the terms are positive and
74:14 - we're looking at the sum as n goes from
74:17 - one to infinity
74:18 - of some series what we'll do
74:22 - is we will let the function
74:25 - f of n be equal to the individual terms
74:29 - and we will take the integral from some
74:32 - number
74:33 - any number we want up to infinity
74:39 - of f of n dn
74:44 - this integral and the original sum
74:48 - will either both converge
74:54 - or both diverge
75:00 - so if we can take the integral they will
75:03 - both
75:03 - do the same thing so if the integral
75:05 - equals infinity the sum equals infinity
75:07 - if the integral equals a number the sum
75:10 - also equals a number
75:12 - but they are not necessarily the same
75:14 - number
75:15 - it just means that they both converge to
75:19 - a number so let's take a look
75:22 - at some examples
75:29 - let's take a look at the sum as n goes
75:31 - from one to infinity of one over
75:33 - n to the fourth
75:37 - if we use the divergence test on this
75:39 - the limit as n goes to infinity we see a
75:41 - zero so that's inconclusive
75:43 - so what we'll do instead is we will use
75:45 - the integral tests to see if it tells us
75:47 - something
75:48 - we'll take the integral from let's go
75:50 - from the first term
75:51 - 1 to infinity and we don't like to
75:54 - integrate fractions so i'm going to
75:55 - write this as
75:56 - n to the negative 4 dn
76:01 - which we know is equal to n to the
76:03 - negative 3
76:04 - divided by negative 3
76:10 - which we know let's simplify that a
76:14 - little bit further we'll bring the n to
76:15 - the bottom so we've got negative
76:17 - 3 into the third and we're integrating
76:20 - from one
76:21 - to infinity
76:24 - well if we plug infinity in we get one
76:26 - divided by a huge number
76:28 - which is zero minus
76:31 - if we plug one in we get a negative
76:34 - one-third
76:35 - and minus a negative one-third is
76:36 - positive one-third
76:38 - and it equals one-third the number
76:41 - doesn't matter so much
76:44 - as the fact that it equals a po a number
76:47 - it doesn't equal infinity because the
76:49 - integral converges
76:51 - the sum also converges
76:59 - because both the integral and the sum
77:01 - are going to do the same
77:03 - thing let's take a look at one more of
77:06 - these examples
77:09 - let's take the sum as n goes from 1 to
77:12 - infinity
77:13 - of n over three n squared plus
77:17 - one again the divergence test says that
77:21 - this is going to zero so it's
77:23 - inconclusive
77:24 - so let's try the integral test let's
77:26 - take the integral from one because
77:27 - that's the lower limit to
77:29 - infinity of n over
77:32 - three n squared plus one
77:36 - well we're kind of set up for a u
77:38 - substitution
77:40 - where u is three n squared plus one d
77:43 - u is six n so oops i forgot the dn
77:49 - so we'll multiply by six
77:52 - and we will multiply by one sixth and so
77:55 - that's going to give us 1
77:56 - 6 times the integral
77:59 - and let's go ahead and plug the limits
78:01 - in 3 times
78:03 - 1 squared plus 1 is 4 to infinity
78:08 - of 1 over udu
78:12 - which is equal to 1 6 natural log of
78:15 - u integrated from 4
78:20 - to infinity but when we plug the
78:24 - infinity into the natural log the
78:26 - natural log
78:26 - always gets bigger and bigger we end up
78:29 - with infinity
78:31 - so the integral diverges to
78:34 - infinity and because both the integral
78:37 - and the series do the same thing if the
78:39 - integral diverges
78:42 - then the sum will also diverge
78:46 - and so we see here is a great example of
78:48 - the how the
78:50 - divergence test is inconclusive because
78:53 - both of these
78:54 - the limit was zero so we had to use a
78:57 - different test to decide
78:59 - one converged and the other diverged
79:05 - before we wrap up here though i want to
79:06 - talk about one special series
79:11 - and this is a series when we see it
79:12 - we're going to just recognize whether or
79:14 - not it converges or diverges
79:16 - it is called the p series a p series is
79:19 - a series of the form as the sum
79:21 - going from 1 to infinity of 1 over
79:25 - n to the p power
79:30 - if we were to do the integral test on
79:32 - this
79:35 - we would take the integral from one
79:38 - to infinity of one over n to the p
79:42 - d n or the integral from one to infinity
79:46 - of
79:46 - n to the negative p d n
79:50 - and the exponent property says we
79:52 - increase that exponent by
79:54 - one and we divide by the new exponent
79:58 - negative p
79:59 - plus one and if that's the case
80:03 - we're integrating from 1 to infinity
80:06 - when we plug that
80:07 - in what we really end up with
80:11 - is and this is going to be kind of loose
80:14 - notation here not quite correct we
80:16 - should be doing the limit as
80:17 - n goes to infinity but i'm just going to
80:19 - write infinity in for the n
80:21 - we get infinity raised to the negative p
80:23 - plus one
80:25 - over negative p plus one
80:29 - minus then when you plug one in one to
80:32 - any power is one
80:34 - over negative p plus one
80:38 - but the important thing to note here is
80:41 - infinity has an exponent of negative p
80:43 - plus one
80:45 - if this is in the numerator
80:48 - then the whole thing goes off to
80:50 - infinity
80:52 - but if that infinity ends up in the
80:54 - denominator
80:56 - the whole thing goes to 0 and it
80:58 - converges
81:01 - so this means it will
81:04 - diverge
81:08 - if the exponent negative p
81:12 - plus one is greater than 0
81:15 - because if we have a positive exponent
81:19 - then it will diverge and if we solve
81:21 - this
81:23 - by subtracting 1 and dividing by
81:25 - negative 1
81:26 - if p is less than 1
81:30 - or really or equal to 1
81:34 - because
81:38 - it is the harmonic series
81:43 - if it's equal to one we already know the
81:47 - harmonic series
81:48 - one over n diverges
81:51 - very slowly but it diverges
81:55 - and then the opposite is true that it
81:57 - converges
82:00 - if the exponent negative p plus 1 is
82:02 - negative
82:03 - which moves the infinity to the
82:05 - denominator
82:07 - or if we add 1 and divide by negative 1
82:10 - if p is greater than 1.
82:15 - so this is kind of the important idea
82:17 - that the p
82:18 - series
82:21 - will diverge if p
82:24 - is less than one or equal to one let's
82:27 - go ahead and write the or equal to in
82:28 - there
82:29 - and it will converge if the exponent is
82:33 - greater than one
82:39 - and that can save us doing all the tests
82:41 - we just have to look at the exponent if
82:42 - we're actually working with a p
82:44 - series let's try some examples really
82:48 - quick
82:48 - to wrap up this video
82:53 - first let's consider the sum as n goes
82:56 - from one
82:57 - to infinity of one over n
83:00 - to the five thirds
83:05 - well this is a p series because it's one
83:06 - over n to some exponent and that five
83:09 - thirds is greater than one because it's
83:12 - greater than one
83:13 - we know it converges
83:20 - similarly we can look at the sum as n
83:22 - goes from one to infinity
83:24 - of one over n to the two fifths power
83:28 - we're looking at that exponent
83:30 - two-fifths is
83:32 - less than one because it's
83:35 - less than one this p series
83:39 - diverges
83:42 - so this will be an important series to
83:44 - add to our other series that we're
83:46 - familiar with
83:47 - the harmonic series the geometric series
83:49 - the p series these are ones we should
83:51 - recognize
83:51 - really quickly when they converge and
83:54 - when
83:55 - they diverge so we're going to wrap up
83:57 - here give you a chance to practice some
83:59 - of these
84:00 - trying to to decide using the divergence
84:02 - test and the integral test
84:04 - or recognizing a p series does this
84:06 - series
84:07 - converge to a number we don't really
84:09 - care what number
84:11 - or does it diverge to infinity
84:14 - take a look at the practice and we will
84:16 - see you in class to discuss it further
84:22 - when working with theories and trying to
84:23 - decide if they converge or diverge
84:26 - we have the divergence test to see if it
84:28 - diverges
84:29 - and if that's inconclusive we can try
84:31 - the integral test however the integral
84:33 - test
84:33 - only works if all the terms are positive
84:36 - and if we can take the integral some
84:38 - integrals are difficult or impossible to
84:40 - take
84:41 - and so we need another method to try and
84:44 - determine if series converge or diverge
84:47 - if one of those first two
84:48 - fail and so one idea that might come up
84:52 - is to use a series we know to establish
84:55 - something about a series we don't know
84:58 - the question here is going to be can
85:00 - known series
85:07 - help determine
85:14 - convergence
85:19 - of an unknown series
85:32 - and obviously the answer is yes because
85:34 - that's what we're taking a look at
85:35 - so let's see about this first one called
85:38 - the
85:39 - comparison test
85:46 - the idea of the comparison test is
85:50 - if i know a series converges so we'll
85:53 - say
85:54 - if the sum as n goes from one to
85:57 - infinity
85:57 - of maybe the series b converges
86:08 - and i've got some
86:11 - other series where each term is
86:14 - smaller than the b term but still
86:18 - positive still greater than one
86:23 - then well if every term of a is smaller
86:27 - than b
86:28 - and b converges
86:32 - then the series a must also converge
86:46 - to something smaller than whatever the b
86:48 - converges to but again the important
86:50 - question is does it converge or not
86:54 - and we can kind of take the opposite
86:56 - logic as well
86:58 - let's say we've got a series that
87:00 - diverges
87:02 - the series that we know diverges maybe
87:04 - it's the harmonic series or something
87:06 - like that
87:10 - and every term of this series
87:16 - a sub n is bigger than
87:19 - every term of the series b which we know
87:22 - already goes to infinity
87:24 - which is also bigger than zero that's
87:26 - important
87:27 - these actually should have or equal two
87:29 - on them
87:32 - then well if series a is bigger than
87:35 - series b
87:36 - which is infinity series a
87:39 - must also diverge as well
87:46 - let's take a look at some examples where
87:47 - we can use this logic
87:56 - number three
88:04 - let's consider the sum as n goes from
88:07 - one to infinity
88:09 - of one over n to the fourth plus three n
88:12 - squared plus two and with the divergence
88:16 - test this clearly goes to zero
88:18 - but the integral of this is going to be
88:19 - very difficult to take
88:22 - so let's see if we can compare it to
88:23 - something we know
88:26 - we know something about the sum
88:29 - as n goes from one to infinity of one
88:32 - over n to the fourth
88:34 - that's a power series where the exponent
88:36 - is bigger than
88:38 - one so it converges
88:41 - sometimes reciprocals are harder to
88:42 - think about so first i'll look at the
88:44 - fact
88:45 - that if i take n to the fourth and i add
88:48 - something to it
88:49 - and add something more to it that's
88:51 - going to be
88:52 - bigger than just the n to the fourth by
88:56 - itself
88:58 - well if we took the reciprocal of this
89:00 - inequality
89:03 - it's going to switch the direction of
89:06 - the inequality
89:11 - just going to show what we did there um
89:13 - off to the side here on the left
89:16 - 10 is bigger than 2. if we took the
89:19 - reciprocals 1
89:21 - 10 that would be smaller than the
89:23 - reciprocal
89:24 - one-half when we take reciprocals the
89:26 - inequality
89:27 - switches direction
89:31 - so what we've shown is our series
89:36 - is smaller than a known series
89:41 - we know that known series converges
89:49 - and so then our series
89:52 - being smaller must also converge
89:56 - because it can't go to infinity
90:00 - if it's smaller than a convergent series
90:05 - let's try one more example
90:10 - let's consider the sum as n goes from
90:13 - one to infinity
90:14 - of one over the natural log of n
90:19 - again as n goes to infinity this goes to
90:21 - zero
90:24 - and so what i might try and say is the
90:26 - natural log of
90:28 - n compared to
90:31 - some either an n or an n squared or some
90:34 - other
90:34 - p series that we know
90:38 - well how does the natural log of n
90:41 - compare to
90:41 - n if i think briefly about the graphs
90:45 - natural log comes up and moves slowly
90:50 - but n is a straight line that's going to
90:52 - grow much faster
90:54 - the n is bigger than the natural log of
90:57 - n
90:59 - well if i took the reciprocals 1 over
91:01 - the natural log of n then
91:03 - must be bigger than 1 over n
91:08 - and 1 over n we know that's the harmonic
91:10 - series
91:11 - so it's going to diverge
91:16 - but if we've got something bigger than
91:17 - infinity it must
91:19 - also go to infinity it must also
91:22 - diverge as well
91:29 - so if we can find a series that is
91:32 - bigger than our series that converges
91:35 - we must also converge if we find a
91:38 - series that's smaller than our series
91:39 - that diverges
91:41 - we must also diverge the order's
91:44 - important because if i found something
91:46 - bigger that diverges
91:49 - that doesn't necessarily mean i diverge
91:52 - and if i find something smaller
91:54 - that converges that doesn't necessarily
91:56 - mean i converge
91:58 - so we need to make sure the order is
92:00 - right
92:01 - to make this comparison test work
92:06 - and sometimes it's not so clear
92:09 - from our comparison test exactly
92:14 - how the pieces come together so maybe a
92:16 - more powerful test
92:18 - will be what we call the limit
92:24 - comparison
92:26 - test
92:30 - and the limit comparison test says
92:33 - consider
92:36 - a sub n and b sub n
92:39 - are greater than zero for all n
92:42 - in other words we've got all positive
92:44 - terms
92:47 - if we were to divide them if we took the
92:50 - limit as
92:51 - n goes to infinity of their quotient a
92:54 - sub
92:54 - n divided by b sub n
92:57 - and that actually equals a limit but not
93:00 - zero
93:04 - maybe it equals four or two or one third
93:06 - one half if it equals a specific
93:08 - limit that's not zero
93:11 - then both converge
93:17 - or both diverge
93:21 - they both do the same thing if the limit
93:25 - equals a number besides zero
93:29 - if the limit equals zero though
93:42 - then we only know something
93:45 - if the denominator converges
93:52 - if the denominator converges that tells
93:55 - us the numerator
93:57 - also converges
94:03 - if the denominator diverges and we equal
94:06 - 0 we don't know anything
94:08 - it's inconclusive
94:12 - similarly if the limit of the quotient
94:18 - is equal to infinity
94:23 - and we add to that that b
94:26 - sub n the denominator diverges
94:31 - then the numerator will also do the same
94:34 - thing then a sub
94:35 - n diverges as well
94:39 - so what we can do is take a known series
94:41 - and divide by the known series and take
94:43 - the limit as n goes to infinity
94:46 - what we hope happens is that it equals a
94:48 - constant
94:49 - that's not equal to zero if that's the
94:52 - case
94:53 - they will both do the same thing whether
94:55 - it's converge or diverge
94:57 - if it does equal to zero we hope that
94:59 - denominator converges
95:01 - because then our numerator also
95:03 - converges
95:04 - if it goes to infinity we hope the
95:07 - denominator diverges
95:08 - because the numerator also diverges but
95:11 - if we don't get that second
95:12 - half then the test also is inconclusive
95:17 - and you have to use
95:18 - another test but let's see how we can
95:21 - use this test
95:25 - with some examples
95:32 - let's find the sum as n goes from 1 to
95:35 - infinity
95:36 - of 3 over the square root of n minus 2.
95:44 - now i see that square root of the n in
95:46 - the denominator so i think
95:47 - okay let's compare it with
95:51 - 1 over the square root of n or 1 over n
95:55 - to the one half
95:57 - that's a p series it diverges
96:02 - because the exponent is smaller than one
96:05 - let's see what happens
96:07 - when we take the limit as n goes to
96:10 - infinity
96:11 - of our unknown series 3 over the square
96:14 - root of n minus 2
96:17 - divided by our known series 1 over the
96:20 - square root of n
96:25 - well let's simplify that by multiplying
96:28 - by the square root of n
96:29 - on top and bottom
96:32 - when we do the square roots of n's
96:34 - divide out and we get the limit
96:36 - as n goes to infinity of 3 root
96:40 - n over the square root of n minus 2.
96:45 - and that's really nice because those
96:47 - square roots of n being the highest
96:48 - exponent are going to take over
96:50 - and we end up with three over one or
96:53 - just
96:54 - three
96:57 - because that three is not equal to zero
96:59 - they are going to both
97:01 - do the same thing
97:09 - so we said our comparison diverges
97:13 - therefore the sum as n goes from 1 to
97:16 - infinity of 3 over the square root of n
97:18 - minus 2
97:20 - doing the same thing also diverges
97:28 - when we equal a number not equal to 0
97:31 - they both do the same thing
97:35 - let's try another example let's consider
97:38 - the sum as
97:39 - n goes from 1 to infinity
97:43 - of 5 to the n plus 2 over
97:46 - 6 to the n divergence test
97:50 - the 6 to the n takes over it equals 0.
97:52 - the integral is difficult to take
97:54 - so let's try a comparison test let's try
97:57 - to compare it
97:59 - with kind of a simple form of the 5
98:03 - to the n over 6 to the n
98:07 - which is 5 6 to the n plus 2 is probably
98:10 - not going to matter when we get off to
98:11 - infinity so it's probably going to
98:12 - behave similar to the 5 6.
98:17 - well 5 6 to the n is a geometric series
98:21 - where the r is less than one multiplying
98:24 - by 5
98:25 - 6 over and over and over again when the
98:27 - r is less than 1
98:29 - we know that it converges
98:37 - so let's see what happens when we take
98:39 - the limit as n
98:40 - goes to infinity of what we don't know
98:44 - 5 to the n plus 2 over 6 to the n
98:48 - divided by what we do know 5 to the n
98:51 - over 6 to the n
98:58 - well uh we're dividing fractions so
99:02 - dividing fractions means we multiply by
99:04 - the reciprocal
99:06 - so we get 5 to the n plus 2 over 6 to
99:10 - the n
99:11 - times 6 to the n over 5 to the n
99:16 - 6 to the ends will reduce out and we get
99:18 - the limit
99:19 - as n goes to infinity
99:23 - of 5 to the n plus 2 over 5 to the n
99:29 - and as the ends get huge we see those 5
99:31 - to the ends are going to take over
99:33 - ultimately the plus 2 is going to make
99:35 - very little difference
99:36 - and this will equal 1.
99:40 - which is not zero
99:44 - because it equals a number that's not
99:46 - zero they both
99:48 - numerator and denominator will do the
99:51 - same
99:52 - thing
99:57 - well we said it converges in the
99:59 - numerator in the denominator
100:00 - so therefore our unknown sum
100:06 - of five to the n plus 2 over 6 to the n
100:09 - also converges
100:13 - because our limit equals a number
100:18 - they both do the same thing
100:24 - let's try one more example
100:30 - let's take the sum as n goes from 1 to
100:33 - infinity
100:34 - of the natural log of n divided by
100:37 - n squared
100:44 - well the
100:48 - natural log of n is smaller than n
100:52 - so if i pick something bigger we'd be
100:54 - thinking like n over n squared which is
100:56 - one over
100:56 - n so let's try that one over n
101:00 - let's compare it to one over n 1 over n
101:03 - is the harmonic series it diverges
101:08 - so let's see what happens when we take
101:10 - the limit as n goes to infinity
101:13 - of the natural log of n over n squared
101:18 - divided by the known series 1 over n
101:23 - multiplying by the reciprocal
101:28 - we get the natural log of n over n
101:31 - squared times n
101:35 - the n divides out with the n squared
101:41 - and so we get the limit as n goes to
101:43 - infinity of the natural log of
101:46 - n divided by n
101:49 - well both of those go off to infinity
101:55 - so let's try to l'hopital it to see if
101:57 - that can help us
101:59 - figure out what the limit as n goes to
102:02 - infinity
102:03 - the derivative of natural log of n is
102:05 - one over n
102:06 - the derivative of n is one and now if n
102:10 - goes to infinity
102:14 - if n goes to infinity we got one divided
102:16 - by a large number which is zero divided
102:18 - by one which is zero
102:22 - so remember our rule about zero
102:27 - if we equal zero we need the denominator
102:31 - to converge
102:36 - uh-oh our denominator diverges
102:42 - so that is inconclusive that doesn't
102:46 - actually tell us
102:47 - anything so let's try a plan b
102:53 - uh 1 over n did not work so let's
102:56 - compare it maybe with one over n
102:58 - squared we know one over n
103:01 - squared converges
103:05 - because it's a p series where the p is
103:08 - greater than one
103:11 - so let's take the limit as n goes to
103:15 - infinity
103:16 - of the unknown natural log of n divided
103:19 - by n
103:19 - squared divided by one over n squared
103:26 - well this one's going to simplify quite
103:28 - nicely when we multiply by the
103:30 - reciprocal
103:31 - the natural log of n over n squared
103:34 - times
103:34 - n squared over 1. the n squareds divide
103:38 - out
103:39 - and we're left with the limit as n goes
103:41 - to infinity of the natural log of
103:44 - n which
103:47 - is infinity
103:50 - so we go up to our rule
103:54 - and if it equals infinity
103:57 - that's only useful if the denominator
104:01 - diverges
104:03 - well our denominator converges
104:08 - so this tells us nothing
104:11 - back to the drawing board so squared
104:14 - made us diverge
104:16 - first power made us converge
104:19 - let's go somewhere in the middle between
104:21 - one and two so we might try one over
104:24 - n to the three halves that's right in
104:26 - the middle
104:28 - it's still bigger than one is an
104:30 - exponent so it's a p series that
104:32 - converges
104:39 - so let's take i didn't cross off the
104:42 - last one that one was bad
104:43 - let's take the limit as n goes to
104:46 - infinity
104:48 - of the unknown series the natural log of
104:50 - n divided by n squared
104:53 - over the known series 1 over n to the 3
104:56 - halves
105:00 - well if we multiply by the reciprocal
105:05 - we get the natural log of n over
105:08 - n squared times n to the three halves
105:12 - over one now when we reduce we're going
105:17 - to end up with a half
105:18 - left in the denominator so we have the
105:20 - limit as n goes to infinity
105:23 - of the natural log of n over n to the
105:26 - one half
105:32 - as you plug infinity in you'll notice
105:34 - the numerator is going to infinity and
105:36 - the denominator is going to infinity
105:39 - so we'll use l'hopital's rule which
105:42 - allows us to take the derivative of the
105:44 - numerator and denominator
105:48 - the derivative of natural log of n i'm
105:51 - just going to come down here to the next
105:52 - row
105:54 - limit as n goes to infinity the
105:56 - derivative of natural log of n is one
105:57 - over n
106:00 - the derivative of n to the one half
106:03 - pull out the one half and then subtract
106:06 - one from the exponent you get n to the
106:08 - negative one half that sticks it in the
106:10 - denominator
106:13 - and so we'll multiply by the reciprocal
106:15 - again
106:17 - one over n times two n to the one half
106:21 - all over one
106:24 - subtracting the exponents we get the
106:26 - limit as n goes to infinity
106:29 - of 2 over n to the one-half
106:36 - reducing the exponents and now as n gets
106:40 - really really huge in that denominator
106:42 - we get two divided by
106:44 - a large number which is zero
106:50 - so we go back to our rule
106:55 - if it equals zero we're happy if the
106:57 - denominator converges
107:01 - here the denominator we used converges
107:05 - and so we finally have a solution
107:09 - because the denominator converges and we
107:11 - equal zero
107:13 - therefore the natural log of n over
107:16 - n squared also converges
107:23 - so we're not as flexible when the limit
107:26 - equals zero or infinity when it equals
107:28 - zero or infinity it either needs to
107:30 - converge or diverge depending on the
107:32 - direction we're at
107:33 - but if it equals any other number it's
107:35 - really convenient to use
107:37 - the limit comparison test because if it
107:40 - equals a number other than zero they
107:42 - both converge or both diverge
107:45 - working with these takes a little bit of
107:46 - practice identifying
107:48 - which which series to use in the
107:51 - denominator
107:52 - so practice a few of these take a look
107:55 - at the homework assignment we'll discuss
107:56 - them more and practice more
107:58 - in class
108:01 - up to this point we've been mainly
108:02 - working with series where the terms are
108:04 - all
108:05 - positive but when the terms are negative
108:07 - we have what's called an
108:08 - alternating series where we have
108:10 - positive and negative terms bouncing
108:12 - back and forth
108:14 - there's another strategy we can use to
108:16 - determine the convergence of an
108:18 - alternating series
108:19 - so our question for the day is how
108:23 - do we determine
108:29 - the convergence
108:34 - of an alternating
108:44 - series
108:48 - and first we'll just really define the
108:50 - alternating series a little clearer
108:52 - oh turn 18
108:56 - series there's two types
108:59 - and they're almost identical
109:03 - uh if we have the sum as n goes from one
109:06 - to infinity
109:07 - of negative one to the n plus one times
109:11 - some other series basically what that
109:14 - does
109:14 - is when n is one we get one plus one
109:17 - which is two
109:18 - and negative one squared is a positive
109:20 - one so we just
109:21 - end up with uh the first b term
109:25 - but then when we go to the next one we
109:27 - end up with an odd exponent so we end up
109:29 - subtracting the second b
109:31 - adding the third b subtracting the
109:34 - fourth b
109:35 - and so on and so forth alternating
109:38 - between positive and negative
109:41 - the other type and it's really the same
109:43 - idea the difference is that the negative
109:45 - one just has an n
109:46 - power and what that does is it allows
109:49 - the first term to start out negative
109:51 - and then we add the second term subtract
109:53 - the third term
109:54 - add the fourth term and so on
109:59 - those are alternating series and
110:02 - an interesting question that can kind of
110:04 - come up out of this introduction of
110:05 - alternating series
110:07 - we've talked about the harmonic series
110:09 - which diverges
110:10 - to infinity what if we made the harmonic
110:13 - series
110:14 - into an alternating
110:20 - harmonic series
110:27 - in other words we were to take a look at
110:29 - the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity
110:32 - of negative 1 to the n plus 1 over
110:36 - n
110:38 - because if we look graphically at what
110:40 - this does
110:43 - if we call this one over to the right
110:48 - the first term is going to be a positive
110:50 - one
110:51 - so we'll add one the second term is a
110:54 - negative one-half
110:56 - so we subtract one-half
111:00 - then the next term adds one-third
111:06 - and then we end up subtracting 1 4th
111:09 - and what you see is happening
111:13 - is we keep going back and forth but we
111:15 - don't go quite as far
111:16 - as we did last time
111:20 - and it looks like we're actually
111:21 - converging down to a point
111:24 - on the line and in fact it does the
111:27 - alternating harmonic series
111:29 - turns out to converge
111:37 - at the natural log of 2
111:41 - and we can look at that a little more
111:42 - closely in class because there's some
111:44 - interesting stuff that happens there
111:46 - but for now what i want to point out if
111:48 - we change a divergent series like the
111:50 - harmonic
111:51 - into an alternating series sometimes it
111:54 - could turn out to be
111:55 - a series that actually converges
111:58 - but this is not always the case so we
112:00 - need some better rules to test
112:02 - the convergence of an alternating series
112:05 - and so we have what is called
112:07 - the alternating
112:12 - series test
112:19 - and the alternating series test says
112:21 - that an alternating series
112:30 - such as the sum as n goes from 1 to
112:33 - infinity of negative 1 to the n plus 1
112:37 - times sum b sub n terms converges
112:44 - if two things are true
112:48 - first each
112:51 - b sub n is positive
112:55 - and the n plus one term is smaller
112:59 - than the nth term in other words every
113:02 - term we go to next is smaller than the
113:04 - one before it
113:05 - and that's what happened with the
113:06 - alternating harmonic we didn't quite go
113:09 - back as far and then we didn't quite go
113:10 - back as far and we didn't
113:12 - quite go back as far and eventually
113:13 - that's going to pull us down
113:15 - to a point on the line so it each term
113:19 - needs to be smaller
113:20 - than the one before it and the other
113:22 - thing that's important and it's just the
113:24 - divergence test
113:25 - that the limit as n goes to infinity
113:29 - of b sub n has to equal
113:32 - 0. we have to pass the divergence test
113:36 - with the b sub n without the alternating
113:39 - part
113:40 - if that's true if each term is getting
113:43 - smaller
113:52 - and the divergence test works on the
113:55 - non-alternating part
113:58 - then the series will converge
114:01 - so let's take a look at some examples
114:06 - where we can use this alternating series
114:08 - test
114:11 - let's take a look at the sum
114:16 - as n goes from 1 to infinity
114:20 - of negative one to the n plus one
114:23 - over n cubed
114:28 - well to do that we will consider
114:32 - n plus one
114:36 - and n
114:40 - ignoring the alternating part the
114:42 - negative 1 to the n plus 1. if we ignore
114:44 - the alternating part we end up with 1
114:46 - over n plus 1 cubed
114:49 - and 1 over n cubed
114:54 - well if i think about the fact that n
114:56 - plus 1
114:57 - cubed is going to be bigger than just
115:01 - n cubed
115:04 - because we've added one we've got a
115:05 - bigger number we're cubing
115:08 - the reciprocals then one over n
115:11 - plus one cubed must be smaller than
115:14 - one over n cubed in other words we've
115:18 - shown
115:18 - that the next term is smaller than the
115:22 - first
115:22 - term if that's the case the terms are
115:26 - getting smaller
115:27 - therefore we can say the series
115:30 - converges
115:36 - let's try another one
115:40 - let's try the sum as n goes from 1 to
115:44 - infinity of negative 1 to the n
115:48 - times n over 2 to the n
115:54 - to use the alternating series test
115:57 - we consider
116:00 - the n plus one and the n
116:05 - to see if n plus one is smaller
116:08 - ignoring the alternating part we just
116:10 - have n plus
116:11 - one over two to the n plus 1
116:15 - and just n over 2 to the n
116:21 - what i notice here is n does not grow
116:24 - nearly as fast as the denominators
116:28 - the denominators grow faster
116:31 - two to the fifth is a lot bigger than
116:33 - five two to the twelfth is a whole lot
116:35 - bigger than twelve
116:36 - the denominators are growing much larger
116:38 - so they're going to kind of take
116:40 - over so when we compare
116:43 - those denominators 2 to the n plus 1
116:47 - is going to be bigger than just 2 to the
116:49 - n
116:50 - because we've added 1 to the exponent
116:52 - making it bigger
116:54 - so the reciprocals 1 over 2 to the n
116:57 - plus 1
116:58 - must be less than 1 over 2 to the n
117:05 - therefore
117:09 - multiplying both top and bottom by n or
117:12 - n plus one they're basically the same
117:14 - amount
117:15 - we can conclude that n plus one over two
117:18 - to the n plus one
117:20 - is less than n over two to the n
117:25 - so we found out is that the next term is
117:28 - smaller
117:29 - than the first term and when that
117:32 - happens
117:34 - we know that we will ultimately converge
117:38 - with our alternating series
117:41 - so now that we've got some idea of this
117:43 - uh work with convergence and divergence
117:46 - with alternating series
117:47 - we're ready to talk about what's called
117:49 - absolute convergence
117:57 - versus what's called conditional
118:04 - convergence
118:11 - the idea behind absolute convergence
118:22 - is that the sum as n goes from one to
118:27 - infinity
118:28 - of your terms
118:34 - exhibits
118:39 - absolute convergence
118:46 - if the sum is in
118:49 - goes from one to infinity of the
118:51 - absolute value
119:00 - converges however we have
119:03 - conditional convergence
119:15 - if the sum as in goes from one to
119:18 - infinity of your terms
119:21 - exhibits
119:25 - conditional convergence
119:36 - if the sum is then goes from one to
119:41 - infinity of the original series
119:43 - converges
119:48 - but the sum as n goes from one to
119:51 - infinity of the absolute value
119:56 - diverges
119:58 - an example of number two here would be
120:00 - the harmonic series
120:01 - when the harmonic series is positive it
120:03 - diverges
120:04 - but when the harmonic series is
120:06 - alternating
120:08 - where we've got negatives and positives
120:09 - it does converge
120:12 - so we have conditional convergence with
120:14 - that example
120:16 - conditional convergence isn't very
120:18 - exciting to us because we're forced to
120:20 - use
120:20 - the alternating series test
120:25 - but what's really interesting is the
120:26 - fact that absolute convergence
120:34 - if the positive form in other words
120:35 - ignoring the alternating part
120:37 - if that converges it implies
120:43 - convergence
120:51 - in other words if
120:55 - the sum as in goes from one to infinity
120:57 - of the absolute value of a series
120:59 - converges
121:03 - then we know for sure that the sum
121:07 - as n goes from one to infinity of all
121:10 - the terms positive or negative
121:12 - also converges
121:17 - notice the opposite isn't true if the
121:19 - original
121:20 - converges does that mean the absolute
121:22 - value converges not necessarily the
121:24 - alternating harmonic is a great example
121:26 - of that
121:27 - but if the absolute value converges
121:30 - then we know the entire thing
121:34 - converges
121:38 - well what that means is if we can prove
121:40 - the absolute value converges
121:43 - we can then work with alternating series
121:46 - by using
121:48 - the other convergence test
122:00 - looking for absolute
122:05 - convergence
122:12 - so if we have maybe the sum as n
122:16 - goes from 1 to infinity of the
122:18 - alternating negative 1 to the n
122:20 - over 4 n minus 1.
122:25 - we're going to take a look at the
122:26 - absolute value version of it
122:31 - which means we're going to really see if
122:32 - the sum as n goes from 1
122:34 - to infinity of 1 over 4 n minus 1
122:38 - converges
122:41 - well i notice 1 over 4 n minus 1 is
122:43 - really similar to 1 over n
122:47 - which diverges
122:50 - that's the harmonic series
122:53 - so let's use the limit comparison test
123:00 - to see what happens when we divide these
123:03 - and take the limit as n goes to infinity
123:08 - we take the unknown one one over four n
123:11 - minus one
123:12 - over the known one one over four n
123:17 - multiplying by the reciprocal we have
123:19 - the limit as n goes to infinity
123:21 - of n over four n minus one
123:25 - we know from experience the ends take
123:27 - over and we get one-fourth
123:29 - which is not zero or infinity therefore
123:32 - we conclude that they both
123:34 - do the same thing
123:41 - so because our one over n diverges
123:47 - therefore this one diverges
123:54 - absolutely which doesn't really tell us
123:56 - much we like it when it converges
123:58 - absolutely because then the original one
124:00 - converges
124:02 - but this one does not divert does not
124:04 - converge absolutely
124:06 - but it might converge conditionally
124:09 - so now we go to the alternating series
124:12 - test
124:13 - we will consider
124:16 - n plus 1 and n
124:22 - when we use n plus one we get one over
124:24 - four times n plus one
124:26 - minus one and one over
124:31 - four n minus one
124:35 - which if we simplify these that becomes
124:37 - one over
124:38 - four n plus four minus one is plus three
124:42 - and one over four n minus one
124:48 - well if we were to compare these
124:50 - denominators
124:55 - 4 n and 4n are the same so if i add 3 to
124:59 - 1 and subtract 1 from the other
125:01 - the one we added 3 to is going to be
125:03 - bigger
125:04 - so then the reciprocals one over four n
125:07 - plus three must be less than one over
125:09 - four n minus one and so what we've shown
125:14 - is that the next term is smaller
125:17 - than the first term if that's the case
125:20 - the alternating series
125:22 - will converge
125:26 - therefore it converges
125:29 - not absolutely because when we did the
125:31 - absolute value thing
125:34 - we diverged absolutely
125:38 - but we do converge conditionally
125:43 - similar to the harmonic series if it
125:45 - alternates it converges if it doesn't
125:48 - alternate
125:49 - it diverges so we've got conditional
125:53 - convergence here
125:56 - let's do another one
126:00 - example number two we're going to do the
126:02 - sum as n
126:03 - goes from 1 to infinity of the sine of
126:07 - n over n cubed
126:13 - this doesn't look like an alternating
126:15 - series at first but if you think about
126:16 - sine of n
126:17 - sine of n goes from positive to negative
126:19 - to positive to negative
126:21 - oscillating between one and negative one
126:23 - so we're really going to end up with
126:25 - alternating signs here
126:28 - so what we'll do is we're going to
126:30 - compare it
126:32 - by getting rid of the negative part the
126:34 - sine is what makes it oscillate between
126:36 - 1 and negative 1.
126:39 - we can compare it with
126:43 - 1 over n cubed
126:47 - and that we know converges
126:55 - because it's a p series where the
126:57 - exponent is bigger than one
127:01 - all right let's compare it to the
127:03 - absolute value of the sine
127:05 - of n over n cubed because the absolute
127:12 - value forces everything to become
127:14 - positive we're looking for absolute
127:15 - convergence
127:18 - well if we do that compare it to having
127:21 - n cubed in the denominator the absolute
127:23 - value of sine
127:24 - is never going to be bigger than one
127:26 - which means our series
127:28 - every term is going to be less than or
127:30 - equal to one over n
127:31 - cubed so we've got a smaller series than
127:35 - a known conversion series
127:37 - therefore our series by the comparison
127:41 - test
127:43 - that we saw in the previous video
127:48 - the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of
127:50 - the absolute value of the sine of n
127:53 - over n cubed must
127:56 - converge
128:00 - if the absolute value converges
128:04 - then we have absolute
128:08 - convergence
128:11 - and the original series
128:17 - without the absolute value also
128:20 - converges
128:29 - so if we can prove the absolute value
128:31 - converges with either the integral test
128:33 - the comparison test the limit comparison
128:35 - test or another test
128:36 - then we have absolute convergence and
128:38 - the alternating series converges
128:42 - if the absolute value diverges then we
128:45 - check for conditional convergence
128:48 - by using the alternating
128:51 - series test
128:55 - so that's how we can work with
128:57 - alternating series take a look at
128:58 - practicing these again
129:00 - series take lots of practice to get
129:02 - comfortable with so practice practice
129:04 - practice come to class with questions
129:06 - and we'll talk about it more
129:08 - at that time
129:12 - as we wrap up chapter 5 we're going to
129:14 - ask kind of the last question
129:16 - which is what other tests
129:24 - do we have that can be used for
129:30 - convergence
129:35 - that's kind of been the theme of chapter
129:37 - five we started with the divergence test
129:40 - to see if the limit goes to anything but
129:43 - zero then it definitely diverges but if
129:44 - it goes to zero
129:46 - it's inconclusive so we could use the
129:47 - integral test if we could take the
129:49 - integral easily
129:50 - we could use a comparison test to see
129:55 - what's happening compared to a known
129:57 - series whether by dividing or being
129:59 - smaller or bigger than that known series
130:01 - we then looked at if we have an
130:02 - alternating series what we can do
130:04 - in terms of converging absolutely or if
130:08 - it doesn't converge absolutely does it
130:09 - converge conditionally because the terms
130:11 - are getting smaller each time
130:13 - and then to wrap it up we've got two
130:15 - more tests that i want to look at here
130:17 - today
130:18 - the first one is called the ratio test
130:24 - and the ratio test is particularly
130:27 - helpful
130:31 - with factorials
130:36 - if we have factorials in the problem you
130:38 - can pretty much bet
130:39 - the best way to get at convergence is by
130:42 - doing
130:42 - the ratio test and here's what the ratio
130:44 - test says we're going to let the sum
130:47 - as n goes from 1 to infinity of all of
130:50 - our terms
130:51 - be the series that we want to see if it
130:53 - converges or
130:55 - and we're going to define greek letter
130:58 - rho it kind of looks like a
130:59 - p but it's a greek letter rho rho
131:03 - is equal to the limit as n
131:06 - goes to infinity of the absolute value
131:10 - of the n plus one term divided by the
131:14 - n term and this is going to be useful
131:18 - because when we take that limit
131:19 - one of three things is going to happen
131:23 - if zero is less than or equal to rho
131:26 - which is less than
131:27 - oops not equal to just less than one if
131:30 - we get a
131:30 - number that's less than one for rho
131:34 - then the sum as n
131:37 - goes from one to infinity of the entire
131:40 - series
131:41 - converges absolutely
131:46 - positive or negative it will converge if
131:49 - rho is less than one
131:53 - if rho ends up being bigger than 1
131:58 - then the series as n goes from 1 to
132:01 - infinity
132:04 - diverges
132:09 - this is because if we're dividing and
132:11 - the next term is bigger
132:13 - dividing will result in
132:16 - a bigger number than one however there's
132:18 - a problem that comes out of this test
132:21 - and that is if rho equals one
132:24 - we get no information it doesn't happen
132:28 - often but that's kind of the worst case
132:29 - scenario if rho ends up equaling one
132:32 - we need another test
132:36 - so let's see if we can do some examples
132:39 - with
132:39 - the ratio test and see how it works
132:44 - out
132:47 - let's start by doing the sum as n goes
132:50 - from 1 to
132:51 - infinity of 3 to the n over
132:54 - n factorial i mentioned that this test
132:57 - is best with
132:58 - factorials so we define our rho
133:03 - as the limit as n goes to infinity
133:08 - of in the numerator we replace n with n
133:12 - plus one we have three to the n plus one
133:17 - actually let's do it this way over
133:20 - n plus 1 factorial
133:25 - and then the denominator is just the a
133:26 - sub n term which is 3 to the n
133:28 - divided by n factorial
133:32 - well if we simplify this by multiplying
133:34 - by the reciprocal
133:35 - we get rho is equal to the limit as n
133:38 - goes to infinity
133:39 - of 3 to the n plus 1 over n plus 1
133:42 - factorial times
133:46 - n factorial over 3 to the n
133:50 - which is very interesting because
133:54 - n plus 1 factorial represents n plus 1
133:57 - times n times n minus 1 factorial
134:00 - multiplies by everything below it
134:02 - specifically i could write n plus 1
134:05 - times
134:06 - everything below it which is n factorial
134:09 - which is nice because then the n
134:10 - factorials would divide out
134:13 - leaving behind an n plus one
134:16 - with the with the threes three to the n
134:19 - plus one over three to the n
134:20 - we can subtract the exponents and the
134:22 - three to the n
134:23 - divide out and we're just left with
134:26 - three
134:28 - so we have now the limit as n
134:31 - goes to infinity of three
134:34 - over n plus one and we know as n gets
134:38 - huge
134:39 - this becomes three divided by a huge
134:41 - number which
134:42 - is zero well if rho is zero
134:47 - our ratio test tells us in letter a up
134:49 - there that if rho is greater than or
134:50 - equal to zero
134:52 - therefore the sum as
134:55 - n goes from 1 to infinity of 3 to the n
134:58 - over n factorial converges
135:03 - absolutely
135:06 - actually we could probably just say
135:08 - converges because there's no negative
135:09 - terms in this case
135:11 - but we did determine from the ratio test
135:13 - that this first
135:15 - series converges
135:19 - let's do another example
135:22 - let's look at the sum as n
135:26 - goes from 1 to infinity
135:30 - let's take n to the n power over n
135:34 - factorial let's see what happens there
135:38 - well now rho is equal to the limit as n
135:41 - goes to infinity
135:44 - of the numerators the n plus one terms
135:46 - so it's n
135:47 - plus one to the n plus one power
135:52 - over n plus one factorial
135:56 - divided by the regular series n to the n
135:59 - power divided by n factorial
136:04 - well if we multiply by the reciprocal
136:11 - and i'm going to even break this
136:15 - up the n plus 1 factorial we're going to
136:18 - write that as n
136:19 - times in oops sorry we're going to write
136:22 - that as n
136:23 - plus 1 times n factorial
136:27 - that way it's going to match down there
136:31 - and the n plus 1 to the n plus 1 power
136:38 - i'm going to rewrite that as n plus
136:41 - 1 to the n times n
136:44 - plus 1. that way when you add the
136:47 - exponents you get that n
136:48 - plus one so now multiplying by the
136:52 - reciprocal we have
136:53 - n plus one to the n times n plus one
136:58 - over n plus 1
137:01 - times n factorial times
137:05 - n factorial over n to the n power
137:10 - and that's nice because one of the n
137:12 - plus ones can divide out with the
137:13 - denominator
137:14 - the n factorials can divide out
137:18 - and we're just left with n
137:21 - plus one to the n limit as n goes to
137:26 - infinity
137:28 - n plus 1 to the n
137:31 - over n to the n power
137:35 - which if we play with this we get n to
137:37 - the
137:38 - infinity both of those are to the n
137:40 - powers so we have n plus
137:42 - 1 over n to the n power
137:47 - which is equal to the limit as
137:50 - n goes to infinity if i divide both
137:52 - terms by n
137:53 - we get 1 plus 1 over n raised to the n
137:57 - power
138:01 - but
138:04 - this guy the limit as n goes to infinity
138:07 - of 1 plus 1 over n to the n power
138:09 - should look familiar way back when we
138:13 - talked about
138:13 - limits we found out that the limit as n
138:16 - goes to infinity of 1
138:17 - plus 1 over n to the n power that
138:21 - goes to e
138:26 - that's one way that we can define e is
138:28 - that limit right there
138:31 - so the whole thing's equal to e which is
138:33 - definitely greater than one it's almost
138:36 - three a little less than 3 and we know
138:39 - from the ratio test that if we're
138:41 - greater than 1
138:42 - the series has to diverge
138:47 - so therefore the sum as n goes from one
138:51 - to
138:51 - infinity of n to the n over n factorial
138:56 - diverges to infinity
139:06 - so a lot of these we massage
139:08 - algebraically to reduce
139:09 - so we can figure out the limit
139:12 - let's do one that's an alternating
139:14 - series before we step away from the
139:16 - ratio test
139:18 - let's consider the sum as n goes from 1
139:21 - to infinity
139:22 - of negative 1 to the n times n factorial
139:26 - squared over 2 n
139:32 - factorial
139:35 - well row technically row
139:38 - we've been leaving it off on the past
139:40 - two but technically row
139:42 - says it's the absolute value of the
139:45 - quotient
139:46 - so because it's the absolute value of
139:49 - the quotient
139:50 - we don't really need to worry about the
139:51 - negative one to the n part
139:54 - because the absolute value will just
139:55 - always make it positive
139:57 - so really our numerator we've just got n
140:00 - plus one
140:02 - factorial squared
140:06 - over 2
140:09 - times n plus 1
140:14 - factorial all over
140:18 - n factorial squared
140:21 - divided by 2n factorial
140:29 - well as i simplify this the 2 times n
140:32 - plus 1 is really 2n
140:33 - plus 2 factorial
140:40 - so if we break that up counting down so
140:44 - that it will divide out with a 2n
140:45 - factorial that's really
140:47 - 2n plus 2 times 2n
140:50 - plus 1 times 2n
140:54 - factorial as it counts down
140:59 - similarly the n plus 1 factorial
141:02 - squared is an n plus 1
141:08 - squared times n factorial
141:13 - squared just counting down and putting
141:17 - the squared on both parts because the
141:18 - whole thing is squared
141:22 - so when we multiply by the reciprocal
141:24 - oops i forgot the limit as n goes to
141:26 - infinity
141:27 - the limit as n goes to infinity
141:30 - of we have n plus 1 squared
141:34 - times n factorial squared
141:38 - divided by n factorial squared
141:42 - oops i'm getting ahead of myself finish
141:44 - out the first fraction
141:46 - divided by two n plus two
141:49 - times two n plus one times two
141:52 - in factorial and then multiply by the
141:56 - reciprocal which is
141:58 - 2n factorial
142:04 - over n factorial squared
142:08 - and let's see what we can divide out
142:10 - here
142:12 - the n factorial squareds are gone the
142:14 - two n factorials are gone
142:18 - and that's it so we've got the limit as
142:21 - n
142:22 - goes to infinity of
142:26 - and let's go ahead and multiply out to
142:28 - that numerator
142:29 - becomes n squared plus two n plus one
142:34 - multiplying out the denominator two n
142:36 - plus two times two n plus one is four
142:39 - n squared plus six
142:42 - n plus two
142:47 - and we know that the larger exponents
142:51 - are going to take over so it's going to
142:52 - become
142:53 - one-fourth which is less than one
142:59 - and so the ratio test tells us that if
143:01 - we're less than one
143:03 - it's going to converge absolutely
143:06 - and we know if it converges absolutely
143:09 - it also converges for the actual
143:12 - series so the sum as n goes from 1 to
143:15 - infinity of negative 1 to the n times n
143:18 - factorial squared over 2 n
143:21 - factorial converges
143:30 - absolutely
143:32 - so that is the ratio test really helpful
143:35 - with factorials because it allows us
143:38 - generally to reduce
143:39 - out the factorials by just breaking up
143:42 - maybe the n plus one from the n
143:43 - factorial maybe up to a couple terms
143:46 - and then if our row is less than one it
143:48 - converges absolutely
143:50 - if it's greater than one it diverges and
143:52 - we hope it doesn't equal one
143:54 - because then we have no information and
143:56 - we need another
143:58 - test a second test that's useful as we
144:03 - wrap up the chapter though is what's
144:05 - called the root
144:06 - test
144:11 - and the root test is really helpful
144:17 - with powers of
144:21 - n the reason it's helpful with powers of
144:24 - n
144:25 - is because it ultimately is going to
144:26 - take the nth root and get rid of that
144:28 - power
144:29 - of n so let's let the sum as
144:32 - n goes from 1 to infinity of a sub n
144:36 - be what we're looking for trying to
144:37 - decide does it converge or diverge
144:42 - we're going to also define a row in this
144:44 - case
144:45 - but here rho is going to be equal to the
144:47 - limit as n
144:48 - goes to infinity
144:51 - it's a terrible infinity as n goes to
144:54 - infinity
144:56 - of the nth root of the absolute value
145:01 - of the a sub n term
145:04 - if rho equals that one of three things
145:07 - will happen
145:08 - very similar to the ratio test
145:11 - if zero is less than or equal to rho
145:13 - which is less than one
145:17 - then the series
145:20 - converges
145:23 - absolutely
145:30 - and if that row is greater than one
145:36 - then the series
145:39 - diverges
145:43 - and just like last time if rho is equal
145:46 - to 1
145:47 - we have no information
145:52 - so we'll have to use some other tests to
145:54 - decide if it converges
145:56 - or diverges
146:00 - again this root test is really helpful
146:01 - with powers of n
146:03 - so let's take a look at a couple of
146:04 - examples
146:09 - starting with taking the sum as n goes
146:11 - from one
146:12 - to infinity of three
146:15 - n cubed minus seven n squared
146:18 - plus one raised to the n power
146:23 - all over four n cubed plus
146:26 - two n squared minus one all raised to
146:30 - the n
146:32 - power
146:36 - well when i see those powers of n we're
146:39 - going to use
146:39 - the root test with rho equal to the
146:43 - limit
146:44 - as n goes to infinity
146:47 - of the nth root of our terms three
146:50 - n cubed minus seven n squared plus one
146:53 - to the n over four n
146:56 - cubed plus two n squared minus one to
146:59 - the n
147:04 - and what's nice about that is the nth
147:07 - root
147:07 - takes care of those nth exponents as we
147:10 - take the nth root of the numerator and
147:12 - denominator
147:13 - so we're left with the limit of three n
147:15 - cubed minus seven
147:16 - n squared plus one over four n
147:20 - cubed plus two n squared minus one
147:24 - and we know the largest exponents take
147:26 - over which is going to leave this
147:28 - with just three-fourths
147:32 - three-fourths which is less than one
147:36 - and the root test just like the ratio
147:38 - test tells us that if we end up with a
147:40 - limit
147:41 - a row that is less than one the whole
147:44 - series
147:45 - converges absolutely
147:48 - so therefore the sum as n goes from one
147:50 - to infinity
147:52 - of three n cubed minus seven n squared
147:55 - plus one to the
147:56 - n over 4 n cubed plus 2
147:59 - n squared minus 1 to the n converges
148:05 - absolutely
148:08 - whether positive or negative it
148:10 - converges
148:19 - let's try one more example of the root
148:21 - test
148:22 - let's take the sum as n goes from 1 to
148:25 - infinity
148:28 - of n to the n power
148:31 - over the log or let's do the natural log
148:34 - the natural log of n
148:37 - raised to the n power
148:43 - again rho is going to be equal to the
148:45 - limit as n goes to infinity
148:48 - because we have n powers we're thinking
148:50 - the root test where we take the nth root
148:52 - of n to the n over the natural log of
148:56 - n to the n power
149:01 - well the nth root and the nth exponents
149:04 - will
149:05 - be inverses of each other leaving us
149:07 - with just the limit as
149:08 - n goes to infinity of n
149:12 - over the natural log of n
149:16 - the problem here is that as n goes to
149:19 - infinity the numerator goes to infinity
149:22 - and the denominator also goes to
149:24 - infinity
149:27 - so what we'll have to do is use
149:28 - l'hopital's rule which says we can take
149:31 - the derivative of the top
149:32 - and bottom the derivative of n is one
149:36 - the derivative of natural log of n is
149:38 - one over n
149:41 - which means we have the limit as n goes
149:43 - to infinity
149:45 - multiplying by the reciprocal is just
149:48 - n and as n goes to infinity
149:53 - n goes to infinity which is
149:57 - much larger than one
150:02 - and so the root test just like the ratio
150:05 - test tells us if rho
150:06 - is greater than one then the series as
150:10 - n goes from one to infinity of n to the
150:12 - n
150:13 - over the natural log of n to the n power
150:16 - diverges
150:23 - so we have two tests today to wrap up
150:25 - our work with sequences and series try
150:27 - to decide if series
150:29 - converge or diverge we have the root
150:32 - test
150:33 - which is good for powers of n where rho
150:35 - is the limit as n goes to infinity of
150:37 - the nth root of the absolute value
150:40 - and we have the ratio test where rho is
150:41 - the limit as n goes to infinity of the n
150:44 - plus one over the nth term and that
150:46 - one's helpful with factorials
150:49 - once we do that and calculate our row
150:51 - the process is the same if rho is less
150:53 - than 1
150:53 - we converge absolutely if rho is greater
150:56 - than 1
150:57 - we diverge if row equals one we have no
151:00 - information
151:01 - take a look at the homework assignment
151:03 - and try a few of these and we'll discuss
151:05 - them
151:05 - in class further and answer any
151:07 - questions that you might have
151:11 - now that we've gotten comfortable with
151:12 - various series and decide if a series
151:14 - converges or diverges we're going to
151:16 - look at some specific series that have
151:18 - some important properties that
151:20 - actually make calculus a lot easier to
151:22 - work with
151:23 - when the equations are complex
151:26 - our is going to be when
151:33 - does a power
151:36 - series
151:40 - converge
151:46 - so first we got to make sure we
151:47 - understand what we're talking about when
151:49 - i say
151:50 - power series a power series is a very
151:53 - special series
151:55 - it can be either centered at zero or any
151:58 - other value
151:59 - so first kind of the simple version of a
152:01 - power series
152:02 - is a power series
152:08 - centered
152:12 - at x equals zero
152:15 - is of the form
152:23 - the sum as n goes from zero to infinity
152:28 - of some constant and that constant
152:30 - varies based on the term
152:32 - times x to the n power in other words if
152:36 - i wrote it out it's
152:37 - basically a polynomial the first
152:40 - constant
152:41 - plus another constant times x
152:45 - plus another constant times x squared
152:48 - plus another constant times x cubed
152:52 - and so on and so on
152:58 - and this is when the power series is
152:59 - centered at zero we can shift it and
153:02 - actually do a power series
153:08 - centered
153:11 - at x equals a
153:15 - some other number which is of the form
153:23 - the sum as n goes from zero to infinity
153:26 - of those same constants but now instead
153:28 - of
153:28 - x it's going to be x minus a to the n
153:32 - power which means if we were to write
153:35 - this out when
153:36 - n is 0 the x part goes away and so we
153:40 - get
153:40 - the first constant or c sub 0
153:45 - plus c 1 times x minus a to the first
153:48 - power
153:49 - plus the next constant times x minus a
153:52 - to the second power
153:53 - plus the next constant times x minus a
153:56 - to the third power
153:58 - and so on and so forth
154:03 - and so let's take a look at some
154:04 - examples of
154:06 - power series so we can get an idea of
154:09 - what we're talking about
154:13 - an example of a power series would be
154:15 - something like
154:16 - 1 plus x
154:20 - plus x squared plus x cubed
154:24 - and so on and so forth that's a power
154:27 - series because we're looking at all the
154:28 - different powers of
154:30 - x we could even write that as equal to
154:33 - the sum
154:34 - as n goes from zero to infinity of x to
154:36 - the n power
154:40 - in fact we can make our power series as
154:43 - interesting
154:44 - as we want maybe we could make it 1
154:48 - plus x plus x squared over
154:51 - 2 factorial plus x cubed over
154:54 - 3 factorial plus and so on
154:58 - where we're dividing by the exponent
155:01 - factorial
155:03 - you know you can kind of see the first
155:05 - one we're dividing by
155:07 - 1 factorial and 0 factorial as well but
155:10 - both those are equal to one
155:11 - so we don't need that so this power
155:15 - series then
155:16 - is really the sum as n goes from zero to
155:18 - infinity
155:19 - of x to an exponent and then we divide
155:22 - by that exponent
155:24 - factorial
155:28 - let's look at one more example of a
155:30 - power series
155:33 - we're going to do 1 plus the x minus 2
155:37 - divided by 2 times 3
155:40 - plus x minus 2 squared divided by 3
155:44 - times 3 squared plus x
155:48 - minus 2 cubed divided by
155:51 - 4 times 3 cubed and so on
155:54 - and so forth
155:58 - this is also a power series because we
156:00 - see that
156:01 - x minus 2 squared cubed fourth power
156:05 - and so on so what we end up with
156:08 - is the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity
156:11 - of the x minus 2 raised to the n power
156:16 - divided by and what we notice is if we
156:19 - look in the denominators we've got
156:22 - two which is one more than the exponent
156:24 - of one
156:26 - three which is one more than the
156:27 - exponent of two four which is one more
156:30 - than the exponent of three
156:31 - so we're really dealing with x plus one
156:35 - times 3 to the
156:38 - and you notice the exponent is always
156:42 - one no the exponent's always exactly
156:46 - the exponent so the exponent on 3 is the
156:48 - same as the exponent
156:50 - on the numerator and so we end up with
156:53 - this power series
156:55 - in fact we go one step further to
156:57 - classify these power series you notice
156:59 - the first two
157:01 - don't have that x minus a property the
157:04 - first two
157:05 - are centered
157:08 - at zero while the last power series
157:12 - because it's x minus
157:13 - two is centered
157:18 - two
157:22 - so that's what a power series is
157:28 - now that we've defined what a power
157:30 - series is
157:32 - the real question is when does
157:35 - that power series converge
157:40 - we're going to take a look at the
157:44 - convergence
157:46 - of a power series
157:54 - and as it turns out the power series
158:02 - the sum as n goes from zero to infinity
158:06 - of those constants times x minus a
158:09 - raised to an exponent
158:12 - we'll always satisfy
158:18 - one of the following
158:26 - it will either a converge
158:32 - only when
158:35 - x equals a or only where it's centered
158:41 - or b it will converge
158:46 - for all real numbers
158:51 - x maybe it converges everywhere
158:56 - or c and this one's a little more
158:59 - involved
159:00 - it will converge
159:04 - if the absolute value of x minus a
159:07 - is less than some value r
159:14 - for some r
159:18 - that represents
159:23 - the radius
159:26 - of convergence
159:31 - i'll underline that term because we're
159:33 - going to use that a lot today
159:38 - and what's really interesting though is
159:40 - while when x minus a the absolute value
159:42 - is less than r
159:44 - what we don't know is when the absolute
159:47 - value of x minus a
159:49 - equals r
159:52 - it may or may not
160:04 - converge
160:07 - kind of to visually see these three
160:09 - options
160:14 - option a if i've got a number line of
160:17 - all possible values for x
160:22 - and right in the middle is a
160:28 - it could converge
160:36 - only on that value a
160:42 - and then diverge
160:46 - everywhere else
160:50 - so that's the case where it converges
160:52 - only at
160:53 - a
161:00 - or same number line
161:04 - we might have a value a in the middle
161:06 - where it's centered and it really
161:08 - converges
161:10 - everywhere
161:15 - it converges for all real numbers
161:23 - or c that same number line
161:30 - and then off to the right we're going to
161:32 - add the radius
161:33 - and off to the left we subtract the
161:36 - radius
161:37 - and what that does is give us a range of
161:39 - values
161:40 - where it converges
161:44 - and outside of those values it diverges
161:55 - but what's important to note in this
161:56 - case we have a radius of convergence
162:02 - it is not immediately clear what happens
162:05 - at those
162:05 - edges it may converge and it may diverge
162:10 - so we'll have to test those edges to get
162:12 - an idea of exactly what's happened
162:14 - but only converges on the radius
162:20 - of convergence
162:24 - where the absolute value of x minus a is
162:27 - less than
162:28 - r and then we have to really decide what
162:30 - happens exactly
162:31 - at r
162:36 - so if these are the three cases for x
162:38 - when the whole series will converge
162:40 - or diverge what we're ultimately
162:43 - interested in finding then
162:45 - is what is the radius of convergence on
162:47 - what
162:48 - interval does the series converge and
162:52 - diverge
162:58 - to find the interval
163:04 - and radius of convergence
163:11 - the easiest thing to do probably is to
163:14 - use
163:15 - the ratio test which we know
163:19 - if rho is less than one
163:22 - it converges
163:29 - so let's take a look at an example of
163:32 - a power series and see if we can
163:35 - determine
163:36 - where it converges or where it diverges
163:39 - we're going to look at the power series
163:41 - as n goes from 0 to infinity
163:44 - of x to the n over n factorial
163:48 - and see if it converges
163:52 - using the ratio test then we're looking
163:54 - for rho which is equal to the limit as
163:56 - n goes to infinity careful not to
163:58 - confuse your variables we're always
164:00 - taking n to infinity
164:03 - of the absolute value of the next term x
164:05 - to the n plus 1
164:07 - divided by n plus 1 factorial
164:11 - divided by the current term x to the n
164:14 - over
164:14 - n factorial
164:19 - so if we simplify that we get the limit
164:21 - as n goes to infinity
164:24 - of x to the n plus one over
164:29 - n plus one factorial we know is n plus 1
164:32 - times n factorial
164:35 - times the reciprocal n factorial over x
164:38 - to the n
164:42 - which is nice because it reduces with
164:43 - the n factorials dividing out
164:47 - the x to the n divides out with the x to
164:49 - the n so we're left with the limit as
164:51 - n goes to infinity of x to the first
164:55 - power
164:55 - over n plus one and really it doesn't
165:00 - matter what
165:01 - x equals as n gets huge we're taking x
165:06 - divided by a huge
165:07 - number which means this is going to
165:09 - equal zero
165:13 - in other words rho is equal to zero
165:16 - which is less than one
165:19 - for all real numbers
165:24 - for x whatever number i pick for
165:28 - x rho will always be less than one
165:33 - it's always going to be zero so
165:36 - in this case what that tells us
165:39 - is the sum as n goes from
165:42 - 0 to infinity of x to the
165:46 - n over n factorial this power
165:49 - series converges
165:54 - for all x
165:58 - in other words the radius of convergence
166:03 - is infinity it will converge no matter
166:06 - what
166:06 - x equals if i wanted to express it as an
166:08 - interval
166:09 - it converges from negative infinity all
166:12 - the way up to positive infinity
166:17 - because rho is always less than one
166:20 - this power series will always converge
166:24 - but that doesn't always happen
166:28 - let's take a look at the power series
166:32 - the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity
166:36 - of n factorial times x to the n
166:43 - let's run through the same process with
166:45 - this and see when it converges
166:49 - well we have rho is equal to the limit
166:52 - as n goes to infinity of the next term
166:56 - which is n
166:56 - plus one factorial times
167:00 - x to the n plus one
167:04 - divided by the current term n factorial
167:08 - x to the n using our ratio test
167:12 - and we simplify that we get the limit as
167:15 - n goes to infinity
167:18 - of n plus 1 is n plus 1
167:21 - times n factorial x to the n plus 1
167:26 - over n factorial x to the n
167:30 - which is nice because the n factorials
167:32 - divide out the x to the n divides out
167:35 - and we're just left with the limit as n
167:38 - goes to infinity of n plus 1
167:42 - times our x
167:46 - well in this case regardless of what x
167:48 - is actually
167:50 - equal to when n goes to infinity this
167:53 - whole thing is going to be infinity
167:55 - times our
167:56 - x and it comes out to be infinity
168:01 - to converge we need this to be less than
168:04 - one but it is
168:05 - never less than
168:09 - one
168:12 - because we're never less than one we
168:14 - don't really have a radius
168:16 - of convergence in other words what we
168:18 - can conclude
168:20 - therefore the sum as n goes from 0 to
168:24 - infinity
168:25 - of the power series n factorial times x
168:28 - to the n
168:31 - it will diverge
168:32 - [Music]
168:34 - everywhere except one place
168:40 - recall that we always converge at least
168:42 - on the center
168:45 - at least when x is equal to a
168:49 - well this power series is centered at 0
168:51 - because we're not doing x
168:52 - minus anything so it diverges
168:56 - for all x not equal to zero
169:01 - in other words the radius of convergence
169:07 - because we're only on one point the
169:09 - radius is zero
169:11 - in the interval of convergence
169:14 - there's not really an interval it's just
169:16 - the value at the center which happens to
169:19 - also be
169:20 - zero
169:25 - so that's the second case where it
169:27 - diverges everywhere except the center
169:29 - which in this case happens to be zero
169:34 - so when do we end up with an actual
169:36 - radius of convergence
169:40 - well let's try that other series we
169:42 - played with earlier
169:43 - let's try the power series as n goes
169:46 - from zero to infinity
169:48 - of x minus two to the n
169:52 - divided by n plus 1 times 3 to the n
170:00 - using the ratio test rho is equal to the
170:03 - limit
170:04 - as n goes to infinity
170:07 - of the next term which is x minus two to
170:10 - the n
170:10 - plus one divided by
170:15 - n plus one plus one is n plus two
170:19 - times three to the n plus 1
170:23 - divided by the current term which is x
170:26 - minus 2 to the n
170:28 - divided by n plus 1 times 3 to the n
170:36 - and when i multiply by the reciprocal
170:42 - we get x plus two to the n plus one
170:48 - divided by n plus 2 3 to the n
170:51 - plus 1
170:56 - times the reciprocal n plus 1
171:00 - times 3 to the n
171:05 - oops i put x plus 2 that should be x
171:07 - minus 2.
171:09 - careful not to change the signs x minus
171:12 - 2 to the n in the denominator
171:17 - reducing here things become really nice
171:19 - the x minus 2 to the n divides up with
171:21 - the n
171:22 - leaving 1 behind the
171:25 - 3 to the n divides out with the n
171:27 - leaving 1 3 behind
171:30 - and so what's left is the limit as
171:34 - n goes to infinity
171:37 - of an x minus 2 times an n plus 1
171:43 - over a 3 times n
171:46 - plus two
171:50 - not forgetting the absolute values that
171:51 - are around everything because that's
171:52 - important here
171:55 - well as n goes to infinity we know the
171:59 - n term is going to take over but notice
172:02 - it's the same
172:03 - in on numerator and denominator which
172:06 - means we're going to
172:07 - end up with the coefficients of n
172:12 - which is the absolute value of x minus 2
172:17 - divided by the absolute value of 3 which
172:19 - is just
172:20 - 3.
172:23 - well that's interesting because the
172:25 - first time when we took the limit
172:28 - we ended up with a value that was always
172:30 - smaller than one so we said it was all
172:32 - real numbers
172:34 - the second time we took the limit in
172:36 - example number two
172:38 - we end up with a value that's never less
172:39 - than one so we said it's
172:42 - basically has no radius but here we got
172:45 - x minus two's absolute value over three
172:48 - which we want to be less than one
172:52 - which means what we've ended up with is
172:54 - an equation
172:56 - that we can solve for x
173:00 - we've got the absolute value of x minus
173:02 - 2 over 3
173:03 - is less than one multiplying both sides
173:07 - by 3
173:10 - the absolute value of x minus 2 is less
173:13 - than 3.
173:15 - remove the absolute values puts x minus
173:18 - 2
173:18 - between negative 3 and positive 3.
173:24 - and adding 2 to both sides puts x
173:27 - between
173:28 - 5 and negative 1.
173:36 - what we have is a radius
173:39 - of convergence
173:43 - the radius is what the absolute value is
173:45 - less than
173:47 - it's less than 3 which means it's going
173:50 - to have a radius of convergence of 3
173:52 - wide 3 to the left and 3 to the right
173:55 - from the center
173:57 - and it will converge on the interval
174:04 - from negative 1 negative 1
174:09 - to 5. however we don't know what happens
174:13 - at negative 1 and at 5. recall we have
174:17 - to actually
174:18 - check those values
174:23 - so let's go back and check those values
174:27 - specifically let's see what happens at
174:29 - negative one
174:32 - actually i'll say at x equals negative
174:34 - 1.
174:37 - when x is equal to negative 1
174:41 - our original series we're going back to
174:43 - the beginning here
174:44 - this original series that we're working
174:46 - with
174:48 - if i plug negative 1 in for x i get the
174:50 - sum as
174:51 - n goes from 0 to infinity
174:55 - of negative 3 to the n
175:01 - over n plus one
175:05 - times three to the n
175:09 - which is nice because the three to the n
175:11 - divide out
175:15 - leaving behind a negative 1 to the n
175:19 - and so we have the sum as n goes from 0
175:22 - to infinity
175:24 - of negative 1 to the n
175:28 - divided by n plus one
175:33 - notice those denominators are just
175:34 - counting up one uh when n is zero it
175:37 - starts at one
175:39 - two three four we have one half
175:42 - one third one-fourth one-fifth one-sixth
175:45 - we should recognize that as the harmonic
175:47 - series
175:49 - but because we have negative one to the
175:51 - n in the numerator
175:52 - this is actually the alternating
175:58 - harmonic which we know
176:01 - converges
176:05 - so on our interval when x equals
176:07 - negative 1 we can put a square bracket
176:09 - because we know the alternating harmonic
176:11 - series which we end up with at negative
176:12 - 1
176:13 - does converge
176:16 - but we still need to see what happens
176:20 - at x equals 5 the other edge
176:25 - if x equals 5 we have the sum as n goes
176:28 - from 0 to infinity
176:29 - of 5 minus 2 which is 3 to the n
176:33 - over n plus 1 times 3 to the n
176:38 - which when the three to the ends divide
176:41 - out
176:42 - leaving one in the numerator is the sum
176:45 - as n goes from zero to infinity
176:48 - of one over n plus one
176:52 - and so when we start plugging in values
176:53 - of n we get
176:55 - one over one plus one over two plus one
176:57 - over three plus one over four plus one
176:59 - over five
177:00 - we should recognize that as the harmonic
177:06 - series
177:08 - and the harmonic series which is not
177:10 - alternating
177:11 - we've shown diverges
177:15 - so at five it actually diverges so we're
177:18 - going to do
177:18 - a curved bracket
177:22 - which means we have a power series with
177:25 - a radius of convergence of
177:26 - 3 meaning x can be 3 away from its
177:30 - center
177:31 - x can the whole series will converge
177:34 - when x ranges from negative
177:36 - one including negative one
177:39 - to five excluding the five
177:43 - [Music]
177:45 - so that's how we can decide if a power
177:48 - series
177:49 - converges we'll use the ratio test
177:53 - and find out does it converge only at
177:54 - the center for all real numbers
177:57 - or within some radius of convergence and
177:59 - we can figure out what that radius
178:01 - is and exactly what interval
178:04 - works for x so that the series converges
178:11 - but why are power series important
178:16 - power series are important to us because
178:20 - quite often we can represent
178:24 - functions
178:28 - as power series
178:35 - and usually the power series is easier
178:39 - to do calculus with
178:40 - than the original function so if we can
178:44 - represent the function as a power
178:46 - series we'll do the calculus on the
178:49 - power series and save us a lot of
178:51 - grief for example we
178:58 - know
179:00 - the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity
179:03 - of a times r to the n that's the
179:07 - geometric series
179:09 - the geometric series is equal to the
179:11 - starting value a
179:12 - divided by one minus the ratio
179:16 - given the ratio is less than one because
179:19 - if the ratio is greater than one it ends
179:21 - up diverging
179:26 - so
179:31 - if i have the function f of x equals 1
179:34 - over 1 plus x cubed
179:39 - i could represent that as a power series
179:42 - if i can make it look like a
179:45 - over 1 minus r well we're not too far
179:49 - away from
179:50 - a over 1 minus r because we've already
179:53 - got a 1
179:54 - over 1 but instead of plus if i make it
179:56 - a minus
179:59 - and i think what could i subtract that
180:00 - would be the same as adding
180:02 - x cubed well if we subtract a negative x
180:08 - cubed
180:10 - then we're in the same form where r is
180:12 - equal to the
180:13 - negative x cubed
180:16 - so we can go to our power series as n
180:19 - goes from zero to infinity
180:23 - of a
180:27 - a is the numerator the starting value of
180:29 - 1
180:32 - times r which is what we're subtracting
180:34 - which is negative
180:35 - x cubed to the n
180:39 - power or cleaning that
180:42 - up we have the sum as n goes from zero
180:45 - to infinity
180:47 - one times anything is just that and i'm
180:49 - going to separate out the negative signs
180:51 - so we can see it's an alternating series
180:53 - negative 1 to the n
180:55 - times x to the 3n
181:02 - this power series then comes out to be
181:04 - the same value as
181:06 - one over one plus x cubed
181:10 - or we could write it out as the
181:11 - individual terms when n
181:13 - is one everything comes out to just a
181:15 - positive one
181:17 - minus because we're alternating i'm
181:20 - sorry starting out when n is zero
181:23 - now when n is one we get a negative x to
181:26 - the third
181:28 - plus when n is two we get x to the sixth
181:33 - minus when x is 3 we get
181:36 - x to the ninth plus
181:39 - and so on
181:42 - i want to take a look visually at this
181:46 - function coming together all right what
181:49 - i've done here on desmos is i've graphed
181:51 - the function we were working with 1 over
181:53 - 1 plus x cubed
181:55 - and then i'm going to start to build the
181:56 - power series that we found the power
181:58 - series that we found
182:00 - was 1 minus x cubed
182:04 - is the first two terms and notice that
182:06 - the blue line starts to kind of follow
182:08 - the red line
182:10 - now look what happens when we add x to
182:11 - the sixth
182:13 - it gets a little closer minus x to the
182:16 - ninth
182:16 - it gets a little closer plus x to the
182:19 - twelfth it gets a little closer
182:21 - minus x to the fifteenth it gets closer
182:23 - and as i continue to work through this
182:26 - power
182:26 - series the graph will start to get
182:29 - closer and closer
182:32 - to the graph of one over x one over one
182:35 - plus
182:35 - x cubed eventually leveling out at
182:38 - exactly
182:39 - the right value so that's how we can
182:42 - find
182:42 - a power series that gives us the exact
182:45 - same graph let's do one more example
182:49 - before we wrap up
182:51 - let's look at f of x equals x squared
182:55 - over 4 minus x squared
183:01 - now if we want to be in power series
183:03 - form we're ok with the numerator
183:05 - but we do need a 1 minus right now we
183:09 - have a
183:09 - 4 minus so what i'm going to do is i'm
183:12 - going to factor that
183:13 - 4 out of the denominator
183:18 - leaving behind a 1 minus and now it's x
183:21 - squared over 4.
183:26 - but we don't like to have a constant in
183:28 - front of the denominator so i'm going to
183:30 - pop that up to the numerator
183:33 - which is going to give us x squared over
183:36 - 4 in the numerator divided by one minus
183:41 - another x squared over four
183:46 - now we're in power series form
183:50 - of a geometric series where we've got
183:52 - the sum as
183:53 - n goes from 0 to infinity
183:56 - of the first term which is the numerator
184:00 - x squared over 4
184:04 - times r which is what's subtracted in
184:08 - the denominator
184:09 - x squared over 4
184:13 - raised to the n power
184:19 - well if i want to clean that up a little
184:21 - bit
184:23 - we'll have the sum as n goes from 0 to
184:25 - infinity
184:27 - of if i multiply the exponents we've got
184:32 - x to the 2n times x squared adding those
184:35 - exponents we get x
184:36 - to the 2 plus 2 n over
184:39 - 4 to the we've got 1 4
184:42 - and putting the n on the denominator as
184:44 - well 4 to the 1
184:46 - plus n power
184:51 - and we end up with a power series
184:54 - that's equal to the original function
185:01 - so we looked at several things today in
185:03 - this video we defined a power series
185:05 - we're going to continue to work with
185:07 - them over the next couple videos
185:08 - and then we looked at when the power
185:10 - series converges by identifying the
185:12 - radius of convergence in the interval
185:14 - where it converges it'll either converge
185:16 - at the center everywhere over a specific
185:20 - interval and we use the ratio test to
185:22 - decide when that is
185:24 - and then we concluded it looking at why
185:26 - power series are important
185:27 - by converting a known function
185:31 - into a power series specifically looking
185:34 - at the geometric
185:35 - series later we'll look at other series
185:38 - that aren't in the geometric series form
185:40 - that we can still convert into power
185:42 - series but this is where we're going to
185:43 - start with for now
185:44 - so take a look at the homework practice
185:46 - a few of these
185:47 - and we will see you in class
185:52 - now that we've taken a look at what a
185:53 - power series is and how to work with a
185:55 - power series
185:56 - we're ready to actually do some calculus
185:58 - with power series
186:00 - the question is going to be how
186:03 - can power series
186:10 - make derivatives
186:16 - and integrals
186:20 - easier
186:27 - and the brief answer to this is that
186:30 - often
186:32 - calculus
186:36 - is easier
186:42 - with a series
186:46 - than the function
186:55 - for example if
186:58 - the function f of x is equal to some
187:01 - power series
187:02 - from n to 0 to infinity
187:06 - of the constants times x minus its
187:09 - center a
187:10 - raised to the n power
187:15 - then we know
187:19 - that the derivative of the function
187:26 - would be equal to the derivative of a
187:28 - power series
187:31 - well what's nice about power series is
187:33 - it's a sum of many terms that have the
187:35 - exact same
187:36 - form so we can take the derivative term
187:38 - by
187:39 - term or really we can take the
187:41 - derivative of the entire sum
187:44 - as n goes from 0 to infinity
187:49 - and this c sub n is a constant
187:55 - and the exponent we know comes out front
187:58 - and then x minus a stays the same and
188:01 - then the exponent is
188:02 - decreased by 1.
188:06 - just using our exponent property we've
188:08 - taken the derivative
188:09 - term by term
188:12 - and we can do the same thing with the
188:14 - integral the integral
188:17 - of f of x dx
188:21 - is equal to the integral of the power
188:24 - series
188:25 - well going to the original power series
188:27 - as n goes from zero to infinity
188:30 - this time we keep the same constant out
188:33 - front
188:34 - and we know that we increase the
188:36 - exponent by 1
188:38 - and divide by the new exponent
188:42 - now there's a couple adjustments that we
188:44 - need to make
188:45 - to these definitions though first
188:48 - let's look at the blue one the
188:49 - derivative when we take a derivative
188:51 - remember the first
188:53 - term in a power series is a constant
188:56 - and the derivative of a constant is
188:58 - always zero so
189:00 - actually it doesn't go from 1 to infin 0
189:03 - to infinity
189:04 - it actually goes from 1 to infinity
189:06 - because that first
189:07 - term's derivative is 0 so we don't need
189:10 - to include it in our
189:12 - derivative with the integral we make up
189:15 - for that
189:16 - first term by having an extra constant
189:18 - now i'm going to add the constant
189:20 - before the sum because i don't want that
189:24 - constant to look like it's part of the
189:25 - sum
189:26 - but the power series anti-derivative
189:28 - does have a constant
189:30 - plus the sum of the anti-derivative and
189:32 - that kind of sticks that extra term
189:35 - back in there so minor adjustments to
189:38 - the intuitive formula just a couple
189:40 - things to be
189:41 - aware of so if that's true that we can
189:45 - just take the derivative
189:46 - term by term and the antiderivative term
189:48 - by term
189:50 - what we can do is we can use what we
189:53 - know
189:56 - to find derivatives and antiderivatives
190:01 - we know
190:05 - that for the function f of x equals 1
190:07 - over 1 minus
190:08 - x we know that's a geometric series
190:12 - sum as n goes from 0 to infinity
190:16 - where the first term is 1 and we take
190:18 - the x to the n power
190:23 - based on what we know we're going to
190:25 - find a
190:26 - power series
190:31 - for the function g of x
190:35 - equals 1 over 1 minus x
190:38 - squared which is really equal to
190:43 - one minus x to the negative two
190:48 - well you might notice that that's very
190:50 - similar to the function that we know
190:52 - that we started with
190:53 - at the beginning so we know that the
190:56 - function
190:57 - f of x is equal to 1 minus x to the
191:00 - negative 1.
191:03 - and if i take the derivative of f
191:07 - f prime of x
191:10 - we would bring the exponent out front
191:14 - bring the exponent down by one times the
191:16 - derivative of the inside the derivative
191:18 - of negative one is positive one
191:20 - i'm sorry the derivative of negative x
191:22 - is negative one
191:23 - a negative and a negative makes a
191:25 - positive
191:27 - which means our derivative is one
191:30 - over one minus x squared
191:35 - which is what we're trying to find a
191:37 - power series
191:38 - for so we know the power series for the
191:43 - first
191:43 - original function is the sum as n goes
191:46 - from zero to infinity of x to the n
191:50 - and we know the second function is its
191:52 - derivative
191:54 - so we'll take the derivative term by
191:56 - term remember we have to have n equals
191:57 - one because the first term goes to zero
192:00 - to infinity bring the n out front
192:04 - and we have x to the n minus 1.
192:08 - and we have just found a power series
192:11 - for an
192:11 - unknown function because it's the
192:13 - derivative of
192:15 - a known function
192:18 - so if we can make that connection with
192:20 - something we know
192:21 - we can use calculus to find the new
192:24 - power
192:24 - series here's another one
192:29 - what if we want to find a power
192:32 - series
192:36 - for h of x equals the negative natural
192:40 - log
192:41 - of one minus x
192:47 - well again the function we know
192:51 - is 1 over 1 minus x
192:57 - we also know that the antiderivative of
192:59 - f of x dx
193:03 - would be the natural log of the stuff 1
193:06 - minus x
193:08 - and then we have to divide by the
193:09 - derivative of the inside which is
193:11 - negative 1.
193:13 - and so the antiderivative of our known
193:16 - function
193:16 - is the negative natural log of 1
193:19 - minus x well if we know
193:23 - the power series for the original
193:25 - function is the sum
193:26 - as n goes from 0 to infinity of x to the
193:28 - n
193:30 - we're just going to integrate that to
193:32 - get our new power series
193:35 - don't forget we need a constant plus
193:41 - the sum as n goes from zero
193:45 - to infinity of x to the n
193:48 - plus one divided by n plus one
193:58 - one little thing that remains though is
194:00 - what is that constant c
194:02 - so we make sure we're equal to the
194:04 - original function
194:06 - well to figure out what's going on with
194:08 - that constant we'll take the zeroth
194:10 - term and see how much it is off by so if
194:13 - we plug zero
194:14 - in for our x we get negative
194:18 - natural log of one minus zero which is
194:20 - the negative natural log of one
194:24 - which is just 0. so our constant in this
194:28 - case is equal
194:29 - to 0. so we don't need the constant here
194:33 - it's equal to 0
194:34 - we're just going to say it's equal to
194:36 - the sum as n goes from zero to
194:38 - infinity of x to the n plus one
194:43 - over n plus one
194:46 - and actually all that n plus one stuff
194:48 - kind of seems silly to me that we're
194:49 - shifting one
194:50 - over in the numerator and shifting 1
194:52 - over to the denominator
194:54 - instead of shifting 1 over in the
194:56 - formula let's shift one of our ends over
194:59 - starting with n equals 1 to infinity and
195:01 - now it becomes just
195:02 - x to the n over n
195:13 - so that's how we can use calculus to
195:15 - move from a known
195:16 - series to a power series for an unknown
195:19 - series if we can connect the known
195:21 - series to a derivative or
195:22 - anti-derivative of the known series
195:25 - we can just take the derivatives term by
195:27 - term
195:28 - and we end up with our new power series
195:34 - another place that calculus comes in
195:36 - handy is
195:37 - with partial fractions and power series
195:40 - so let's take a look at that really
195:42 - quick
195:44 - partial fractions
195:50 - and power series
195:54 - and we're actually not going to take the
195:55 - antiderivative but we're going to use
195:57 - the idea behind partial fractions
195:59 - to build an unknown power series
196:04 - let's say f of x
196:07 - is equal to one over one minus
196:10 - x times x minus two and we wanna build a
196:14 - power series for this
196:18 - well if we were to break it up
196:21 - into two fractions a over 1 minus
196:25 - x plus b over x minus
196:28 - 2. we could use
196:31 - what we know about the form of a
196:33 - geometric series
196:34 - to change these into gmet2 geometric
196:37 - series
196:39 - but first we have to figure out what a
196:41 - and b is
196:43 - so if we multiply across we get
196:47 - 1 equals a times x minus 2
196:50 - plus b times 1 minus x
196:54 - if we let x equal 2 we end up with one
196:57 - equals
196:58 - b times negative one so b is negative
197:02 - one
197:04 - if we let x equal one we end up with
197:08 - one equals negative one times a
197:12 - so a also equals negative 1.
197:16 - and so what we end up with then
197:19 - is that f of x is negative 1 over 1
197:22 - minus
197:23 - x plus negative 1 over x minus 2.
197:29 - okay let's see if we can massage these
197:32 - to get them in the right format
197:34 - where we have a geometric series form
197:36 - remember a geometric series form
197:38 - is going to be a over 1 minus the ratio
197:43 - the first one is actually already there
197:47 - the second one we're going to do a
197:48 - little bit of work with
197:51 - one thing we can do on the second one is
197:53 - we're going to switch the order
197:56 - so we have negative 2 plus
197:59 - x that way the
198:02 - variable is on the right side and then
198:05 - like before we can divide out a negative
198:08 - two so that we just have one
198:11 - minus x over two
198:14 - and then that negative two needs to move
198:17 - up to the numerator
198:18 - so that we're in power series form so we
198:21 - finally end up with is negative one over
198:23 - one minus
198:24 - x plus negative one over negative two is
198:28 - one half
198:30 - over one minus x over two
198:36 - which means we're dealing with a power
198:39 - series two power series added together
198:42 - we've got the sum as n goes from zero to
198:44 - infinity
198:46 - of the first term is the numerator so
198:48 - that's the negative one
198:52 - times the ratio which we're just
198:55 - subtracting
198:56 - x in the denominator so the ratio must
198:58 - just be x
198:59 - to the n
199:02 - plus the second power series which has a
199:05 - first term of
199:06 - one half because it's in the numerator
199:09 - times what's subtracted in the
199:10 - denominator x over two
199:13 - to the n power
199:18 - and maybe i want to clean that up a bit
199:20 - we've got the sum as
199:21 - n goes from 0 to infinity
199:25 - i want to factor out ultimately an x to
199:27 - the n
199:28 - so i'm putting that in onto both top and
199:30 - bottom
199:32 - because it's not a power series unless
199:34 - we're multiplying by
199:35 - x to the n everything else becomes that
199:38 - constant
199:39 - out front and so we factored out that x
199:42 - to the n we're left with negative 1
199:45 - plus a 1
199:48 - over in the denominator we've got a 2
199:51 - and a 2 to the n so combine that
199:53 - together we get 2 to the n
199:55 - plus 1 is our coefficient
199:59 - and now we ended up with a power series
200:03 - that represents this function
200:07 - we were able to do that because our
200:08 - partial fractions
200:10 - allowed us to break it into two
200:12 - geometric series looking parts
200:15 - and we could make each part into a
200:16 - geometric series and factor out the x to
200:19 - the n
200:20 - to end up with our final partial
200:22 - fraction power
200:23 - series
200:26 - one last point then to wrap up this
200:28 - video
200:32 - let's take a look at how we can take a
200:34 - power series
200:40 - and find a function
200:46 - doing the exact opposite process we were
200:47 - doing before before we started with the
200:49 - function and we worked to find the power
200:51 - series
200:52 - now we're going to start with the
200:54 - function which is the sum as n
200:56 - goes from 1 to infinity of 1 over
201:00 - x plus 4 to the 2 n minus 1 and we're
201:04 - going to see if we can build this
201:05 - into a function
201:09 - that's equal to the sum
201:13 - well one thing i notice is we're trying
201:14 - to make it into a geometric geometrics
201:16 - like to be
201:17 - start at n equals zero so what we're
201:20 - going to do is we're going to shift this
201:22 - power series down to
201:23 - n equals zero which means we need to
201:25 - account for an extra
201:28 - in if you will so where we see the
201:31 - n we're gonna call it n plus one
201:37 - and that'll shift to the zero
201:40 - over one
201:43 - so if we replace that n with n plus one
201:45 - we get one
201:46 - over x minus four to the two
201:49 - times n plus one minus one
201:54 - and a little bit of algebra in that
201:56 - exponent
201:57 - gives us one over x minus four
202:01 - to the two n plus two minus one
202:05 - gives us a plus one
202:11 - well i'm going to keep trying to massage
202:13 - this as we work to figure out
202:15 - where our geometric series form might be
202:18 - when we see that addition
202:22 - inside an exponent we can break that
202:24 - into a product
202:25 - so let's see what that gives us the sum
202:27 - as n goes from
202:28 - 0 to infinity of 1
202:32 - over and i'm going to do the first power
202:34 - first
202:35 - x minus 4 times
202:39 - 1 over x minus 4
202:42 - to the 2n
202:46 - well notice we're getting really really
202:49 - close
202:50 - oops it's a plus 4 isn't it i've been
202:51 - writing this wrong
202:55 - make sure we're not changing our signs
202:57 - halfway through the problem
202:58 - sorry about that
203:03 - we're getting really close to that
203:05 - geometric form because the geometric
203:07 - form
203:08 - says we've got our first term times our
203:11 - second term which needs to be raised to
203:13 - the n power
203:15 - so if we could write that second part
203:18 - as something to the n power we'd be in
203:20 - business
203:21 - and if we go as n goes from zero to
203:23 - infinity of one over x
203:25 - plus four times
203:29 - what's nice about a numerator of 1 is it
203:31 - can be written as 1 to the n
203:34 - so if i pull out an n power we're left
203:37 - with
203:38 - x plus 4 squared
203:44 - in the denominator in fact we could even
203:47 - write that
203:49 - as
203:52 - 1 over x plus 4
203:55 - the entire thing squared because the one
203:58 - squared doesn't matter
204:00 - and now what we've got is we've got our
204:05 - first term which becomes the numerator
204:10 - and the ratio which is subtracted in the
204:13 - denominator
204:16 - recall that the sum as n goes from zero
204:19 - to infinity
204:21 - of a times r to the n
204:24 - is equal to the numerator a over 1 minus
204:27 - the r
204:30 - so in our case the numerator a
204:34 - is the 1 over x plus 4.
204:38 - over the denominator one minus the ratio
204:41 - that's multiplied is one over
204:42 - x plus four squared
204:52 - but this is really an ugly format so to
204:55 - get rid of the fractions and fractions
204:57 - remember we've got x plus 4 squared in
204:59 - the denominator so we're going to
205:01 - multiply
205:02 - by x plus 4 squared on top and bottom
205:06 - it's going to distribute through and so
205:10 - what we'll end up with
205:12 - is a single x plus 4 in the numerator
205:16 - and x plus 4 squared minus
205:20 - and the x plus 4 is divide out so it's
205:22 - just minus 1.
205:26 - and we end up with this final function
205:31 - that is equal to the original sum that
205:33 - we started with
205:36 - so sometimes we can kind of parse this
205:39 - power series apart
205:41 - to find the pieces of the geometric
205:44 - sum if we are in fact in a geometric
205:47 - form
205:48 - if it's not a geometric series we're
205:50 - going to need a new game plan
205:52 - and that's what we're going to take a
205:53 - look at in our next video but for now
205:55 - take a look at how we can take
205:56 - derivatives and anti-derivatives of
205:58 - known
205:59 - power series and unknown power series
206:02 - and then also how the partial fractions
206:04 - can help us find power series
206:05 - and break up a power series to find a
206:08 - function
206:10 - good luck and we will see you in class
206:15 - thus far we focused our attention of
206:16 - power series on
206:18 - geometric series everything relates to a
206:20 - geometric series and can be written in
206:22 - the form of a geometric series
206:24 - but that's actually not the case in fact
206:26 - most
206:27 - functions cannot be written in the form
206:29 - of a geometric series
206:30 - so the question that we're going to try
206:32 - and address today
206:33 - is how do we find
206:39 - a power series
206:45 - for other functions
206:53 - and the answer to that is what are
206:56 - called
206:56 - a taylor series
207:00 - and mclaren
207:05 - series and taylor and mclaren developed
207:08 - these processes independent of each
207:10 - other there's a slight difference
207:11 - between the two of them
207:13 - taylor's is probably the most well-known
207:16 - because it's the most
207:17 - versatile taylor said
207:23 - a series
207:28 - for a function
207:33 - at the point a
207:36 - is
207:41 - the function at a plus the first
207:44 - derivative at a
207:46 - divided by 1 factorial
207:50 - times x minus a to the first power
207:53 - plus the second derivative at a
207:57 - over 2 factorial times x minus a to the
208:00 - second power
208:03 - plus the third derivative and we'll just
208:05 - put a little 3
208:07 - at a divided by three factorial
208:12 - times x minus a to the third power
208:17 - and so on and so forth ultimately we're
208:20 - adding
208:21 - the nth derivative at a divided by
208:24 - n factorial times x minus
208:28 - a to the nth power on and on and on to
208:31 - infinity
208:35 - in other words it is the sum as n goes
208:38 - from
208:38 - zero to infinity of the nth derivative
208:42 - at a divided by n
208:45 - factorial times x minus a
208:49 - to the n
208:55 - this is what is called a taylor
208:58 - series now mclaren
209:03 - wasn't quite as versatile when he came
209:06 - up with
209:07 - his version of this same result
209:11 - mclaren said
209:15 - basically the same thing a series at
209:19 - but mclaren kept it at a equals 0 and
209:22 - didn't expand it to any a
209:25 - so if we plug 0 in for all the a's we
209:27 - basically get what's called
209:28 - a mclaren series which is
209:31 - f of 0 plus the first derivative at zero
209:35 - divided by one factorial times x to the
209:38 - first
209:41 - plus the second derivative at zero
209:43 - divided by two factorial
209:45 - times x to the second plus
209:48 - the third derivative at zero divided by
209:52 - three factorial times x to the third
209:54 - and so on and so forth and so what you
209:56 - see is we're ultimately
209:58 - taking the nth derivative at zero
210:02 - dividing by n factorial
210:05 - times x to the n and we keep going all
210:08 - the way up to infinity
210:10 - in other words it can be summarized as
210:12 - the sum as n goes from zero to infinity
210:16 - of f to the n at 0 divided by n
210:19 - factorial times x to the n
210:23 - and we get a mclaren series and really a
210:26 - mclaren series is a special case
210:29 - of the taylor series because it's just
210:32 - when a equals zero
210:34 - turns out the algebra is a lot nicer
210:35 - when a is zero for a mclaren series
210:38 - but the process is exactly the same the
210:41 - idea is if we can identify
210:43 - the generic form of all of the
210:45 - derivatives
210:47 - at the point we can write it as
210:50 - a mclaren or taylor series
210:55 - let's take a look at how we can write
210:56 - any function as a power series
211:00 - we're going to find either the
211:02 - [Music]
211:04 - well let's start with maclaren actually
211:05 - let's start with the mclaren series
211:09 - sometimes they're called mclaren
211:10 - polynomials
211:13 - a maclaren polynomial is not infinite it
211:15 - stops at a certain point
211:17 - but if we make it into a series going
211:19 - all the way to infinity
211:22 - we can find a mclaren series for example
211:25 - for
211:26 - f of x equals e to the x
211:31 - so we're going to start to look for a
211:33 - pattern that's going to occur
211:35 - with the derivatives so f
211:38 - of x actually start with f of x
211:42 - we know f of x is e to the x
211:46 - the first derivative is also e to the x
211:50 - the second derivative is also e to the x
211:53 - and so we can see pretty quick that any
211:55 - derivative
211:56 - is just e to the x
212:00 - and since this is a mclaren series we're
212:02 - actually going to plug
212:03 - 0 into all of these well e to the zero
212:07 - is one
212:09 - the first derivative at zero is also one
212:13 - the second derivative at zero is also
212:16 - one
212:17 - and so on and so forth we see that any
212:19 - derivative at zero is e to the 0 which
212:22 - is equal to 1.
212:25 - so we can build this mclaren series by
212:27 - saying okay e to the x
212:29 - is equal to first the function at 0
212:32 - which is 1 plus the first derivative
212:36 - which is one
212:39 - over one factorial times x to the first
212:43 - plus the second derivative which is one
212:46 - over two factorial times
212:48 - x squared
212:51 - plus and so on continuing with this
212:54 - pattern until we have the nth derivative
212:58 - which is 1 over n factorial
213:02 - times x to that n power and so on
213:09 - well if we've seen this pattern building
213:12 - essentially we have the sum as
213:14 - n goes from zero to infinity
213:18 - of all of the x to the n's divided by
213:22 - n factorial
213:26 - this series then is equal to the e to
213:29 - the x function
213:31 - in fact in certain context as we
213:33 - continue our study of mathematics
213:35 - it's more convenient instead of working
213:36 - with e to the x to work with the power
213:39 - series
213:39 - the sum of x to the n over n factorial
213:46 - this one wasn't too interesting though
213:47 - because all of the
213:49 - zero points ended up being equal to one
213:52 - so let's see if we can find a mclaren
213:54 - series for something a little more
213:56 - interesting
213:57 - how about f of x equals
214:00 - the sine of x
214:05 - well if we start building our
214:06 - derivatives f of x is the sine of x
214:10 - f prime the derivative of sine is cosine
214:15 - the second derivative is negative sine
214:21 - the third derivative is negative cosine
214:26 - and the fourth derivative then
214:31 - becomes positive sign and so we're
214:32 - starting to cycle back through
214:34 - sine cosine negative sine negative
214:36 - cosine
214:39 - okay let's plug 0 in because that's what
214:43 - mclaren wants us to do
214:45 - the sine of 0 is equal to 0.
214:50 - the first derivative at 0 is the cosine
214:52 - of 0
214:54 - which is 1.
214:57 - the second derivative at zero is the
214:59 - negative sign
215:01 - well negative sine of zero is zero
215:06 - the third derivative at zero is negative
215:09 - cosine which is 1
215:10 - so negative 1 and then the fourth
215:13 - derivative at 0 is going to start to
215:15 - cycle back through our answers and so we
215:18 - end up with coefficients of 0
215:20 - 1 0 negative 1 0 1
215:23 - 0 negative 1 which means all
215:26 - of the odd terms the first term the
215:29 - third term the fifth term and so on
215:32 - are all going to be 0 because we're
215:34 - multiplying
215:35 - by that derivative so we don't really
215:38 - have any odd terms
215:41 - the first term 0 or the 0th term is 0.
215:45 - and now for the first term we'll take x
215:48 - to the first power
215:50 - divided by one factorial times the
215:53 - derivative of one
215:57 - the second derivative is zero so we have
215:59 - zero when we do the third derivatives
216:01 - the third derivative is negative one
216:03 - times x to the third
216:06 - over that three factorial
216:09 - the fourth derivative is zero but the
216:11 - fifth goes back
216:12 - to x to the fifth over
216:16 - five factorial
216:20 - then we're going to do minus and you
216:21 - start to see the pattern forming the
216:23 - sixth power goes to zero but the seventh
216:25 - power is negative
216:27 - x to the seventh over seven factorial
216:31 - and so on
216:34 - so we need a way to represent this
216:37 - pattern
216:38 - so we can convert it into a series
216:42 - well one thing that i notice is we are
216:44 - alternating
216:45 - positive negative positive negative so
216:48 - we've got a negative 1 to the n
216:51 - to give us that alternating series
216:54 - notice when n is 1
216:59 - actually we're going to start at 0. so
217:01 - when n is
217:02 - 0 negative 1 to the 0 is a positive 1
217:05 - which matches our first term
217:06 - so that's good then we've got x raised
217:10 - to an
217:10 - exponent but the exponents on x are all
217:13 - the odd numbers so we can't just say
217:15 - n what we can say though
217:18 - if 2n is the odd numbers
217:21 - 2n plus 1 i'm sorry 2n is the even
217:24 - numbers
217:26 - adding 1 2n plus 1 becomes all the odd
217:29 - numbers
217:31 - so as you can see when n is 0
217:35 - the first term has x to the first when
217:38 - n is 1 plugging 1 in we end up with
217:42 - x to the third when n is
217:46 - two the second term remember that we're
217:48 - starting at zero zero one two
217:51 - we end up with two times two plus one
217:53 - which is five so those exponents work
217:55 - out
217:56 - and we're dividing by that same exponent
217:58 - two n plus one
218:01 - factorial and that's going to continue
218:04 - forever
218:05 - as we end up taking the sum as n goes
218:08 - from zero to infinity
218:10 - of that exact thing we just found
218:12 - negative one to the n
218:14 - x to the two n plus one
218:18 - over two n plus one factorial
218:22 - this is our mclaren series our power
218:25 - series
218:27 - that is exactly the same as the sine of
218:30 - x
218:32 - i want to take a look at this on desmos
218:34 - because i really think this is amazing
218:35 - when you see the graph work out
218:37 - okay what i've done on here is i've
218:39 - graphed sine of x we know sine of x
218:41 - starting at zero going up and down
218:43 - period of two pi amplitude of one
218:47 - that's that's not very exciting but what
218:50 - we've just found out is that the mclaren
218:52 - series which starts with x
218:55 - over one factorial and then it's going
218:58 - to be alternating
218:59 - with the odd exponents should be exactly
219:02 - the same as this graph
219:03 - and this is really neat to watch it
219:05 - build when we subtract
219:07 - x cubed over three factorial it starts
219:10 - to bend with the graph
219:12 - then we add x to the fifth over
219:16 - five factorial and it continues to bend
219:18 - with the graph
219:19 - subtract x to the seventh over seven
219:22 - factorial and it gets even better
219:24 - add x to the ninth over nine factorial
219:28 - and it gets even better
219:29 - and if we keep going we're gonna get
219:31 - more and more of
219:32 - the graph building up as it stretches
219:35 - out and out
219:36 - and eventually when you get to an
219:37 - infinite number of terms
219:39 - you've got the entire sine x curve
219:42 - from this power series so what we've
219:46 - done is we've changed the sine of x
219:48 - into a polynomial polynomials are much
219:52 - easier to work with as we get to more
219:54 - complex operations
219:57 - so that's how we can build a mclaren
219:59 - series we find all the derivatives
220:01 - we plug 0 into all the derivatives and
220:04 - we look for patterns
220:05 - in this mclaren series format where
220:08 - we're taking
220:10 - the first term then
220:13 - times x over 1 factorial times x squared
220:16 - over 2 factorial times x cubed over 3
220:19 - factorial
220:20 - all the way up and ultimately we're just
220:22 - trying to find that generic form
220:24 - so that we can change it into a series
220:29 - that's mclaren let's take a look at
220:32 - taylor because taylor's a little bit
220:33 - more versatile
220:35 - we're going to find some taylor
220:37 - polynomials
220:43 - and series a polynomial is finite
220:47 - a certain number of terms a series goes
220:50 - off to infinity
220:51 - and we're going to start simply with f
220:53 - of x equals
220:54 - 1 over x and we're going to find this
220:58 - taylor series at a equals
221:02 - 1. we're going to plug 1 into all the
221:04 - derivatives and then we're going to have
221:05 - x minus 1
221:06 - squared cubed fourth power fifth power
221:10 - and so on so first f of x our function
221:14 - is one over x or let's actually write it
221:18 - as x to the negative one
221:20 - we can convert it so that we can see
221:22 - what it is
221:23 - our first derivative then is negative x
221:27 - to the negative
221:28 - 2 or negative 1 over x squared
221:32 - our second derivative is positive
221:35 - 2 x to the negative 3.
221:38 - so 2 over x cubed
221:43 - and our third derivative
221:48 - notice if we pull the negative 3 out we
221:50 - end up with negative 3
221:52 - times 2 times x to the negative four
221:56 - or negative three times two over x to
221:59 - the fourth
222:01 - and the reason i write it like that is
222:02 - you can sort of start to see a factorial
222:05 - forming
222:06 - in this numerator you can see next time
222:08 - it's going to be
222:09 - 4 times 3 times 2 then 5 times 3 4
222:12 - times 3 times 2. it's going to count
222:14 - down so we're ending up with those
222:16 - factorials in the numerator that's going
222:19 - to be really helpful to us
222:20 - as we come up with a generic form
222:24 - all right we're doing it at one so we're
222:26 - gonna plug one
222:27 - into each of these one divided by one is
222:30 - one
222:32 - the derivative at one is negative one
222:35 - over one which is one
222:38 - the second derivative at one well the
222:41 - denominator is just
222:42 - one so we end up with two
222:45 - the third derivative at one gives us
222:48 - negative three times
222:50 - two and you can kind of see we're
222:53 - building towards
222:55 - the nth derivative at one
222:58 - is going to have an n factorial as we
223:00 - said
223:01 - next time it's gonna be four times three
223:02 - times two times one
223:04 - we just have to worry about the fact
223:06 - that it's an alternating series
223:08 - we want it to start out positive on the
223:10 - zeroth term on the zeroth derivative so
223:13 - we'll just do the n
223:14 - power and in much the same way we can
223:18 - use the taylor formula to start building
223:20 - then
223:21 - that one over x is equal to
223:27 - and let's see if we can jump right to
223:28 - the generic form
223:30 - the sum as n goes from zero to infinity
223:36 - of the derivative pattern notice our
223:39 - derivative pattern was negative 1 to the
223:41 - n
223:41 - times n factorial
223:44 - then we divide by an n factorial
223:49 - times x minus our a which is 1
223:52 - raised to the n power
223:55 - but this one's really interesting
223:56 - because the n factorials actually divide
223:58 - out
223:58 - so what we really have is the sum as n
224:01 - goes from 0
224:02 - to infinity of negative 1 to the n
224:05 - times x minus 1
224:08 - to the n power and we have ended up with
224:10 - a power
224:11 - series that is equal to the function
224:15 - one over x let's try one more
224:22 - finding another taylor series we did
224:24 - cosine last time
224:26 - let's do i'm sorry we did sine last time
224:28 - let's do cosine this time
224:31 - and let's do it at a is equal to pi
224:35 - pi is a nice number to stick into cosine
224:38 - and so in much the same way we're going
224:40 - to run through the derivatives the
224:42 - zeroth derivative
224:43 - is cosine x that's the regular function
224:46 - first derivative is negative sine
224:48 - x second derivative
224:52 - is negative cosine x
224:55 - the third derivative
224:59 - is positive sine x
225:02 - and the fourth derivative we start to
225:04 - see it cycling back to cosine
225:09 - this time because it's a taylor series
225:11 - though we're not plugging 0 in we're
225:12 - plugging
225:13 - pi in well the cosine at pi
225:17 - is negative 1.
225:20 - negative sign at pi the first derivative
225:23 - is zero
225:25 - the second derivative
225:28 - negative cosine well cosine at pi is
225:31 - negative one
225:32 - the opposite of negative one is positive
225:34 - one and then the third derivative at pi
225:37 - is also zero and then you can start to
225:39 - see it the fourth derivative it's going
225:41 - to start to
225:43 - cycle around
225:47 - might be a little trickier to see the
225:48 - pattern of the derivatives
225:50 - off the bat here so we're going to
225:54 - go ahead and build a couple terms and
225:56 - see if that helps us see the pattern
225:58 - the first term is or the zeroth term i
226:01 - should say
226:01 - is negative one so cosine x equals
226:04 - negative one
226:08 - then our first derivative is going to be
226:11 - a zero
226:11 - so that all goes to zero for the second
226:15 - derivative we end up with one
226:18 - times the x minus pi to the second power
226:22 - divided by two factorial
226:26 - then a zero then another negative one
226:29 - x minus pi this is now the fourth
226:32 - derivative
226:33 - fourth power divided by four factorial
226:36 - and you start to see the pattern this
226:38 - time it's the even exponents
226:40 - times x minus pi the next one is going
226:42 - to be to the sixth power
226:44 - over six factorial and so on
226:50 - can we come up with a generic formula
226:55 - well it's an alternating series but this
226:58 - time the first term is negative
227:00 - so we need to stagger negative 1 to the
227:02 - n will make the first term
227:04 - positive negative 1 to the 0 is positive
227:06 - 1.
227:07 - so if we do n plus 1 that'll stagger us
227:10 - by 1.
227:12 - and then all we have left is the x
227:16 - minus pi to the oh what power now
227:22 - this time we end up with the zeroth term
227:24 - the second
227:25 - term the fourth term the sixth term this
227:28 - time we have the even
227:29 - exponents the even terms so to get even
227:33 - numbers we'll do 2 times
227:34 - n and we'll divide by that 2 n factorial
227:39 - as it keeps going so what we end up with
227:44 - is that the cosine of x
227:47 - is really equal to the taylor series as
227:50 - n goes from 0 to infinity
227:53 - of negative 1 to the n plus 1
227:56 - times x minus pi to the 2n over the 2n
228:00 - factorial we should have that 2n in
228:02 - parentheses
228:06 - and this one is centered at pi because
228:09 - we did at pi
228:10 - at a equals pi what does that mean
228:14 - centered at pi as opposed to the mclaren
228:17 - series which was centered
228:18 - at zero well let's go back to the graph
228:21 - to discuss that
228:22 - notice when we started to build the sine
228:24 - of x as a mclaren series it was centered
228:27 - at zero
228:28 - and if i start deleting these terms off
228:30 - you see ultimately
228:33 - where the function started building was
228:35 - from the center
228:37 - of zero but if i do a cosine x
228:43 - i have to move the graph over a bit
228:47 - and now if i start building negative 1
228:50 - plus
228:50 - x minus pi squared
228:54 - over two you start to see where it's
228:57 - building
228:58 - is right at pi if i do x equals pi
229:02 - and put a line here that's the center
229:04 - and now if i go
229:05 - minus x minus pi
229:09 - to the 4th power over 4 factorial
229:13 - that 2 should be factorial as well but
229:14 - that doesn't really make a difference
229:16 - you see it's starting to build that
229:18 - cosine but it starts building from the
229:22 - center
229:24 - of pi
229:28 - and if we keep going we'll get closer
229:29 - and closer to the actual
229:31 - function over eight factorial
229:35 - and we've almost got a full period now
229:38 - and if we keep going off to infinity you
229:40 - can see how
229:41 - we'd end up eventually with the entire
229:43 - graph forming
229:44 - from a center of pi
229:47 - so taylor allows us to start building
229:49 - the graph from any point
229:50 - mclaren always builds the graph from
229:52 - zero
229:53 - but let's take give you a chance to look
229:55 - at the homework assignment
229:56 - try and build some of these taylor and
229:58 - mclaren series
229:59 - get comfortable with what they are and
230:01 - how they work and then we will see you
230:03 - in class to discuss them
230:05 - more
230:08 - after looking at the conic sections what
230:10 - we realize is that we have
230:12 - non-functions that are relationships
230:15 - between
230:15 - x and y that we use quite often
230:19 - it would be nice if there's a better way
230:20 - to to express those relationships
230:24 - that are not functions and so what we're
230:27 - going to take a look at in the next
230:28 - couple sections is some different
230:30 - ways to express relationships
230:33 - between our variables we're answering
230:36 - the question
230:38 - is there a better way
230:46 - to describe
230:51 - relations
230:56 - that are
230:59 - not functions
231:05 - we're used to this whole xy relationship
231:08 - and
231:08 - x determines y and that's what allows us
231:12 - to graph our points and our function
231:14 - to represent all the solutions
231:17 - however there might be another way to
231:19 - represent functions
231:21 - what if instead of just having x
231:23 - dependent on y
231:24 - what if x and y were both defined to be
231:28 - dependent on another variable
231:31 - and this is where we get what are called
231:34 - parametric
231:37 - equations
231:42 - and the idea of a parametric equation is
231:44 - the x value
231:45 - comes from some function x of t and the
231:49 - y
231:49 - value comes from some function y of t
231:53 - where t now is the
231:56 - independent variable
232:02 - and what's really important is that
232:03 - independent variable
232:05 - moves over
232:09 - an interval in other words we're
232:13 - graphing x and y
232:14 - with relationship to time as time passes
232:18 - we have this movement of our x and y
232:20 - values
232:21 - and so the time can quickly determine
232:26 - the graph let's take a look at an
232:28 - example
232:31 - let's say we have a relationship where x
232:34 - of t is equal to three
232:37 - t plus two sometimes you just see x
232:40 - equals
232:41 - and y of t is equal to t
232:45 - squared minus 1 and
232:49 - negative 3 is the lowest value for t
232:52 - and 2 is the highest value for t
232:55 - what if we wanted to graph this
232:58 - parametric equation
233:02 - well what we can do is we can make a
233:03 - value a table of values for our t
233:05 - values going from negative 3 to 2
233:08 - negative 3 negative 2
233:09 - negative 1 0 1 and 2
233:12 - and we can look at what happens to our x
233:15 - and y
233:16 - values so that we can graph what happens
233:18 - at each of these moments in time as the
233:20 - time progresses
233:22 - so when t is negative 3 we plug negative
233:24 - 3
233:25 - into the x equation and so we end up
233:29 - with
233:30 - 3 times negative 3 which is negative 9
233:33 - plus 2 is negative seven
233:38 - then we plug negative three into the y
233:41 - function when we plug negative three
233:44 - into the y
233:45 - function we get negative three squared
233:48 - which is nine
233:49 - minus one is eight
233:52 - then we plug the negative two in three
233:55 - times negative two
233:56 - plus two is negative four
234:00 - negative two squared minus one is three
234:04 - plugging the negative one in three times
234:06 - negative one plus two is negative one
234:10 - negative one squared is one minus one is
234:12 - zero
234:14 - plugging zero in we get two and negative
234:17 - one
234:19 - plugging one in we get five and
234:22 - zero and plugging two in
234:26 - we get eight and three
234:29 - and so what this does is give us the
234:31 - coordinate points that we can graph
234:35 - to see our function popping up some
234:37 - graph paper to help us graph
234:39 - this
234:45 - x starts at negative seven comma eight
234:51 - then it's negative four three
234:56 - then it's negative one zero
235:01 - then it's 2 negative 1
235:05 - then it's 5 0
235:08 - and then it's 8 3
235:13 - and what we end up with is this graph
235:18 - turns out what we have is the forming of
235:20 - a parabola
235:23 - but what's really important to note is
235:25 - that the graph also has
235:27 - direction and that's something that's
235:29 - unique about parametric curves is you
235:31 - end up with direction
235:32 - to your graphs
235:37 - so this is our function x of t is three
235:40 - t
235:41 - plus 2 y of t is t squared minus
235:44 - 1. now sometimes it might be useful
235:49 - to convert our parametric equation
235:53 - and eliminate
235:57 - the parameter
236:04 - so that we can see the relationship
236:06 - between x and y a little more straight
236:07 - forward and really the way we can
236:10 - eliminate the parameter
236:11 - is we can solve one equation
236:18 - for the variable for the parameter t
236:23 - and substitute
236:27 - into the other function
236:31 - so let's take a look at some examples
236:38 - starting with x is equal to 2
236:42 - plus 3 over t
236:46 - and y is equal to t minus 1.
236:52 - what would this look like as a regular
236:54 - function
236:56 - well the y equation is really easy to
236:58 - solve for t by adding 1 to both sides
237:01 - and then we can take that y plus 1 and
237:04 - replace the t
237:05 - with that y plus one
237:10 - when we do we end up with x equals two
237:13 - plus three over the y plus one
237:18 - and then we might wanna solve this for y
237:20 - because we're used to seeing functions
237:21 - solve for y
237:22 - so if we subtract 2
237:26 - from both sides we can multiply both
237:30 - sides by y
237:30 - plus 1 and divide both sides by
237:34 - x minus 2 and subtract 1 from both sides
237:38 - to get y
237:39 - is equal to 3 over x minus 2
237:43 - minus 1. and this would give us the
237:46 - exact same function
237:48 - but with the parameter eliminated
237:55 - let's take a look at a little bit more
237:56 - of an interesting function
237:58 - let's look at the parametric equation x
238:01 - equals
238:02 - 4 plus 2 cosine of t
238:07 - and y equals negative 1 minus 3
238:11 - sine of t
238:14 - this is actually a very familiar graph
238:17 - to us
238:18 - let's see what happens when we work to
238:19 - solve it
238:21 - if it becomes something more familiar
238:25 - we can start by working with the x
238:26 - equation i'm going to subtract 4 from
238:28 - both sides and then divide by 2
238:30 - so we've solved for the cosine of t
238:34 - and the same thing with the y i'm going
238:36 - to solve it for the sine of t
238:38 - by adding 1 and dividing by negative 3.
238:47 - one way we could attack this is to take
238:48 - the cosine inverse and then plug it into
238:51 - the sine that's going to be a lot more
238:53 - work than we need to do though
238:55 - because we know
238:59 - that sine squared of t plus
239:03 - cosine squared of t equals
239:07 - one
239:10 - so let's do that we're going to take the
239:12 - sine of t
239:13 - which is y plus 1 over negative
239:16 - 3 squared plus the cosine of t
239:21 - which is the x minus 4 over 2
239:25 - squared must equal one
239:29 - and if we put that squared on top and
239:31 - bottom we end up with y
239:33 - plus one squared over nine
239:37 - plus x minus four squared
239:40 - over four equals one
239:43 - and we should recognize that function
239:47 - that is an ellipse
239:53 - that is centered
239:57 - at four comma negative one
240:02 - with a vertical
240:06 - major axis
240:11 - equal to the square root of nine is
240:13 - three double that at six
240:15 - and a horizontal
240:20 - minor axis
240:24 - equal to the square root of 4 is 2
240:27 - and double that we get 4.
240:30 - so this is an ellipse centered at 4
240:32 - negative 1 with a vertical major axis of
240:34 - 6 and a horizontal minor
240:36 - axis of 4 that is what the graph looks
240:39 - like
240:40 - but what we've done because this is a
240:42 - parametric equation
240:45 - is x and y depend on t the independent
240:49 - variable
240:50 - now the ellipse is defined as a
240:53 - function of t
240:56 - this is one advantage of parametric
240:58 - equations is we can start working with
241:01 - non-functions and define them in terms
241:03 - of this parametric
241:05 - variable this parameter t
241:09 - today's assignment is designed to have
241:11 - you get familiar with parametric graphs
241:13 - and converting between parametric
241:15 - and rectangular coordinates with the x's
241:18 - and y's
241:19 - take a look at practicing those and then
241:21 - in our next video we'll look at how we
241:23 - can do
241:23 - calculus when we're working with
241:26 - parametric
241:30 - equations
241:32 - now that we've taken a look at
241:34 - parametric curves and how to work with
241:37 - uh parameterized equations we're ready
241:40 - to take that
241:41 - up to the level of calculus and ask
241:43 - ourselves the question
241:46 - how do we do
241:50 - calculus
241:55 - with parametric equations
242:07 - and really calculus is very similar in
242:09 - parametric as it is
242:11 - in rectangular coordinates but there are
242:13 - a few
242:14 - adjustments that we're going to make
242:16 - first we're going to take a look at
242:17 - derivatives
242:22 - with parametric equations and the big
242:24 - thing with derivatives
242:25 - is normally when we find a derivative we
242:27 - call it d y
242:29 - d x well
242:32 - d y and d x are now separate equations
242:35 - so we have to take their derivatives
242:36 - separately so we'll take the derivative
242:39 - of the y
242:40 - equation with respect to t and divide it
242:43 - by the derivative of the x equation
242:46 - with respect to t in other words we're
242:48 - taking
242:49 - y prime of t divided by x
242:52 - prime of t to get d y d
242:55 - t so
243:00 - some examples of doing this
243:05 - would include if x of t is equal to
243:08 - t squared minus 3
243:12 - and y of t equals 2t
243:15 - minus 1.
243:18 - so if we want to find the derivative of
243:20 - this the derivative
243:23 - is d y
243:26 - over d x so first we need to find d
243:30 - y well y prime the derivative of the y
243:33 - function with respect to t
243:34 - we know is 2.
243:39 - over the derivative of x with respect to
243:42 - t
243:42 - well x prime of t is equal to 2t
243:46 - so our denominator is 2t and when we
243:49 - simplify by reducing out the twos we get
243:52 - the derivative d y d
243:53 - x being one over t and this becomes the
243:57 - function of the slope of the tangent
243:59 - line
243:59 - at any point on this parametric curve
244:03 - with respect to t
244:06 - let's do one more example
244:15 - let's try x of t equals
244:18 - 5 cosine squared of t
244:22 - and y of t is equal to 5
244:26 - sine squared of t
244:31 - well again we need the individual
244:33 - derivatives first we need y's derivative
244:36 - which we know is 5
244:39 - times bring the 2 out front sine of t
244:44 - times the derivative of the sine which
244:46 - is the cosine of t using
244:48 - the chain rule there so really that's
244:50 - tan
244:51 - sine cosine
244:57 - and now the derivative of x with respect
244:59 - to t
245:01 - is we have the 5 times
245:04 - bring the 2 out front 2 cosine of t
245:07 - times the derivative of the inside which
245:09 - is negative
245:12 - sine of t
245:15 - and so if we clean that up we get
245:17 - negative 10
245:18 - cosine t sine
245:22 - t and so when we want to find the
245:24 - derivative
245:26 - which is d y dx
245:31 - we simply plug those in the derivative
245:33 - of y was tan
245:34 - sine t cosine t
245:37 - over the derivative of x with respect to
245:40 - t which was negative 10
245:42 - cosine t sine t
245:45 - and this time we get a lot of reducing
245:47 - that happens
245:49 - leaving just the negative in the
245:50 - denominator really we have one over
245:52 - negative one
245:54 - which is just negative one which means
245:57 - the slope of this function
245:59 - is negative one
246:03 - now when we were back in calculus one
246:06 - we didn't just want to find the
246:07 - derivatives because the derivative was
246:09 - the slope of the tangent line but we
246:11 - actually wanted to
246:12 - find that tangent line quite often
246:15 - through a given point so let's see if we
246:17 - can do that
246:18 - as well let's find the tangent
246:22 - line what you remember
246:26 - is y minus y1 equals m times
246:29 - x minus x1
246:32 - where m is equal to the slope dydx
246:38 - at the point x one comma y one
246:45 - so if we have the function x
246:48 - of t is equal to t squared minus four
246:52 - t and y of t
246:56 - equals 2t cubed minus 6t
247:00 - and we want the equation of the tangent
247:02 - line
247:04 - at the point t equals 5.
247:08 - we can build this in much the same way
247:12 - first we're going to find the slope y
247:14 - prime of t
247:15 - is equal to six t squared
247:19 - minus six and
247:22 - x prime at t is equal to two t
247:26 - minus four
247:31 - and then the derivative d y
247:34 - over dx
247:38 - is equal to the y six t
247:41 - squared minus six over the x
247:45 - two t minus four
247:48 - and this represents the slope of the
247:50 - tangent line to any point
247:53 - we're specifically interested in the
247:55 - slope at t
247:56 - equals five so if we plug
248:00 - five into that we have six
248:03 - times five squared minus six
248:07 - over two times five minus four
248:11 - six times 25 minus six is 144
248:18 - over six
248:21 - and dividing we get exactly 24.
248:26 - now we've got the slope of our tangent
248:28 - line
248:29 - we still need to go back and find what
248:33 - point
248:33 - that is actually the slope at so if we
248:36 - go back to our x of t
248:37 - equation
248:41 - and find out what's happening at x of 5
248:43 - we'll have
248:44 - 5 squared minus
248:47 - 5 times 4 or 4 times 5
248:51 - same thing which is 25 minus 20
248:56 - which is 5.
249:00 - and y at that point of 5
249:04 - is 2 times 5 cubed minus 6
249:07 - times 5 which is
249:10 - 125 times 2 is 250 minus 30 is 220
249:17 - so we also have this point then of 5
249:19 - comma
249:20 - 220. now we have a point
249:24 - and we have a slope we're ready to make
249:26 - the equation of our tangent line
249:29 - which is y minus the y coordinate of 220
249:33 - equals the slope of 24 times x
249:36 - minus the x coordinate of 5
249:40 - and we now have the equation of the
249:41 - tangent line
249:44 - through this curve when time is equal to
249:47 - five
249:49 - let's do one more example
249:54 - let's say x of t
249:57 - is equal to the sine of t
250:00 - and y of t
250:03 - is equal to the cosine of t and we want
250:07 - the tangent line
250:09 - at t equals pi over 3.
250:17 - well the derivative of y with respect to
250:20 - time
250:20 - is negative sine of t and the derivative
250:24 - of
250:25 - x with respect to t is cosine of t
250:30 - so our derivative d y
250:33 - d x
250:36 - is equal to the negative sine of t
250:41 - over the cosine of t
250:44 - which we should recognize sine over
250:46 - cosine is tangent so we get the negative
250:49 - tangent of t and we want to know
250:52 - specifically what happens with that
250:54 - slope
250:55 - at t equals pi over three
250:59 - so what we're really working on is
251:02 - negative tangent of pi over three
251:07 - and the tangent of pi over three is the
251:08 - square root of three so we have negative
251:10 - square root of three
251:13 - is the slope of our tangent line at pi
251:16 - over three now we just need our point
251:23 - if we plug pi over 3 into the x equation
251:26 - careful not the derivative in the
251:28 - equation
251:29 - x is equal to sine of t so we have the
251:32 - sine of
251:32 - pi over 3 and the sine of pi over 3 is
251:37 - one-half
251:40 - plugging pi over 3 into the y function
251:44 - y is going to be cosine of pi over
251:47 - three which is root three over two
251:52 - which gives us the point
251:56 - one half comma root three over two
252:01 - to go with our slope of negative root 3
252:04 - and make our tangent line which is y
252:06 - minus one-half
252:08 - the y-coordinate equals the slope
252:11 - negative square root of 3
252:13 - times x minus the x-coordinate square
252:15 - root of three over two
252:19 - and we found the equation of our tangent
252:21 - line
252:25 - so it's kind of a brief overview of
252:27 - doing derivatives
252:28 - with parametric equations we can also do
252:32 - anti-derivatives with parametric
252:34 - equations
252:35 - and they just need a little bit of a
252:36 - tweak to what we've done
252:38 - before so let's take a look at the
252:42 - antiderivatives
252:47 - these would be our integrals
252:52 - and remember with anti-derivatives or
252:54 - integrals the fundamental theorem of
252:55 - calculus told us what we're really
252:57 - finding is the
252:58 - area under
253:01 - a curve and it turns out that if we want
253:04 - to find the area under a curve in
253:05 - parametric equations
253:07 - we still take the integral from a to b
253:12 - but we need to account for the fact that
253:15 - our dx's is split up into
253:18 - an x function and a y function
253:21 - with respect to t so we've got the y
253:24 - function that we're going to integrate
253:26 - with but when we use the chain rule with
253:30 - the dx we end up with an
253:32 - x prime of t dt
253:38 - also it's important to note
253:41 - that a is the left endpoint
253:47 - because sometimes with parametric
253:49 - equations
253:50 - the graph ends up being graphed from
253:52 - right to left in which case we need to
253:55 - switch the order of the integration
253:57 - or just take the opposite of the final
253:58 - integral
254:00 - we'll take a look at what that means
254:01 - when it comes up but for now we'll say
254:03 - if we want the area under the curve
254:05 - we take the anti-derivative from a to b
254:08 - the integral from a to b
254:10 - of the y function times the derivative
254:14 - of the
254:14 - x function dt
254:18 - here's an example of what that looks
254:20 - like
254:25 - if x of t is equal to 2
254:28 - cosine of t plus the cosine of 2t
254:35 - and y of t is equal to 2
254:39 - sine of t minus the sine of 2t
254:46 - we're going to find the area under the
254:48 - curve between
254:51 - 0 and
254:54 - pi
254:59 - well the first thing we need to know if
255:01 - we're going to use this function this
255:03 - operation to find the area under the
255:04 - curve is we need to know the derivative
255:06 - of the x function
255:08 - so first the x derivative
255:11 - the antiderivative of two cosine is
255:13 - negative two
255:14 - sine t and the anti-derivative of cosine
255:18 - of 2t
255:19 - using the chain rule is negative 2 sine
255:23 - of 2t
255:27 - so when we plug that into our integral
255:29 - function the area
255:31 - under the curve from 0 to pi
255:36 - of the y function which is
255:39 - 2 sine t
255:42 - minus the sine of 2t
255:46 - times the derivative of the x function
255:49 - which is negative 2
255:51 - sine t minus 2
255:54 - sine of 2t
255:58 - dt
256:02 - and then all we have to do is evaluate
256:04 - that integral to find the area
256:07 - under that curve
256:10 - this integral is going to take a little
256:11 - bit of work to work out
256:14 - so let's give ourselves a little bit
256:15 - more space to work with
256:19 - and let's see what happens
256:24 - first thing i'd notice is that i've got
256:26 - a gcf of negative 2 inside this
256:28 - last factor i can factor out that
256:31 - negative 2 and pull it all the way out
256:33 - of the integral
256:34 - so let's do that negative 2 times the
256:37 - integral from 0 to pi
256:39 - of 2 sine t minus the sine
256:42 - of 2 t times now it's positive sine
256:47 - t plus the sine of 2t
256:54 - dt
256:56 - and then to keep integrating
257:01 - let's take let's foil this out yeah
257:06 - let's boil this all out so we've got two
257:09 - sine
257:09 - squared of t plus 2
257:13 - sine of t times the sine of 2t
257:17 - minus the sine of t times the sine of
257:21 - 2t minus the
257:24 - sine squared of 2t
257:28 - dt
257:31 - let's go ahead and combine the like
257:33 - terms in the middle
257:35 - so we have negative 2 times the integral
257:37 - from 0 to pi
257:39 - of 2 sine squared of t
257:43 - plus sine of t sine of 2t
257:48 - minus the sine squared of 2t
257:52 - dt
257:57 - a couple things that i notice here
258:00 - we each piece of this integral we need
258:03 - to do some work with using some trig
258:05 - formulas
258:06 - in order to simplify we see the sine
258:09 - squared of t and we remember
258:16 - that the sine squared of t is equal to
258:19 - one half times
258:22 - or minus one half times the cosine of
258:25 - double the angle
258:26 - two t
258:30 - so we're going to replace that sine
258:32 - squared with this property and what's
258:33 - nice when that 2
258:35 - distributes through it's going to clear
258:36 - out those one halves
258:38 - so we end up with negative 2 times the
258:40 - integral from 0 to pi
258:42 - when the 2 distributes through we have 1
258:45 - minus the cosine of 2t
258:49 - plus another thing i notice is we've got
258:53 - a sine of
258:53 - 2t we have a a formula from trig
258:58 - that says the sine of 2t is equal to 2
259:02 - sine of t cosine of t
259:06 - and when we multiply that by the sine
259:08 - we'll end up with
259:09 - 2 sine squared of t
259:13 - times the cosine of t and that's set up
259:15 - now for a nice easy substitution where u
259:17 - is sine and du is cosine
259:22 - minus and again we see the sine squared
259:24 - so we'll use the sine squared formula
259:26 - again to say one half
259:28 - plus because we have to distribute the
259:31 - negative through
259:33 - one half cosine and we double the angle
259:35 - we get four t
259:38 - dt
259:43 - let's go ahead and combine there's not
259:45 - much for like terms but we do have one
259:46 - minus a half
259:49 - so now we have negative two times the
259:50 - integral from zero to pi
259:52 - of one-half minus the cosine of two
259:56 - t plus 2 sine squared
259:59 - t cosine t plus 1 half
260:03 - cosine of 4t dt
260:08 - and after all that algebra we finally
260:11 - have something we can integrate
260:14 - we have negative two times one half of t
260:19 - minus the antiderivative of cosine is
260:21 - sine of two t
260:23 - but we need a one half to
260:26 - take care of the two on the inside plus
260:31 - sine squared comes from a sine cubed
260:35 - but we need to divide by three to take
260:37 - care of that and then
260:38 - using the chain rule gives us the cosine
260:41 - you can check that using substitution
260:44 - plus anti-derivative of cosine
260:48 - is sine of 4t but we need to divide by a
260:52 - 4 which means we have a total of divide
260:54 - by 1
260:54 - 8. and we're integrating this whole
260:58 - thing from
260:58 - 0 to pi
261:03 - what's nice is when we plug pi into sine
261:07 - pi or zero both pi and zero of sine
261:11 - go to zero which means all the terms go
261:15 - away except for the very first one
261:17 - so we end up with negative two times one
261:19 - half of pi
261:22 - minus zero because when we plug in half
261:25 - of zero is zero
261:28 - and then when we multiply this together
261:30 - negative two times pi over two is
261:32 - negative pi
261:35 - but wait why is it negative
261:40 - we made a small error
261:44 - at the beginning and that we didn't take
261:48 - the time to notice if
261:49 - a was a left endpoint or a right
261:51 - endpoint
261:53 - if we start integrating at 0 we're
261:55 - claiming that 0 is the left endpoint
261:59 - let's take a look at this graph really
262:01 - quick
262:03 - what i've done here is i've asked desmos
262:05 - to graph this parametric curve for us as
262:07 - t grows from 0 to some value a and a
262:10 - is going to be a video that's going to
262:12 - scroll from 0 up to pi
262:14 - and i want to notice when this graph is
262:16 - drawn it's going to start here at 3
262:18 - 0 and as a gets bigger
262:21 - it goes off to the left this curve is
262:23 - actually drawn
262:25 - backwards until our time is equal to
262:28 - pi and this then becomes the curve that
262:31 - we're trying
262:32 - to find the area underneath down to the
262:34 - x-axis
262:36 - but because it was drawn from right to
262:38 - left the left-most
262:39 - endpoint was actually pi
262:43 - not zero which means we should have
262:46 - integrated
262:47 - not from 0 to pi
262:51 - but from pi to 0 to make it integrate
262:54 - from left to right
262:55 - that way our dt is positive
262:58 - well we could fix that easily at the end
263:01 - because if we switch the order of
263:02 - integration
263:03 - that would have stuck a negative out
263:05 - front
263:07 - well let's just make that adjustment at
263:09 - the end
263:10 - and say this is drawn backwards
263:18 - which means the area under the curve is
263:21 - actually
263:22 - equal to a positive pi
263:26 - so if it's drawn backwards you'll end up
263:27 - with a negative area
263:29 - and that should be your hint oh this is
263:31 - probably drawn from right to left
263:32 - we need to take the absolute value and
263:35 - say it's equal to the positive value
263:36 - because
263:37 - area can never be negative
263:44 - i want to take a look at one more use of
263:46 - integration of calculus
263:48 - with parametric curves we've talked
263:50 - about the area under a curve but let's
263:52 - actually talk about
263:53 - another interesting thing and that is i
263:56 - think this is number two
263:59 - arc length
264:03 - arc length was generally one of the most
264:05 - difficult formulas to work with
264:07 - in rectangular coordinates and there are
264:09 - some situations where arc length is
264:10 - actually
264:11 - easier to work with in parametric
264:13 - equations we just need a slightly
264:15 - different formula to account for the
264:17 - fact that we have an
264:17 - x and a y function to find the arc
264:21 - length it's going to be the integral
264:24 - from a to b of the square root
264:28 - of and instead of 1 plus the derivative
264:31 - squared
264:32 - it's going to be dx dt
264:36 - squared plus d y dt
264:41 - squared it really comes from the
264:42 - pythagorean theorem the change in the x
264:44 - plus the change in the y squared dt
264:49 - one thing we need to be careful of as we
264:51 - use this formula
264:54 - and it's a property from precalculus
264:56 - that we don't spend a lot of time on but
264:58 - it does become important here
264:59 - is when we take the square root of
265:01 - something that's been squared
265:03 - it's not actually equal to that
265:05 - something it's actually equal to the
265:07 - absolute value of that something
265:09 - and so sometimes if you get a weird
265:10 - answer we might need to go back and say
265:12 - let's take the absolute value of what
265:14 - was under the square root
265:15 - instead of what was what we ended up
265:17 - with
265:18 - it doesn't become an issue often but
265:20 - when it when you get a weird answer like
265:21 - an arc length of zero
265:23 - something like that that's probably what
265:25 - happened
265:27 - all right let's try an example
265:33 - let's say x of t
265:38 - is equal to 3t squared
265:42 - and y of t is equal to 2t cubed
265:47 - and we're going to find the arc length
265:50 - as
265:50 - t runs from 1 2
265:53 - 3.
265:57 - well to use the formula we need to take
265:59 - both derivatives and square them
266:02 - so let's take the derivative of x which
266:04 - is 6 t
266:06 - and when we square the derivative of x
266:11 - we get 36 t squared
266:16 - with the y's the derivative of y is 6
266:19 - t squared and when we take that
266:21 - derivative
266:22 - and square it we'll get 36 t
266:25 - to the fourth
266:29 - so using our formula we're going to take
266:30 - the integral as t runs from 1 to 3
266:35 - of the square root of the x derivative
266:39 - squared
266:39 - which was 36 t squared
266:42 - plus the y's derivative squared which is
266:44 - 36 t
266:45 - to the fourth dt
266:49 - and if we can integrate
266:52 - this guy we'll end up with our arc
266:56 - length from one to three
266:59 - let's do a little simplifying with this
267:02 - we've got a common factor of 36
267:04 - t squared that can come out that's going
267:06 - to leave behind
267:08 - one plus t squared dt
267:13 - and we can take the square root of 36 t
267:17 - squared it's 6t times the square root of
267:20 - 1 plus t
267:21 - squared dt
267:24 - and we're set up then for a nice
267:26 - substitution where u
267:27 - is equal to one plus t squared d
267:30 - u is equal to two t dt
267:35 - well to get that six to be a two we're
267:37 - going to divide it by three
267:39 - so we'll divide by three inside and
267:41 - multiply by three outside
267:44 - so we end up with three times the
267:45 - integral
267:47 - make sure we plug our limits of
267:48 - integration into the u
267:50 - one plus one squared is two one plus
267:54 - three squared is
267:55 - ten and we're left with just the square
267:58 - root of
267:58 - u or u to the one half d u
268:04 - which is equal to three times u to the
268:07 - three halves
268:08 - times the reciprocal which is two thirds
268:12 - integrated from two to ten
268:16 - the threes divide out and so we're just
268:18 - left with two
268:19 - times u which will start by plugging in
268:22 - 10 to the three halves
268:25 - minus plug the two in two to the three
268:28 - halves
268:29 - and that's not going to be any pretty
268:31 - numbers so let's just leave our arc
268:32 - length
268:33 - as that value 2 times 10 to the 3 halves
268:37 - minus 2 to the 3 halves
268:40 - and that's how we can find arc length in
268:43 - parametric curves
268:46 - so we've taken a look at both
268:47 - derivatives and anti-derivatives
268:49 - specifically in the context of tangent
268:51 - lines and arc lengths and
268:53 - area under curves take a look at the
268:55 - homework assignment to practice a few
268:57 - of these and we will talk about them
268:59 - more in class
269:01 - see you then
269:04 - now that we've taken a look at
269:05 - parametric equation there's an alternate
269:07 - way to graph x and y
269:09 - coordinates using two different
269:10 - functions we're going to look at another
269:12 - option for graphing in a completely
269:15 - different graphing system the question
269:17 - is going to be
269:19 - what other
269:24 - graphing
269:27 - systems
269:31 - can we use
269:36 - normally when we've graphed a point up
269:38 - to now we've said we're going to graph a
269:39 - point really with an x y coordinate
269:41 - where x is how far we go to the right
269:44 - and y is how far we go up however we
269:47 - could graph
269:48 - using a different version of reference
269:50 - points
269:51 - and this leads to what are called polar
269:58 - coordinates
270:01 - the idea behind polar coordinates is
270:03 - we've got the coordinate system
270:07 - and instead of giving an x y coordinate
270:09 - what we're going to do is we're going to
270:10 - have
270:11 - some distance which we will call r
270:15 - that is going to be some angle theta
270:18 - away from the polar axis or the what we
270:21 - traditionally have called the
270:23 - x axis to get to our point
270:27 - so a point is now made up of an ordered
270:30 - pair
270:31 - of r comma theta
270:35 - where r represents the radius or
270:38 - distance from the center and theta
270:42 - represents the angle that we open
270:45 - up to now what's interesting about polar
270:49 - coordinates then
270:51 - is unlike the x y coordinate system
270:53 - where there's only one way to get the to
270:55 - the point four comma
270:56 - seven with polar coordinates there are
270:58 - multiple ways to get to the same point
271:00 - they are not
271:02 - unique coordinates to represent the same
271:06 - point
271:07 - let's say we want to look at a point
271:10 - over here and if i were to draw it out
271:14 - let's say that
271:15 - radius has a distance of 2 and the angle
271:19 - is a distance of pi over 4 a 45 degree
271:22 - angle
271:24 - if that's the case then our radius is 2
271:26 - and our angle is pi
271:27 - over 4 and that's going to represent
271:30 - that point
271:31 - but that's not the only way to get to
271:33 - that point i could have taken my angle
271:35 - and gone around a full circle and a
271:37 - little bit
271:38 - more 2 pi plus another pi over 4 would
271:41 - be 9 pi
271:42 - over 4. and so we end up with the same
271:44 - radius of 2
271:46 - but an angle of 9 pi over 4
271:50 - representing the exact same point
271:54 - in fact there's a third way to represent
271:56 - to that exact same point
271:58 - and that is to take an angle that goes
272:01 - around
272:02 - to the distance exactly opposite it
272:07 - that angle would be 5 pi over 4
272:10 - but then our radius is going to come out
272:13 - the other direction
272:15 - and to show the radius coming the other
272:16 - direction we'll say the radius is
272:19 - negative and so we end up with this
272:20 - point
272:21 - negative 2 comma 5 pi over 4
272:27 - and we've got three ways to represent
272:28 - the exact same point
272:31 - in fact there are infinite number of
272:32 - ways that we could represent this exact
272:34 - same point
272:35 - including negative angles and angles
272:37 - that are several times around the entire
272:39 - unit circle
272:41 - so polar coordinates are not unique but
272:43 - they do provide a way to do a lot of
272:45 - graphs in a much more convenient
272:47 - way but before we do that let's take a
272:50 - look
272:50 - at how we can do conversions
272:57 - between polar and rectangular
272:59 - coordinates
273:00 - and to set these conversions up let's
273:03 - take a look at a point
273:09 - that is drawn by some radius r
273:13 - and some angle theta and if we were to
273:17 - drop a triangle on that
273:19 - we end up with an x distance to the
273:21 - right and a y
273:22 - distance up well we know
273:26 - that the cosine of theta the cosine of
273:29 - the angle
273:30 - is the adjacent x over r
273:33 - and multiplying by r tells us that the x
273:36 - coordinate is equal to
273:37 - r cosine theta
273:42 - similarly if we took the sine of the
273:44 - angle it would be the opposite over
273:46 - r or y over r
273:49 - and multiplying both sides by r we get r
273:52 - sine theta is equal to the y coordinate
273:59 - we also have ways to convert the other
274:01 - direction
274:02 - we know from the pythagorean theorem on
274:05 - this exact triangle
274:06 - that x squared plus y squared is equal
274:09 - to
274:09 - r squared and so if we know x and y we
274:13 - should be able to calculate
274:14 - r also if we know x and y
274:18 - we can use the tangent of theta
274:22 - to equal the opposite over the adjacent
274:24 - or y over
274:25 - x and so tangent of theta is equal to
274:29 - the ratio
274:30 - of our coordinates
274:33 - let's see if we can use these conversion
274:35 - properties
274:36 - to help us convert maybe the point 3
274:39 - comma
274:40 - negative 4 to polar coordinates
274:49 - well we've got the x and y so we know
274:51 - that
274:52 - r squared is equal to x squared plus
274:55 - y squared so r squared is equal to 3
274:59 - squared which is 9
275:02 - plus 4 squared which is 16.
275:05 - so r squared is 25 and our radius
275:09 - must be 5.
275:14 - we also know that the tangent of the
275:17 - angle
275:18 - is equal to the ratio of y over x
275:20 - negative 4
275:21 - over 3. and if we take the tangent
275:25 - inverse of both sides it's not a pretty
275:27 - number but we get negative 0.9273
275:31 - approximately and so we end up with the
275:34 - polar coordinate of
275:36 - 5 comma negative 0.9273
275:44 - for our polar coordinate that's equal to
275:47 - 3
275:48 - comma negative 4.
275:52 - let's go the other direction
275:56 - let's convert
275:59 - the polar coordinate four comma two pi
276:02 - over 3
276:05 - to a rectangular point
276:12 - well to do that we know x is equal to
276:15 - r cosine theta
276:20 - and we know that y is equal to r
276:23 - sine theta from our formulas up above
276:29 - so now we just have to plug in what we
276:30 - know that x is equal to the radius of
276:33 - four
276:34 - times the cosine of two pi over three
276:37 - or x is equal to four times cosine of
276:41 - two pi over three is negative one half
276:44 - so the x coordinate is negative two
276:50 - for the y coordinate y is equal to the
276:52 - radius of four
276:53 - times the sine of two pi over three
276:57 - so y is equal to four times the sine of
277:00 - two pi over three is root three over two
277:04 - which reduces down to two root two
277:08 - and we end up with the rectangular
277:10 - coordinate of negative two
277:12 - comma 2 root 2 being the exact same
277:16 - as the polar point 4 comma
277:19 - 2 pi over 3.
277:24 - now that we've taken a look at how we
277:25 - can convert between rectangular and
277:26 - polar coordinates
277:28 - we're ready for our next task which is
277:30 - to see if we can actually
277:32 - plot points
277:35 - and we're going to plot two points on
277:38 - this
277:39 - graph we're going to plot the point 4
277:40 - comma 5 pi
277:42 - over 3 and we're going to plot the point
277:46 - negative 3 comma negative
277:51 - 3 pi over 2.
277:54 - now when we're graphing in polar
277:56 - coordinates we can convert them to
277:57 - rectangular coordinates and figure out
277:59 - where they should be
278:00 - or we can just graph them using our
278:02 - angles in what's called a polar grid
278:05 - this here is our polar grid and each
278:07 - circle represents a radius of one
278:09 - so we can kind of count out just like we
278:11 - count on our x-axis of one
278:13 - two three four five and so on
278:19 - and we can see the growing radii coming
278:21 - out of the center
278:23 - here on this polar grid every pi over
278:25 - six has been labeled so we've got zero
278:28 - pi over six two pi over six
278:31 - which is pi over three then we end up
278:34 - with
278:34 - pi over two then two pi over 3
278:38 - and 5 pi over 6 and then pi
278:41 - and then 7 pi over 6
278:44 - and then 4 pi over 3 and then 2
278:47 - pi or 3 pi over 2
278:51 - and then 5 pi over 3 and
278:54 - 11 pi over six and then we're back
278:57 - around to two pi
278:58 - and so you can see you're working
278:59 - yourself around this one does not label
279:02 - the pi
279:03 - over fours but those would be just kind
279:05 - of in the middle so if you wanted to
279:07 - you needed a pi over four you could
279:08 - stick it right up in the middle
279:10 - and you could label the pi over fours in
279:12 - this graph as well
279:14 - just kind of like a unit circle but with
279:16 - a different
279:17 - radius established for each coordinate
279:20 - point
279:22 - so when we want to plot point a as four
279:24 - comma five pi over three
279:26 - i'll go over to an angle of five pi over
279:29 - three and i'll count out
279:30 - four radii one two three 4
279:34 - and that fourth radius out from 5
279:37 - pi over 3 is point a
279:40 - similarly with negative 3 negative 3 pi
279:43 - over 2
279:44 - negative angles count backwards so we're
279:46 - going to go the opposite direction i'll
279:48 - do this one in green because we did the
279:50 - first one in blue
279:51 - going the opposite direction we've got
279:54 - negative 3 pi over 2
279:56 - if you count 1 2 3 negative 3 pi over 2
280:00 - is up here at the top
280:04 - but instead of coming vertically up
280:06 - towards negative 3 pi over 2
280:09 - because the radius is negative we're
280:11 - going to count backwards
280:13 - to 3 points and that gives us a negative
280:15 - 3 radius because we're going
280:17 - backwards away from the negative 3 pi
280:19 - over 2
280:20 - and there becomes point b
280:26 - so if that's how we plot points then
280:27 - we're one step away from being able to
280:30 - actually
280:31 - graph polar equations
280:34 - let's take a look at that
280:38 - let's take a look at polar graphs
280:45 - the first polar graph we're going to
280:46 - look at is r
280:48 - equals 4 plus 4 cosine of
280:51 - theta and to set this up we're going to
280:54 - take a bit of time with this so we can
280:55 - get
280:56 - good comfort with how these polar graphs
280:57 - work we're going to look at all the
280:59 - common angles theta
281:01 - and see what radius they give us and see
281:04 - if we can graph
281:05 - what shape this is going to give us our
281:08 - common angles that we're going to look
281:09 - at is we're going to count every pi
281:11 - over six it does skip the pi over fours
281:13 - and we could include the pi over fours
281:15 - if we wanted to
281:17 - but uh for the sake of time i'm just
281:18 - going to do zero one pi
281:20 - over six pi over three
281:24 - pi over 2 2 pi over 3
281:28 - 5 pi over 6 pi
281:34 - 7 pi over 6 4 pi over 3
281:39 - three pi over two
281:43 - five pi over three
281:47 - and eleven pi over six
281:56 - and then 2 pi would be coming back
281:58 - around to the same point
282:00 - so i'm going to use my calculator to
282:03 - take a look at these so let's pull up
282:05 - our calculator
282:06 - on your calculator in order to graph
282:08 - polar equations we need to change the
282:10 - mode that we're in if we click
282:12 - mode down a couple spots you see
282:15 - function is highlighted
282:17 - next to function is par that's for
282:19 - parametric equations if you want to use
282:20 - your calculator for those
282:22 - and the next is the polar equations
282:24 - let's go down
282:25 - to polar equations and hit enter to
282:28 - highlight polar equations
282:30 - and now when i hit the y equals instead
282:32 - of saying y equals it's actually going
282:33 - to say r equals and we want
282:36 - r to equal 4 plus 4
282:39 - cosine of theta and now when we hit the
282:42 - x button the x t
282:43 - theta n we're going to end up with a
282:45 - theta for our variable
282:49 - and then i'm going to hit second table
282:53 - and i'm going to delete all of these
282:54 - values out that i don't want
282:58 - and now i can start entering in my
283:00 - values i enter in 0 and i see that the
283:02 - radius should be 8.
283:04 - if i enter in pi over 6 we see the
283:07 - radius should be 7.5
283:10 - approximately and then i can enter in pi
283:13 - over 3 and i see the radius should be
283:16 - approximately
283:18 - six and so i can go down and finish
283:21 - filling in to figure out what values i
283:23 - want to fill into my table
283:25 - so when the rate when the angle is zero
283:27 - the radius ends up being
283:28 - eight pi over six is approximately 7.5
283:33 - pi over 3 is approximately 6 pi
283:36 - over 2 is 4 2 pi over 3
283:39 - comes out to 2 5 pi over 6
283:42 - comes out to 0.5 pi is zero
283:47 - seven pi over six is point five four
283:50 - pi over three is two
283:53 - three pi over two is four you start to
283:56 - see it's kind of looking symmetrical
283:58 - five pi over 3 is 6 and 11 pi over 6
284:02 - is 7.5 and you can see it's going to go
284:05 - to 8 next
284:07 - so let's see what this graph looks like
284:10 - when the angle is 0
284:14 - the radius is eight so i'll count out
284:16 - one two three four
284:17 - five six seven eight on a zero radius
284:21 - then at pi over six that's the first
284:23 - line it's 7.5
284:26 - pi over three it's six
284:31 - pi over two is four
284:35 - two pi over three is two
284:39 - five pi over six is one half
284:43 - and then at pi it actually comes down
284:45 - and hits zero
284:49 - and then one half
284:52 - and two
284:56 - and 4
285:00 - and then 5 pi over 3 it goes out to
285:03 - 6 and 11 pi
285:07 - over 3 it comes out to 7.5
285:11 - and then you can see it's gonna go back
285:13 - around to
285:15 - eight and so what we end up with is this
285:18 - interesting little curve
285:21 - that comes in it almost looks like a
285:23 - squished heart
285:28 - actually i'm going to make that line a
285:29 - little bit thicker so we can get a real
285:31 - good
285:31 - c on what what that graph
285:37 - looks like here it curves in and then
285:40 - balances
285:41 - out and that's our polar
285:45 - graph
285:50 - that is the function r equals 4
285:54 - plus 4 cosine of theta and
285:57 - actually we can end up with some pretty
285:59 - gnarly looking graphs
286:01 - in polar coordinates to save us some
286:04 - time we're going to cheat and we're
286:05 - going to look at some graphs on
286:07 - desmos and kind of graph what these
286:09 - things
286:10 - look like first we're going to graph
286:14 - theta equals pi over 3.
286:18 - actually this pi over 3 option let's see
286:20 - if we can kind of talk through what it's
286:21 - going to do
286:23 - pi over 3 means the angle is going to
286:24 - stay consistent at pi over 3 regardless
286:27 - of what the radius is equal to
286:30 - theta equals pi over 3 is just a line
286:33 - so let's see if we can find something a
286:34 - little more interesting than that
286:36 - let's do r equals 2 cosine
286:40 - theta minus 3
286:43 - sine of theta when we graph that r
286:46 - equals 2 cosine theta
286:50 - minus 3 sine theta
286:56 - what we end up with is a kind of
286:57 - off-centered
286:59 - circle this is the equation of a circle
287:05 - kind of was off-centered but it was a
287:07 - circle nonetheless
287:10 - let's take a look at another equation
287:12 - this one's kind of gnarly
287:14 - let's take a look at r equals
287:17 - theta over three
287:22 - r equals theta over three
287:26 - gives you a gnarly spiral and as you
287:28 - scroll out
287:29 - you see this only goes up to 12 pi
287:36 - yeah the spiral only stops here because
287:40 - theta has been programmed to only go to
287:41 - 12
287:42 - pi but if theta keeps going the spiral
287:45 - is going to keep going
287:46 - out and out and out so theta equals pi
287:49 - over 3 is actually equal to a graph of a
287:52 - spiral which is kind of cool
287:57 - how about this one r equals 3
288:00 - plus 3 cosine of theta
288:08 - r equals 3 plus 3 cosine
288:11 - theta that's kind of similar to the one
288:15 - that we saw earlier it
288:16 - looks like a squished heart
288:27 - something like that
288:31 - how about this graph r
288:34 - equals 2 plus 4
288:37 - sine of theta
288:44 - this one's interesting
288:49 - because it ends up with a little
288:50 - squiggly in the center
288:52 - a little tiny circle on the inside
288:58 - so that one's kind of neat in that it
289:00 - comes around and then it loops around
289:03 - before it finishes in the center
289:08 - kind of the classic polar graph is
289:10 - what's called the rows
289:12 - r equals 3 sine of 2
289:16 - theta let's take a look at this graph
289:30 - this one gives us a nice little rose
289:32 - with four petals on it
289:40 - we can actually play with the number of
289:41 - petals by changing what's in front of
289:43 - theta
289:44 - turns out if the number's even you end
289:46 - up with twice as many petals so if i do
289:48 - six
289:48 - theta i've got a 12 petal rose but if
289:51 - it's odd we end up with exactly that
289:53 - many petals so if i do 5
289:55 - theta we get a 5 petal rose
289:58 - so you can play with that and get some
290:00 - gnarly looking graphs
290:05 - in polar coordinates
290:14 - now it might be useful though to change
290:16 - a polar graph into a more familiar
290:18 - rectangular coordinates and that takes a
290:21 - little bit of creative spark
290:23 - so let's take a look at how we can do
290:25 - one last thing
290:26 - and that is letter c to transform
290:33 - polar
290:36 - to rectangular
290:41 - functions
290:44 - let's start by doing theta
290:47 - is equal to pi over 3.
290:54 - well we know this is probably going to
290:57 - be a line based on our little experiment
290:59 - with functions up above in desmos
291:01 - where we said if that angle is going to
291:03 - stay constant and the radius is going to
291:04 - change you're just going to end up with
291:05 - a straight line
291:07 - but to find out what that line is what
291:08 - we know about theta is that the
291:10 - tangent of theta is equal to y over
291:13 - x by definition so we can take the
291:17 - tangent of the angle
291:18 - pi over 3 and that must be equal to y
291:22 - over x
291:23 - and the tangent of pi over 3 is the
291:26 - square root of 3
291:28 - equal to y over x and so if we multiply
291:32 - both sides by
291:33 - x we end up with x square root of 3
291:35 - equals y
291:37 - and that's a line through the origin
291:42 - with a slope of the square root of three
291:47 - that one's not too exciting let's try
291:48 - another one
291:51 - let's do r equals three
291:57 - well if the radius is going to stay
291:58 - consistent and the angle is going to
292:00 - change you might expect this to be a
292:02 - circle because we keep the same radius
292:04 - and go all the way around the unit
292:05 - circle
292:07 - we also know we've got a property that x
292:09 - squared plus y
292:10 - squared equals r squared so plugging in
292:14 - what we know
292:14 - x squared plus y squared equals three
292:17 - squared or nine
292:19 - and that really doesn't need any
292:20 - simplifying we recognize that from our
292:23 - conic sections as a circle
292:26 - with radius of 3.
292:31 - so let's try a more interesting graph
292:33 - than just r equals or theta equals
292:36 - let's try r equals 6 cosine
292:40 - theta minus 8 sine of theta
292:47 - now this one we're going to have to be a
292:48 - little more creative with
292:51 - a nice little trick that can help us
292:53 - quite often is we're going to multiply
292:55 - both sides by r
292:59 - and when i do that we end up with r
293:00 - squared equals
293:02 - and when i distribute the r r
293:06 - cosine theta minus eight r
293:09 - sine of theta
293:13 - and the reason that's nice is we know
293:15 - that r cosine
293:16 - theta is equal to x
293:21 - and we know that r sine of theta
293:24 - is equal to y and we know that
293:28 - r squared is equal to x squared plus y
293:32 - squared and so if we put that all
293:35 - together we get x squared plus
293:36 - y squared equals 6x minus 8y
293:43 - now it might not be clear what shape
293:45 - this is exactly so let's move all the x
293:47 - and y's to the same side so we have x
293:49 - squared minus six
293:50 - x plus y squared plus eight y equals
293:53 - zero
293:56 - and then if i try and complete the
293:58 - square on the x's
293:59 - by adding nine half of 6 squared
294:03 - and adding 16 half of 8
294:07 - squared to both sides
294:11 - the x's are a perfect square x minus 3
294:14 - squared
294:16 - plus the y's are a perfect square
294:20 - y plus 4 squared
294:23 - equals 0 plus 9 plus 16
294:27 - is 25.
294:30 - you recognize this as a conic section as
294:32 - well it is a circle
294:35 - centered at 3
294:38 - negative 4 with a radius
294:43 - of five
294:51 - let's do one last function
294:58 - let's consider r equals secant theta
295:02 - tangent theta
295:08 - well we don't really have any formulas
295:09 - with secant and tangent
295:12 - but we do know that secant is one over
295:16 - the cosine
295:18 - and tangent is sine over cosine
295:24 - and if i multiply both sides of this
295:26 - equation by the cosine squared of theta
295:29 - to clear out the denominators
295:30 - we get r cosine theta squared
295:34 - equals the sine of theta
295:39 - and where this gets interesting is if we
295:40 - multiply both sides by
295:42 - r that's kind of our favorite trick of
295:44 - polar coordinates to multiply both sides
295:46 - by r
295:47 - we get r squared cosine theta
295:50 - equals r sine theta
295:55 - and we should recognize that r sine
295:57 - theta is just y
296:01 - and r cosine theta is x and if it's all
296:04 - squared
296:05 - that must be x squared so we really have
296:08 - is
296:09 - x squared equals y
296:12 - is the same function as r equals secant
296:15 - theta
296:16 - times tangent theta this is a parabola
296:26 - so this video was a quick introduction
296:28 - to this new coordinate system of polar
296:31 - coordinates where we can graph
296:32 - things using a radius and an angle
296:36 - theta
296:39 - take a look at the homework assignment
296:41 - to practice some of these and good luck
296:43 - to you
296:44 - let me know if you have any questions
296:45 - and we will see you in
296:48 - class now that we've taken a look at
296:51 - using polar coordinates we're ready to
296:53 - do some calculus with polar coordinates
296:56 - as we answer the question how
296:59 - do we find
297:03 - areas
297:06 - in polar
297:10 - coordinates or polar curves would be
297:12 - more accurate
297:18 - before we actually get to working with
297:20 - area in polar coordinates i want to go
297:22 - over some tips on how we can use
297:25 - the ti 83 or 84 calculator
297:32 - to help us with finding the correct
297:34 - areas in the polar curves because it's
297:36 - really easy to find the incorrect
297:38 - area the wrong part of the graph so the
297:41 - first thing that we want to do
297:42 - is we need to make sure that the mode
297:46 - is set to polar so you'll hit the mode
297:48 - button and make sure
297:49 - polar is selected
297:52 - and what's nice about that as we found
297:54 - out in our previous video
297:56 - is now when you hit the y equals button
297:59 - it will give us
298:03 - r equals equations
298:12 - when we're going to graph these though a
298:15 - little tip
298:15 - is when you graph a polar graph i would
298:18 - not recommend
298:21 - that you do not hit
298:24 - the graph button it's a button
298:34 - for the first drawing
298:43 - because some of these polar graphs are
298:44 - too large or too small you're not going
298:46 - to see
298:47 - much in hitting just the graph button
298:50 - so we're going to say rather
298:53 - we're going to hit the zoom button
298:58 - and select
299:01 - zoom fit and what zoom fit will do
299:05 - is it will center the graph as large as
299:08 - possible
299:09 - on the screen so we'll use zoom fit
299:12 - to get a good view
299:18 - now sometimes it skews this graph when
299:21 - we do this maybe the x's will count by
299:23 - twos and the y's will count by
299:24 - sevens and so we end up with a
299:26 - significant skew but it does provide us
299:28 - a really good view
299:30 - of what the graph looks like
299:33 - something else to be aware of is the
299:35 - window button
299:39 - because the window button not only gives
299:41 - you a chance to set the minimum and
299:43 - maximum values for x and y
299:45 - the window buttons will also allow
299:50 - you to select
299:55 - a range
299:59 - for theta for the angles
300:03 - and then if you adjust that
300:07 - to reset it
300:11 - we will use 0 to 2 pi
300:14 - that's kind of the default so whenever
300:17 - we change it we need to remember to
300:19 - change it back to
300:20 - 0 to 2 pi otherwise some weird things
300:23 - might happen so let's take a look to see
300:25 - if we can
300:26 - correctly use the calculator
300:30 - to graph
300:34 - one petal
300:38 - of r equals three
300:42 - sine of two theta
300:46 - three sine 2 theta is your typical rows
300:49 - we're going to graph it
300:50 - first so i'll pull up my calculator here
300:55 - first we'll go to mode to check to see
300:57 - if it is
300:58 - in polar coordinates which it's not
301:01 - right now
301:02 - so i'm going to scroll over and select
301:03 - polar coordinates
301:06 - second quick to go back home now when i
301:09 - hit the y equals button i have
301:10 - r equals equations let's delete out the
301:13 - old equation
301:14 - and we want to graph 3 sine of 2 theta
301:18 - 3 sine of 2 theta
301:22 - and when we close the parentheses
301:25 - that will give us the graph but instead
301:27 - of just hitting graph because i'm
301:28 - probably going to get a bad view
301:30 - of it this first time i draw it i'm
301:32 - going to click the zoom button
301:34 - and i will scroll down to find zoom
301:38 - fit it's number zero on my calculator
301:42 - depending on the version of your
301:43 - calculator you
301:44 - it might be a different number so if you
301:46 - hit zoom
301:47 - and then that number it'll automatically
301:49 - zoom you don't have to scroll so it
301:51 - might be worth memorizing what number it
301:52 - is on your calculator
301:54 - so i can hit enter
301:57 - and it'll quickly graph its four petaled
302:00 - rows
302:01 - our task is to try and graph only one
302:04 - petal let's try and graph this
302:06 - first petal what i notice is
302:09 - it starts and ends at the origin
302:13 - at that point regardless of the angle
302:16 - the radius
302:17 - i know is zero that's what pulls it in
302:20 - towards the center
302:21 - so we need to figure out what angles
302:24 - give us a radius of zero
302:27 - so we can just graph one petal
302:31 - well to do that we'll go back to our
302:32 - equation and we'll set that radius to
302:35 - zero
302:37 - equals three sine of 2
302:40 - theta
302:43 - and solving this for theta will tell me
302:45 - what angles
302:46 - give me that center point dividing by 3
302:50 - gives me 0 equals the sine of 2 theta
302:54 - and i know from my unit circle that the
302:56 - sine is equal to 0
302:58 - at the left and right points so
303:01 - 2 theta is equal to maybe 0
303:05 - 1 pi 2 pi 3 pi
303:09 - and so on and so forth
303:12 - dividing everything by 2 then my theta
303:16 - my angles are equal to 0 pi
303:19 - over 2 pi
303:22 - 3 pi over 2 and so on and so forth
303:27 - we just want one petal so let's just
303:31 - connect from
303:32 - 0 to pi over 2. we're going to take
303:35 - theta
303:36 - and stick it in between those two values
303:40 - and hopefully that will give us
303:43 - exactly one petal
303:47 - of the rose when i hit window
303:50 - i see the x min and or the theta min and
303:53 - the theta max
303:54 - these are our range for our theta so
303:56 - we're going to go from 0
303:58 - enter to pi over 2
304:01 - and if i type in pi and divide by
304:04 - 2 and hit enter it's going to give me a
304:07 - decimal approximation for that
304:10 - and now i can hit graph because it's
304:12 - already been graphed for me
304:14 - and what i notice is that does give me
304:16 - exactly one
304:18 - petal of my rose
304:21 - like we were hoping for so all that to
304:24 - give you kind of an orientation to how
304:26 - to get what we want
304:27 - on the calculator let's see now if we
304:30 - can use that to help us
304:32 - actually do what we wanted to do
304:35 - which was to find areas
304:40 - to find an area in polar coordinates is
304:43 - similar to rectangular coordinates in
304:45 - that we're going to take an
304:46 - integral from a to b
304:50 - but a slight difference is we're going
304:52 - to take half the integral from
304:54 - a to b of the radius
304:57 - squared d theta
305:02 - that is going to be the big formula for
305:05 - today
305:06 - half the integral from a to b of
305:09 - r squared d theta
305:13 - so going back to the example we were
305:15 - just looking at
305:16 - let's see if we can find the area
305:21 - of one petal
305:27 - of r equals 3
305:30 - sine of 2 theta
305:37 - well to do that we'll take one half
305:39 - times the integral
305:41 - and we need to usually do some work to
305:43 - find our a to b
305:45 - however we just found out in our
305:48 - previous example that that theta is
305:50 - going to go from 0
305:51 - to pi over 2 to give us one petal
305:56 - of the radius squared so 3 squared is 9
306:01 - sine squared of 2 theta
306:05 - d theta this integral then
306:08 - should give us the entire area
306:13 - of one petal i'm going to pull that 9
306:16 - out because it's a constant gives us 9
306:18 - halves times the integral from 0 to pi
306:20 - over 2.
306:22 - then we're integrating sine squared and
306:24 - we know we can't really integrate sine
306:26 - squared but we have a nice property that
306:28 - says that's one half
306:29 - minus one half of the cosine
306:32 - of double the angle four theta
306:36 - d theta and now i can integrate that to
306:41 - get nine halves
306:42 - times half of a theta
306:46 - minus the antiderivative of cosine is
306:49 - sine
306:51 - but we have to divide by that 4 so we
306:53 - actually end up with
306:54 - 1 8 sine of 4 theta
306:58 - and that's going to be integrated from 0
307:00 - to pi over 2.
307:04 - so we have 9 halves times
307:08 - one half of theta which is pi over two
307:14 - minus one eighth of the sine
307:18 - of four times theta four times
307:21 - pi over two is two pi
307:28 - minus one half times zero
307:31 - plus one eighth
307:34 - times the sine of 4 times 0
307:37 - which is 0.
307:41 - and when we simplify all that we get 9
307:44 - halves
307:46 - times pi over four
307:50 - and all the rest of the pieces actually
307:52 - go to zero
307:54 - so for our final area of one petal we
307:57 - get nine pi
308:01 - over eight
308:05 - so that's how we can find area with
308:08 - these polar
308:09 - coordinates let's do one more example to
308:11 - make sure we've got it
308:17 - let's find the area
308:21 - inside r
308:24 - equals 1 minus the cosine of theta
308:30 - well first you get an idea of what's
308:32 - going on we'll go back to our calculator
308:35 - we'll clear out the old function we're
308:38 - doing 1
308:39 - minus the cosine of theta
308:44 - under window remember we've got to reset
308:46 - our min and max
308:48 - otherwise weird things happen we want to
308:49 - go from 0 to 2 pi
308:51 - as a default
308:56 - and then we'll zoom on my calculator
308:58 - hitting zero will give me a zoom fit
309:01 - your calculator might have a different
309:02 - number
309:04 - and this is kind of the shape we're
309:06 - trying to find the
309:07 - area inside of
309:12 - well what we see is it seems to start
309:15 - and end again where the radius is 0.
309:19 - so again we're going to figure out when
309:21 - that radius is 0
309:22 - so 0 equals 1 minus cosine of
309:26 - theta if i add cosine of theta to both
309:30 - sides we want to know where the cosine
309:32 - is equal to one and if i think about my
309:36 - unit circle
309:36 - cosine is equal to one over here
309:40 - on the right so theta is equal to
309:43 - 0 2 pi 4 pi
309:48 - and so on but we just want to get one
309:52 - loop of it which goes from zero to two
309:55 - pi
309:56 - so we want theta to range from zero to
309:58 - two pi
309:59 - and that's where we set the defaults so
310:01 - we don't need to adjust it at
310:03 - all we're ready now to go to
310:07 - our formula that says the area is one
310:10 - half
310:11 - times the integral from a to b which we
310:13 - just found out was zero to two pi
310:17 - of the radius squared one minus
310:20 - cosine theta squared
310:24 - d theta
310:28 - and it might be worth on this one to go
310:30 - ahead and square that
310:31 - out 1 minus 2 cosine
310:34 - theta plus cosine squared of
310:38 - theta d theta
310:42 - we recognize that cosine squared we
310:44 - should be really familiar with what to
310:46 - do with that one
310:46 - from 0 to 2 pi of 1 minus
310:50 - 2 cosine theta plus
310:53 - let's break this up to one half plus
310:56 - one half cosine of two theta
311:02 - d theta
311:06 - we could combine like terms if we wanted
311:08 - to but there's not much
311:09 - combining that happens so let's go ahead
311:11 - and take the antiderivative
311:13 - which is going to be one half times a
311:17 - theta minus two
311:20 - sine theta plus one half of a theta
311:26 - plus the antiderivative of cosine is
311:29 - sine of two theta
311:31 - but to account for that 2 theta we have
311:32 - to divide by 2 which gives us 1
311:34 - 4 and we're integrating from 0 to 2 pi
311:42 - plugging that in then we get one half
311:44 - times
311:45 - theta which is 2 pi
311:49 - notice when we plug 2 pi into sine we'll
311:51 - get 0.
311:54 - actually i shouldn't cross it off just
311:57 - in case we get something
311:58 - on the subtraction step so we have two
312:02 - pi
312:02 - plus one half of theta
312:05 - one half of two pi is just one pi
312:09 - and one fourth sine of two
312:12 - two times two pi which is the sine of
312:14 - four pi which is also zero
312:17 - and then when we plug zero in everything
312:20 - goes off to zero
312:21 - the sine of zero is zero theta is zero
312:23 - half of zero is zero
312:26 - so we end up with a total of three pi
312:30 - over two is the area
312:33 - inside that curve one minus
312:36 - the cosine of theta
312:44 - so as long as we've got this important
312:45 - formula down one half
312:47 - integral from a to b of r squared d
312:49 - theta
312:50 - the integrals the area inside these
312:54 - polar curves is not too difficult to
312:56 - find
312:57 - we can do one twist on it though and
313:01 - instead
313:01 - find the area between curves
313:11 - and just like we found the area between
313:14 - curves
313:15 - with rectangular coordinates by
313:17 - subtracting the top from the bottom
313:19 - we're going to do much the same thing to
313:22 - find the area between
313:23 - curves we want to find the area outside
313:26 - of
313:29 - r equals 2 plus 2 sine
313:33 - theta
313:36 - and inside
313:40 - r equals 6 sine theta
313:46 - well first we need to get an idea of
313:48 - what shape we're looking at
313:49 - so we're going to use the calculator to
313:51 - help us with that
313:56 - clear out the old function the first
313:57 - function that we want to be outside of
313:59 - is 2
314:00 - plus 2 sine of theta
314:06 - and we want to be inside 6 sine of theta
314:11 - as i graph this i'm going to take very
314:13 - careful note
314:15 - of which graph graphs first because i
314:18 - want to be outside
314:19 - of the 2 plus 2 sine theta i want to be
314:21 - outside of the first curve
314:24 - and inside the second curve the 6 sine
314:27 - theta
314:28 - so as it graphs i need to be very aware
314:30 - of outside the first
314:32 - inside the second let's go ahead and hit
314:34 - zoom fit
314:35 - which is zero on my operating system
314:39 - outside that first one inside the second
314:42 - one
314:44 - so i want to be outside the first curve
314:47 - and inside
314:48 - the second one it's kind of this
314:49 - sideways half moon on top
314:51 - is what i want to be inside of let's
314:54 - kind of draw a quick picture of it
314:59 - so one function was this
315:03 - half circle the other function was kind
315:06 - of this upside down heart
315:07 - looking thing but the top function
315:11 - the blue function is the six sine
315:14 - theta i want to be inside that one
315:19 - and outside the 2 plus 2
315:22 - sine theta which means the area we're
315:25 - finding is this kind of
315:27 - sideways half moon on top which means we
315:30 - really need to know
315:33 - what are the two points of intersection
315:36 - so i know where to integrate from and to
315:40 - well those lines intersect where the
315:43 - radii
315:44 - are equal so we'll set the two functions
315:48 - equal the first is two plus two sine
315:51 - theta
315:52 - the second is six sine theta
315:56 - subtract 2 sine theta from both sides to
315:58 - get 4
315:59 - sine theta divide by 4 and one half
316:03 - equals
316:04 - the sine of theta i think about my unit
316:08 - circle
316:09 - sine the y coordinate is one half
316:14 - at pi over six and five
316:17 - pi over six
316:20 - so theta is equal to pi over six and
316:24 - five pi over 6.
316:29 - to test that let's set our minimum and
316:31 - maximum on our calculators
316:35 - hitting window we're going to go from pi
316:39 - over 6 to 5
316:42 - pi over 6
316:45 - and now when it graphs it's going to
316:48 - graph the exact
316:49 - shape that we want to find the area of
316:55 - we're ready to integrate
316:59 - we know that the area is found by taking
317:02 - one half
317:02 - times the integral from our limits of pi
317:05 - over six to five pi
317:06 - over 6 and we know from our prior study
317:10 - that we take the outside function minus
317:12 - the inside function
317:14 - so the outside function is 6 sine theta
317:17 - but remember in polar coordinates we
317:19 - have to square
317:20 - them so we have 36
317:24 - sine squared of theta
317:27 - and we'll subtract the other function
317:31 - which is 2 plus 2 sine of theta
317:35 - squared d theta
317:41 - we now have the integral that we can use
317:43 - to find the area
317:45 - between these curves
317:48 - a little simplifying as we square out
317:50 - the
317:51 - binomial so one half from pi over 6
317:55 - to 5 pi over 6
317:58 - of 36 sine squared theta
318:02 - minus that minus has to distribute
318:04 - through 2 squared is 4
318:06 - minus 8 sine theta
318:10 - minus 4 sine squared of theta
318:16 - d theta
318:20 - i'm gonna combine like terms so we have
318:24 - one half times the integral of pi over
318:26 - six to five pi
318:28 - over six 36 minus four
318:31 - is 32
318:34 - sine squared of theta minus 4 minus 8
318:39 - sine of theta d theta
318:44 - noticing here that all my terms in that
318:46 - integral are even i'm going to go ahead
318:48 - and distribute that one half
318:50 - through the integral so i don't have to
318:52 - worry about it anymore
318:53 - pi over 6 to 5 pi over 6 of 16
318:57 - sine squared theta minus 2
319:00 - minus 4 sine theta d theta
319:07 - now i'm going to break up that sine
319:09 - squared
319:13 - and we're going to multiply by 16. so
319:16 - when we have the one half
319:18 - sixteen times a half is eight
319:22 - minus sixteen times a half is eight
319:26 - cosine of 2 theta
319:31 - minus 2 minus 4 sine theta d
319:34 - theta i'm going to combine
319:37 - like terms again pi over 6 to 5 pi over
319:40 - 6
319:41 - 8 minus 2 is 6 minus
319:45 - 8 cosine of 2 theta
319:49 - minus 4 sine of theta d
319:52 - theta and now we're finally ready to
319:56 - integrate we end up with six theta
320:01 - minus the antiderivative cosine is sine
320:03 - of two theta when we divide by two we
320:05 - get
320:06 - four minus the antiderivative of
320:09 - sine is negative cosine
320:13 - so we have 4 cosine theta
320:16 - integrated from pi over 6
320:21 - to 5 pi over 6.
320:25 - so let's plug it all in
320:30 - we have six times the five pi
320:33 - over six minus four sine of two theta
320:37 - which is
320:37 - five pi over three plus
320:40 - four cosine of theta which is five pi
320:44 - over six
320:46 - minus six times the pi
320:49 - over six plus 4
320:54 - times the sine of 2 times pi over 6
320:58 - which makes it pi over 3
321:02 - minus 4 times the cosine of
321:05 - pi over three
321:10 - oops sorry pi over six
321:15 - so to help us out we might want to think
321:17 - about our unit circle
321:20 - we need to know a 5 pi over 3
321:26 - which is going to be down in the fourth
321:28 - quadrant
321:31 - this is 5 pi over three
321:34 - it has coordinates of one half comma
321:37 - negative root three over two
321:40 - we're also going to need to know about
321:42 - five pi over six
321:47 - which is over here five pi over six
321:51 - that has coordinates of negative
321:54 - root three over two comma one half
321:58 - we need to know about pi over three
322:04 - which has coordinates of one-half
322:07 - comma root 3 over 2
322:11 - and pi over 6 is another one we need a
322:14 - lot of them on here that one's pi over
322:16 - six
322:17 - has coordinates of root three over two
322:19 - comma one half
322:23 - all right plugging it all in then we
322:25 - have the
322:27 - let's switch colors six is divide out so
322:29 - we have 5 pi
322:30 - minus 4 times the sine of pi over
322:34 - 5 pi over 3 assigns the y coordinate
322:37 - which is negative making it positive
322:39 - root 3 over 2 plus 4 times the cosine
322:44 - of 5 pi over 6 cosine's the x coordinate
322:47 - making it negative root 3 over 2
322:52 - minus the 6's divide out just pi
322:56 - plus 4 times the sine of pi over 3 sine
322:59 - being the y coordinate root 3 over
323:01 - 2 minus 4 times the cosine of pi
323:05 - over 6 cosine being the x coordinate
323:07 - root 3
323:08 - over 2 and this simplifies quite
323:12 - nicely because we've got a couple
323:13 - opposites in there
323:15 - 4 root 3 over 2 and negative 4 root 3
323:18 - over 2
323:18 - is 0. 4 root 3 over 2 and negative 4
323:22 - root 3 over 2
323:23 - is 0. so we're just left with 5 pi
323:27 - minus pi leaves us with 4 pi
323:30 - the area that we're looking for on that
323:32 - curve beneath the 6 sine theta
323:35 - and above the 2 plus 2 sine theta
323:38 - area there is four pi
323:44 - let's do one last example make sure
323:46 - we've got a really good grip
323:47 - on this number two we're gonna find the
323:50 - area
323:51 - inside the curve r equals
323:54 - 4 cosine theta
323:59 - and outside the curve
324:03 - r equals 2. let's take a look at our
324:06 - calculator
324:08 - all right first thing we need to do is
324:10 - plug this formula
324:12 - in so let's delete out these old
324:14 - formulas
324:16 - from the previous problem our first one
324:19 - is 4 cosine theta which means the first
324:23 - graph we want to be
324:24 - inside of so we'll take note of the
324:26 - first graph the second graph of 2 we
324:28 - want to be
324:29 - outside of
324:32 - for our window we have to reset it to 0
324:34 - to 2 pi
324:38 - and then i'll zoom fit so we get a good
324:42 - picture we want to be inside this first
324:43 - curve on the right
324:45 - outside the second curve on the left so
324:48 - we're really looking for the right area
324:50 - here shaded so if we draw a quick
324:52 - picture of what we're working with
324:54 - the first function was the circle on the
324:56 - right
324:58 - the second function was the circle in
325:00 - the center
325:03 - and if you can excuse my crude drawing
325:05 - you see we want the area
325:08 - the right part of that which means again
325:11 - so we know our limits of integration
325:13 - we need to find where those points
325:16 - intersect
325:18 - that's where our functions are equal so
325:20 - we will say
325:21 - four cosine theta equals two
325:25 - divide by two cosine theta is one
325:29 - half so if i think about my unit circle
325:32 - where is the cosine one-half the
325:34 - x-coordinate is one-half
325:36 - up on top and near the bottom
325:40 - that happens at pi over three
325:44 - and 5 pi over 3
325:48 - so we're going to say theta is probably
325:50 - going to go
325:51 - from pi over 3 to 5 pi over 3
325:55 - but just to make sure we'll go back to
325:57 - our calculator and check to make sure
325:59 - that's going to give us the area on the
326:00 - right
326:01 - that we're looking for we'll click
326:04 - window
326:06 - for the minimum we want to go from pi
326:08 - over 3
326:10 - to a maximum of 5 pi over
326:13 - 3 and when we hit
326:16 - graph what you notice is something
326:19 - unexpected happens
326:23 - it does not give us this section to the
326:25 - right we want it gave us
326:27 - everything else that we didn't want
326:31 - so we were going from pi over 3 to 5 pi
326:34 - over 3 and that didn't work
326:36 - maybe what we want to do is go the other
326:37 - direction
326:39 - and get that other grouping well we
326:42 - can't go from 5 pi over 3 to pi
326:44 - over 3 but what we can do is continue
326:47 - around the circle
326:48 - and after 2 pi the next top point
326:52 - 6 pi over 3 one more pi over 3 is 7 pi
326:56 - over 3 because remember our trig
326:59 - formulas have an infinite number of
327:00 - solutions the next point we could try
327:04 - is 7 pi over 3 and we're probably going
327:07 - to be
327:08 - between those
327:10 - values so let's take a look at the graph
327:14 - and see if going
327:15 - from a window of 5 pi over 3
327:20 - to the next lap around at 7 pi over 3
327:24 - does that give me the graph i want
327:28 - hitting graph you see it does give us
327:30 - that half moon
327:32 - shape that we were looking for so these
327:35 - now
327:35 - are our limits of integration
327:39 - for this problem
327:43 - now that we have our limits of
327:44 - integration we're ready to use our
327:45 - formula that the area is one-half
327:48 - times the integral from 5 pi over
327:52 - 3 to 7 pi over 3
327:55 - of the outside function which was the
327:57 - blue one before
327:59 - cosine theta
328:02 - squared makes it 16 cosine squared
328:06 - theta minus the outside function that we
328:10 - crossed out
328:11 - which is just 2 squared becomes
328:14 - 4 d theta
328:19 - and now we have the integral we need to
328:21 - solve
328:22 - to find the area between these two
328:24 - curves
328:27 - again one thing i notice is all the
328:28 - terms are even so i'm going to go ahead
328:30 - and distribute
328:32 - that one half through so we have the
328:34 - integral from 5
328:35 - pi over 3 to 7 pi over 3
328:39 - of 8 cosine squared theta minus 2
328:42 - d theta and it seems like the trig
328:46 - formula that we use the most anymore is
328:48 - that cosine squared or sine squared
328:51 - so we're going to integrate from 5 pi
328:52 - over 3
328:54 - to 7 pi over 3.
328:57 - cosine squared gives us a one-half but
328:59 - when multiplied by
329:00 - 8 that leaves us with 4 plus
329:03 - 1 half times 8 is 4
329:06 - cosine of 2 theta
329:10 - minus the 2 still d theta
329:15 - let's go ahead and combine the like
329:16 - terms of four minus two
329:19 - so we're integrating five pi over three
329:21 - to seven pi
329:22 - over three of two plus four
329:26 - cosine of two theta
329:30 - d theta and now we're ready to
329:34 - actually integrate
329:38 - when we integrate we get 2 theta plus
329:40 - the antiderivative of cosine
329:41 - is the sine of two theta we have to
329:45 - divide by the two which just leaves us
329:46 - with two sine of two theta
329:49 - integrated from five pi over three to
329:52 - seven pi
329:53 - over three
329:56 - so when we plug that in we get two times
329:59 - our theta which is seven
330:01 - pi over three plus two times the sine of
330:05 - two theta
330:06 - which is fourteen pi over three
330:10 - minus two times theta which is five pi
330:13 - over
330:14 - three minus two
330:17 - times the sine of two theta which is ten
330:20 - pi
330:22 - over three
330:25 - let's think about our unit circle to
330:27 - help us with those
330:29 - strange ones we've got to figure out 14
330:32 - pi over 3 and 10 pi over 3.
330:35 - that's going to loop us around the
330:36 - circle a couple times so to help us out
330:38 - i'm going to count in
330:39 - three pies so we've got zero
330:44 - three pie over three six pie over three
330:49 - nine pie over three
330:52 - and twelve pi over 3 looping us around
330:54 - the circle over and over again
330:58 - uh that should help us see that 14 pi
331:01 - over
331:01 - 3 is right here
331:06 - 14 pi over 3 is going to be the same
331:09 - as 2 pi over 3.
331:14 - so the coordinates there are negative
331:17 - one-half
331:18 - comma root 3 over 2.
331:22 - and later when we get to the 10 pi over
331:24 - 3 10 pi is a little more than 9
331:27 - so it's going to be down here
331:30 - 10 pi over 3 turns out to be the same as
331:33 - 4 pi over 3.
331:37 - so the coordinates there are negative
331:39 - one-half
331:40 - negative root 3 over 2.
331:46 - so when we simplify to bring it all
331:48 - together we get fourteen pi
331:50 - over three plus two times the sine of
331:55 - fourteen
331:55 - pi over three sines the y coordinate
331:58 - root three over two
332:00 - times two gives us just a root three
332:03 - minus 2 times 5 is 10 pi over
332:06 - 3 minus
332:10 - 2 times the sine of 10 pi over 3
332:13 - sine being the y coordinate is going to
332:15 - be a negative negative times a negative
332:17 - is a positive
332:19 - root three over two times two is just
332:21 - root three
332:24 - combining like terms fourteen minus ten
332:27 - is four
332:27 - pi over three plus root 3 and root 3
332:32 - is 2 square roots of
332:36 - 3
332:39 - which means the area between these two
332:42 - circles
332:44 - is going to be 4 pi over 3
332:48 - plus 2 square roots of
332:52 - 3.
332:56 - so now it's your turn to take a look at
332:57 - some of these on the homework assignment
332:59 - to practice
333:00 - them get really good the key formula
333:03 - here for the area
333:05 - we've been using it all the way through
333:07 - is that the area is one half times the
333:09 - integral from a to b
333:11 - of the radius squared d theta
333:14 - try a few of these and we'll look at
333:16 - them more in class
333:20 - this video is going to start a chapter
333:22 - that goes a completely different
333:23 - direction than the sequences and series
333:25 - that we've been focusing on up to this
333:27 - point
333:27 - we're going to start by looking at these
333:29 - things called conic
333:30 - sections answering the question what are
333:38 - conic sections
333:41 - and we're going to just barely touch the
333:42 - surface of what a conic section
333:44 - is each one of these different conic
333:46 - sections we could probably spend a whole
333:47 - day or more on
333:49 - and instead we're going to do them all
333:50 - in one day so we're just going to hit
333:53 - the highlights there are several conic
333:56 - sections the first one
333:57 - is the circle
334:01 - and we actually have a very precise
334:03 - definition for the circle
334:05 - it is all points
334:09 - that are equidistant
334:14 - from a point
334:20 - so if i have a point here in the center
334:23 - and i have some set
334:25 - distance we'll call that distance r
334:28 - no matter where that set distance goes
334:32 - that distance is going to be the same
334:34 - and if we collect
334:35 - all of the points that are exactly a
334:37 - distance of r away from that point
334:40 - we should get a perfect circle with
334:42 - radius
334:43 - r the equation that builds a circle like
334:48 - this
334:49 - is x minus h squared
334:52 - plus y minus k squared
334:56 - equals r squared
334:59 - where the point h comma k
335:02 - is the center of the circle
335:06 - and r is equal to the radius
335:11 - of the circle
335:14 - so if i wanted to find the equation
335:20 - of a circle
335:24 - centered
335:28 - at five comma negative two
335:32 - with radius 3
335:37 - we could build that knowing that the
335:39 - center is
335:40 - h comma k and the radius
335:44 - is that radius of 3. so my equation
335:48 - becomes
335:49 - open a parenthesis x minus h
335:54 - which is the x coordinate of the center
335:56 - 5
336:00 - squared plus y
336:03 - minus k which is the y coordinate of the
336:06 - center
336:07 - subtracting a negative 2 is the same as
336:09 - adding 2
336:11 - squared equals the radius squared the
336:15 - radius is three
336:16 - three squared is nine and this gives us
336:19 - the equation of the circle
336:21 - centered at five negative two with a
336:24 - radius of three
336:27 - now a circle is the most basic of the
336:29 - conic sections
336:31 - and we don't actually spend much time on
336:33 - it because of how basic it is so let's
336:35 - go to the next
336:36 - most interesting conic section and that
336:39 - is
336:40 - the parabola
336:46 - a parabola has a very specific
336:47 - definition also that has to do with
336:50 - distance
336:51 - as well a parabola is all the points
337:00 - with a distance
337:06 - from a point
337:10 - and we call this other point the focus
337:17 - equal to the distance
337:24 - from a line
337:29 - and that line we call the directrix
337:37 - so what this means is we've got this
337:40 - parabola
337:46 - there is a focus inside the parabola
337:51 - and there is a directrix
337:56 - outside of the parabola and the idea of
337:59 - a parabola
338:00 - is if i take the distance from the focus
338:02 - to the line
338:05 - let's call that a it's going to be the
338:07 - same
338:08 - as from the parabola to the directrix
338:12 - that distance is going to be the same
338:17 - now it's going to be a different
338:19 - distance if i go
338:21 - maybe more diagonal and slightly to the
338:23 - right we'll call that b
338:25 - but then we'll get the same distance as
338:27 - you drop down to the directrix
338:29 - b so wherever this line is
338:32 - drawn c that length is the same
338:37 - as the length to the directrix
338:40 - c those lengths are always the same now
338:44 - this drawing is not to scale
338:46 - and not a perfect parabola so it those
338:49 - don't look quite
338:50 - the same but if it were a perfect
338:51 - parabola those distances from the focus
338:54 - to the graph would be the same as the
338:57 - distance from the graph
338:58 - to the directrix
339:02 - for the equation of the parabola
339:07 - it is based
339:11 - on the direction of the parabola
339:21 - the most common type of parabola that we
339:24 - are
339:24 - familiar with is the parabola that opens
339:28 - upwards
339:30 - the parabola that opens up where it has
339:32 - a vertex
339:33 - we'll call that vertex at the point h
339:36 - comma k
339:38 - and then up above the vertex is the
339:42 - focus
339:44 - and then below it is the
339:47 - line that is the directrix
339:52 - the equation of a parabola like this is
339:56 - y equals 1 over 4p
340:01 - times x minus h squared
340:05 - plus k where h comma k
340:08 - is that vertex point
340:12 - also it's important to note that this
340:14 - letter p
340:16 - p is the distance
340:22 - to either the directrix
340:27 - or focus depending on which direction
340:31 - we're going
340:33 - from the vertex
340:39 - and we already said the vertex h comma k
340:47 - is the vertex coordinates
340:51 - and the equation
340:54 - y equals
340:58 - since we drop from the vertex down to
341:00 - the directrix
341:02 - we can take that k coordinate of the
341:04 - vertex and subtract the p
341:08 - to get the directrix
341:16 - also of note just a little side note if
341:19 - the parabola is upside down
341:21 - the only difference is we make the whole
341:22 - thing negative so we would have y
341:24 - equals negative 1 over 4p times
341:28 - x minus h squared plus k exactly the
341:31 - same but the negative
341:32 - in front would make the parabola go the
341:35 - other direction
341:36 - so that's the first direction of a
341:39 - parabola
341:42 - the second direction we have a parabola
341:45 - actually goes the other direction
341:47 - it goes opening to the right
341:52 - with a vertex still at our point
341:55 - h comma k
341:59 - but now the focus is off to the right
342:04 - and the directrix is vertical
342:10 - this equation is x equals
342:13 - 1 over 4p
342:14 - [Music]
342:16 - times y minus k squared
342:19 - plus h
342:23 - and p on here is still the distance
342:29 - to either the directrix
342:33 - or the focus from the vertex
342:40 - so again that distance between them is p
342:43 - just like it was before
342:48 - h comma k is still the center notice the
342:51 - k
342:51 - is always with the y so it's y minus k
342:54 - here
342:55 - but that is the vertex
342:58 - and the directrix equation then is an x
343:01 - equals equation
343:03 - it's x equals h minus
343:07 - that p that distance from the vertex to
343:10 - the directrix
343:19 - and again we have a little side note
343:22 - that if the parabola opens
343:23 - off to the right that just means we have
343:27 - a negative
343:28 - in front of everything so it's x equals
343:31 - negative 1 over 4p
343:34 - times x minus k i'm sorry y minus k
343:37 - squared plus h
343:42 - so with the parabola the equation is
343:46 - based
343:47 - on the direction
343:51 - so with this in mind let's see if we can
343:54 - find
343:56 - some equations of parabola
344:03 - first let's say we want a parabola that
344:05 - has a focus
344:08 - at three comma two
344:12 - and directrix
344:16 - at y equals 8.
344:20 - i always try and draw a rough sketch of
344:23 - what's happening to help me decide what
344:25 - type of equation i'm using
344:27 - if i look at the point 3 comma 2 for the
344:30 - focus
344:32 - 3 comma 2 is the focus
344:38 - and the directrix is a y equals equation
344:40 - but it's y
344:41 - equals eight y equals is a horizontal
344:44 - line
344:47 - the parabola then needs to go between
344:50 - them and the only way we can get between
344:52 - them
344:53 - is to have our parabola come up kind of
344:55 - like this
344:58 - with our vertex in the center
345:02 - so the focus is at three comma two
345:05 - the directrix is at y equals eight
345:11 - we need to know first
345:15 - what is our p that p distance that
345:18 - separates
345:20 - the focus from the vertex and the vertex
345:23 - from the directrix
345:26 - well because we're going horizontally
345:28 - with our p distance we look at the y
345:30 - values of 8 and 2.
345:35 - the distance from eight to two eight
345:36 - minus two is six
345:39 - and that covers notice the p is there
345:42 - twice
345:43 - so six is equal to two p we can see that
345:45 - p
345:46 - value is going to be equal to three
345:52 - so the vertex coordinate then
345:56 - we're still going to the right the same
345:58 - three but
345:59 - now we're going to be off by a distance
346:02 - of
346:02 - p which is three
346:09 - well the focus had a y coordinate of two
346:12 - three more would give it a y coordinate
346:14 - of
346:16 - five so the vertex has a
346:20 - coordinates of 3 comma 5
346:23 - and we know the p is equal to 3
346:26 - so we're ready to make our equation
346:30 - it's a y equals equation because it's a
346:33 - vertical parabola
346:35 - but it opens downwards so we know it
346:37 - needs to be negative negative 1 over 4
346:39 - times p
346:40 - which we found out was 3
346:43 - times x minus the x coordinate of 3
346:48 - squared plus the y
346:51 - coordinate which we found out to be 5.
346:56 - a little simplifying in that denominator
346:58 - we find out that y
347:00 - is equal to negative 1 12 times x
347:03 - minus 3 squared plus
347:07 - 5. and so in this way we can really use
347:11 - our
347:11 - sketch of the parabola it doesn't have
347:13 - to be to scale or perfect
347:15 - but our sketch really helps us build the
347:17 - pieces we need
347:18 - the vertex and that distance p between
347:21 - the vertex and the focus
347:23 - or the vertex and the directrix
347:27 - let's try one more example
347:30 - let's find the equation of the parabola
347:32 - that has a focus
347:34 - of negative 4 comma negative 1
347:38 - and directrix of
347:42 - x equals negative eight
347:49 - so this time if we were to draw our
347:51 - rough sketch
347:53 - the focus is at negative four negative 1
347:56 - which is the focus
348:00 - and the directrix is an x equals
348:03 - equation which means it's a vertical
348:05 - line
348:05 - x equals negative 8 which is even
348:07 - further to the left
348:10 - so that tells us our parabola has to
348:13 - come in through the center
348:18 - we need to find our vertex coordinates
348:22 - the focus is negative four negative one
348:26 - the directrix is x equals negative eight
348:31 - so as we go after our p value remember p
348:35 - is the distance between the vertex and
348:38 - the focus
348:39 - or between the vertex and the directrix
348:43 - so we have two p's of total distance
348:45 - between the vertex
348:47 - and the directrix the directrix
348:50 - has an x of negative eight
348:53 - the focus has an x of negative four
348:57 - if we subtract those we find the
348:59 - distance between them
349:01 - is four units
349:04 - so p here must be equal to two
349:09 - so if we have a distance of two between
349:11 - them we know that
349:14 - the x coordinate of the vertex
349:17 - is two away from our vertex i'm sorry
349:20 - from our focus
349:22 - and the directrix two away from negative
349:25 - four
349:25 - is negative six and we keep the same
349:28 - y-coordinate
349:29 - of negative one and we now know our
349:32 - vertex
349:32 - is at negative six negative one
349:38 - well since our parabola opens to the
349:40 - right it's an x equals
349:43 - it's positive because it's open the
349:44 - correct direction
349:46 - one over four 4p which we found out was
349:49 - 2
349:50 - times y minus the k
349:54 - the y coordinate of the vertex which is
349:56 - negative 1
349:58 - so plus 1 squared plus the x coordinate
350:02 - which is negative six
350:05 - cleaning up that denominator we have x
350:07 - equals one eighth
350:09 - times y plus one squared
350:12 - minus six
350:15 - and we now have the equation of our
350:17 - parabola
350:22 - so the parabola is our second
350:27 - conic section we've had circles and
350:29 - parabolas
350:31 - our third conic section is kind of a
350:33 - variation
350:34 - on the circle and it is what is called
350:37 - the
350:37 - ellipse
350:42 - the ellipse is also defined in terms of
350:44 - distance the ellipse is
350:46 - all the points
350:51 - where the sum
350:55 - of the distance
351:02 - from any point
351:08 - to two foci which is the plural of focus
351:14 - is constant
351:22 - an ellipse is traditionally called the
351:25 - oval
351:26 - shape
351:31 - and the idea of the ellipse if i had
351:32 - drawn it perfectly
351:34 - is we have two foci in the ellipse
351:40 - and if i were to pick any point on the
351:42 - ellipse
351:45 - and look at the distance to both foci
351:47 - we'll call them maybe a1 and a2
351:52 - and then i picked a different point on
351:54 - the ellipse
351:58 - and took its distance to the two foci
352:00 - we'll call that
352:01 - b1 and b2 and it doesn't matter which
352:04 - points i pick i could pick a point
352:06 - that's way off
352:09 - on the side and i end up with
352:12 - c1 and c2 connecting to
352:15 - the two foci
352:19 - what happens is the sum of the distances
352:23 - a1 plus a2 is always constant so from
352:26 - the beep
352:26 - from the point with the b's b1 plus b2
352:29 - is exactly the same distance
352:31 - same thing for the c1 plus c2 no matter
352:35 - what point i
352:36 - pick if i go from that point to the two
352:38 - vertices
352:39 - the total distance is always
352:42 - constant that's what makes
352:46 - an ellipse and we have
352:49 - two equations
352:54 - four ellipses
352:58 - and it really depends on which direction
352:59 - the ellipse is going
353:01 - the first is for the horizontal ellipse
353:04 - where we have
353:05 - x minus h squared over
353:09 - a squared plus y minus k
353:13 - squared over b squared equals one
353:19 - or if the ellipse opens vertically
353:23 - we'll put the y's first y minus k
353:26 - squared over still a squared
353:29 - plus x minus h squared
353:32 - over v squared equals one
353:39 - where the a is always bigger than the b
353:44 - that's important the a is always bigger
353:45 - than b the first denominator is always
353:47 - the biggest
353:48 - so whichever x or y has the bigger
353:50 - denominator we have that one come first
353:52 - and we have this other variable called c
353:56 - where c squared is equal to a squared
353:59 - minus
354:00 - b squared
354:05 - that's going to be an important
354:06 - relationship for us as we attempt to
354:09 - define
354:10 - some of the properties first
354:13 - the major axis
354:23 - which is the distance across
354:28 - we'll call it the long distance across
354:33 - it could be horizontal or vertical
354:35 - depending on which
354:36 - way the ellipse opens up but the major
354:39 - axis has a distance
354:41 - of 2 a
354:46 - and the minor axis
354:50 - which is the other direction depending
354:52 - on its vertical or horizontal
354:55 - it's the shorter distance across the
354:56 - middle
355:02 - that shorter distance is to be
355:07 - we also know the distance
355:11 - between the foci
355:15 - plural of focus is
355:18 - to c and that's where the c comes in
355:21 - identifying those focus
355:23 - or foci and of course we're getting used
355:27 - to seeing
355:27 - in all of these conic sections that the
355:30 - center
355:31 - is always the point h comma k
355:37 - so if all this information is true about
355:39 - our ellipse
355:41 - we should be able to find some equations
355:55 - let's find the equation of the ellipse
355:57 - that has end points
356:02 - of the major axes
356:08 - at negative three comma five
356:13 - and negative three comma negative seven
356:18 - that also has the foci
356:22 - at negative three comma one
356:26 - and negative three comma negative three
356:33 - notice the major axis and the foci all
356:35 - have an x coordinate of negative
356:37 - 3. the endpoints what moves
356:42 - is actually the y-coordinate
356:46 - so that tells me the y-coordinate is
356:47 - where we get the tall
356:49 - and narrow shape
356:54 - where we've got a center
356:58 - which we don't know where the center is
357:00 - yet
357:02 - but we've got two foci
357:06 - one above and one below the higher one
357:08 - has a higher y coordinate so the higher
357:10 - one must be negative three one
357:12 - the lower one must be negative three
357:14 - negative three
357:16 - and the end points of the major axes
357:19 - means if we draw the long line through
357:21 - the center
357:22 - the major axis is the longest line
357:24 - possible
357:25 - so the endpoints must be at negative
357:27 - three comma five
357:30 - and negative three comma negative seven
357:36 - we need to find a b c
357:40 - and the center h comma k
357:45 - let's do the center first that's
357:46 - probably the easiest to do
357:48 - you can see all these are in a line on
357:49 - negative 3 for the x coordinate
357:52 - the y coordinate is going to be in the
357:54 - middle of the foci
357:56 - so the folk i go from one to negative
357:58 - three
358:00 - the distance between them if we subtract
358:02 - one minus negative three is
358:04 - four so the distance between
358:07 - the foci let's go ahead and label that
358:13 - the distance between the foci is 4
358:17 - and remember that is equal to 2c
358:21 - so we're also figuring out here at the
358:24 - same time that 2 equals c when we divide
358:26 - both sides by 2.
358:29 - so if the total distance is 4 half of
358:31 - that is
358:32 - 2 so to get to the center
358:37 - from one of the foci we'll either add or
358:39 - subtract 2 when we figure out the
358:41 - y-coordinate of the center right in the
358:43 - middle
358:43 - is at negative 1.
358:48 - so we've got our center we also know
358:51 - that the distance
358:52 - between the endpoints of the major axes
358:57 - is 2a
359:02 - the distance from 5 to negative 7 if we
359:05 - subtract is a total distance of 12
359:07 - which means if we divide by 2 a
359:10 - is equal to 6.
359:17 - we still need to figure out what b is
359:18 - though we don't know b from this
359:21 - drawing but we do know that c squared is
359:24 - equal to
359:25 - a squared minus b squared
359:28 - and c we know is 2 2 squared is 4
359:32 - equals a we know is 6
359:35 - 6 squared is 36 minus b
359:39 - squared if i add b squared to both sides
359:43 - and subtract
359:44 - 4 i find out that b squared is 32
359:49 - and that's actually all we need is b
359:51 - squared because b squared is in the
359:52 - formula
359:55 - our formula then becomes notice this
359:59 - opens vertically so the y's come first
360:02 - y minus the y coordinate of the center
360:05 - is negative 1
360:06 - so plus 1 squared divided by a
360:09 - squared 6 squared is 36
360:13 - plus x minus the x coordinate which is
360:17 - negative 3
360:18 - on the center squared
360:21 - divided by b squared which we just found
360:23 - out was 32
360:25 - equals 1 and this then is the equation
360:30 - of the ellipse that has endpoints of the
360:33 - major axis at negative three
360:35 - five and negative three seven it also
360:37 - puts the foci at negative three one
360:39 - and negative three three
360:44 - let's do one more ellipse
360:47 - [Music]
360:49 - leave that on the screen
360:52 - let's find the ellipse that has the end
360:54 - points
360:59 - of the minor axis
361:02 - this is the smaller one at one negative
361:05 - two
361:07 - and one negative four
361:11 - also has foci
361:14 - at negative two negative three
361:19 - and three negative three
361:24 - notice the foci the y coordinate is
361:26 - consistent which means
361:28 - it must open up around the x's so this
361:30 - is going to be a horizontal ellipse
361:35 - we know the foci are at negative
361:38 - 2 negative 3.
361:42 - and three negative three
361:46 - we're going to need to find the center
361:50 - we're also told the end points of the
361:51 - minor axes
361:55 - the minor axis goes the short distance
361:58 - through the center
361:59 - the endpoints of the minor axes are at
362:01 - one negative two
362:03 - and one negative four
362:09 - well the center we know is right in the
362:10 - middle of those
362:12 - so we obviously have a y coordinate of
362:13 - one and right in the middle of negative
362:16 - two and negative four
362:17 - we see is negative three we also can use
362:21 - our distances to help us conclude a few
362:23 - things
362:27 - the distance between the foci
362:32 - we're looking at the x coordinate here
362:34 - from negative 2 to negative 3 is 5.
362:38 - and the distance between the foci is 2c
362:41 - so c equals 5 halves
362:46 - we also know the distance between the
362:49 - minor axis
362:50 - the minor axis gives us two b's
362:54 - the minor axis goes from negative two to
362:57 - negative four that's a total distance of
362:59 - two so b must be equal to one
363:04 - we can then find our c because c squared
363:08 - equals a squared minus b squared
363:13 - well c is five halves that's 25 fourths
363:18 - is equal to a squared we don't know
363:21 - minus b squared which is one
363:26 - add one to both sides that's four
363:28 - fourths gives us 29
363:29 - fourths is equal to a squared
363:33 - and we're ready to make our equation
363:36 - [Music]
363:38 - because this one opens up horizontally
363:40 - on the x's
363:41 - we have the x's come first x minus the x
363:44 - coordinate of the center which is
363:45 - negative 3
363:47 - plus 3 squared divided by a squared
363:50 - which is 29 4
363:54 - plus now the y coordinate
363:57 - y minus the y coordinate is 1 on the
364:00 - center
364:01 - squared divided by b squared which is 1
364:06 - equals 1.
364:10 - and even though it's a little ugly this
364:11 - is probably the preferred format
364:13 - of the ellipse because it shows all of
364:16 - that information we want to see
364:18 - it helps us identify how big the minor
364:21 - axis is the major axis is where the
364:23 - center is
364:24 - so we'll go ahead and leave it in this
364:27 - form and so that's our third
364:30 - conic section the ellipse
364:35 - there is one last conic section
364:41 - conic section number four we'll call it
364:43 - d here
364:44 - it is called the hyperbola
364:49 - and the hyperbola is defined really
364:51 - similar to how we define the ellipse
364:54 - it is all points
364:59 - where the only difference is the ellipse
365:01 - was a sum
365:03 - the hyperbola is the difference
365:11 - of the distance
365:20 - from any point
365:27 - to the two foci
365:32 - is constant
365:40 - and the idea here is a hyperbola
365:43 - is going to look something like this
365:47 - where there's going to be
365:51 - two vertices
365:56 - and we take a look at the distance if i
365:59 - pick a point
366:00 - on one hyperbola
366:03 - the two distances the longer one we'll
366:05 - call the first point
366:06 - the shorter one we'll call the second
366:08 - point no matter what point i pick on
366:10 - whichever one
366:15 - the longer one i'll call the first point
366:17 - the shorter one the second point
366:19 - no matter which points i pick when i
366:22 - subtract the a1 minus a2
366:25 - i'll get the exact same value as if i
366:27 - took the b1 minus the b2
366:30 - or wherever i want to draw these lines
366:31 - the hyperbola has that distance
366:34 - constant
366:38 - just like with the ellipse there are two
366:40 - equations that we use
366:49 - for the hyperbolas the first equation is
366:52 - used if it opens kind of the traditional
366:54 - way off to the left and right
366:56 - this is where x minus h squared over a
367:00 - squared minus y
367:04 - minus k squared over b squared equals 1.
367:10 - and here it doesn't matter which one's
367:12 - bigger a or b what's important here is
367:13 - the x is positive
367:14 - and the y squared is negative because if
367:17 - we switch that
367:19 - and we have the y minus k squared over a
367:23 - squared minus the x minus h
367:26 - squared over b squared equals one
367:30 - then the hyperbola is open vertically
367:36 - we also still have this relationship
367:38 - with c
367:40 - c squared this time is equal to the sum
367:43 - of a squared plus b squared
367:46 - [Music]
367:51 - and with that we end up with these
367:53 - important properties
367:56 - the distance
367:59 - between the foci
368:06 - is 2c
368:09 - and the distance between
368:16 - the vertices
368:20 - that's the corners of the hyperbolas
368:24 - is 2a we still need to find b to figure
368:27 - out how wide
368:28 - everything's going to be and then of
368:30 - course we still have our center
368:34 - at h comma k
368:39 - so using this let's see if we can find
368:42 - some equations
368:49 - starting with a hyperbola that has
368:54 - vertices
368:56 - at negative four comma three
369:00 - and two comma three
369:04 - [Music]
369:08 - and also has foci
369:13 - at negative seven comma three
369:17 - and five comma three
369:24 - so again i like to do a rough sketch
369:26 - just so i have an idea of what's
369:28 - happening
369:29 - with this i see the vertices the
369:31 - x-coordinate
369:33 - is changing and the y-coordinate is
369:36 - constant
369:36 - so the x-coordinate is going to change
369:38 - left and right
369:40 - well the y-coordinate is going to remain
369:42 - constant
369:45 - so we have vertices at
369:48 - negative 4 comma 3.
369:52 - and 2 comma 3.
369:55 - we also have foci
369:58 - out here at negative 7 comma 3
370:03 - and 5 comma 3.
370:07 - we need to know where the center is
370:12 - and also find our a b and c
370:17 - well the center is going to be right in
370:18 - the middle of the vertices
370:21 - our vertices the x's are changing from
370:24 - negative 4 to 2 and if we subtract
370:26 - that's a total distance of
370:28 - 6. we know the distance between the
370:31 - vertices
370:32 - is 2a so that tells us that a is equal
370:35 - to
370:35 - three the distance to the center is also
370:39 - equal to three
370:42 - so if we back up three or add three
370:45 - depending on which point we're going
370:47 - from
370:47 - we'll end up with negative 1 comma 3
370:51 - as the coordinates of our center point
370:54 - we now have our h and k we also have our
370:57 - a
370:58 - the only other thing we can pull off of
370:59 - the graph is c which we get from the
371:02 - distance between the foci
371:05 - the foci go from x of negative 7 to 5.
371:08 - that's a total distance of 12 which we
371:10 - know is
371:11 - 2 c so c
371:14 - must be equal to six
371:19 - now we can go after the b because we
371:21 - know c squared is a
371:22 - squared plus b squared
371:25 - c was six squared is thirty six
371:29 - a was 3 squared is 9
371:33 - and subtracting 9 from both sides b
371:36 - squared is going to be equal to
371:42 - 27.
371:45 - so go into our equation then
371:48 - the equation is because it opens
371:51 - sideways we start with the x
371:53 - x minus h
371:56 - h it comes from the center so three i'm
371:59 - sorry negative one
372:00 - so we'll add one squared
372:04 - divided by our a squared three squared
372:06 - is nine
372:07 - minus y minus the y coordinate of the
372:12 - center which is 3
372:13 - squared divided by b squared which we
372:16 - just found out is 27
372:19 - equals 1.
372:26 - let's try one last hyperbola before we
372:29 - step
372:29 - away from them
372:34 - let's find the hyperbola that has
372:38 - vertices
372:40 - at two comma three
372:46 - and two comma negative one
372:51 - it's also going to have foci
372:55 - at two comma five
372:59 - and two comma
373:03 - negative three
373:06 - this time i see the x's staying
373:08 - consistent which means
373:10 - the hyperbola is going to go up and down
373:12 - around the y's
373:17 - so the vertices are at two comma
373:20 - three and two comma negative one
373:26 - the foci are at two comma five
373:31 - and two comma negative three
373:35 - we need to find the center and a
373:38 - b and c
373:42 - well first we know that a comes from the
373:45 - distance between
373:46 - the vertices
373:50 - the x's are the same so we'll focus on
373:52 - the y's the distance from three to
373:54 - negative one is
373:55 - four so four must equal two a
373:58 - therefore a equals two
374:01 - so the distance from the center to the
374:04 - edge is two
374:06 - x coordinates stays the same the y
374:09 - coordinate is two off
374:11 - from the vertices so three minus two is
374:14 - one
374:16 - the center must be at two comma one
374:22 - the vertices are two c apart
374:25 - so from five to negative three is eight
374:28 - that's two c's
374:29 - so c must equal four
374:33 - and then we're ready to go after our b
374:36 - because we know a squared plus b squared
374:39 - equals c
374:40 - squared a
374:43 - is two two squared is four plus b
374:46 - squared equals c which is 4
374:49 - squared is 16. subtract 4 from both
374:53 - sides and b
374:54 - squared equals 12.
374:58 - now we have all the pieces we need to
375:00 - build our
375:01 - equation this one opens vertically so
375:05 - it's going to be a y
375:06 - first y minus the y coordinate
375:09 - of the center which is 1 squared
375:13 - over a squared 2 squared is 4
375:17 - minus x minus the x coordinate is 2
375:22 - squared over b squared which is 12
375:25 - equals 1 and we have our hyperbola
375:32 - so this video was a quick overview
375:35 - of all of the conic sections that we're
375:39 - going to work with in this course
375:41 - we talked about hyperbolas we talked
375:44 - about
375:44 - ellipses we talked about parabolas
375:48 - and we talked about circles four common
375:51 - conic sections that we're going to talk
375:53 - about
375:53 - further in class so take a look at the
375:56 - homework assignment
375:57 - try a few of these there's a lot of
375:59 - pieces to keep track of but they're not
376:00 - too hard as a whole
376:02 - so take a look at them and we will see
376:03 - you in class
376:09 - this next chapter is going to take a
376:10 - look at vectors and how vectors can help
376:13 - us in calculus and in other contexts
376:15 - so the question we're going to do as we
376:17 - set up this new study of vectors is what
376:19 - exactly are they
376:23 - what are
376:26 - vectors
376:31 - and quite simply a vector
376:36 - is a quantity
376:44 - with magnitude
376:51 - which is a fancy word for size
376:55 - and direction
377:03 - and an example of a vector we might
377:06 - represent a vector from a point
377:09 - out to another point with direction that
377:12 - would be a vector we might label it
377:14 - vector v
377:17 - and what's interesting about vectors is
377:19 - they're not
377:20 - necessarily unique
377:26 - let's say we've got a vector u
377:30 - and we use the little kind of vector
377:32 - looking symbol above it
377:34 - to let us know that's a vector vector u
377:37 - goes from the origin
377:43 - to the point three comma two
377:47 - and vector v goes
377:50 - from
377:53 - negative 3 negative 1
377:57 - to 0 comma 1.
378:01 - i want to notice really quick a bit of
378:03 - notation i have this little
378:06 - arrow looking thing above the vector
378:07 - that i'm going to write to represent a
378:09 - vector
378:10 - the textbook uses bold letters to
378:12 - represent vectors
378:14 - it's really the same thing it's just
378:15 - hard to type
378:17 - by handwriting a bold u and a bold v
378:20 - so my notes are going to be slightly
378:23 - different than the textbook
378:24 - but that line above means we're talking
378:26 - about a vector
378:28 - so let's look at what these vectors
378:31 - look like
378:36 - the first vector it says goes from the
378:39 - origin to the point
378:40 - three comma two so the vector
378:44 - goes from the origin to the point three
378:46 - comma two that's
378:48 - vector u the second vector goes from
378:52 - negative three comma one
378:54 - to zero comma one and you notice that
378:57 - both vectors
378:58 - are going the same direction
379:01 - and both vectors are the same
379:05 - size because both vectors have
379:09 - the same magnitude
379:15 - in the same direction
379:22 - we can say that those are equivalent
379:28 - vectors they both represent the same
379:32 - vector the same size and the same
379:35 - direction now we need a good way to
379:38 - represent vectors and one
379:42 - way we can represent vectors it's what's
379:44 - called
379:45 - component form
379:50 - which basically means it is the size and
379:53 - direction
379:54 - from the origin
379:59 - and usually we represent the vector
380:03 - with square brackets the x-coordinate
380:06 - and the y-coordinate from the origin
380:11 - now vectors aren't always set up from
380:14 - the origin
380:15 - so to find the component form
380:19 - what we can do is we can subtract
380:25 - the terminal point
380:33 - minus the initial point
380:41 - so for example if we were asked to
380:44 - find the component form
380:52 - of a vector
380:56 - with initial point
381:03 - of negative 3 negative 1
381:09 - and terminal point
381:16 - of negative 2 comma three
381:21 - we could do that by finding the x
381:24 - component
381:27 - and the y component by subtracting
381:31 - the terminal point minus the initial
381:33 - point
381:34 - so the terminal point for x starts at
381:38 - negative two
381:40 - minus the initial point of negative
381:42 - three
381:43 - so negative two
381:48 - minus the negative 3
381:52 - is going to equal 1.
381:55 - the x component is 1.
381:58 - for the y component we take the terminal
382:01 - point of three
382:02 - and we subtract the negative one
382:05 - and we end up with four
382:10 - and we take the x and y components
382:11 - together to represent our vector v
382:16 - as the x component comma
382:19 - the y component
382:23 - and this is our component form
382:27 - of the vector again i want to make sure
382:30 - i emphasize
382:32 - that we use pointed brackets
382:39 - when talking about a vector pointed
382:42 - brackets and that vector of 1 4
382:45 - tells us that if this vector was
382:47 - centered at the origin it would go to
382:48 - the point 1 comma 4
382:50 - with that same magnitude and direction
382:56 - speaking of magnitude quite often we're
382:58 - going to be interested
382:59 - in how exactly we can find that
383:08 - magnitude and the way we represent the
383:11 - magnitude of a vector
383:12 - is it looks like our double
383:15 - absolute values and if i think about a
383:18 - vector
383:23 - if i want to know the total distance of
383:25 - that vector
383:27 - the magnitude of the vector
383:30 - we could look as it added as set up with
383:33 - an x
383:33 - component
383:37 - and a y component and you can see the
383:40 - pythagorean theorem could be used to
383:43 - find the size of that vector
383:45 - x squared plus y squared equals the
383:47 - magnitude squared
383:50 - or if we take the square root of both
383:52 - sides the magnitude
383:54 - is the square root of the x component
383:56 - squared
383:57 - plus the y component squared
384:00 - and this gives us a nice little formula
384:03 - to find the magnitude
384:05 - of any vector
384:08 - so for example if i wanted to
384:12 - find the magnitude
384:17 - of a vector v
384:21 - equal to negative five comma four
384:28 - we would say that the magnitude of the
384:30 - vector
384:33 - is equal to the square root of the x
384:35 - component squared
384:36 - 5 squared is 25 plus the y component
384:40 - squared
384:41 - 4 squared is 16. and
384:44 - 25 plus 16 is 41
384:48 - and so the magnitude the size of this
384:50 - vector
384:51 - is the square root of 41.
384:56 - let's try one more example
384:59 - let's find the magnitude
385:05 - of let's do the vector w
385:09 - is equal to four-fifths
385:12 - comma three-fifths
385:18 - well the magnitude of vector w
385:21 - is the square root of the x component
385:25 - squared which is 16 over 25
385:29 - plus the y component squared 9 over 25
385:34 - which is the square root of 25 over 25
385:38 - or the square root of 1 which is just 1.
385:44 - and this is actually kind of interesting
385:45 - to us
385:48 - whenever a vector has magnitude of
385:51 - 1 we call that a unit
385:54 - vector a unit vector has
385:58 - magnitude of
386:02 - one
386:05 - in fact there are some special unit
386:07 - vectors that we are
386:08 - particularly interested in
386:12 - we call these the standard
386:16 - unit vectors
386:21 - there are two standard unit vectors that
386:23 - we're going to talk about in this video
386:25 - and there's a third one that we're going
386:27 - to talk about in the next video
386:29 - the first vector is vector i
386:32 - which has an x component of 1 and the
386:35 - other component is 0.
386:40 - other one is j j
386:43 - has an x component of zero and a y
386:46 - component of one
386:49 - basically i is a horizontal vector
386:53 - with magnitude of one and j is a
386:56 - vertical vector
386:58 - of magnitude of one and what's important
387:01 - is the vectors i and j
387:02 - meet at a ninety degree angle
387:08 - because we have these two special
387:09 - vectors i and j that are universally
387:12 - accepted
387:13 - we can write our vectors
387:17 - can be written
387:22 - as a linear
387:25 - combination
387:32 - of i and
387:36 - j vectors
387:44 - whatever i is multiplied by represents
387:46 - the x component
387:48 - and whatever j is multiplied by
387:50 - represents
387:51 - the y component
387:54 - so for example we talked about this
387:57 - vector an earlier example of negative 5
387:59 - comma 4.
388:02 - this same vector could be expressed as
388:04 - standard unit vectors
388:06 - as negative 5 times the i vector
388:10 - because negative 5 is the x component
388:14 - plus 4 times the j vector
388:17 - which represents the y component
388:22 - another example would be the vector
388:25 - 2 comma negative 1.
388:28 - because 2 is the x component we could
388:30 - write that as 2i
388:33 - and negative 1 being the y component can
388:36 - be written as negative
388:38 - j
388:44 - this even gives us a way to write
388:46 - vectors that have zero for one of the
388:48 - components
388:49 - maybe zero comma three
388:53 - there's zero i components but there are
388:56 - three j vectors combined together
389:04 - similarly negative 2 comma 0 would just
389:08 - use
389:08 - the x component so we have negative 2
389:12 - i
389:16 - so in this way every vector could
389:18 - actually be represented in two different
389:20 - ways it can be represented
389:22 - as standard unit vectors or it can be
389:25 - represented
389:26 - as a component vector
389:31 - as we go through this video we're going
389:32 - to express the vectors in both
389:34 - ways so we get used to seeing them both
389:36 - ways
389:37 - but make sure as you're working on the
389:39 - assignments and ultimately quizzes and
389:41 - tests you take the time
389:42 - to be aware of what format the
389:44 - question's asking you to express the
389:46 - answer in
389:49 - all right now that we've taken the time
389:50 - to define vectors
389:52 - let's see if we can do a little bit of
389:54 - work with vectors working with vectors
389:58 - it's really what we're going to do this
390:00 - entire chapter
390:02 - but looking at some basic operations
390:04 - with vectors
390:05 - one thing we can do with vectors is we
390:07 - can combine
390:08 - them together
390:12 - we can combine vectors
390:19 - let's say vector v is equal to
390:22 - x1 y1
390:26 - and vector w
390:31 - is equal to x2 y2
390:39 - two operations that are very common with
390:41 - vectors one is called
390:43 - scalar multiplication
390:51 - and this is the idea if k is just a
390:53 - number
390:55 - and we wanted to multiply it times the
390:57 - vector
390:59 - v what that really means is take vector
391:02 - v
391:02 - which had an x component of x 1 and
391:05 - multiply
391:06 - the x component by the k and multiply
391:09 - the y
391:10 - component by the k
391:13 - it kind of feels like we're distributing
391:15 - as we multiply by the scalar or multiply
391:18 - by the number
391:18 - k
391:22 - vectors can also be combined with other
391:24 - vectors though
391:25 - with what is called vector addition
391:32 - where we end up with vector v plus
391:35 - vector w
391:39 - and when we add vectors together what
391:41 - that really means we want to do
391:43 - is add their components together x1 plus
391:47 - x2 to get the new x component
391:51 - y1 plus y2 to get the new y component
391:56 - and similarly using the idea of an
391:58 - inverse we could also do vector
392:00 - subtraction
392:01 - where we subtract the components and so
392:03 - we end up with addition and subtraction
392:04 - of vectors
392:06 - and also a multiplication by a scalar
392:10 - in future videos we'll take a look at
392:11 - how we can multiply a vector times a
392:13 - vector there's actually two different
392:15 - ways to do that
392:16 - depending on what we're looking for
392:18 - specifically
392:19 - so for now we'll stick with vector
392:21 - addition and scalar multiplication
392:26 - so let's let
392:31 - the vector a be the vector seven comma
392:34 - one
392:36 - and the vector b
392:40 - is going to have an initial point
392:47 - of 3 comma 2
392:50 - and terminal point
392:57 - of negative 1 comma negative 1.
393:03 - i'm going to pause here because before
393:05 - we get too
393:06 - far before we can do any linear
393:08 - combinations of vectors
393:10 - with each other we need to know what
393:12 - vector b actually is in component form
393:16 - so we already know vector a is 7 comma
393:18 - 1.
393:20 - to get vector b we need to subtract the
393:23 - terminal point
393:24 - minus the initial point so for the x
393:27 - component
393:28 - negative one minus three is negative
393:30 - four
393:32 - comma negative one minus two is negative
393:34 - three
393:38 - so we have these two vectors
393:45 - first problem we're going to attempt to
393:47 - solve is figure out what
393:48 - negative 2 times vector a is
393:55 - this is scalar multiplication because
393:58 - we're multiplying by a scalar or a
393:59 - constant
394:00 - negative two times vector a which is
394:03 - seven one
394:05 - and similar to distributing we end up
394:07 - with the vector negative 14
394:10 - negative 2 or if you prefer
394:14 - an i j form negative 14
394:17 - i minus 2 j
394:25 - let's look at vector a plus vector b
394:32 - here we're adding two vectors together
394:35 - vector a
394:36 - is seven comma one plus vector b is
394:39 - negative
394:39 - four negative three and for vector
394:43 - addition we just add the individual
394:46 - components
394:47 - together seven minus
394:50 - four is three
394:54 - and one plus negative three
394:57 - is negative two
395:00 - and in component form our sum is 3
395:03 - negative 2
395:04 - with i j we have 3i minus 2
395:08 - j
395:14 - let's subtract the vectors a minus b
395:21 - well vector a is seven one minus vector
395:24 - b
395:25 - which is negative four negative three
395:29 - subtracting component by component seven
395:32 - minus a negative four
395:34 - becomes eleven one minus a negative
395:37 - three
395:38 - becomes four
395:41 - and we have our component form of a
395:43 - minus b
395:45 - which is equal to 11 i
395:49 - plus 4 j we want to make sure
395:53 - we always have that vector notation
395:56 - above i and j
396:01 - one last one of these let's find
396:04 - 3a minus 4b
396:11 - to do this we have three times the a
396:14 - vector
396:17 - the a vector is seven comma one
396:22 - minus four times the b vector negative
396:24 - four
396:25 - comma negative three
396:28 - well when we do that operation initially
396:30 - we have scalar multiplication
396:33 - which gives us 21 comma 3
396:38 - plus i'm going to go ahead and take that
396:40 - negative in
396:41 - negative 4 times negative 4 is 16
396:44 - negative 4 times negative 3 is 12
396:48 - and now we're ready to add these vectors
396:50 - together 21 plus 16 is 37
396:55 - 3 plus 12 is 15
396:58 - and we have our component form solution
397:00 - which is equal to 37
397:02 - i plus 15
397:08 - j
397:10 - and in this way you can see how we can
397:11 - do lots of different combinations
397:13 - of our a and b vectors
397:23 - another thing we can do with vectors is
397:26 - we can find
397:27 - a described vector
397:31 - using our trig properties
397:37 - and to kind of set this up we'll think
397:39 - about the fact
397:41 - that if i have a vector v
397:47 - the x coordinate of that vector
397:50 - using trig we're used to saying that x
397:52 - coordinate is the cosine of the theta
397:54 - angle that is formed
397:58 - and the y coordinate is the sine of
398:01 - theta
398:03 - but that comes off the unit circle
398:07 - if the vector is not a unit vector we
398:09 - need to multiply
398:11 - by the magnitude of the vector
398:18 - so we have the magnitude of the vector
398:20 - times cosine gives the x component
398:23 - and the magnitude of the vector times
398:25 - sine
398:26 - gives the y component
398:29 - and in this way we can now find the
398:32 - vector
398:37 - with magnitude
398:42 - 10 that forms
398:46 - a 120 degree angle
398:58 - because the x component
399:02 - is the magnitude of 10
399:05 - times the cosine of the angle
399:09 - and the y component is the magnitude of
399:13 - 10
399:14 - times the sine of the angle
399:18 - magnitude of 10 sorry well we need to
399:22 - know what the sine and cosine
399:23 - of 120 is so if we draw our little unit
399:26 - circle on here
399:28 - 120 degree angle
399:35 - is right up here it's the same as
399:38 - 2 pi over 3.
399:42 - so the x coordinate is negative
399:45 - one half and the y coordinates root
399:47 - three over two
399:51 - so ten cosine of one twenty would be ten
399:54 - times the x coordinate of negative one
399:56 - half
399:59 - our x components negative five
400:02 - for the y coordinate the sine of 120 is
400:04 - the y coordinate
400:07 - of root three over two which gives us
400:10 - 5 root 3
400:14 - and so for our final vector
400:17 - that has a magnitude of 10 and is going
400:19 - to form 120 degree angle
400:21 - it's going to be negative 5 comma 5 root
400:24 - 3.
400:26 - or negative 5 i plus 5
400:29 - root 3 j
400:38 - let's try one more and do this next one
400:40 - in radians instead of degrees
400:44 - let's find a vector
400:50 - with magnitude
400:55 - for
400:59 - forming
401:02 - a seven pi over four angle
401:10 - if i think about my unit circle
401:14 - 7 pi over 4 is down here
401:19 - with coordinates root 2 over two comma
401:22 - negative root two
401:23 - over two
401:26 - so when we want the x component it's the
401:29 - magnitude of four
401:31 - times the cosine of seven pi over four
401:37 - which is 4 times cosine the x
401:40 - coordinate root 2 over 2
401:43 - or 2 root 2.
401:49 - to get the y component exactly the same
401:51 - we're just going to take the sine
401:53 - instead of 7 pi over 4
401:56 - which is 4 times negative root 2 over 2
402:00 - which gives us negative 2 root 2.
402:05 - and so our vector with magnitude of 4
402:07 - that forms a 7 pi over 4
402:09 - angle is 2 root 2 comma negative 2 root
402:13 - 2
402:14 - in component form or in terms of i and j
402:18 - it's going to be 2 root 2 i
402:22 - minus 2 root 2
402:25 - j
402:31 - so trig can be very helpful as we work
402:33 - with vectors we're going to do quite a
402:34 - bit of trig
402:35 - as we do different angles with vectors
402:37 - throughout this course
402:38 - but i want to do one other thing with
402:40 - vectors as we finish out our
402:42 - introduction to vectors
402:46 - and that is looking at this concept of
402:49 - finding
402:52 - unit vectors
402:56 - in the same direction
403:04 - and the trick here to get a unit vector
403:07 - is we're going to use a scalar
403:12 - multiplication
403:15 - basically we want to divide the vector
403:19 - down so it just has a magnitude of one
403:23 - so its magnitude is currently eight we
403:25 - need to divide by eight
403:27 - if its magnitude is 12 we need to divide
403:29 - by 12.
403:30 - we are going to take 1 over the
403:33 - magnitude of the vector
403:36 - times the vector to give us a unit
403:40 - vector
403:41 - in the same direction
403:45 - so for example let's say we've got the
403:49 - vector v
403:51 - is equal to 9 comma 2
403:54 - and we want to find
403:57 - a unit vector
404:01 - in the same
404:08 - direction
404:10 - well first we need to know the magnitude
404:12 - of the vector so we know how much we
404:14 - have to shrink it by
404:16 - the magnitude is the square root of the
404:19 - x component
404:20 - plus the y component squared each
404:24 - so here we end up with the square root
404:26 - of 85
404:29 - as the magnitude
404:32 - which means we can take 1 over the
404:34 - square root of 85
404:36 - times the vector
404:40 - which will keep the vector going in the
404:41 - same direction but it will shrink its
404:43 - magnitude down
404:44 - so it's a unit vector this gives us our
404:48 - new vector of
404:49 - 9 over the square root of 85
404:53 - comma 2 over the square root of 85
404:57 - or if you prefer 9 over the square root
405:00 - of 85
405:01 - i plus 2 over the square root of 85
405:07 - j
405:11 - that is a unit vector in the same
405:14 - direction as the original vector 9
405:16 - 2 by multiplying by the reciprocal
405:22 - of the magnitude
405:26 - one nice thing about knowing the
405:29 - unit vector is it makes it very easy
405:32 - to get a vector of any size
405:36 - in the same direction to get a vector
405:45 - of magnitude
405:49 - k
405:55 - in the same direction
406:04 - we not only take one over the magnitude
406:08 - of the vector
406:10 - times the vector but we're also going to
406:14 - multiply by our desired
406:16 - magnitude of k
406:20 - so for example
406:23 - if we want a vector let's stick with 9 2
406:32 - we're going to find a vector
406:38 - in the same direction
406:43 - but instead of a unit vector we want it
406:46 - to be
406:46 - of magnitude
406:51 - five
406:55 - well we already found out in the
406:57 - previous example that the magnitude of
406:59 - the vector
407:00 - is equal to the square root of 85.
407:04 - we want to get a magnitude of 5 so we're
407:07 - not only going to divide by the square
407:08 - root of 85 but we're also going to
407:10 - multiply by
407:11 - 5 and we use that as our scalar
407:16 - times the vector 9 2.
407:20 - and that gives us 45 over the square
407:23 - root of 85
407:25 - for the x component comma 10
407:28 - over the square root of 85
407:31 - for the y component or in terms of i and
407:35 - j
407:37 - 45 over root 85 i
407:42 - plus 10 over root 85
407:46 - j and that now is a vector of the
407:51 - same direction but now with magnitude
407:55 - 5.
407:59 - we haven't really done any calculus yet
408:01 - we've just been kind of exploring with
408:03 - this concept of a vector
408:05 - using scalar multiplication vector
408:08 - addition
408:10 - i k j vectors calculating the magnitude
408:12 - of a vector
408:14 - so it's been a really brief overview of
408:16 - vectors
408:17 - in the plane two-dimensional vectors but
408:20 - it's really important we're comfortable
408:22 - with these before we get to
408:23 - too many complex topics that these are
408:25 - built on so i want you to spend a day
408:28 - practicing with these vectors on the
408:29 - homework assignment we'll talk about
408:31 - them more in class and answer any
408:33 - questions
408:34 - that you may have
408:39 - now that we've taken a look at how
408:40 - vectors work in two space we're ready to
408:43 - answer the question
408:44 - about how do vectors
408:50 - work in
408:53 - three d in three dimensions in space
408:57 - but before we do that let's take a quick
409:00 - look at
409:00 - 3d graphing because we do not have as
409:03 - much experience with 3d graphing
409:05 - as we do with 2d graphing and we can
409:08 - think about 3d graphing
409:10 - as graphing in space where it's kind of
409:13 - like the corner in a house
409:15 - where one wall coming out becomes your
409:18 - x-axis
409:19 - the other wall coming out becomes your
409:20 - y-axis
409:22 - uh intersecting with the floor and then
409:24 - coming up vertically
409:26 - is what we will call the z-axis and in
409:28 - this way
409:29 - we end up with our x y z space and
409:34 - you can also go negative y and negative
409:37 - x
409:37 - and negative z so we get the origin is
409:40 - just kind of a
409:40 - fixed point out in
409:44 - space and so then if
409:47 - we were asked to actually sketch a point
409:52 - let's sketch the point
409:55 - one comma two comma three
409:59 - this becomes quite a tricky task to do
410:02 - in two dimensions but we'll do the best
410:05 - we can here
410:06 - uh we'll have our z-axis our y-axis and
410:10 - the x-axis
410:11 - forming the corner of the house and we
410:14 - can almost
410:16 - think about these as counting out on the
410:18 - y-axis one two three
410:21 - counting out on the x-axis one
410:24 - two three and on the z-axis
410:27 - one two three
410:32 - and it might be easier to kind of
410:33 - visualize where the point one two three
410:35 - is if we graph a three-dimensional box
410:38 - that sits in this corner where the box
410:40 - has dimensions of one by
410:42 - two by three so the box is gonna have a
410:44 - dimension of
410:45 - one down the x-axis two
410:49 - across the y-axis
410:53 - so we kind of end up with this
410:59 - shape and then vertically we're going to
411:01 - go up
411:02 - three units
411:06 - and so you almost end up with this three
411:08 - dimensional box
411:15 - sitting in the corner and that
411:18 - front corner closest to us becomes the
411:21 - point
411:22 - one two three because it goes a distance
411:24 - of one
411:26 - down the x-axis a distance of two down
411:29 - the y-axis and then vertically
411:30 - up a distance of three and so that's
411:33 - kind of how we can
411:34 - sketch a point in three dimensions
411:39 - and where we're ultimately going is from
411:41 - the origin
411:42 - we're going to have a vector that goes
411:44 - out to that point
411:45 - diagonally across the box
411:49 - but before we can get to that idea of
411:51 - vectors which have direction
411:53 - and magnitude to calculate the magnitude
411:57 - we need to know how
411:58 - distance
412:04 - works in three dimensions
412:08 - now in two dimensions we're familiar
412:11 - with the pythagorean theorem so we could
412:13 - take the x-coordinate
412:15 - squared plus the y-coordinate squared
412:18 - and take the square root to get that
412:20 - distance
412:22 - or the x distance squared plus the y
412:24 - distance squared
412:25 - the square root of that equals the
412:27 - distance we can extend
412:29 - that same logic out into three
412:31 - dimensions
412:32 - so that the distance is the square root
412:34 - of the x distance
412:35 - squared plus the y distance squared
412:38 - plus the z distance squared
412:43 - so a really quick example of that
412:48 - would be to find the distance
412:52 - between
412:55 - the point one comma negative five
412:58 - comma four and the point
413:02 - 4 comma negative 1 comma negative 1.
413:07 - well if we look at our x's the distance
413:10 - the x's
413:11 - travel from 1 to 4 that's a distance of
413:14 - 3
413:14 - when we subtract them when we look at
413:17 - our y's the distance the y's travel from
413:20 - negative 5
413:21 - to negative 1 that's a distance of
413:24 - 4. and the z's traveling from 4 to
413:28 - negative 1
413:30 - they cover a distance of 5 when we
413:33 - subtract those points
413:35 - so then using our distance formula the
413:37 - distance between them is the square root
413:39 - of the x distance
413:41 - 3 squared
413:45 - plus the y distance
413:48 - squared
413:51 - plus the z distance
413:54 - squared which gives us the square root
413:58 - of 9 plus 16
413:59 - plus 25 which is the square root
414:03 - of 50. and if we want to simplify that
414:07 - that's 5 root 2.
414:11 - so distance the pythagorean theorem in
414:13 - three dimensions works very much the
414:14 - same as
414:16 - it does in two dimensions we just add
414:18 - the extra z squared
414:20 - to our distance formula
414:23 - all right that was a very brief
414:25 - introduction to graphing in 3d
414:27 - because our main interest is not
414:29 - graphing in 3d our main interest
414:32 - is in 3d vectors that go through the
414:35 - space
414:36 - and basically 3d vectors are very
414:38 - similar to 2d vectors we just have to
414:41 - add the third
414:44 - component
414:48 - to get x y z
414:55 - or we could add
415:00 - a third unit vector
415:08 - which is the vector k in our i j
415:11 - k vectors where k is equal to the vector
415:14 - 0 0 1 giving us one unit in the z
415:18 - direction so for example
415:23 - we could have the vector v
415:27 - could be equal to 1 negative 2
415:30 - 3. and in terms of i j
415:33 - k vectors then that would be i minus 2
415:38 - j plus 3 k
415:43 - or if i had the vector u equal to 0
415:48 - 1 negative 2.
415:52 - because 0 is the i vector we don't
415:54 - really have an i so we just have 1j
415:57 - minus 2 k
416:02 - and that tells us that this is a vector
416:04 - that goes from the origin
416:06 - diagonally to those points either 1
416:09 - negative 2
416:10 - 3 or 0 1 negative 2.
416:17 - let's see if we can find
416:20 - a vector
416:25 - with initial point
416:32 - of 3 8 2
416:36 - and terminal point
416:44 - of 2 negative 1 3.
416:51 - well our vector we know from
416:54 - two-dimensional vectors that we can take
416:56 - the terminal point and subtract the
416:58 - initial point and that'll give us the
416:59 - distance that vector's traveling
417:01 - so looking at the x component 2 minus 3
417:04 - gives us negative 1
417:06 - looking at the y component negative 1
417:08 - minus 8 gives us negative 9
417:11 - and looking at the z components 3 minus
417:13 - 2 is equal to a positive 1
417:16 - or if we prefer we could say that's
417:18 - negative i
417:20 - minus 9 j plus a single
417:24 - k and this is that same vector
417:29 - and what's nice about vectors in three
417:32 - space
417:33 - once we're comfortable with vectors in
417:35 - two space
417:37 - is that we can do
417:42 - all the same operations
417:51 - from those two d vectors
417:54 - that we worked with in the prior video
418:00 - so for example
418:06 - if vector v is equal to negative one
418:10 - four three
418:13 - and vector w is equal to two comma zero
418:17 - comma negative three
418:21 - we could do things like find 2v
418:26 - minus 3w
418:30 - scalar multiplication and vector
418:32 - addition or subtraction
418:34 - 2 and 3 are scalars that's just 2 times
418:36 - the v vector of negative 1
418:38 - 4 3 and then a negative 3
418:42 - times the vector w of 2 0
418:45 - negative 3. so when we multiply those
418:48 - scalars through because multiplication
418:50 - comes first in order of
418:52 - operations we get negative 2 8
418:55 - 6 plus let's take the negative through
418:59 - negative 6 0 9
419:02 - when those are multiplied through and
419:04 - finally vector addition
419:06 - adds those together to get negative 2
419:09 - plus negative 6 is negative 8
419:11 - comma 8 plus 0 comma
419:15 - 15. or if we do those as i j
419:19 - k's we have negative 8 i plus 8
419:22 - j plus 15 k
419:31 - let's keep with these same two vectors
419:33 - and let's find
419:35 - the magnitude of vector v
419:40 - well magnitude is just the distance
419:42 - formula where we take the square root of
419:45 - the x
419:45 - component squared plus the y component
419:48 - squared
419:49 - plus the z component squared it's that
419:51 - pythagorean theorem we saw earlier
419:53 - so vector v negative 1 squared is 1
419:57 - plus 4 squared is 16 plus 3 squared is
420:01 - 9 and we end up with the square root of
420:04 - 26
420:05 - is the magnitude or size of vector v
420:11 - and once we know the magnitude we're
420:13 - ready to find a
420:14 - unit vector
420:18 - in the direction
420:24 - of v
420:27 - and just like with two dimensional
420:28 - vectors to make a vector into a unit
420:31 - vector in the same direction we scale or
420:33 - multiply
420:34 - by the reciprocal
420:38 - 1 over the square root of 26
420:41 - the reciprocal of the magnitude times
420:44 - the vector v
420:45 - negative 1 4 3
420:48 - which gives us the vector negative 1
420:51 - over the square root of 26
420:54 - 4 over the square root of 26
420:58 - 3 over the square root of 26
421:02 - or if we prefer with i j k vectors
421:05 - negative 1
421:06 - over the square root of 26 i
421:10 - plus 4 over the square root of 26 j
421:14 - plus 3 over the square root of 26
421:18 - k
421:21 - so as you can see working with vectors
421:23 - in 3d is very similar to working with
421:25 - vectors in two dimensions
421:28 - there's an extra component to work with
421:30 - but we follow the exact same patterns
421:32 - so i'll give you a chance to practice
421:34 - some of these on your own
421:36 - take a look at them and we will answer
421:38 - any questions you have
421:39 - in class
421:44 - working with vectors we discussed how we
421:45 - can add and subtract vectors together
421:48 - we did a multiplication with vectors
421:50 - called scalar multiplication where we
421:52 - multiplied a constant or a scalar by a
421:54 - vector
421:55 - but we haven't talked about how we can
421:56 - multiply two vectors together
421:59 - there's actually two different ways to
422:01 - multiply vectors together and so we
422:03 - specify the difference
422:05 - by not calling it multiplication but we
422:07 - call them a
422:08 - dot product and a cross product the
422:11 - difference is
422:12 - one gives us a scalar as a product
422:15 - and one gives us a vector as a product
422:18 - and they both have different uses
422:20 - depending on what we're trying to
422:21 - accomplish
422:22 - in this video we're going to look at the
422:24 - dot product as we answer the question
422:28 - how do we multiply
422:36 - vectors
422:40 - to get a scalar
422:45 - or a constant in other words when we
422:47 - multiply these vectors together using
422:49 - the dot product the answer is going to
422:52 - be a scalar
422:53 - not a vector so let's define
422:56 - this dot product
423:01 - let's say we've got a vector u and that
423:05 - vector u
423:06 - is x1 y1
423:10 - z1 and there's another vector v
423:15 - that's going to be our second vector so
423:17 - we'll call it x2
423:19 - y2 z2 as its components
423:24 - the way we define the product u
423:28 - dot v the dot product
423:31 - is we're going to multiply the
423:33 - components together
423:36 - and add the products so we'll take the x
423:39 - coordinates
423:39 - and multiply them together x1
423:44 - x2 plus
423:46 - then we take the y components and
423:49 - multiply them together
423:51 - y1 times y2
423:55 - plus and then we take the z components
423:58 - and multiply them together z1
424:01 - times z2 and when we add those together
424:04 - we'll get some
424:05 - scalar so this is just a new operation
424:10 - we really just need to do a little bit
424:11 - of practice with
424:12 - to learn and then we'll talk about how
424:14 - it's useful to us when talking about
424:17 - vectors so for an example here we're
424:20 - going to do
424:21 - vector u is equal to 2
424:25 - 9 negative 1. and
424:28 - vector v is equal to negative 3
424:32 - 1 negative 4 and we're going to
424:36 - calculate
424:37 - u dot v
424:42 - well to do u dot v we're just going to
424:44 - multiply the common components together
424:46 - we take the x's 2 times negative 3 is
424:49 - negative 6.
424:53 - then we take the y's nine times
424:56 - one is a positive nine
425:00 - and then we take the z's negative one
425:03 - times negative four
425:04 - is a positive four
425:07 - and when we add those together negative
425:09 - six plus nine
425:10 - plus four we get seven so our dot
425:14 - product
425:15 - of u and v is equal to seven
425:21 - let's try one more example let's say
425:23 - vector u
425:24 - is equal to three i plus
425:28 - five j plus two k
425:33 - and vector v is equal to negative
425:36 - i plus 3k
425:41 - if we want the dot product u dot
425:44 - v we'll start by multiplying the
425:49 - i components together three times
425:52 - negative one
425:53 - is negative three the j
425:57 - components together five times
426:00 - and you notice there's no j component on
426:02 - v
426:03 - since there's no j component that really
426:05 - means there's 0
426:06 - j's so 5 times 0 is
426:10 - plus 0. and finally
426:13 - on the k's 2 times 3
426:16 - is a positive 6 and so when we add those
426:20 - together
426:21 - we end up with three
426:26 - and that's the dot product it's a very
426:28 - simple straightforward multiplication of
426:30 - vectors where we multiply the components
426:32 - together
426:33 - and add the individual products
426:36 - what is this useful for though
426:40 - well one common use of the dot product
426:43 - is the dot product can be used to tell
426:46 - us
426:47 - the angle between
426:50 - two vectors
426:55 - we have an important formula that says
426:57 - that the cosine
426:59 - of the angle between the vectors
427:02 - is equal to u dot
427:05 - v divided by the magnitude of u
427:10 - times the magnitude of v
427:14 - this is going to be an important formula
427:16 - for us to know
427:18 - you'll probably have it memorized by the
427:20 - time you finish the homework assignment
427:22 - because we use it a lot as we try and
427:25 - find the angle
427:26 - between two vectors
427:31 - so let's do some examples
427:36 - where we find the angle
427:41 - between two vectors
427:49 - let's start with the vector a
427:52 - is equal to one to zero
427:56 - and b is the vector 2
428:00 - 4 1.
428:04 - i like to find the individual pieces of
428:07 - the formula
428:08 - before i plug them in just makes a
428:10 - little more straight forward
428:11 - so let's find the numerator first the a
428:14 - dot b
428:15 - which is going to be 1 times 2 is 2
428:18 - plus 2 times 4 is 8 plus 0 times 1 is 0.
428:23 - so a dot b is ten
428:28 - next we need the magnitude of both
428:30 - vectors so the magnitude of
428:32 - a is the square root
428:35 - of one squared plus two squared plus 0
428:39 - squared
428:40 - or the square root of 5.
428:44 - we also need to know the magnitude of
428:47 - vector
428:47 - b vector b is the square root of 2
428:52 - squared
428:53 - plus 4 squared plus 1 squared which is
428:56 - the square root of 21.
429:02 - now we put it all together and know that
429:05 - the
429:05 - cosine of the angle between the vectors
429:09 - is the dot product 10
429:12 - divided by the product of the magnitudes
429:15 - and we multiply square roots we multiply
429:18 - underneath
429:18 - five times twenty one now we just go to
429:22 - our calculator to figure out what the
429:24 - cosine inverse of that fraction is and
429:26 - we can type it in just like it is
429:30 - cosine inverse of 10
429:33 - divided by the square root of
429:36 - 5 times 21.
429:41 - make sure we close the parenthesis on
429:42 - the cosine inverse
429:44 - and this tells us that the angle is
429:46 - about point 22
429:48 - radians
429:52 - so theta is equal to 0.22
429:56 - radians
430:01 - let's do one more example
430:06 - finding the angle between
430:09 - let's say a is equal to
430:13 - i minus 2 j plus
430:16 - k and
430:20 - b is the vector i
430:24 - plus j minus 2k again i'm going to find
430:32 - the pieces of the formula first and then
430:34 - we'll go to the formula first we need to
430:36 - know what
430:37 - a dot b is
430:41 - 1 times 1 is 1 negative 2 times 1 is
430:45 - negative 2
430:46 - and 1 times negative 2 is negative 2
430:49 - gives us a total of negative 3 for the
430:51 - dot product
430:54 - then we need the magnitudes the
430:56 - magnitude of a
430:57 - is the square root of one plus four plus
431:00 - one
431:01 - or the square root of six
431:05 - the magnitude of b is the square root of
431:08 - one
431:08 - plus one plus four which is also the
431:12 - square root of six
431:15 - and so when we put that all together we
431:18 - know the cosine of theta
431:20 - is equal to the dot product negative 3
431:25 - over the square root of six times six
431:30 - which is actually thirty-six
431:34 - and the square root of thirty-six is six
431:36 - which means this reduces to negative
431:38 - one-half
431:41 - well here we don't have to go to the
431:42 - calculator because negative one-half is
431:44 - one of our key points on the unit circle
431:47 - the x-coordinate is negative one-half
431:55 - at the point two pi
431:58 - over three so theta
432:01 - must equal two pi
432:06 - over three this is our angle
432:09 - between the vectors
432:14 - as we're discussing the angle between
432:17 - vectors
432:18 - one important relationship comes out of
432:20 - this
432:21 - we'll go ahead and call this number
432:24 - three
432:25 - and it's this concept of what are called
432:28 - orthogonal
432:31 - vectors and orthogonal is just a big
432:35 - fancy word that means perpendicular or
432:38 - right angles
432:42 - basically two vectors that meet at a
432:45 - right angle
432:46 - and to set this up let's say if u
432:49 - dot v turned out to be zero
432:57 - then as we're trying to find the angle
432:59 - between the vectors we would say the
433:01 - cosine of theta
433:03 - is equal to the dot product divided by
433:05 - the magnitude of u
433:08 - times the magnitude of v
433:11 - but zero divided by anything is zero
433:14 - and we know from our unit circle
433:18 - that the x coordinate is 0 at pi over 2
433:22 - so therefore the angle theta
433:25 - is pi over 2. we have a right angle
433:29 - formed between these two vectors
433:33 - those vectors are orthogonal if
433:36 - u dot v
433:42 - is equal to zero
433:46 - the vectors are
433:49 - orthogonal
433:57 - so that can save us a little bit of work
433:59 - if we end up with orthogonal vectors
434:02 - if i asked you to find the angle
434:09 - between vector p which is at 1
434:13 - 0 5
434:17 - and vector q which is at
434:20 - 10 3 negative 2.
434:26 - we would start going through that same
434:28 - process that we had before we
434:30 - would first find the dot product p dot q
434:34 - and then we'd find the magnitudes and
434:36 - set up our formula
434:37 - but look what happens when we do p dot q
434:40 - we end up with 10
434:41 - plus zero
434:45 - minus 10 to give us a dot product of
434:48 - 0. as soon as i see that dot product is
434:52 - 0
434:53 - i know the vectors are orthogonal
434:59 - which means the angle between them has
435:01 - to be pi
435:03 - over 2 and i can stop there saves us a
435:06 - little bit of time
435:09 - in fact we can even go a step further
435:14 - and we can find components to make
435:16 - vectors
435:17 - orthogonal we can find maybe an
435:21 - x so that vector p
435:25 - equal to 2 8 negative 1
435:31 - and vector q equal to
435:34 - some missing component x negative 1
435:37 - 2 such that
435:40 - those two vectors are orthogonal
435:48 - well if i want these vectors to be
435:50 - orthogonal p
435:52 - dot q has to equal 0.
435:57 - so let's calculate p dot q multiplying
436:00 - the x components we get 2x
436:03 - the y components negative 8 the z
436:06 - components negative 2 and to be
436:09 - orthogonal that has to equal
436:11 - 0. well this is a real simple algebra
436:15 - equation by adding 10 to both sides and
436:17 - dividing by
436:18 - 2 we find out if that first coordinate
436:21 - is a 5
436:23 - p and q will be orthogonal
436:27 - vectors
436:30 - so in this video we've taken a quick
436:32 - look at the dot
436:34 - product the dot product is a way to
436:36 - multiply two vectors together to end up
436:38 - with a scalar
436:39 - and that dot product is commonly used to
436:42 - find
436:43 - the angle between two vectors
436:46 - go ahead and take a look at the homework
436:48 - assignment to practice these
436:50 - and then in our next video we'll take a
436:51 - look at how we can multiply vectors
436:53 - together
436:54 - to get a vector we'll see in class
437:01 - the second type of multiplying vectors
437:05 - is called the cross product and the
437:06 - cross product has a very specific
437:08 - purpose
437:09 - it's to answer the question how
437:13 - do we find
437:17 - a vector
437:20 - orthogonal
437:28 - to two vectors
437:37 - and as i said the answer to this is the
437:39 - cross product
437:40 - it's a product where we multiply two
437:43 - vectors
437:44 - together and end up with a another
437:47 - vector that is orthogonal or
437:49 - perpendicular to the other
437:51 - two vectors
437:56 - in fact let's write that down always
438:00 - orthogonal
438:06 - to the other two
438:12 - vectors
438:16 - and unlike the dot product the cross
438:17 - product only works in three dimensions
438:20 - so let's say i've got
438:21 - a vector u that has component form of a
438:26 - b c and another vector v
438:31 - that has component form d e
438:34 - f if i want to calculate the cross
438:38 - product of u crossed with v
438:43 - the way we calculate that is we take b f
438:47 - minus c e to get the x component
438:51 - c d minus a f
438:54 - to get the y component and ae
438:58 - minus bd to get the z component
439:02 - now while this technically is the
439:04 - formula for the cross product and if you
439:07 - really like
439:08 - memorizing formulas you can memorize
439:10 - this formula
439:11 - i find it very difficult to memorize the
439:15 - cross product formula
439:17 - so instead i look at a thing that comes
439:19 - from linear algebra that's quite simple
439:21 - called the determinant
439:27 - and here we're not going to go into
439:28 - detail with the determinant we're just
439:30 - going to look at how a determinant works
439:32 - with what's called the 2 by 2 matrix if
439:35 - i want the determinant
439:37 - of a b c d
439:42 - the way the determinant is calculated
439:45 - is we take the first diagonal
439:48 - a d and we subtract
439:54 - the second diagonal cb
439:57 - or actually let's put it alphabetically
439:59 - let's call it bc
440:02 - and if i can remember this pattern of
440:04 - multiplying one diagonal and subtracting
440:06 - the other diagonal
440:07 - it's actually really easy to
440:10 - find the cross product
440:17 - the cross product
440:22 - is the determinant
440:29 - of the other rows
440:36 - actually overcome other columns
440:43 - with a little caveat that the middle
440:46 - component we do backwards
440:54 - here's what i mean by that
440:57 - let's say we'll take the same u and v
441:00 - vectors and put them on top of each
441:03 - other
441:03 - u is a b
441:06 - c and v
441:14 - we said was d e
441:17 - f
441:21 - to combine these to get u crossed with v
441:28 - first we look at the x component when we
441:31 - do the x component we ignore the x
441:33 - column and find the determinant of
441:35 - what's left which is
441:37 - b f
441:40 - minus the other diagonal c e
441:46 - then when we do the middle component we
441:48 - ignore the middle column
441:52 - and the middle works backwards so we're
441:53 - going to do the backwards diagonal first
441:55 - so we're going to diagonal and do cd
442:00 - minus the af diagonal
442:07 - then for our third component we can
442:09 - ignore the third column
442:13 - and we've got ae
442:17 - minus bd
442:21 - and you notice that gives us the exact
442:22 - same formula we had up above
442:25 - that i highlighted in yellow but by
442:28 - using this determinant strategy we don't
442:30 - really have to memorize the formula we
442:32 - just have to remember
442:34 - ignore the column we're working on find
442:37 - the determinant
442:38 - in the middle works backwards
442:42 - so let's try a few examples
442:49 - let's say vector p is equal to
442:52 - 5 1 2
442:56 - and vector q is equal to
442:59 - negative 2 3 1.
443:04 - if i want to do p crossed with
443:08 - q
443:11 - we can take the 5 1
443:14 - 2 above and the negative 2
443:18 - 3 1 below
443:21 - and we can cross them
443:26 - for the first component
443:29 - we ignore the first column and we find
443:32 - the determinant
443:33 - 1 times 1 is 1. minus two times three is
443:37 - six
443:40 - for the second component we'll ignore
443:42 - the second column
443:43 - but we have to work backwards two times
443:46 - negative two is negative four
443:49 - five times one is five and we subtract
443:52 - so minus five and then for the third
443:55 - component we ignore the third column
443:59 - five times three is fifteen
444:02 - minus one times negative two is negative
444:05 - two so it becomes
444:06 - a plus two and when we put that all
444:10 - together we get our cross product
444:12 - which is negative five negative nine
444:16 - seventeen and what we've done is we have
444:20 - found
444:21 - a vector that is perpendicular
444:24 - orthogonal to both p and
444:27 - q vectors
444:31 - now here's an interesting question
444:32 - though with multiplication
444:35 - including the dot product order does not
444:38 - matter
444:39 - does order matter with the cross product
444:43 - let's take a look at it let's do b
444:46 - here and we're going to cross them in
444:48 - the opposite order we're going to do
444:50 - q crossed with p
444:55 - and when we do that now we've got the q
444:57 - vector first negative 2
445:00 - 3 1
445:03 - and the p vector second 5 1
445:07 - 2 and when we cross those
445:12 - let's see what we get ignoring the first
445:16 - column
445:16 - 3 times 2 is 6 minus 1 times 1 is 1
445:22 - comma ignoring the second column
445:25 - and working backwards in the middle one
445:27 - times five is
445:28 - five minus negative two times two
445:31 - is negative four so plus four
445:36 - comma ignoring the third column
445:39 - negative two times one is negative 2
445:42 - minus 3 times 5 is 15.
445:49 - and now what we end up with is 5
445:52 - 9 and negative
445:56 - 17.
446:01 - how does that compare with the answer we
446:03 - got before when we did peak.q
446:09 - notice every positive is negative and
446:11 - every negative is positive they are not
446:13 - the same but they're very similar
446:15 - because they're both perpendicular
446:16 - to our vectors they just need to go in
446:20 - opposite directions
446:29 - which kind of starts to lead to some
446:32 - properties of our cross product
446:34 - p cross q and q cross p are very similar
446:37 - they're just
446:38 - opposite directions let's list some
446:42 - properties
446:45 - of the cross product
446:51 - so first we'll do some general
446:53 - properties
446:59 - and we'll start with the one we just
447:01 - talked about
447:06 - that if we do u cross v
447:10 - that's going to be the opposite of v
447:13 - cross u
447:20 - another interesting thing about our
447:22 - properties is if you have a constant or
447:24 - a scalar that's multiplied by a vector
447:27 - it doesn't matter when or where you
447:28 - multiply that scalar
447:30 - you can take that scalar times the cross
447:33 - product of uv
447:36 - or we can do the scalar times u
447:41 - and then cross it with v
447:45 - or we can do the u
447:49 - crossed with the scalar times the v
447:52 - it doesn't matter where that scalar
447:54 - appears with the u
447:56 - with the v or in front of the cross
447:57 - product
448:01 - you'll get the same result either way
448:04 - another interesting result is if we take
448:06 - a vector and we cross it with the zero
448:08 - vector
448:09 - zero comma zero comma zero you can
448:12 - imagine the multiplication working out
448:14 - there you're ultimately doing a lot of
448:15 - multiplying by zero
448:17 - you end up with the zero vector the zero
448:20 - vector is just a vector filled with
448:22 - zeros
448:25 - and if we took a vector when we crossed
448:27 - it with itself
448:30 - if you imagine what's happening there is
448:33 - when we do
448:33 - that determinant step you're going to be
448:35 - subtracting the same thing that you
448:37 - multiplied
448:38 - and so you'll also end up with the zero
448:42 - vector
448:47 - so those are some general properties of
448:50 - the cross product some specific
448:52 - properties though
448:55 - with our ikj vectors
449:01 - that are interesting
449:04 - if i is crossed with j
449:09 - we end up with k
449:13 - and if j is crossed with k
449:18 - we end up with i
449:23 - and if k is crossed with
449:26 - i we end up with j
449:31 - so it kind of looks like if we cross we
449:32 - just end up with the other vector
449:35 - but one thing we have to be careful of
449:37 - is with cross product the order matters
449:40 - that means if we were to actually
449:42 - calculate j
449:43 - crossed with i we can't just say it's
449:46 - the missing k
449:47 - it's actually the opposite of k
449:51 - and k crossed with j
449:54 - is the opposite of i
449:58 - and i crossed
450:01 - with k
450:04 - is the opposite of j
450:09 - so the order does matter there with
450:12 - those properties
450:15 - so let's see if we can use some of these
450:16 - properties to help us simplify
450:20 - some of our cross products let's leave
450:23 - those
450:24 - ijk properties on the screen
450:28 - as we go to number three using the
450:34 - properties
450:37 - let's take a look at doing 2i
450:41 - crossed with 3j and the answer crossed
450:45 - with
450:48 - j
450:53 - well one thing we know about scalars is
450:55 - we can pull those scalars out front
450:57 - and we still get the same result so
450:59 - we're really talking about is 6
451:02 - times i crossed with j
451:05 - crossed with j
451:11 - well we know that i j crosses to k
451:14 - so we have 6 k
451:17 - crossed with j
451:22 - we also know that k crossed with j
451:25 - notice that's backwards
451:29 - so we're going to get a negative out of
451:30 - it negative 6
451:32 - i and so we end up with our final
451:37 - solution using the property
451:38 - of negative 6 i
451:44 - let's do another one
451:47 - let's do i crossed with k
451:52 - cross that with k
451:56 - crossed with j
452:04 - well i k
452:07 - crosses to j
452:11 - and kj
452:15 - actually i k crosses to negative j
452:17 - because the order's backwards
452:19 - j k or k j cross to negative
452:26 - i well we know these
452:29 - scalars these negative scalars can pull
452:32 - out front so negative one times negative
452:34 - one is a positive one
452:36 - we're really just doing um
452:39 - j crossed with i
452:43 - and j crossed with i we know
452:47 - is negative k
452:53 - and so in this way we can simplify using
452:56 - some of our
452:57 - cross product properties rather than
452:58 - having to go through all the work
453:00 - of the determinant to find our final
453:03 - cross product
453:07 - that's what we're looking at today
453:08 - though is the cross product you can
453:10 - either memorize the formula or remember
453:12 - the cross product
453:13 - pattern remember the center is the
453:16 - opposite
453:17 - order but the other two follow that
453:19 - determinant pattern
453:20 - we'll take a look at these in class
453:22 - practice some of these on the homework
453:24 - and we'll answer your questions
453:25 - when we see you
453:30 - vectors provide us a great transition
453:32 - into talking about equations
453:34 - of surfaces in three-dimensional space
453:37 - we're going to start here in this
453:39 - section talking specifically about lines
453:41 - and planes so we're going to answer the
453:43 - question
453:47 - how do we
453:51 - find equations
453:57 - of lines
454:00 - and planes
454:03 - in space in 3d graphing
454:09 - and we'll start with the first one being
454:10 - the equation of a line and similar to
454:21 - how we do equations of lines in two
454:23 - space y equals mx plus b
454:26 - in three space we also get a slope
454:27 - intercept feel to a formula
454:31 - but we're going to set it up with
454:33 - vectors
454:34 - we're going to let r naught
454:38 - be a vector we're going to call it
454:42 - x naught y naught
454:45 - z naught be a vector
454:52 - to a point
454:56 - on the line
455:02 - we're going to let v
455:06 - which is going to be represented with
455:09 - abc
455:14 - be a parallel vector
455:22 - to the line in other words
455:26 - vector v is going in the same direction
455:33 - then actually let's look at a visual of
455:36 - what we have here
455:38 - so we've got our three-dimensional space
455:42 - and let's say there's some line floating
455:44 - out here in three dimensional space
455:48 - we're going to take a point on the line
455:54 - and that point we're going to call x
455:56 - naught y
455:57 - naught z naught and so the vector that
456:01 - points at that
456:06 - is going to be vector r naught
456:10 - and then we're going to have another
456:11 - vector that's parallel
456:13 - to
456:17 - the blue line we're going to call that
456:19 - vector v
456:24 - so that's kind of visually what pieces
456:26 - are if we combine those pieces together
456:30 - the line
456:34 - is the vector
456:40 - r equal to the r naught vector
456:46 - plus the parallel vector
456:49 - times t which is going to create a
456:51 - parametric equation
456:53 - in terms of t so the line is the vector
456:57 - r naught plus the vector times t
457:01 - where we kind of have a slope intercept
457:03 - field where we've got a
457:05 - slope of the vector which is parallel
457:08 - and the intercept or a starting point is
457:10 - that r naught
457:11 - point so it kind of feels like that y
457:14 - equals mx
457:15 - plus b format
457:18 - now we can break this vector out
457:25 - r is the vector x y z
457:35 - is equal to the r naught
457:38 - which is the x naught y naught
457:41 - z naught plus the parallel vector which
457:46 - is
457:46 - a b c
457:50 - times the parametric variable t
457:54 - this is the vector equation
458:00 - of the line
458:10 - and then if we take that vector equation
458:12 - of the line
458:14 - and simplify
458:22 - to get a parametric equation
458:32 - where the vector x y z
458:38 - you can see if we multiply the scalar
458:42 - t through the abc we get a t
458:45 - b t c t and then we add the components
458:48 - together
458:49 - and we get x naught plus a t
458:53 - comma y naught plus b t
458:57 - comma z naught plus ct
459:02 - and if we take this apart component by
459:04 - component
459:05 - we end up with the parametric equations
459:08 - x is equal to the x component x naught
459:11 - plus
459:12 - a t y is equal to the y components y
459:16 - naught plus b t and z is equal to the z
459:20 - component z naught plus c t
459:24 - and this becomes the parametric
459:28 - equation for a line where x not y naught
459:32 - z
459:32 - naught are on the line and abc
459:36 - is a parallel vector
459:39 - and in fact we can go one step further
459:46 - and solve each of these equations
459:51 - for t to get what we call
459:55 - the symmetric
459:58 - equation
460:02 - for a line solving the first equation we
460:06 - would subtract
460:06 - x naught and divide by a that equals t
460:10 - but also the second equation is y minus
460:13 - y naught over b
460:15 - is equal to t and z minus
460:18 - z naught over c is equal to t and these
460:22 - become the
460:23 - symmetric equations
460:27 - for the line
460:32 - so if these are the equations for a line
460:34 - let's see if we can make one
460:41 - let's do an example
460:44 - where we find the equation of a line
460:46 - through two points
460:49 - we're going to find the equation
460:56 - of the line
461:00 - through the points
461:07 - one negative three two
461:12 - and five negative two eight
461:16 - any two points in space can be connected
461:18 - with a line
461:20 - and we can find that line
461:26 - first we need to know a parallel vector
461:28 - and a point
461:29 - on the line so for the parallel vector
461:34 - that's just going to be the vector that
461:35 - connects these two points together
461:38 - let's take the 1 negative 3 2 as the
461:41 - initial point
461:43 - and the 5 negative 2 8 as the final or
461:46 - terminal point
461:48 - let's call that t for terminal point and
461:51 - we know to get the vector that connects
461:53 - them we subtract the coordinates 5 minus
461:55 - 1
461:56 - is 4 negative 2 minus negative 3
461:59 - is positive 1 and eight minus two is six
462:04 - so now we know four one six is a
462:06 - parallel vector in the same direction as
462:08 - this line
462:10 - we can use either one of these points so
462:14 - see we've got our parallel vector let's
462:16 - do our
462:18 - uh r naught vector being just the first
462:21 - point we could have picked either point
462:22 - but one negative three two
462:26 - and from this we should be able to get
462:30 - a vector equation
462:33 - for the line
462:37 - the vector equation for the line is
462:40 - x y z is equal to
462:44 - the initial vector 1
462:48 - negative 3 2
462:53 - plus the parallel vector 4
462:57 - 1 6 times t
463:02 - and once i have the vector equation we
463:05 - can find the parametric equations for
463:12 - the line
463:13 - by simplifying the x coordinate is equal
463:17 - to a 1
463:18 - plus 4 t
463:22 - the y component is equal to the y's
463:24 - which is negative three
463:25 - plus one t and the z component
463:29 - is equal to the z's which is two plus
463:32 - six t and this becomes the parametric
463:37 - equations
463:38 - that will build this three-dimensional
463:40 - line that connects the two points
463:44 - we can then solve each of these
463:46 - equations for t
463:47 - to find the symmetric equation form
463:54 - of each of these lines when we do that
463:57 - we get x minus 1
463:59 - over 4 equals t is equal to y
464:02 - plus 3 over 1 which we don't need to do
464:05 - the divide 1
464:06 - which is equal to z minus 2 over 6 which
464:10 - are all
464:10 - equal to t so we have three different
464:14 - ways to represent this same line either
464:16 - in vector form
464:17 - parametric form or symmetric form
464:20 - but this gives us the equation of the
464:22 - line that connects the two points
464:26 - any two points we can find a line that
464:28 - connects them
464:31 - if we have three points though three
464:34 - points can be used to define
464:36 - what's called a plane
464:41 - let's look at finding the equation
464:45 - of a plane
464:49 - and a plane is just a big flat
464:52 - surface
464:56 - kind of like a piece of paper or your
464:58 - screen
464:59 - but it goes on forever just like a line
465:01 - goes on forever but it's incredibly thin
465:04 - the flat surface is this big flat space
465:06 - that spreads
465:07 - out forever
465:10 - and we're going to set this up in a
465:12 - similar but slightly different way than
465:14 - we set up the line
465:16 - we're going to let r naught
465:20 - be a vector
465:24 - to a point
465:28 - on the plane
465:33 - and just like before we can represent r
465:36 - naught
465:37 - as x naught y naught
465:40 - z naught
465:46 - and we're going to have another vector
465:50 - we call it the vector v before because
465:51 - it was parallel but this time we need
465:54 - a normal vector or an orthogonal vector
465:57 - that's perpendicular
465:58 - so because it's normal we're going to
466:00 - call it vector in
466:02 - be a normal
466:06 - which means perpendicular
466:10 - or orthogonal vector
466:15 - to the plane
466:28 - so visually what we have if i were to
466:30 - draw a picture
466:34 - somewhere out here is this big flat
466:35 - space that goes on forever
466:40 - and we've got a point on the plane
466:44 - that's our point x naught y
466:47 - naught z naught
466:51 - the vector that goes to it that's our r
466:54 - naught
466:57 - and then there's this other vector
466:59 - that's going to come straight
467:01 - out of it it's going to be perpendicular
467:05 - to the plane
467:07 - that is our normal vector
467:11 - what we know about vectors that are
467:13 - normal or orthogonal
467:16 - is the dot product of the vectors
467:20 - must equal 0.
467:23 - so if i pick any random point on here
467:29 - we'll call that vector r
467:35 - and i look at the vector that connects r
467:39 - to r naught
467:41 - it's going to be perpendicular to vector
467:43 - n
467:45 - well the vector that connects r to r
467:47 - naught
467:48 - is the vector
467:52 - r minus r naught
467:56 - and if i dot that vector with something
467:58 - that's normal to it
468:01 - or orthogonal to it we know orthogonal
468:04 - vectors have a dot product of zero
468:07 - so we can say that the plane
468:11 - is the product
468:16 - the normal vector
468:20 - with r minus r naught
468:25 - similar to before that normal vector we
468:27 - said uh let's call that normal vector
468:31 - just like before is going to be the
468:32 - vector abc
468:38 - so the vector a b
468:42 - c is dotted with
468:45 - the difference between our general
468:47 - vector at any x
468:48 - y z point
468:52 - minus the specific point on the plane
468:56 - x naught y naught z naught
469:01 - we know that product is going to be zero
469:06 - which means if we simplify
469:10 - we've got a b c
469:14 - dotted with x minus x naught
469:19 - y minus y naught and z
469:22 - minus z naught equals zero
469:30 - which means if i keep going
469:34 - this simplifies
469:39 - to what we call
469:43 - the scalar equation
469:50 - of a plane
469:56 - the dot product says we multiply the
469:57 - components a
469:59 - times x minus x naught plus b
470:03 - times y minus y naught
470:06 - plus c times z minus z naught
470:11 - zero and remember abc
470:15 - is the components of the normal vector
470:18 - and x naught y naught z naught are the
470:21 - coordinates of a point
470:23 - on the plane this is the scalar equation
470:28 - of a plane good one two
470:31 - no now i could go through a step further
470:36 - and i could distribute
470:40 - and combine
470:44 - like terms to get rid of the parentheses
470:49 - this gives what we call the general form
470:57 - of a plane
471:01 - and so when we distribute we get an ax
471:04 - we get a b
471:04 - y we get a c z and then we get a lot of
471:08 - constants that we're going to say all
471:09 - those constants are going to add
471:11 - together to a d
471:12 - equals 0.
471:15 - and that becomes the general form
471:19 - of a plane
471:22 - so we looked at an example where we
471:24 - connected two points to get a line
471:27 - let's do an example
471:31 - where we connect three points
471:35 - which always define
471:40 - a plane i guess there's one exception if
471:44 - those three points are linear they don't
471:46 - define a plane
471:47 - but let's say these three points are not
471:49 - collinear
471:50 - let's say our points are 3 negative 1
471:54 - 2 q
471:58 - is the point 4 negative 2 1
472:03 - and r is the point negative five
472:06 - three negative one
472:12 - well the first thing we need to find the
472:14 - plane that connects these three points
472:17 - is we need the normal vector a plane is
472:20 - built with a normal vector
472:22 - and any point so we need
472:26 - a normal vector
472:31 - and the best way to get a normal vector
472:33 - or an orthogonal vector is to use a
472:35 - cross product
472:36 - of two vectors on the plane
472:40 - so we can connect p q and r in
472:43 - any two ways there's three or six if you
472:46 - count backwards ways to connect these we
472:48 - need to connect two of them
472:50 - let's connect p and q in a vector
472:54 - which is going to be the vector four
472:55 - minus three is one
472:58 - negative two minus negative 1 is
472:59 - negative 1
473:01 - and 1 minus 2 is negative 1.
473:05 - then let's connect the vectors p and
473:08 - r together i could have done
473:12 - q and r we get the same final result
473:16 - any two but p to r negative five minus
473:20 - three
473:20 - is negative eight three minus a negative
473:23 - one
473:24 - is four and negative one minus
473:27 - two is negative three
473:33 - to get a vector that's normal to both of
473:35 - these because both these vectors
473:37 - actually lie
473:38 - on the plane connecting points that are
473:41 - on the plane
473:42 - we want a normal vector we're going to
473:45 - cross them
473:48 - and when we cross ignoring the first
473:50 - column negative 1
473:51 - times negative 3 is 3 minus
473:55 - four times negative one is negative four
473:58 - so three plus four
473:59 - comma ignoring the middle column going
474:02 - backwards negative one times negative
474:04 - eight is eight
474:05 - minus one times negative three is
474:08 - positive
474:09 - 3 comma ignoring the third column
474:13 - 1 times 4 is 4 minus negative 1 times
474:16 - negative 8 is positive 8.
474:20 - and so our normal vector then
474:24 - is equal to seven eleven
474:27 - negative four
474:34 - we can pick any point on the plane a
474:37 - vector that points to any point so let's
474:38 - just use the first point it doesn't
474:40 - matter which one we use
474:42 - 3 negative 1 2
474:45 - and now that we have a normal vector and
474:47 - a point
474:48 - we should be able to build the
474:52 - scalar equation
475:00 - and you recall the scalar equation is a
475:02 - times
475:03 - x minus x naught plus b times y
475:06 - minus y naught plus c times z minus z
475:10 - naught equals zero where a b and c
475:13 - come off the normal vector
475:16 - so a is 7 times x
475:20 - minus the x point which is 3
475:23 - plus b which is 11 times y minus the y
475:26 - point which is negative 1 plus c which
475:30 - is negative 4
475:33 - times z minus two equals
475:37 - zero this then is the scalar equation
475:40 - form of the plane that connects
475:44 - the three points
475:48 - we can do a little algebra to get the
475:49 - general equation form
475:51 - of the plane
475:57 - and we can get that general equation by
475:59 - distributing 7x minus 21
476:02 - plus 11y plus 11 minus 4z
476:06 - plus 8 equals 0.
476:09 - combining like terms we get 7x plus 11y
476:13 - minus 4z and then we combine the
476:17 - negative 21
476:18 - plus 11 plus 8 to get negative 2
476:23 - equals 0.
476:30 - what i've done here is try to give you a
476:32 - visual of what we just graphed the 7x
476:34 - plus 11y minus 4z
476:36 - minus 2. and as you can see we end up
476:39 - with this
476:40 - flat plane that we can see from all
476:42 - angles in three dimensions
476:44 - and if we were to try and find the point
476:47 - on here
476:48 - of negative or if positive 3 on the x
476:52 - negative 1 on the y it should also put
476:56 - us
476:56 - at about z of 2 and this graph doesn't
477:00 - quite get us there
477:01 - exactly but it should be around here you
477:04 - can see
477:04 - 4 on x negative 2 on y
477:14 - it's approximately a 001 again the graph
477:16 - doesn't quite hit it perfectly because
477:18 - it's in between these points
477:20 - and you can also see negative 5 on x
477:24 - 3 on the y
477:28 - it's going to be approximately negative
477:30 - 1 on the z if i could get in there
477:31 - perfectly
477:32 - but this graph only lets me hit on the
477:33 - grids which are off slightly
477:36 - but you can see we've made this plane
477:40 - that connects our three points
477:44 - using our vectors
477:49 - so that's what we're looking at today
477:51 - the equation of a plane
477:53 - is found by using a normal vector and a
477:55 - point on the plane
477:56 - the equation of the line is found using
477:59 - a parallel vector and a point on the
478:01 - line
478:01 - take a look at the homework assignment
478:03 - to practice some of these and we will
478:04 - see you to work on these further
478:06 - in class
478:09 - now that we've taken a look at the
478:11 - graphs of lines and planes in 3d we're
478:13 - ready to extend that conversation as we
478:16 - ask
478:17 - how do we graph
478:22 - other shapes or other
478:26 - curves or surfaces
478:31 - in space
478:37 - and we're going to start with kind of
478:38 - the basic graph and that is going to be
478:41 - the graph of a
478:42 - cylinder and a cylinder in 3-space
478:45 - graphing is not what we think of with a
478:48 - normal cylinder
478:49 - normally we think of a cylinder like a
478:51 - soup can
478:52 - but actually a cylinder is going to be
478:54 - defined here as
478:55 - any 3d shape
478:58 - made of
479:02 - parallel curves
479:07 - and the most basic form of that and
479:09 - there are others but the most basic form
479:11 - of that
479:12 - is when one variable
479:16 - is missing from the equation
479:22 - what we'll do in that case is we will
479:24 - graph
479:28 - in the other planes
479:33 - and copy down
479:38 - the missing variable
479:46 - in other words if x is missing we'll
479:49 - graph it in two dimensions on the y
479:51 - z plane and then we'll copy that y
479:54 - z graph all the way up and down the x
479:56 - graph
479:58 - let's take a look at some examples so we
480:00 - can see that happen
480:05 - first graph we're going to do is z
480:07 - equals x
480:08 - cubed
480:12 - first thing i'll observe with z equals x
480:14 - cubed is that the y
480:15 - variable is missing so if the y
480:19 - variable is missing we're going to graph
480:20 - it on the x
480:22 - z plane
480:28 - so we'll graph it two dimensionally but
480:31 - we'll graph it on
480:32 - x z and we know that the graph
480:36 - of anything cubed is going to be
480:41 - this graph that comes up from the
480:42 - negative levels off at zero and then
480:45 - kind of takes off after that
480:50 - that graph on the x y plus on the x
480:53 - z plane then is going to be copied
481:00 - down the y-axis
481:07 - so now we try and transition that
481:09 - two-dimensional graph
481:11 - into a three-dimensional graph where
481:13 - we've got x
481:14 - y and z and we've already graphed on the
481:18 - x
481:18 - z plane let's go ahead and draw the
481:21 - negatives
481:22 - also on this coordinate system so we can
481:25 - kind of see in three dimensions there
481:27 - so the xz plane we've already got this
481:31 - graph that comes
481:32 - up on the xz levels off
481:35 - and then takes off where kind of y is
481:37 - zero
481:39 - but that same graph is going to be able
481:41 - to slide up and down the y-axis
481:44 - and so we'll see it levels off at zero
481:46 - and takes off
481:47 - or back down the y-axis where it comes
481:50 - up
481:51 - levels off and takes off and so what we
481:54 - end up with
481:56 - is this kind of three-dimensional sheet
481:58 - with a little bit of a curve
482:00 - to it maybe emphasize that the peaks and
482:03 - the valleys
482:05 - line up here this three-dimensional
482:07 - shape it's a cylinder
482:09 - of all of these parallel graphs these
482:11 - parallel lines
482:13 - made of y of z equals x
482:16 - cubed all the way up and down
482:21 - the line
482:25 - let's take a look at another example
482:31 - let's graph z equals y squared
482:37 - because we just have z and y we're going
482:39 - to graph it on
482:40 - the y z plane
482:44 - so we'll start with our two dimensional
482:46 - graph so we know what that looks like on
482:48 - the y
482:50 - z plane and we know that
482:55 - the squared variable gives us that
482:57 - parabola graph
483:01 - and so we're going to copy that graph
483:05 - down the other variable down the x-axis
483:11 - so let's see if we can do that
483:14 - we've got x y and z let's
483:18 - include the negatives even though we
483:19 - don't really need them in this graph
483:21 - what do we do on the x
483:26 - and now with the z y plane
483:32 - that's almost the actual two-dimensional
483:34 - plane that we're
483:35 - used to here the z-y-plane is this
483:39 - parabola
483:40 - and that parabola is going to go all the
483:42 - way down the x-axis
483:46 - and all the way down the x-axis the
483:48 - other direction
483:49 - and so you can see we kind of end up
483:51 - with this
483:53 - three-dimensional curve
483:56 - it's a parabola going all the way down
483:58 - the x-axis
484:00 - and this then becomes our
484:02 - three-dimensional graph of z
484:04 - equals y squared
484:10 - now this idea of graphing a
484:12 - two-dimensional version of the graph and
484:14 - then seeing how it stretches along the
484:16 - graph
484:17 - there's actually a name for that
484:18 - two-dimensional version for the graph so
484:20 - let's go ahead and formally define that
484:22 - here
484:23 - we call it a trace or a
484:26 - cross section
484:30 - that is created
484:34 - when a surface
484:39 - intersects
484:43 - a plane
484:47 - parallel
484:50 - to a coordinate plane
484:58 - we've been focusing thus far when one of
484:59 - the variables is zero
485:01 - so we've got the either the x y plane
485:04 - the y z plane
485:05 - or maybe the x z plane were on that
485:08 - center point but it doesn't have to be
485:09 - on that center point it could be
485:11 - anywhere
485:12 - so let's say we've got you know your
485:14 - typical cosine graph
485:18 - and let's see if i can make it 3d by
485:21 - drawing another cosine graph back here
485:30 - there's your three dimensional graph
485:33 - it's a cylinder because it's that same
485:34 - graph stretched all the way
485:36 - through and the idea is if we were to
485:38 - cut it
485:39 - in the middle
485:44 - what you end up with
485:48 - is a nice little cosine graph
485:53 - cut in the middle it's that
485:56 - two-dimensional representation when it's
485:58 - sliced down
486:00 - and then that two-dimensional is
486:01 - stretched
486:03 - throughout the rest of the graph to give
486:04 - you the 3d version of it
486:11 - these traces become very helpful when we
486:13 - try to graph
486:15 - other shapes that aren't just this
486:18 - cylinder shape that stretches throughout
486:19 - the whole graph but it changes as you go
486:21 - through the graph
486:25 - we talked about lines and planes the
486:28 - next level
486:29 - up lines and planes are made with x y
486:31 - and z the next level up are made with x
486:33 - squared y squared and z
486:34 - squared these graphs are called quartic
486:39 - surfaces
486:45 - and now in general a quartic surface is
486:48 - of the form
486:50 - ax squared plus b y squared
486:54 - plus z i'm sorry c z squared
486:58 - and then we've also got combinations of
486:59 - the x's and y's so we've got
487:02 - d x y plus e
487:05 - y z plus f x
487:08 - z and then we've got x's and y's that
487:11 - could appear by themselves g
487:15 - x plus h y
487:18 - plus we have to skip i because that's
487:21 - the square root of negative one so we'll
487:22 - jump to j
487:24 - z or there's also possibly having a
487:27 - constant
487:29 - k equal to zero some combination of
487:33 - x squared y squared z squared x y's and
487:36 - z's
487:36 - combinations thereof we call those the
487:38 - cortex surfaces this is the three
487:40 - dimensional
487:41 - version of our parabolas
487:45 - ellipses hyperbolas circles
487:48 - the conic sections now in 3d
487:52 - let's look at trying to graph one of
487:54 - these quartic surfaces
487:56 - let's try and sketch
487:59 - x squared over 4 plus y
488:02 - squared over 9 plus
488:05 - z squared over 25
488:09 - equals one
488:14 - one thing you might notice is this kind
488:16 - of has the feel of an ellipse
488:19 - but we're going to see if the traces can
488:21 - confirm
488:23 - that suspicion what we can do with
488:26 - traces is we're going to take a trace in
488:28 - each direction
488:30 - first we're going to do a trace
488:34 - on the x y plane which means we don't
488:37 - want any
488:38 - z's we can make z equal to any
488:40 - convenient number we want
488:42 - the easiest one's probably going to be
488:44 - zero
488:46 - if that didn't work we'd have to pick
488:47 - another number if sometimes if z
488:49 - is zero everything goes to zero and it's
488:51 - useless to us but in this case it
488:52 - doesn't
488:53 - we end up with x squared over four
488:57 - plus y squared over nine plus
489:00 - zero equals one
489:03 - and we recognize this graph
489:09 - as an ellipse on the x y plane
489:15 - in the x direction we're going to go two
489:17 - each direction
489:19 - in the y direction it goes three each
489:21 - direction
489:24 - and so we end up with this nice little
489:26 - ellipse
489:30 - in the x y direction
489:34 - we need to know what's happening in all
489:36 - the directions so we're also going to
489:38 - draw a trace
489:41 - in the x z direction
489:44 - when we do this y is equal to zero
489:48 - so we end up with x squared over 4
489:51 - plus z squared over 25
489:54 - equals 1.
490:04 - all right in the xz direction the x's
490:07 - because the denominator is 4 the square
490:09 - root is 2
490:09 - each direction the z's go this
490:12 - each direction 5 units and so on this
490:16 - xz graph we end up with this tall
490:19 - skinny
490:28 - ewips
490:33 - and i'm not going to quite fit it all on
490:36 - one screen
490:39 - but we do need to also do a trace in the
490:42 - y z direction
490:46 - which means our x is equal to zero
490:50 - when x is equal to zero the equation
490:51 - becomes y squared over nine
490:53 - plus z squared over 25
490:56 - equals one and so if we were to try and
491:01 - draw that
491:09 - we end up with the y's we've got our y z
491:12 - axis the y's are going three
491:15 - each direction so it's a little wider
491:17 - than the green one
491:19 - the z's still going five each direction
491:25 - and we end up with
491:28 - this slightly fatter ellipse and now
491:31 - what we're going to try and do is put
491:32 - these three graphs together
491:34 - in one
491:37 - what we see is in the y z direction we
491:39 - get a fat tall ellipse
491:40 - in the x z direction it's a skinnier
491:43 - ellipse
491:44 - in the x y direction it's really a small
491:46 - ellipse
491:47 - and so when we put it all together
491:57 - into a 3d graph
492:05 - what we end up with
492:10 - is the short skinny one
492:15 - one direction
492:20 - tall and skinny another direction
492:25 - and fatter and skinnier
492:29 - pattern a little wider the other
492:30 - direction we end up with this
492:34 - three-dimensional
492:36 - what we call an ellipsoid
492:43 - so that's how we can use the surfaces to
492:45 - kind of combine
492:46 - them each together to end up with our
492:49 - three-dimensional
492:50 - ellipsoid what i've done here is i've
492:54 - drawn
492:54 - on a online calculator
492:57 - the 3d ellipsoid and what you can see is
493:00 - if we look at the top we see that
493:02 - ellipse that goes from two to three
493:05 - if i look from one side we see the
493:09 - ellipse that goes from
493:11 - two to negative two one direction and
493:13 - five to negative five another direction
493:15 - and if we look at the other side we see
493:17 - the slightly fatter 3 to negative 3 and
493:20 - 5 to negative 5
493:21 - and this 3d shape is our
493:24 - ellipsoid we've been trying to draw now
493:27 - there are some
493:30 - common
493:33 - quartic surfaces
493:39 - that we're going to work to get familiar
493:41 - with in this section
493:44 - and your book has a really nice
493:46 - introduction to them
493:48 - on page 221 through 222
493:52 - and so i want to hop over to a picture
493:54 - from the book
493:55 - of those shapes
493:58 - just that we can talk about some
493:59 - characteristics really quick about each
494:02 - of these
494:02 - we've already talked about the ellipsoid
494:04 - the ellipsoid is similar to the ellipse
494:06 - we've got an
494:07 - x squared over something plus y squared
494:10 - over something plus a z
494:11 - squared over something what really makes
494:13 - an ellipsoid defined is you notice that
494:15 - x squared
494:16 - y squared and z squared are all positive
494:20 - and they're not going to equal zero
494:22 - they're going to equal a number
494:24 - that's going to create the ellipsoid and
494:27 - if a b and c
494:28 - all are equal we actually end up with a
494:30 - perfect sphere because all of those
494:32 - major and minor axes are going to be
494:34 - equivalent
494:36 - and just like we saw before the traces
494:40 - were all ellipses in the various
494:43 - directions
494:45 - now if we make a minor change and we
494:47 - make one of them negative
494:49 - so we've got a positive a positive and
494:51 - you see that we've got that
494:52 - negative z squared if one of them is
494:55 - negative we end up with what's called a
494:57 - hyperboloid of one
494:59 - sheet so with two of the variables
495:03 - positive coefficient one with a negative
495:06 - coefficient
495:07 - and then the way we know which direction
495:09 - this hyperboloid is
495:11 - pointing is that the axis corresponds
495:15 - with the negative coefficient
495:17 - so in this case the z squared was
495:20 - negative
495:21 - and so you see the graph here goes
495:23 - around the z
495:24 - axis if the y squared was the negative
495:28 - one it would turn sideways and go around
495:30 - the y
495:30 - axis
495:34 - now if two of the terms are negative
495:38 - here we've got two variables with
495:40 - negative coefficients and one with a
495:42 - positive coefficient a positive
495:44 - a negative and a negative we end up with
495:47 - what's called a hyperboloid of two
495:48 - sheets
495:50 - the hyperbola with two sheets doesn't
495:52 - connect in the middle
495:54 - and what we also notice
495:58 - is that the axis
496:01 - of the surface corresponds to the
496:04 - variable with a positive coefficient
496:06 - so here the z squared was positive
496:10 - and that's why it goes around the z axis
496:13 - if the y squared was positive it would
496:15 - go around the y axis
496:16 - if the x squared was positive it would
496:18 - go around the
496:19 - x-axis
496:23 - now each of these have been equal to a
496:25 - number but sometimes our equations are
496:27 - equal to zero which changes things
496:29 - slightly
496:30 - one example here is the elliptical cone
496:33 - with the elliptical
496:34 - cone we've got two positives and one
496:36 - negative but this time it equals
496:39 - zero if it equals
496:42 - zero then the axis of the surface will
496:45 - correspond to the variable with the
496:47 - negative coefficient
496:48 - so again here the z is negative that's
496:51 - why the cone
496:52 - goes around the z axis
496:58 - we end up with an elliptical paraboloid
497:01 - if we have a constant term z
497:08 - and the x and y terms are each squared
497:12 - that constant term is called the linear
497:15 - term
497:16 - and the axis will correspond with the
497:18 - linear variable which is why this graph
497:20 - goes around
497:21 - the z-axis
497:26 - finally the last one we're going to look
497:28 - at for our purposes is the hyperbolic
497:30 - paraboloid
497:31 - the hyperbolic paraboloids really
497:33 - interesting because in one plane you
497:35 - have a hyperbola
497:36 - in the other planes you have parabolas
497:39 - and the way we get that
497:42 - very similar to our last example except
497:44 - we've got the middle term
497:47 - is negative or there's a negative in
497:50 - between the x squared and y squared
497:52 - still equal to a linear term and that
497:55 - linear term that it's equal to
497:57 - is going to be the axis of the surface
498:00 - that it's all built around
498:04 - also interesting is it's going to wrap
498:06 - around
498:09 - the positive variable
498:16 - so these six shapes you can see them in
498:18 - your book it also lists all the traces
498:21 - that you're going to get from each of
498:23 - these x y
498:25 - z directions
498:29 - there's going to be some problems on the
498:30 - assignment where it's going to ask you
498:31 - to identify what shape you're dealing
498:33 - with
498:34 - and the way we can do that is by paying
498:36 - attention to
498:38 - what's positive what's negative and what
498:41 - does it equal so let's see if those are
498:45 - our common quadratic
498:47 - surfaces let's see if we can identify
498:53 - some quartic
498:56 - surfaces
499:01 - let's say we're given the surface 16 x
499:03 - squared
499:04 - plus 9 y squared plus 16
499:07 - z squared equals 144.
499:14 - what i would notice on here is looking
499:18 - at the squared terms x squared y squared
499:20 - and z squared
499:22 - all the squares
499:25 - are positive
499:29 - we've got a positive 16x squared a
499:31 - positive 9y
499:32 - squared a positive 16y squared it also
499:36 - does not equal zero
499:42 - so if i were to go through and divide
499:44 - the whole thing by 144
499:46 - it would be equal to 1 which is exactly
499:49 - the form
499:50 - of the ellipsoid
499:57 - let's take a look and see what this
499:59 - graph looks like
500:01 - in the 3d graphing calculator so here's
500:04 - our 3d graph
500:05 - just as we expected it's an ellipsoid
500:07 - all the traces are ellipses
500:11 - just like we predicted so we're doing
500:13 - good on that one let's try another
500:16 - example
500:21 - let's see if we can identify the shape
500:23 - of
500:24 - 9x squared minus 18x
500:28 - plus 4y squared plus 16y
500:32 - minus 36 z
500:35 - plus 25 equals zero
500:41 - well what are we going to note about
500:43 - this shape
500:45 - i do see that there's an x and a y term
500:47 - but those could be paired with the x
500:50 - squared and the y
500:51 - squared and through a process of
500:52 - completing the square we could make that
500:54 - x or y plus or minus some number the
500:57 - whole thing
500:58 - squared so those kind of come in groups
501:01 - but i do notice that the z
501:05 - is a linear term so we have x squared
501:08 - and y squared are positive
501:14 - and the z is linear
501:21 - going back to our graph we saw
501:24 - x squared and y squared positive and the
501:27 - z linear
501:29 - with the elliptic paraboloid and it
501:31 - could be either variable linear what we
501:33 - have is two squared variables in one
501:35 - linear variable
501:36 - and the linear variable is going to tell
501:38 - us which axis this graph is going to
501:40 - wrap around
501:41 - so we end up with an elliptic paraboloid
501:44 - here
501:54 - and if we go to the graphing calculator
501:56 - let's see if our guess was correct
501:59 - and here is our shape graft what you see
502:02 - is it does have that bowl
502:03 - shape that we were expecting from the
502:05 - elliptic paraboloid
502:07 - it's an ellipse from one angle and a
502:10 - parabola from the two
502:11 - other angles we have an elliptic
502:14 - paraboloid
502:17 - let's do one last example of identifying
502:20 - our shape
502:21 - we're going to do 9x squared plus y
502:24 - squared minus
502:26 - z squared plus 2z minus 10
502:30 - equals 0.
502:34 - and let's see what we can note about
502:37 - this shape
502:43 - again we've got a z linear term but it
502:45 - can be paired with the z
502:46 - squared through a process of completing
502:48 - the squared so we have
502:50 - x squared and y squared are positive
502:54 - but you notice that z squared is
502:57 - negative
503:00 - so we have two positive squares and one
503:02 - negative square
503:04 - and that plus 10 can bump to the other
503:06 - side so it's not going to actually be
503:08 - equal to zero
503:10 - which one did that
503:15 - two positive squares and one negative
503:17 - squared that's going to be a hyperboloid
503:19 - of one sheet it is a
503:22 - hyperboloid
503:27 - of one sheet
503:33 - let's look at this example on the
503:34 - graphing calculator
503:36 - here's our hyperboloid of one sheet on
503:38 - the graphing calculator
503:40 - you notice one direction it's a
503:41 - hyperbola other direction it's an
503:43 - ellipse
503:44 - and the other direction it's a skinnier
503:45 - hyperbola we've got our hyperboloid of
503:48 - one
503:49 - sheet because it's going to go through
503:50 - the origin the hyperbola hyperbolas
503:52 - connect in the middle
503:54 - if we had two negatives then they
503:56 - wouldn't connect in the middle but it is
503:58 - hollow in the center
504:00 - so today that's what we're taking a look
504:02 - at three dimensional shapes whether
504:03 - they're cylinders or aquatic surfaces
504:06 - hopefully you can get some familiarity
504:08 - with the different shapes as you work
504:09 - through the homework assignment and in
504:11 - class we'll discuss them further and
504:13 - answer any questions
504:14 - and that you may have
504:19 - as we wrap up chapter 2 on our
504:21 - discussion about graphing in 3d
504:23 - and how vectors can help us with that i
504:25 - want to address another question
504:28 - that asks what other coordinate systems
504:44 - do we have
504:48 - for graphing
504:53 - in space
504:58 - just like with the rectangular
505:00 - coordinate system in 2d we had the x
505:02 - y coordinates but we also had polar
505:04 - coordinates that used a radius and an
505:05 - angle theta with the x-axis
505:08 - sometimes the polar system was easier
505:10 - for graphing equations and
505:12 - interpreting situations and sometimes
505:14 - the rectangular was better
505:15 - do we have the same situation with
505:17 - three-dimensional graphing
505:19 - and the answer is yes we've got two
505:22 - other coordinate systems that we can use
505:25 - the first
505:25 - of the two are called cylindrical
505:28 - coordinates
505:36 - and cylindrical coordinates are kind of
505:38 - like polar coordinates
505:40 - in 3d with polar coordinates we had a
505:43 - radius and an angle theta
505:45 - to make it in 3d we're just going to add
505:47 - an extra coordinate z
505:49 - that tells us how far vertically the
505:51 - graph
505:52 - point is in that z direction
505:56 - so let's formalize that here let's say
505:59 - it is similar
506:02 - to polar coordinates
506:10 - which have r theta a radius at an angle
506:13 - theta
506:18 - and angle with the x-axis
506:26 - we're just adding this z
506:29 - which is the vertical distance
506:38 - in the plane
506:42 - or in space so visually what we're
506:45 - talking about here
506:48 - is we've got our
506:51 - x y z axis from rectangular
506:55 - and instead what we're going to do is
506:58 - we're going to have
506:59 - some radius that makes some angle
507:03 - theta to a point
507:06 - and then we go vertically to some point
507:10 - some distance z and that vertical z
507:14 - makes a right angle with the radius r
507:21 - so if we've got this cylindrical
507:23 - coordinate system
507:25 - let's talk about how we can make
507:30 - conversions
507:35 - between the rectangular system and the
507:38 - cylindrical system
507:41 - very similar to
507:44 - polar coordinates x is equal to r
507:48 - cosine theta and y is equal to
507:51 - r sine theta we just have this new
507:54 - coordinate z
507:56 - which is just the vertical distance
507:57 - which works the exact same way
507:59 - in both systems
508:02 - and similarly if we're going the other
508:04 - way we know that r
508:05 - squared is equal to x squared plus y
508:08 - squared from the pythagorean theorem
508:11 - and that the tangent of theta is equal
508:14 - to the y
508:14 - distance over the x distance and again
508:17 - the z
508:18 - coordinate is just the z coordinate
508:21 - now there is one thing we got to be
508:23 - careful of in three space with the
508:25 - tangent of theta
508:26 - we want to make sure that we check the
508:29 - domain
508:30 - as we take the tangent inverse because
508:33 - on our calculators tangent inverse is
508:35 - always between pi over 2 and negative pi
508:38 - over 2 and sometimes we want to be in
508:40 - the opposite half of the grid
508:43 - so we have to really think about where
508:44 - our point is and we'll look at an
508:46 - example of that
508:47 - right now
508:51 - let's do some examples
508:54 - where we can use these conversions
509:01 - let's say we have the cylindrical point
509:09 - 5 pi over 6 4
509:13 - and we're going to convert it to a
509:15 - rectangular point
509:22 - well very similar to what we did with
509:24 - polar coordinates x is equal to the
509:25 - radius
509:26 - of 5. let's go ahead and label 5 so the
509:28 - radius
509:29 - pi over 6 is the theta and 4 is the z
509:33 - so x is equal to the radius of 5 times
509:35 - the cosine of the angle pi over six
509:40 - y then is the radius of five
509:43 - times the sine of the angle pi over six
509:47 - and the z coordinate is just what the z
509:49 - coordinate is
509:50 - which is four
509:53 - simplifying our x and y then cosine of
509:57 - pi
509:57 - over six is root three over two
510:01 - so we end up with five root three over
510:04 - two for the x coordinate
510:06 - the sine of pi over 6 is one half so we
510:10 - end up with five
510:11 - halves for the y coordinate and so our
510:14 - cylindrical point
510:16 - change to rectangular x y z becomes
510:19 - 5 root 3 over 2 comma 5
510:22 - halves comma 4
510:26 - and we have our rectangular point that
510:29 - is equivalent
510:30 - to the cylindrical point 5 pi over 6
510:33 - 4.
510:37 - we can also go the opposite direction we
510:40 - can take a rectangular point and convert
510:42 - it into a cylindrical
510:44 - let's take the rectangular point
510:50 - negative eight five negative seven
510:54 - and convert it to a cylindrical point
511:04 - for the cylindrical point we now have x
511:07 - y and z that we're converting to an
511:10 - r a theta and a z
511:15 - our formula says that r squared is equal
511:17 - to x squared
511:19 - 64 plus y squared
511:22 - 25 which is equal to
511:26 - 89 taking the square root of both sides
511:29 - the radius
511:30 - must be equal to the square root of 89
511:36 - theta comes from the tangent the tangent
511:38 - of theta is y
511:40 - over x so we're going to take the
511:42 - tangent inverse
511:44 - of y over x 5 over negative 8
511:52 - which is equal to negative
511:56 - doing it on our calculator it'll give
511:57 - you a negative point five
511:59 - five eight six
512:02 - but here's where we have to be careful
512:04 - with the tangent inverse
512:06 - if i think about just the x y plane z
512:09 - it's going to be vertically or below
512:11 - this looking at the x y
512:13 - x is negative eight y is five our
512:16 - point is going to be above some point
512:19 - in the second quadrant
512:23 - however theta of negative 0.55 is a
512:27 - negative angle
512:29 - negative 0.5586 goes the wrong
512:33 - direction we need to move it
512:37 - so it goes to the correct direction
512:41 - well the distance that we need to move
512:43 - it is halfway around the unit circle
512:46 - we need to add pi
512:51 - to get to the correct spot
512:55 - so when we do negative 0.5586 plus
512:58 - pi on our calculator we'll get
512:59 - approximately 2.583
513:03 - and that's going to be the number of
513:04 - radians that we want it to open up to
513:07 - get us in the correct
513:08 - quadrant so again we want to make sure
513:12 - we're careful
513:13 - tangent inverse on our calculator will
513:15 - always stick us on the right half
513:16 - of our xy graph
513:20 - which means if your point ends up in the
513:21 - left half you have to add a pi
513:24 - to it to get to the correct place
513:27 - and a quick sketch can help you see
513:29 - what's happening there
513:32 - now with z z straightforward with these
513:35 - cylindrical
513:36 - points z is just the z so negative seven
513:40 - so we end up with our cylindrical point
513:44 - of the square root of 89 for the radius
513:47 - 2.583 radians for the angle
513:51 - and negative 7 for the z value
513:55 - we've got our rectangular point
514:01 - we can even switch between equations
514:04 - equations in rectangular and equations
514:06 - in cylindrical
514:08 - let's say we've got the equation that r
514:09 - is equal to 3
514:11 - sine of theta and we want to convert
514:14 - that equation to a rectangular equation
514:22 - well we know that r sine theta is equal
514:25 - to
514:26 - something so if we multiply both sides
514:29 - by
514:29 - r we end up with r squared equals three
514:32 - r
514:32 - sine theta
514:36 - and we know from our formulas that r
514:38 - squared is x
514:39 - squared plus y squared
514:43 - three is just a constant we know that r
514:46 - sine theta
514:47 - is equal to the y coordinate and so
514:49 - we've converted this to
514:51 - a rectangular equation x squared plus y
514:54 - squared equals 3y represents the same
514:58 - equation
514:59 - in cylindrical as r equals 3 sine theta
515:06 - so that's cylindrical coordinates very
515:08 - very similar to polar coordinates which
515:10 - we're already familiar with
515:12 - but there is a second three-dimensional
515:14 - graphing system
515:16 - that i want to talk about called
515:19 - spherical
515:26 - coordinates
515:29 - and with spherical coordinates we end up
515:32 - with
515:32 - three greek letters for our coordinates
515:35 - rho
515:36 - theta and phi
515:41 - rho theta and phi
515:44 - rho is the distance
515:52 - from the origin
515:55 - to the point
515:59 - and i want to be careful not to confuse
516:01 - that with the r from the cylindrical
516:03 - coordinates
516:04 - r was the radius in the x y plane and
516:07 - then we moved vertically up
516:09 - rho is going to be the diagonal distance
516:11 - from the origin to the point almost like
516:13 - a vector that goes diagonally through
516:15 - space it's the actual distance to the
516:18 - point
516:19 - not just in the x y plane but through
516:22 - space
516:24 - theta is the angle with the x-axis
516:32 - just like we did before it's the same
516:34 - theta that we saw in the cylindrical
516:36 - coordinates
516:37 - also from polar coordinates theta is the
516:39 - angle with the x-axis
516:41 - and phi our new greek letter
516:44 - v is going to be the angle
516:49 - with the z-axis
516:55 - so visually what we're talking about
516:57 - here
517:02 - is there's some distance diagonally
517:05 - through
517:06 - space rho
517:14 - that comes off of a projection if it
517:18 - makes a right angle
517:20 - it comes off of an angle theta that's
517:23 - made with the
517:23 - x-axis
517:27 - and an angle phi
517:31 - made with the z-axis so we end up with
517:33 - two angles and a distance
517:35 - that give us the coordinates to the
517:38 - point
517:44 - so then the next logical question is how
517:46 - do we do
517:47 - conversions
517:51 - between the rectangular system that
517:52 - we're more familiar with
517:54 - and this new system the spherical
517:56 - coordinates
517:59 - well our x-coordinate is equal to rho
518:03 - times the cosine of theta times the sine
518:06 - of phi
518:08 - notice the first part looks very similar
518:10 - to what we had with polar coordinates
518:12 - and cylindrical coordinates
518:13 - the distance times the cosine of the
518:15 - angle we're just also multiplying by the
518:17 - sine of the
518:19 - last angle y is going to be rho
518:23 - sine theta sine phi
518:27 - and z is rho times the cosine of phi
518:34 - if we're going the other direction from
518:37 - the pythagorean theorem
518:39 - rho squared is equal to x squared plus y
518:42 - squared plus z squared the pythagorean
518:45 - theorem in three dimensions because this
518:47 - time we're going
518:48 - straight to the point instead of just
518:50 - the x y plane
518:53 - because theta is the same theta we saw
518:55 - before it's still tangent of theta is y
518:58 - over x just make sure that you check the
519:00 - domain again
519:05 - and finally to find phi we solve
519:08 - the last equation here for phi z equals
519:12 - rho cosine of phi
519:14 - dividing both sides by rho we get that
519:16 - the cosine of
519:18 - phi is equal to z divided by rho
519:24 - that's usually going to be easier to
519:26 - solve but
519:27 - it does require us to know rho first so
519:29 - if we don't know rho
519:30 - we basically just calculate it it's the
519:32 - square root of x squared plus y squared
519:35 - plus z
519:35 - squared but it'll be usually quicker
519:38 - just to do z
519:39 - divided by rho
519:43 - all right let's see if we can do some
519:45 - examples
519:48 - where we make these exact conversions
519:53 - let's start with taking a spherical
519:55 - point
520:01 - let's take 2 negative 5 pi over 6
520:04 - comma pi over 6 and convert that to
520:08 - a rectangular point
520:14 - well we need to know what x y and z
520:18 - are in rectangular points and our
520:20 - conversion formula say it's going to be
520:22 - rho which is 2.
520:24 - let's go ahead and label these as rho
520:26 - theta and phi
520:29 - times the cosine of the first angle
520:31 - negative 5
520:32 - pi over 6 times the sine of the second
520:36 - angle pi over 6.
520:41 - y is 2 sine
520:44 - of negative 5 pi over 6 times the sine
520:48 - of pi over six
520:51 - and z is equal to rho two times the
520:55 - cosine of the last angle
520:57 - just pi over six
521:01 - simplifying these will give us our
521:02 - rectangular point that's equivalent
521:04 - to the spherical point so we've got 2
521:07 - times the cosine of negative 5 pi over 6
521:10 - is negative root 3 over 2
521:16 - and the sine of pi over six is
521:19 - one half and that gives us negative root
521:23 - three over two
521:26 - for the y coordinate we have two times
521:29 - the sine of negative five pi
521:31 - over six that's in the
521:34 - third quadrant so it's negative one-half
521:38 - sine of pi over six is still one-half
521:41 - and so we end up with
521:42 - negative one-half for our y-coordinate
521:46 - and finally with z we have 2 times the
521:49 - cosine of pi over 6
521:50 - which is root 3 over 2 which is just the
521:54 - square root of 3.
521:57 - so our spherical point of 2 negative 5
522:00 - pi over 6 pi
522:01 - over 6 is the same as the rectangular
522:04 - point
522:05 - negative root 3 over 2 negative one-half
522:09 - square root of 3.
522:18 - let's try going the other direction
522:21 - let's look at the rectangular point
522:28 - of negative one one square root of six
522:33 - and we're going to convert that to a
522:35 - spherical point
522:43 - well to get spherical we need to know
522:45 - what rho
522:47 - theta and phi are going to equal
522:50 - from our x y and z
522:54 - well our row formula actually says rho
522:56 - squared is equal to the sum of all the
522:58 - squares
522:58 - so negative 1 squared is 1 plus 1
523:01 - squared is 1
523:02 - plus the square root of 6 squared is 6.
523:06 - and so that gives us rho squared is
523:10 - equal to 8
523:11 - taking the square root of both sides rho
523:13 - is equal to the square root of 8
523:15 - which simplifies to 2 root 2.
523:22 - with theta theta is equal to the tangent
523:24 - of y over x
523:27 - so if we do a tangent inverse of y over
523:29 - x 1 over negative 1
523:32 - or the tangent inverse of negative 1
523:36 - negative one tangent inverse is going to
523:39 - be
523:41 - pi over negative pi over four
523:46 - but again we need to take a quick
523:50 - look at where this point is gonna be
523:52 - it's a rectangular point of negative one
523:54 - comma positive one
523:58 - and negative pi over four
524:02 - sticks us in the wrong quadrant so we
524:05 - need to
524:06 - add pi to it
524:09 - and when we add pi
524:12 - to a negative pi over 4 we're adding 4
524:15 - pi over 4
524:16 - we end up with 3 pi over 4
524:19 - is the actual point
524:25 - for phi the cosine of phi is equal to
524:29 - z over rho z
524:32 - is the square root of six divided by rho
524:35 - which we just found out was two root two
524:38 - and when we simplify that we're actually
524:41 - doing the cosine
524:42 - inverse dividing by the square root of
524:44 - two we get
524:45 - root three over two
524:48 - and we know the cosine inverse of root
524:50 - three over two
524:52 - is pi over six
524:56 - and so we've ended up with a spherical
525:00 - point
525:01 - that is equal to the rectangular point
525:04 - of negative 1
525:05 - 1 root 6 that point is
525:09 - 2 root 2 3 pi over 4
525:13 - pi over 6.
525:19 - similar to what we did with the
525:21 - cylindrical coordinates
525:22 - spherical coordinates can also be
525:24 - expressed as equations
525:26 - or surfaces can be expressed as
525:29 - equations
525:30 - let's do rho equals 5 cosine
525:34 - of phi
525:38 - we can manipulate these equations to try
525:40 - and convert them
525:41 - into the other form into rectangular
525:44 - form
525:45 - and you can see on this one similar to
525:47 - the other example
525:48 - if we multiply both sides by row we end
525:51 - up with rho
525:51 - squared equals 5 rho cosine of phi
525:58 - and rho squared we know from our
526:00 - formulas is x squared plus y
526:02 - squared plus z squared
526:05 - equals the constant of five and then
526:09 - rho cosine of phi that is directly equal
526:12 - to z
526:13 - and so we end up with the equation x
526:15 - squared plus y squared plus z squared
526:17 - equals 5z
526:19 - as being the equivalent equation in
526:22 - spherical coordinates
526:23 - as rho equals 5 cosine of phi
526:29 - so those are our two new systems we're
526:31 - looking at spherical coordinates and
526:33 - cylindrical coordinates
526:35 - sometimes we might want to make a
526:36 - conversion though between these two new
526:39 - systems and it is a lot of work to have
526:41 - to go
526:42 - to rectangular in the middle so let's
526:45 - take a look at how we can make a direct
526:47 - translation between the two
526:49 - how we can convert between our new
526:53 - systems
526:55 - between spherical
527:00 - and cylindrical
527:06 - coordinates
527:09 - well just as before we have some
527:10 - conversions
527:15 - remember that spherical
527:20 - we just did is expressed as rho theta
527:24 - phi and
527:27 - cylindrical
527:30 - is what we started with is expressed as
527:33 - a radius theta times the z distance
527:40 - so if we want to change spherical into
527:42 - cylindrical our conversion for r
527:45 - is that r is equal to rho times the sine
527:49 - of phi theta
527:53 - i mentioned earlier is the same theta
527:55 - between both systems so there's really
527:56 - no conversion needed for that center
527:58 - coordinate
528:00 - and z is going to be rho times the
528:04 - cosine of phi
528:09 - if we're going the other direction
528:12 - we have cylindrical and we want the
528:14 - spherical
528:15 - rho squared from the pythagorean theorem
528:18 - is the radius
528:19 - squared plus z squared
528:22 - again theta is the same theta so there's
528:24 - no work to do there
528:26 - we just need to get after the phi which
528:29 - if we take the z
528:30 - equals equation that we just had and
528:32 - divide both sides by rho
528:34 - we end up with the cosine of phi is
528:37 - equal to z
528:38 - over rho which
528:41 - usually by this point we will have
528:42 - already calculated rows so that's easier
528:45 - but if we haven't calculated rho we just
528:47 - use our row equation and rho is the
528:49 - square root of r squared plus z squared
528:56 - so let's see if we can do some examples
528:58 - where we convert directly between
529:00 - these new systems of graphing in space
529:04 - between spherical and cylindrical let's
529:07 - do a few examples
529:11 - let's take the spherical point first
529:16 - the spherical point two negative five pi
529:19 - over six and pi over six
529:23 - we're going to convert that to
529:26 - cylindrical
529:34 - well for cylindrical we need to know the
529:36 - radius
529:37 - the angle theta and the vertical
529:40 - distance
529:41 - z the radius
529:44 - is equal to rho 2
529:47 - times the sine of the angle pi over 6
529:50 - the phi
529:51 - the last angle theta
529:54 - is just theta of negative 5 pi over 6
530:00 - and z is rho 2
530:04 - times the cosine of phi times the cosine
530:07 - of pi over 6.
530:11 - simplifying the sine of pi over six is
530:14 - one-half
530:16 - so we end up with a radius of one
530:20 - the cosine of pi over six is the square
530:22 - root of
530:23 - three over two which gives us square
530:26 - root of three
530:29 - and so we now have our cylindrical point
530:34 - of one negative five pi over 6
530:38 - square root of 3 which is equivalent to
530:41 - the spherical point
530:43 - of 2 negative 5 pi over 6
530:46 - comma pi over 6.
530:52 - let's do one more example where we go
530:54 - the other direction
530:57 - let's take the cylindrical point
531:04 - of the square root of 2
531:08 - 3 pi over 4 square root of 6
531:11 - and we're going to convert that to
531:14 - spherical
531:19 - so because it's a cylindrical point
531:20 - we've got a radius a theta
531:23 - and a z i didn't label on the spherical
531:26 - back then we had the rho
531:28 - the theta and the fee
531:33 - so for finding the spherical point we
531:36 - need to know what
531:36 - rho is what theta is
531:40 - and what phi is our row equation says
531:44 - that rho
531:44 - squared is equal to the r squared
531:48 - plus the z squared r squared is two
531:52 - plus the z squared is six
531:55 - which means rho squared is equal to
531:57 - eight
531:58 - taking the square root rho is the square
532:01 - root of eight
532:02 - or two root two
532:07 - theta is the same in both graphing
532:10 - systems so we have
532:11 - three pi over four
532:16 - for phi we know the cosine of phi
532:19 - is equal to z over the rho
532:22 - so we'll do the cosine inverse of z
532:25 - the square root of 6 over the rho
532:29 - to root two and i think we simplified
532:33 - this one before
532:35 - we have the cosine inverse dividing out
532:37 - the square root of two
532:38 - of root three over two
532:41 - cosine inverse of root three over two is
532:45 - pi over six
532:49 - and so we've taken our cylindrical point
532:51 - of square root of two
532:53 - three pi over four square root of six
532:56 - and we've ended up with the spherical
532:58 - point two root two
533:01 - three pi over four
533:04 - and pi over six
533:10 - so that's what we're focusing on today
533:12 - with these new coordinate systems
533:14 - spherical graphing
533:15 - and cylindrical graphing can we convert
533:18 - between
533:18 - all three systems spherical cylindrical
533:21 - and rectangular
533:24 - i want to wrap up really quick by
533:26 - summarizing
533:28 - the three graphing systems visually
533:34 - in three dimensions so we'll make our
533:37 - little coordinate plane here
533:40 - and normally we label them x y and z
533:47 - but just to make it really clear i'm
533:48 - going to call this i
533:50 - j and k
533:54 - as vectors in the x y z direction when
533:57 - we're graphing with the rectangular
533:58 - system
533:59 - with the rectangular system we go a
534:01 - distance x
534:05 - and then we go a distance y
534:09 - and then we can vertically go a distance
534:13 - z to our point
534:17 - that is x y z
534:22 - and each turn makes a right angle
534:26 - that's the rectangular coordinate system
534:29 - when we do cylindrical we say instead
534:31 - what we're going to do is we're going to
534:32 - take a radius
534:34 - that stretches out
534:38 - to where we go vertically at z
534:42 - and that radius is going to make an
534:43 - angle theta
534:45 - with the x-axis and when we do
534:48 - we end up with a point that is the
534:50 - radius
534:51 - theta z
534:57 - with the spherical coordinates instead
535:00 - what we're going to do with spherical
535:01 - coordinates is we're going to go
535:02 - directly
535:03 - from the origin to the point and we're
535:06 - going to call that distance
535:08 - row and that row is going to be formed
535:12 - with an
535:13 - angle of theta with the x-axis it's the
535:15 - same theta as we had with the
535:17 - cylindrical coordinates but also with an
535:20 - angle
535:21 - phi from the z axis
535:24 - and in that way we end up with our point
535:26 - rho
535:28 - theta phi
535:31 - so we now have three ways to represent
535:33 - that same point
535:35 - in space and depending on the context
535:38 - sometimes one context is much easier to
535:40 - work with
535:41 - than the other context but for now we're
535:43 - focusing our energy on learning about
535:45 - the three systems
535:47 - converting between the three systems and
535:49 - interpreting where those points will be
535:51 - so take a look at the homework
535:52 - assignment practice some of those
535:54 - and we will discuss them more in class
536:01 - our next chapter is going to focus
536:03 - exclusively on these things called
536:05 - vectored valued functions so this first
536:08 - lesson we're going to answer the
536:09 - question
536:10 - what are
536:15 - vector valued
536:19 - functions
536:24 - and put quite simply a vector valued
536:27 - function
536:38 - can be defined
536:44 - and 2d
536:49 - as r of t
536:52 - the vector valued function is going to
536:54 - be some function of
536:56 - t times the i vector plus
536:59 - some function g of t
537:03 - times the j vector or in component form
537:06 - f of t comma g of
537:10 - t and
537:13 - similarly it can be defined in 3d
537:17 - as the vector value function r of t
537:20 - is equal to some function of t times the
537:23 - i
537:24 - plus some function of g times the j
537:29 - and some function of t times
537:32 - the k or in component form
537:37 - f of t comma g of t
537:41 - comma h of t basically it's a vector
537:46 - made up of functions in fact we've seen
537:49 - this type of a function before
537:52 - noting that this is really
537:56 - just a parametric equation or a
537:58 - parametric function
538:05 - in vector form
538:10 - when we had parametric equations or
538:12 - parametric functions from a previous
538:14 - chapter we said
538:15 - x was equal to some function f of t y
538:18 - is equal to a g of t and z
538:22 - is equal to some h of t and as
538:25 - t changed it gave us our entire graph
538:27 - our function
538:29 - now we're just expressing those three
538:32 - functions as
538:33 - one function as a vector
538:43 - so now if i was asked to evaluate some
538:46 - vector
538:48 - valued functions
538:54 - for example let's say we have the vector
538:57 - r of t
538:59 - is equal to t squared minus
539:03 - three t i
539:06 - plus four t
539:09 - plus one j
539:13 - and we were asked to find the vectored
539:16 - value
539:17 - function when time is negative four
539:22 - all that really means is we're going to
539:23 - plug negative four into
539:25 - our vector valued function and so we
539:28 - have negative
539:29 - four squared minus three times negative
539:32 - four
539:33 - times the i component plus
539:36 - four times negative four plus one
539:40 - times the j component and simplifying
539:44 - 16 plus 12 is 28
539:47 - i plus
539:51 - actually we're going to make it minus
539:52 - because we have negative 16 plus 1 is
539:55 - negative 15
539:57 - j and we've evaluated the vector valued
540:00 - function
540:01 - at time of negative 4.
540:07 - let's try one more let's find the vector
540:10 - valued function
540:11 - r of t is equal to the cosine of t
540:16 - to sine of t and the natural log of one
540:20 - minus
540:20 - t and we're going to
540:24 - find the vector function
540:27 - at pi over 6.
540:33 - well that means we're just going to plug
540:34 - pi over 6 into each component so we have
540:37 - the cosine of pi
540:38 - over six comma two sine
540:41 - pi over six comma the natural log of one
540:45 - minus
540:46 - pi over six and when we simplify
540:51 - we know the cosine of pi over six is
540:53 - root three over two
540:57 - the sine of pi over six is one half
540:59 - times two is one
541:02 - and then we're left with the natural log
541:04 - of
541:05 - getting a common denominator that's
541:07 - going to be 6 minus pi
541:09 - over 6 and we've evaluated
541:14 - the vectored valued function at pi over
541:17 - 6.
541:20 - now as with any case since a function is
541:22 - just a mapping from the domain
541:24 - to the range we can talk about what
541:27 - exactly is the domain
541:29 - of our vectored valued function
541:36 - and similar to functions that you've
541:38 - seen in the past for example we can't
541:40 - have 0 in the denominator we can't have
541:42 - negatives under the square roots or in a
541:43 - natural log
541:45 - similar to those we can apply those
541:48 - concepts of a domain to our vectored
541:50 - value function
541:52 - the only rule that we have to add is our
541:54 - domain
541:55 - must work
541:58 - for all components
542:04 - of the vector valued function
542:08 - so if r of t is the function
542:12 - 3 over the square root of t
542:15 - plus 1 comma the natural log
542:19 - of t minus 5
542:23 - comma secant
542:27 - of 3t
542:33 - we can go piece by piece to start
542:36 - building a domain that works for the
542:38 - entire vectored valued function
542:41 - one thing we see is t plus 1 is under a
542:44 - square root so we know t plus one
542:46 - must be greater than zero or equal to
542:49 - zero
542:50 - subtracting one we find out t is greater
542:52 - than or equal to negative one
542:56 - another thing we see is we've got a
542:58 - denominator and we know denominators
543:00 - cannot be equal to zero
543:03 - squaring both sides and subtracting one
543:07 - t cannot be equal to negative one
543:12 - which then if we combine that with the
543:15 - first
543:16 - conclusion now we're saying t is just
543:18 - strictly greater than negative one it
543:20 - cannot be equal to negative one
543:22 - because of our work there in the green
543:26 - continuing on we see a t minus five
543:29 - inside a natural log
543:32 - well natural logs must always be greater
543:34 - than zero
543:36 - so we can say t is greater than five
543:40 - which already is greater than negative 1
543:42 - so we kind of have built this new domain
543:45 - t greater than 5 is the more restrictive
543:49 - domain so we're going to stick with that
543:51 - for now
543:53 - but we still have to deal with the
543:55 - secant
543:58 - because the secant we can take the
544:00 - secant of anything
544:02 - but secant is the reciprocal of the
544:05 - cosine
544:07 - and we can't have zero in the
544:09 - denominator
544:11 - so cosine of three t
544:15 - cannot be equal to
544:19 - zero well if we do the cosine inverse
544:23 - then we get that 3t
544:24 - cannot be equal to cosine
544:28 - is 0 at pi over 2
544:33 - and then again it's 0 at 3 pi over 2
544:37 - 5 pi over 2 7 pi over 2
544:41 - basically every plus n pi
544:44 - where n is the natural numbers to get
544:47 - the t alone then we just have to divide
544:48 - both sides by
544:49 - 3 and we get t is equal to
544:52 - pi over 6 plus n
544:56 - over or n pi over 3.
545:01 - and let's get a common denominator by
545:04 - multiplying the second one by
545:06 - two so we have pi plus two n
545:09 - pi over six
545:15 - and that's actually not equals two
545:17 - because that'll make the secant
545:19 - undefined at all of those points
545:22 - and so we can combine all of this
545:25 - together
545:27 - and say our domain is all t greater than
545:30 - 5
545:32 - where t is not equal to
545:36 - pi plus two n pi over six
545:45 - and that covers all of the components
545:49 - of this vectored valued function
545:55 - now since ultimately we're interested in
545:57 - doing calculus with these vector valued
546:01 - let's talk about the first step of
546:04 - calculus and that's finding the limit
546:08 - of a vectored valued
546:14 - function
546:19 - and we'll start with a definition
546:25 - which might be exactly what you expect
546:27 - that the limit
546:29 - as time goes to any value we'll call it
546:32 - a
546:33 - of the vector valued function r of t
546:36 - is really asking us to just take the
546:38 - limit of each component the limit as t
546:41 - goes to a of the first function
546:45 - comma the limit as t goes to a
546:48 - of the second function and if it's in
546:51 - three space the limit
546:53 - as t goes to a of the last function
547:01 - so doing a couple quick examples
547:07 - if we're trying to find the limit as t
547:10 - goes to negative 2
547:14 - of the vectored valued function the
547:17 - square root of t
547:18 - squared minus 3t minus 1 times
547:21 - i plus
547:25 - four t plus three times
547:28 - j plus the sine
547:32 - of t plus one
547:37 - times pi over two
547:41 - okay
547:52 - well basically we're just going to take
547:54 - the limit of this vector
547:55 - valued function component wise so we're
547:57 - going to plug negative 2
547:59 - in for all of the t's as long as it
548:02 - doesn't make anything undefined
548:04 - so we get the square root of negative 2
548:06 - squared
548:07 - minus 3 times negative 2 minus 1 i
548:12 - plus 4 times negative 2 plus 3
548:16 - j plus the sine
548:20 - of negative two plus one
548:24 - pi over two okay
548:30 - simplifying negative two squared is four
548:32 - four plus six is ten
548:34 - minus one is nine square root of nine
548:37 - gives us three i
548:43 - four times negative two is negative
548:44 - eight plus three
548:46 - negative eight plus three is a negative
548:49 - five
548:52 - j and then when we do negative two plus
548:57 - one we get negative
548:58 - one half or negative pi over two
549:02 - the sine of negative pi over 2
549:06 - drawing a quick unit circle negative pi
549:08 - over 2 is straight down
549:11 - at the point zero comma negative one
549:15 - sine being the y coordinate so we get
549:17 - negative 1
549:18 - or negative k
549:21 - and so this vector valued function is
549:24 - approaching 3i minus 5j minus k
549:28 - as time is approaching negative 2.
549:34 - let's do one that's a little more
549:35 - involved than just plugging in values
549:37 - for the limit
549:38 - we're going to find the limit as t goes
549:42 - to zero
549:47 - three t squared minus five t
549:51 - all over six t squared plus t
549:57 - comma the cosine of t
550:00 - minus 1 over t squared
550:06 - and to make this a little more
550:07 - straightforward i'm going to look at one
550:09 - component at a time first
550:10 - looking at the i component
550:14 - or the x component depending on how you
550:17 - want to look at it
550:19 - if we were to plug 0 in we'd end up with
550:21 - 0 in the denominator of this fraction
550:23 - and that is not acceptable
550:26 - so instead what i'm going to do is i'm
550:27 - going to factor
550:29 - a t out leaving behind three t minus
550:32 - five
550:35 - and a t out of the denominator leaving
550:37 - behind six t plus one
550:41 - and that allows the t's to divide out so
550:44 - now we can take the limit as t
550:45 - goes to zero by plugging zero in for the
550:49 - t's
550:50 - which will leave us with negative five
550:52 - over one
550:54 - which equals negative 5 because we've
550:56 - removed
550:57 - that discontinuity
551:02 - if we look at the j component
551:10 - what we find is plugging zero in for
551:12 - cosine we end up with one minus one
551:14 - or zero over zero squared which is zero
551:18 - and so this is an indeterminate form of
551:20 - zero over zero
551:23 - so what we're going to do is use our old
551:25 - friend
551:26 - l'hopital and take the limit as
551:31 - t goes to 0 of
551:34 - the derivative of cosine is negative
551:36 - sine of t
551:38 - the derivative of t squared is two t
551:41 - but now if we plug zero in
551:45 - the sine of zero is zero and this
551:49 - two times zero is zero we're still going
551:51 - to zero over zero
551:54 - so we'll use l'hopital one more time to
551:57 - take the limit as t goes to zero
552:00 - of negative cosine of t
552:04 - over two
552:07 - and now when we plug the zero in cosine
552:10 - of zero gives us one
552:11 - so we are left with negative one over
552:14 - two
552:17 - which means the limit as t goes to zero
552:19 - of our vectored valued function
552:21 - is going to be negative five comma
552:24 - negative one-half
552:29 - taking the limit component-wise of each
552:32 - part
552:37 - speaking of limits and i've kind of
552:38 - alluded to it with this idea of
552:42 - continuity to remove the discontinuity
552:45 - in order to find the limit
552:46 - let's talk about when a vector valued
552:49 - function
552:49 - is continuous
552:54 - a continuous vectored valued
553:00 - function
553:06 - a vector-valued function is continuous
553:12 - if and only if
553:15 - the limit as time approaches a
553:19 - of the vector valued function r of t
553:23 - is exactly the same as the vectored
553:26 - valued function
553:27 - evaluated at that value a
553:31 - the limit is the same as the value which
553:34 - means the limit has to exist
553:35 - and the value has to exist they have to
553:37 - both be defined
553:40 - and quite often instead of determining
553:42 - where something's continuous
553:44 - as we found in calc 1 it's easier to
553:46 - describe when it's
553:47 - discontinuous when the limit is not
553:49 - equal to
553:50 - the value at the function when we have a
553:52 - gap a jump
553:53 - or an infinite discontinuity
553:57 - so let's say we have the vector valued
553:59 - function r of t
554:01 - is equal to e to the t i
554:03 - [Music]
554:05 - plus the sine of t j
554:09 - what we know about the part e to the t
554:11 - is e to the t
554:12 - is continuous for all values we never
554:14 - have to lift our pencil as we graph it
554:17 - similar with sine of t sine of t is
554:20 - continuous for
554:21 - all values there's no gaps no jumps
554:25 - no asymptotes vertical asymptotes
554:28 - it's actually defined for all real
554:31 - numbers
554:32 - and the limit is also defined for all
554:34 - real numbers so this is continuous
554:39 - for all real numbers
554:47 - so let's do an example that might be a
554:48 - little more
554:51 - exciting let's take the vector valued
554:53 - function
554:54 - r of t is equal to the vector
554:57 - 1 over x comma tangent inverse
555:01 - of x
555:06 - well looking at the first component 1
555:08 - over x is
555:09 - undefined at 0 which means while the
555:12 - limit
555:13 - exists at 0 the function does not
555:16 - and so we're going to say it's not
555:20 - continuous
555:23 - at zero because we have an asymptote
555:28 - we're also not continuous when tangent
555:31 - inverse is undefined
555:33 - we know tangent inverse is undefined
555:36 - tangent is y
555:37 - over x so it's undefined whenever the x
555:39 - coordinate of the unit circle is zero
555:42 - that happens at pi over two and
555:45 - every n pi after that so we have a
555:48 - two points of discontinuity from one
555:51 - from each component
555:55 - so this video is a real brief
555:56 - introduction to these things called
555:58 - vectored valued function really it's
556:00 - just a fancy way to take a parametric
556:02 - equation
556:03 - and put it into a vector form so it's
556:06 - one single
556:07 - function we'll be using these vector
556:10 - valued functions to do a lot of modeling
556:12 - of different situations do a lot of
556:13 - different calculus tricks
556:15 - but for now we're going to do some
556:16 - homework problems get comfortable with
556:18 - vector valued functions in general
556:20 - and we'll see you in class to answer any
556:22 - questions you may have
556:26 - now that we've taken a look at what
556:28 - vector valued functions
556:30 - are we're ready to answer the question
556:32 - that we really care about because this
556:34 - is a calculus class
556:36 - how do we do
556:39 - calculus
556:44 - of vectored
556:47 - valued functions
556:56 - and let's start with the first part of
556:58 - calculus calc 1 where we
557:00 - took derivatives
557:06 - and quite simply to take the derivative
557:08 - of a vector valued function we're going
557:10 - to
557:11 - take the derivative
557:18 - of each component
557:30 - so let's do some examples
557:35 - where we do just that
557:40 - first let's take the vectored valued
557:41 - function r of t
557:43 - is 6 t plus
557:46 - 8 i
557:49 - plus 4 t squared plus
557:53 - 2 t minus 3 j
557:59 - the derivative of the vector valued
558:00 - function which will denote
558:02 - r prime of t is simply the derivative of
558:06 - each component
558:07 - the derivative of 6 t plus 8 is just six
558:10 - i's plus the derivative of the
558:13 - polynomial
558:14 - is eight t plus two
558:18 - times the j vector and there is our
558:22 - derivative
558:25 - let's try and make them a little more
558:27 - interesting let's say
558:29 - the vector valued function r of t
558:33 - is e to the t sine t
558:40 - times i plus
558:43 - e to the t cosine t
558:47 - j minus e to the 2t
558:52 - k and we're going to find the derivative
558:56 - of our vector valued function r prime of
558:59 - t
559:03 - well our first pr derivative is a
559:06 - product so we remember we have to use
559:07 - the product rule which is the derivative
559:09 - of the first part e to the t
559:11 - times the second sine of t plus the
559:14 - derivative of the second part which is
559:16 - cosine of t
559:18 - times the first e to the t times the i
559:22 - component
559:24 - plus again using our product rule the
559:28 - derivative of the first
559:30 - times the second plus the derivative of
559:33 - the second which is going to give us
559:34 - negative sign
559:37 - times the first which is e to the t
559:42 - times the j component minus the
559:45 - derivative of e to the 2t is e to the 2t
559:48 - using the chain rule times the
559:49 - derivative of the inside is 2
559:52 - times the k component
559:55 - and now we've got our derivative
560:02 - let's try r of t
560:06 - is equal to t natural log of t
560:09 - i plus 5
560:13 - e to the t j
560:16 - plus the cosine of t minus the sine of t
560:22 - k
560:25 - and so our derivative r prime of t
560:29 - again we've got a product rule so we
560:31 - take the derivative of the first which
560:33 - is one
560:33 - times the natural log of t plus the
560:36 - derivative of the second which is one
560:38 - over t
560:39 - times the first which is t
560:43 - all times i plus
560:47 - 5e to the tj that's a pretty
560:50 - straightforward derivative
560:52 - plus derivative of cosine is negative
560:55 - sine
560:56 - the derivative of sine is cosine
561:01 - times the k
561:04 - a little bit of simplifying just
561:06 - simplifying that t over t
561:07 - is one so we find out our derivative of
561:10 - the vector vector-valued function
561:12 - is the natural log of t plus 1
561:16 - times i plus 5 e to the t
561:20 - times j plus
561:24 - negative sine of t minus the cosine of t
561:29 - k and we have our
561:32 - derivative of the vector valued function
561:37 - one of the most common and useful
561:39 - purposes
561:40 - for the derivative of vector valued
561:42 - functions
561:43 - is to find what are called tangent
561:47 - vectors
561:52 - and similar to a tangent line being
561:55 - tangent
561:56 - to the curve at a point being the first
561:59 - derivative
561:59 - it works exactly the same with vectors
562:03 - we're going to find the tangent at a
562:06 - point
562:09 - let's say the vector r of t
562:13 - is equal to the cosine of t times i
562:18 - plus the sine of t times j
562:22 - and we're going to find the tangent
562:23 - vector
562:25 - at the point t equals pi over 6.
562:33 - well the derivative is just component
562:36 - wise gives us the negative
562:38 - sine of t times i
562:42 - plus the cosine of t times j
562:47 - and we're being asked to find the
562:49 - tangent vector specifically
562:51 - at the point pi over six
562:55 - negative sine of pi over six
562:58 - i plus the cosine
563:01 - of pi over six j
563:06 - which if we simplify the sine of pi over
563:09 - 6
563:10 - pi over 6 is at root 3 over 2
563:14 - comma one half sine being the y
563:17 - coordinate
563:18 - gives us the one half so we have
563:19 - negative one half
563:22 - i
563:25 - plus the cosine of pi over six is root
563:28 - three over two
563:30 - j this vector then
563:34 - can be positioned so it's tangent to the
563:37 - point
563:38 - at time equals pi over six
563:43 - visually what we're looking at if you
563:45 - remember from parametric equations
563:47 - graphing x equals cosine
563:49 - y equals sine that's actually just the
563:52 - unit circle
563:54 - going around counterclockwise
563:59 - and we're specifically interested at
564:00 - when time is pi over six
564:05 - and if we were to draw a tangent vector
564:07 - right there
564:09 - it could be written in component form as
564:12 - negative one half
564:14 - i plus root three over two
564:18 - j
564:22 - and that would be the same as the
564:25 - component vector coming out of the
564:27 - origin it's going in the same direction
564:29 - because remember vectors don't have a
564:31 - location they just have a direction in
564:33 - magnitude
564:35 - speaking of magnitude there's no rule
564:39 - by just taking the derivative that
564:41 - really dictates the magnitude of that
564:43 - tangent vector and so usually we like to
564:47 - standardize how we think about
564:49 - tangent vectors by saying we're going to
564:52 - be particularly interested
564:54 - in the unit tangent
564:57 - vector that way no matter how you get
565:01 - your tangent vector it's always going to
565:03 - be the exact same length the unit
565:05 - tangent vector is a very special vector
565:07 - that we're going to use throughout this
565:08 - chapter
565:10 - we're going to call it capital t of t
565:13 - and it is simply just the derivative of
565:16 - the basic vector r of t
565:19 - divided by the magnitude of that
565:23 - derivative so
565:26 - first we're going to find the tangent
565:28 - vector and then we'll make it a unit
565:30 - vector
565:31 - by dividing by its magnitude
565:36 - so let's try an example where we do just
565:39 - that
565:40 - let's say the vector r of t
565:43 - is equal to t squared minus 3
565:47 - i plus 2t
565:50 - plus 1 j
565:55 - plus t minus 2 k
566:00 - and we want the unit tangent vector
566:04 - to this vector we're going to do this
566:07 - generally not at any specific point
566:09 - we're going to do it generally for any
566:10 - point
566:11 - t we could find it at a specific point
566:13 - if we had a t
566:14 - value we were particularly interested in
566:16 - but for this example let's just do it
566:18 - generally so first we need to know the
566:21 - derivative
566:23 - of our vector valued function r which is
566:26 - two t i plus two
566:29 - j plus
566:32 - 1k
566:37 - but that is not a unit vector so to get
566:40 - our special vector
566:41 - our unit tangent vector we're going to
566:43 - find the magnitude
566:45 - of the derivative and we remember the
566:49 - magnitude
566:50 - is the square root
566:54 - of the square of the components
566:57 - two t squared plus two squared
567:01 - plus one squared
567:05 - which gives us the square root of
567:08 - four t squared plus four plus one
567:13 - which is five
567:17 - that tells us then that the unit tangent
567:19 - vector
567:20 - that special vector t of t is
567:24 - 1 over the square root of 4 t squared
567:27 - plus 5.
567:30 - times the derivative
567:33 - which is 2t comma 2 comma 1
567:37 - in component form if we wanted to we
567:41 - could distribute that divide by the
567:42 - square root
567:43 - giving us just the vector two t
567:46 - over the square root of four t squared
567:49 - plus five
567:51 - comma two over the square root of four t
567:54 - squared plus five
567:56 - comma 1 over the square root of 4 t
567:59 - squared plus
568:00 - 5. and now we have a vector of unit
568:03 - length
568:04 - it's always going to have a length of 1
568:07 - that will always be tangent to the
568:10 - vector
568:11 - r of t we're going to come back to unit
568:15 - tangent vectors in our future sections
568:17 - and explain why they're so important and
568:19 - helpful to us as
568:21 - we're working with vector valued
568:23 - functions but for now we're just going
568:25 - to find them
568:26 - generally like we did in this example or
568:29 - we could find them specifically at a
568:30 - point if i knew t was equal to 7 seconds
568:32 - we could evaluate that
568:36 - but for now let's step away from
568:37 - derivatives
568:39 - we still have to look at the second half
568:41 - of calculus
568:42 - which is integration
568:47 - and just like derivatives we can take
568:49 - the derivative component at a time
568:51 - we can take the antiderivative
569:00 - of each component
569:07 - but just like before in calc 2 when we
569:10 - took an
569:10 - integral we would always have plus a
569:12 - constant
569:13 - we need to reflect that here also but we
569:16 - need to express that constant
569:18 - is a vector so we're going to say it's
569:20 - plus
569:22 - a constant
569:25 - vector which we will represent with a c
569:30 - with the vector symbol above it
569:32 - representing some vector
569:33 - made up of three constants constant one
569:36 - constant two constant three
569:41 - so for example if we're being asked to
569:45 - find the integral
569:48 - of two t plus four i
569:53 - plus three t squared minus four t
569:57 - j dt
570:01 - we can integrate this one component at a
570:03 - time
570:05 - integrating the i component we end up
570:07 - with t squared
570:09 - plus 4t times the i
570:15 - plus the j component becomes t
570:18 - cubed minus 2 t squared
570:22 - times the j component but because this
570:25 - is not a definite integral
570:26 - we need to also add a constant vector
570:30 - to our final solution
570:35 - and so we're integrating a component one
570:37 - component at a time
570:39 - to get our final solution
570:42 - let's do one last example let's do a
570:46 - definite integral this time let's go
570:47 - from zero to pi
570:49 - over three of the vector
570:52 - valued function sine of two t
570:56 - i plus the
570:59 - tangent of t j
571:04 - plus e to the negative 2 t
571:07 - k dt
571:14 - evaluating one component at a time the
571:17 - antiderivative of sine is the cosine
571:20 - of two t actually the negative cosine
571:23 - to account for the times two we need a
571:25 - one half out front
571:27 - times the i component plus
571:32 - the antiderivative of tangent might
571:35 - remember
571:36 - is negative natural log of the cosine of
571:40 - t
571:42 - j remember that comes from writing
571:44 - tangent to sine over cosine
571:46 - and then using substitution to integrate
571:53 - plus antiderivative of e to the negative
571:56 - 2t is e to the negative 2t but we have
571:59 - to multiply by a negative one-half
572:00 - to account for that
572:03 - 2 times the k component
572:07 - and we're just going to integrate this
572:08 - entire thing from 0 to pi
572:10 - over 3.
572:14 - and we'll do that substitution one
572:16 - component again
572:17 - at a time so first with the i we have
572:20 - negative
572:21 - one-half cosine of two t or two pi
572:24 - over three
572:28 - plus one half cosine of two times zero
572:32 - is zero
572:34 - times i
572:38 - plus
572:42 - plugging pi over 3 into the natural log
572:44 - we get negative
572:45 - natural log of the cosine of pi
572:48 - over 3.
572:53 - plus the natural log of the cosine
572:56 - of zero all of that's your j
573:00 - component plus
573:03 - negative one half
573:06 - e to the negative two pi over three
573:11 - plus one half e to the zero
573:16 - all that times the k component
573:23 - simplifying let's see what we have left
573:26 - cosine of 2 pi over 3
573:31 - is going to be 2 pi over three is over
573:33 - here on the unit circle
573:35 - so that's going to be negative one half
573:38 - comma root three over two
573:40 - so the x coordinate is the negative one
573:42 - half
573:44 - so negative one half
573:48 - times negative one-half
573:52 - plus one-half
573:55 - times the cosine of zero is one i
574:00 - plus the negative natural log of the
574:02 - cosine of pi
574:03 - over three one pi over three
574:06 - is a positive one half root three over
574:09 - two
574:11 - so the natural log of one half
574:16 - plus the natural log of
574:20 - cosine of zero is one that's going to be
574:22 - nice because the natural log of one is
574:24 - zero
574:26 - times the j component
574:30 - plus
574:34 - not much simplifying that we're left
574:36 - with on this last part i'm going to put
574:38 - the positive one-half in front just
574:40 - because it makes it pretty
574:41 - minus one-half e to the negative two pi
574:44 - over three
574:46 - times the k component and so one time
574:50 - through left to simplify
574:52 - we end up with one fourth plus one half
574:54 - is
574:55 - three fourths high
575:00 - minus
575:04 - the natural log of one half
575:08 - j plus
575:15 - one half minus one half e to the
575:18 - negative two pi
575:19 - over three k
575:25 - and now we found the antiderivative of
575:28 - our vector valued function
575:29 - from zero to pi over three
575:33 - so calculus with vector valued functions
575:35 - not too difficult it's just basically
575:37 - extending what we saw in calc 1 and calc
575:39 - 2 with derivatives and integrals
575:42 - just doing it with every single
575:43 - component all the way through
575:45 - we also introduced this idea of the unit
575:47 - tangent vector that's going to be very
575:48 - important to us
575:49 - as this chapter progresses so take a
575:51 - look at a few of these on the practice
575:53 - assignment
575:53 - we will see you in class to answer any
575:55 - questions you may have
575:58 - today's video is going to look at
576:00 - answering the question of
576:02 - how do we
576:06 - measure
576:08 - arc length
576:14 - and curvature
576:18 - and we'll talk about curvature a little
576:20 - more when we get
576:22 - to it but first we're going to address
576:24 - the question
576:25 - of arc length
576:31 - for our vectored
576:34 - valued functions
576:42 - and we're going to build this based on
576:45 - what we know
576:50 - from parametric curves
576:55 - when we did parametric curves we said
576:57 - arc length s
576:59 - is equal to the integral from a to b
577:02 - where a and b were the edges of the
577:04 - curve
577:05 - of the square root of x of t
577:09 - prime squared plus y prime of t
577:14 - squared dt
577:19 - well similarly
577:24 - if the vector valued function r of t
577:28 - is equal to the component form f of t
577:33 - g of t h of t
577:40 - then we have arc length is equal to the
577:43 - integral from a to b
577:46 - of the square root of
577:50 - the first component's derivative squared
577:53 - plus the second component's derivative
577:56 - squared
577:57 - plus the third components derivative
578:00 - squared dt
578:04 - and really actually finding the square
578:07 - root of all the components squared
578:09 - we've seen that formula before this
578:12 - is the formula for the magnitude
578:20 - of the vector
578:27 - so instead we can simplify
578:31 - our arc length formula to the integral
578:34 - from a to b
578:36 - of the magnitude of the derivative
578:40 - of the vector
578:43 - and that becomes our formula
578:48 - for arc length we take the derivative of
578:50 - the vector
578:51 - we find its magnitude and then we
578:53 - integrate it
578:54 - over its range
578:58 - so let's do an example
579:01 - using this new formula
579:06 - let's say r of t the vector valued
579:09 - function
579:10 - is equal to two t squared plus one
579:15 - comma two t squared minus one
579:19 - comma t cubed and we're gonna find the
579:22 - arc length as time
579:24 - goes from 0 to 3.
579:31 - well first we need to find the
579:33 - derivative of our vector valued function
579:37 - which is going to be 4t comma 40
579:40 - comma 3t squared
579:47 - next the formula says we need to know
579:49 - the magnitude of the derivative of the
579:51 - vector-valued function
579:54 - and magnitude we know is the square root
579:57 - of the square of its components
579:58 - 16 t squared plus 16 t
580:02 - squared plus 9 t to the fourth
580:07 - which simplifies to the square root of
580:10 - 32 t squared plus nine
580:14 - t to the fourth
580:19 - and actually if we factor out a t
580:22 - squared
580:22 - we get the square root of t squared
580:25 - times
580:26 - 32 plus nine t squared
580:30 - and we can take the square root of the t
580:33 - squared to get our
580:34 - total magnitude is t times the square
580:37 - root of
580:38 - 32 plus nine t squared
580:46 - now we're ready to go to our formula
580:48 - which says that the arc length is equal
580:50 - to the integral
580:51 - we're going from zero to three of the
580:54 - magnitude
580:55 - of the derivative of our vector valued
580:58 - function
580:58 - which we just found out was t times the
581:01 - square
581:02 - root of 32 plus 9t squared
581:06 - dt
581:10 - we can take this integral quite quickly
581:11 - using u substitution where u is 32 plus
581:14 - nine t squared that makes d u
581:18 - equal to 18 t dt
581:21 - so we'll multiply by 18 inside and one
581:24 - over 18
581:25 - outside to get one over 18
581:29 - times the integral plugging 0 and 3 into
581:33 - the u equals equation we get 32 plus 0
581:36 - and plugging the 3 in 3 squared is 9. 9
581:39 - times 9 is 81
581:41 - 81 plus 32 is 113
581:47 - the 18t dt becomes our du and the square
581:50 - root becomes u to the one half
581:54 - which we know is u to the three halves
581:57 - times two-thirds with the one over
581:59 - eighteen on the outside
582:02 - integrated from thirty-two to one
582:05 - thirteen
582:09 - two over eighteen is going to reduce to
582:11 - 9 so we're going to have 1 over
582:13 - 27 times and i don't think this is going
582:17 - to simplify so we'll leave it as 113 to
582:19 - the three halves
582:21 - minus 32 to the three halves
582:25 - and that's an ugly decimal so we'll call
582:27 - that good
582:29 - for the arc length of
582:32 - our vectored valued function
582:36 - so using our formula arc length is
582:39 - simply the magnet
582:40 - the integral of the magnitude of the
582:42 - derivative
582:44 - of the original vector valued function
582:49 - really we've done arc length before when
582:51 - we worked with parametric curves
582:53 - so we're going to move to the next topic
582:57 - which is curvature
583:01 - and curvature is an important concept to
583:03 - us as we look at a
583:04 - curve curvature measures
583:11 - how sharply
583:16 - a smooth
583:20 - curve turns
583:26 - if it's got a real sharp tight curve
583:29 - then you'll get a larger curvature if
583:31 - it's a nearly flat
583:32 - wide curve you're going to get a much
583:35 - smaller curvature curvature measures how
583:38 - sharply the curve turns similar to slope
583:41 - or the derivative measuring how
583:43 - fast the curve changes curvature
583:47 - measures how sharply the curve turns
583:52 - and there's a couple formulas for
583:53 - curvature
583:56 - depending on the context that we're
583:58 - working in
584:00 - we use looks like a k it's kind of a
584:02 - cursive k for our curvature symbol
584:06 - curvature is equal to
584:10 - the magnitude of the unit tangent vector
584:14 - derivative divided by
584:18 - the magnitude of the regular vector's
584:21 - derivative
584:26 - this function works best in 2d
584:32 - so if we have a two-dimensional vector
584:34 - we'll find the unit tangent vector
584:36 - and the magnitude of its derivative
584:39 - divide by the magnitude of the
584:41 - derivative
584:44 - of the valued function
584:47 - however if we're in three dimensions
584:49 - there's a quicker formula that can help
584:51 - us
584:51 - because we can use the cross product in
584:53 - three dimensions
584:55 - in three dimensions we'll take the
584:57 - derivative of the vector valued function
585:00 - and we'll cross it with the second
585:02 - derivative
585:03 - of the vector valued function
585:08 - find its magnitude and divide by the
585:12 - magnitude
585:14 - of the derivative raised to the third
585:17 - power
585:20 - that formula is going to be best
585:24 - when we're working in three dimensional
585:27 - vector space
585:32 - now this can be simplified using
585:35 - functions to show that this is
585:38 - the absolute value of the second
585:40 - derivative of y
585:43 - divided by one plus the first derivative
585:46 - of y
585:48 - squared raised to the three halves power
585:53 - and this function this equation is the
585:56 - one we'll use
585:58 - best with
586:02 - y as a function
586:08 - of x so if we just have a function y
586:12 - equals we'll use the last equation if we
586:14 - have a two-dimensional vector valued
586:16 - function we'll use the first equation
586:18 - if we have a three-dimensional vector
586:20 - valued function we'll use that
586:22 - center equation so let's take an example
586:24 - where we use each of these equations to
586:26 - measure the curvature
586:28 - or how sharply the graph curves
586:32 - these three equations are going to be
586:33 - really key to this section so let's
586:35 - highlight them
586:36 - as we go into our first example
586:45 - let's say we have the function r of t
586:49 - is equal to 5 cosine of t
586:52 - i plus 5
586:57 - sine of t j
587:04 - since we're just working with i and j we
587:07 - have a vector valued function in the
587:09 - plane
587:09 - in two dimensions so we're going to use
587:11 - that first equation
587:13 - the magnitude of the derivative of the
587:15 - unit tangent vector divided by the
587:17 - magnitude
587:18 - of the derivative of the vector valued
587:20 - function
587:22 - probably easier just to start finding
587:23 - all the pieces and then dividing at the
587:25 - end
587:26 - so first the derivative
587:30 - of the vector valued function r of t
587:33 - is negative five sine of t
587:37 - i plus five cosine of t
587:42 - j well for the denominator we need to
587:46 - know the magnitude of that
587:48 - so the magnitude of the derivative of
587:51 - the vector valued function
587:53 - is the square root of the component
587:55 - squared
587:56 - which is 25 sine squared of t
588:00 - plus 25 cosine squared of t
588:06 - which is really nice because if we
588:08 - factor out the 25
588:10 - we get the square root of 25 times sine
588:13 - squared of t
588:14 - plus cosine squared of t
588:17 - and we know sine squared plus cosine
588:19 - squared is one so this is just going to
588:21 - be the square root of 25
588:24 - or five
588:29 - which means it should be really easy to
588:30 - find the unit tangent vector
588:34 - we know the unit tangent vector is
588:37 - the derivative vector divided by
588:41 - its magnitude so one-fifth
588:44 - dividing by the magnitude
588:47 - times five sine of t i
588:52 - plus
588:55 - i'm sorry that's negative five sine of
588:56 - ti plus 5 cosine of t
588:59 - j distributing the 1 5 through making it
589:03 - a unit tangent vector
589:05 - it becomes negative sine of t
589:09 - i plus the cosine of t
589:13 - j
589:21 - the numerator is the derivative
589:25 - of the unit tangent vector
589:32 - so we'll take this unit tangent vector
589:34 - that we just found
589:35 - negative sine of t i plus the cosine of
589:37 - t j
589:38 - and find its derivative which gives us
589:41 - negative
589:42 - cosine of t i
589:46 - minus the sine of t
589:52 - j
589:55 - well the numerator is the magnitude of
589:57 - this vector
589:59 - the magnitude of the unit tangent vector
590:05 - which in this case is really nice
590:06 - because it's the square root of the
590:08 - components which is cosine
590:09 - squared of t plus the sine squared of t
590:13 - and we know sine squared plus cosine
590:15 - squared is one
590:21 - and so now we're ready to go to our
590:23 - formula
590:30 - for curvature in 3d
590:34 - in 3d the curvature is the magnitude of
590:37 - the unit tangent vector's derivative
590:40 - divided by the magnitude of the
590:42 - vector-valued function's
590:44 - derivative
590:47 - well the tangents derivatives magnitude
590:50 - we found out was one the magnitude
590:54 - of the derivative of the vector we found
590:58 - out was five
590:59 - and so we have a curvature
591:04 - of one-fifth
591:09 - it turns out in this case that the
591:10 - curvature is constant because this
591:12 - entire shape is a circle
591:14 - it's a circle of radius five and so it
591:17 - curves at a rate
591:18 - of one-fifth all the way around the
591:20 - entire graph
591:24 - but that's just a 2d example
591:28 - let's take a look at an example in 3d
591:33 - let's take the vector valued function r
591:36 - of t
591:39 - is equal to 4 cosine of t
591:44 - for sine of t
591:49 - and three t
591:57 - now it's off my screen so i'm just going
592:00 - to copy again
592:01 - that curvature in 3d is going to be the
592:04 - magnitude
592:05 - of r prime of t crossed with r
592:08 - prime prime of t
592:12 - divided by the magnitude of r prime of t
592:16 - cubed
592:21 - just to remember the formula which is
592:22 - off my screen
592:26 - so we just need to start finding these
592:28 - pieces so let's start with finding r
592:30 - prime of t
592:32 - r prime of t is negative four
592:36 - sine of t comma four cosine of t
592:40 - comma three we also need to know r
592:44 - prime prime of t
592:49 - which is negative four cosine of t
592:53 - negative four sine of t
592:57 - and zero
593:02 - to make the numerator we need to cross
593:04 - those two vectors
593:06 - so r prime of t crossed with r prime
593:08 - prime of t
593:14 - and when we cross these
593:17 - we get 0 minus
593:20 - a negative 12 so positive 12 sine of
593:24 - t comma
593:28 - 3 times negative 4 is negative
593:31 - 12 cosine of t
593:36 - minus 0
593:40 - comma 16
593:44 - sine squared of t
593:48 - minus a negative so plus 16
593:51 - cosine squared of t
593:59 - which if you factor on that k component
594:03 - factor out a 16 we have sine squared
594:05 - plus cosine
594:05 - squared so that's actually going to
594:08 - simplify just to 16.
594:10 - so let's rewrite this vector simplified
594:14 - with 16 in the k component
594:20 - the numerator of the curvature
594:24 - is the magnitude of r prime crossed with
594:27 - r prime prime of t
594:32 - so let's find the magnitude of this
594:35 - vector
594:36 - which is the square root of 144
594:40 - sine squared of t plus 144
594:44 - cosine squared of t plus 16
594:48 - squared which is 256.
594:53 - factoring out the 144 we're left with
594:55 - cosine squared plus sine squared which
594:57 - is
594:57 - one so we're left with 144 plus 256
595:04 - which is the square root of 400
595:08 - which is 20.
595:14 - so our numerator for the curvature is
595:17 - 20.
595:18 - the denominator is the magnitude
595:21 - of our prime of t
595:25 - cubed well we found r prime of t
595:29 - already in our first step up above in
595:31 - blue so let's just run the magnitude
595:33 - formula
595:34 - which is the square root of the
595:35 - components 16
595:37 - sine squared of t plus 16
595:40 - cosine squared of t plus nine
595:44 - again if you pull the 16 out of the
595:46 - first two terms
595:47 - you're left with 16 times sine squared
595:50 - plus cosine squared
595:52 - which is one plus nine we get the square
595:55 - root of 25
595:57 - which is just five
596:03 - and so finally
596:06 - we're ready to calculate the curvature
596:09 - of our vector valued function
596:12 - curvature we said using the formula in
596:14 - the top right here is
596:16 - the numerator is the magnitude of the
596:17 - cross product we found out was 20
596:21 - divided by the magnitude of the
596:22 - derivative which is 5
596:24 - cubed which is 20 over
596:28 - 125 which dividing by 5 will give us
596:32 - 4 over 25 as our final
596:38 - curvature
596:41 - curvature in three dimensions measuring
596:44 - how
596:44 - sharply a corner is turning
596:49 - we had a third formula though for
596:51 - curvature so let's take a look at it
596:54 - the third formula is used best when we
596:56 - have a function
596:58 - written out like f of x equals x squared
597:02 - how sharp is this function turning how
597:06 - is the curvature measured
597:09 - well again it's off my screen but you
597:11 - have it on your notes up above
597:13 - that the curvature when we have a
597:15 - function is the absolute value of the
597:17 - second derivative
597:19 - divided by one plus the first
597:22 - derivative squared
597:25 - raised to the three halves power
597:29 - so let's find all those pieces first
597:31 - derivative
597:32 - is two x the second derivative
597:36 - is just 2. and so if we plug into our
597:40 - curvature function
597:43 - we get the absolute value of the second
597:44 - derivative which is 2
597:48 - divided by one plus the first derivative
597:52 - which is two
597:53 - x squared
597:56 - all raised to the three halves power
598:02 - cleaning up a little bit the absolute
598:03 - value of two is just two
598:06 - over one plus four x squared
598:09 - raised to the three halves power
598:13 - and this time our curvature is not a
598:15 - constant but it depends on how big x is
598:18 - and that makes sense because we know x
598:20 - squared starts out with a real sharp
598:22 - curve in the center but on the outsides
598:25 - it's becoming more and more
598:27 - flat in fact let's take a look at
598:31 - what the graphs of x squared looks like
598:34 - compared to the graph
598:36 - of its curvature so here i've graphed
598:40 - the graph of x squared and now i'm going
598:43 - to graph
598:44 - its curvature which we said was two over
598:48 - one plus four x squared
598:51 - raised to the three halves power
598:58 - and what we see is the curvature is at
599:01 - its largest value
599:02 - its steepest point at zero
599:06 - but as it gets out further and further
599:08 - and further the curvature gets less and
599:09 - less and less
599:11 - and so we see the curvature increases
599:15 - as the curve sharpness increases
599:18 - and that's what we're measuring with
599:19 - curvature how sharply
599:22 - how fast is this smooth
599:25 - curve turning
599:29 - so we've got three formulas for
599:30 - curvature one formula that helps in two
599:33 - dimensions one in three dimensions and
599:34 - one when we have y as a function of x
599:36 - instead of a vector valued function
599:38 - take a look at the homework assignment
599:40 - also doing some arc length problems
599:42 - to see if you can get comfortable with
599:44 - them come to class with questions
599:46 - and we will see you then
599:51 - now that we've gotten comfortable
599:52 - working with these vector valued
599:53 - functions we're ready to address
599:56 - the question how
600:01 - do we model
600:08 - motion
600:12 - in space
600:16 - over time
600:22 - and the idea is very similar to when we
600:23 - were working with derivatives and
600:25 - integrals
600:25 - we can talk about the position of a
600:28 - particle
600:31 - we can talk about its velocity
600:35 - and we can talk about its acceleration
600:42 - in fact there's one more thing we can
600:43 - talk about too now that we have vectors
600:45 - and that's the idea of speed
600:47 - but we'll get to that in just a minute
600:50 - and what's nice with vector valued
600:52 - functions is now we can extend those
600:54 - ideas of position velocity and
600:56 - acceleration
600:57 - into three dimensions the vector valued
601:00 - function
601:00 - r of t can represent
601:07 - the position of a particle
601:12 - at time t
601:16 - in each direction
601:21 - so the i component can represent how far
601:24 - it's moving horizontally over time
601:27 - the j component represents vertically
601:30 - over time
601:31 - and the k component can represent the
601:32 - third dimension over time and so with
601:35 - each component we can represent motion
601:37 - in each of the directions
601:41 - then we can come up with a velocity
601:42 - vector which is
601:44 - equal to as you might expect from
601:46 - calculus 1 the derivative of the
601:49 - position vector
601:51 - and this represents
601:55 - the velocity
601:59 - at time t
602:03 - in each direction
602:08 - so it might be moving faster vertically
602:10 - than it is horizontally maybe if you
602:13 - shoot a canon vertically up it's moving
602:16 - vertically really fast and maybe
602:17 - horizontally
602:18 - just a little bit the vector v of t
602:21 - can show that velocity in each direction
602:26 - and then as you might expect the
602:27 - acceleration vector a of t
602:30 - is the derivative of the velocity vector
602:33 - or the second derivative of the position
602:36 - vector
602:38 - representing
602:41 - the acceleration
602:50 - at time t
602:53 - in each direction
603:02 - and we're going to introduce a fourth
603:03 - thing to this discussion
603:05 - and that's going to be what we call v of
603:07 - t and notice this is not
603:09 - marked as a vector
603:17 - this is a function that's not a vector
603:21 - but it's going to have
603:22 - a scalar solution and the reason for
603:25 - that
603:26 - is the v of t is going to represent the
603:29 - speed
603:30 - and the way we calculate that is we take
603:32 - the magnitude
603:33 - of the velocity vector so we want to be
603:36 - very careful
603:37 - that if it's a vector it represents the
603:40 - velocity
603:41 - if it's a scalar it represents the speed
603:45 - another way we could say that because
603:47 - the velocity is the derivative of the
603:49 - position we could say that's the
603:50 - magnitude of the position vector
603:53 - this represents
603:57 - speed not in any particular direction
604:01 - but the overall
604:02 - speed of the particle
604:05 - so let's do some examples where we look
604:07 - at these concepts
604:16 - let's say we've got the position vector
604:19 - r of t is equal to t
604:22 - squared i
604:25 - plus the square root of five minus
604:28 - t squared j
604:33 - if we wanted to find the velocity vector
604:35 - with respect to time then
604:37 - we just take the derivative of the
604:39 - position vector
604:41 - taking the derivative of each component
604:42 - we get 2t times
604:44 - i plus square roots of one-half power so
604:47 - we have one-half
604:48 - times five minus t squared to the
604:51 - negative one half
604:53 - times the derivative of the inside which
604:55 - is going to be negative two t
604:58 - times our j
605:01 - cleaning that up a little bit we've just
605:03 - got two t i
605:05 - dividing out the twos minus
605:09 - a t times five minus t
605:12 - squared to the negative one half
605:16 - j this then is
605:19 - our velocity vector at time t
605:22 - in the direction of i and j
605:27 - if i wanted to find the acceleration
605:29 - vector at time t we just take the
605:32 - derivative
605:33 - of the velocity
605:36 - so on the i component we just have 2i
605:41 - minus on the j component we've got a
605:44 - product rule the derivative of t is one
605:47 - times five minus t squared to the
605:50 - negative one half
605:54 - plus the derivative of the negative one
605:58 - half power is negative
606:00 - one-half times five minus
606:03 - t squared to the negative
606:07 - three-halves times the derivative of the
606:10 - inside which is negative two
606:12 - t then we have to also multiply
606:16 - by the first factor which is t
606:19 - all that times j
606:24 - well let's clean that up a little bit so
606:27 - our final acceleration vector
606:30 - is two i minus
606:35 - five minus t squared to the negative one
606:38 - half
606:41 - the twos divide out and the negative
606:43 - times a negative is a positive
606:45 - so we're gonna have plus t times t is t
606:48 - squared times five minus t squared
606:52 - to the negative three halves
606:55 - all that times our j
607:00 - a little bit more complex but that is
607:02 - our acceleration vector
607:08 - we can also find our speed speed is v of
607:11 - t
607:11 - it's the magnitude of the velocity
607:15 - vector
607:18 - so magnitude is the square root of each
607:21 - component
607:22 - squared so we take the 2t squared is 4t
607:26 - squared plus
607:29 - we have a t squared
607:32 - and then the 5 minus t squared
607:36 - to the negative one because when we
607:38 - square one-half
607:40 - the negative one-half the twos divide
607:42 - out
607:44 - and that does not look like it's going
607:46 - to simplify at all so
607:47 - that represents the speed
607:52 - of our particle represented by the
607:55 - vector
607:56 - r of t
608:01 - let's try one more example to make sure
608:03 - we can do velocity acceleration
608:05 - and speed let's say we've got a vector
608:08 - r of t which is equal to
608:12 - let's do component form this time t
608:14 - squared minus three t
608:17 - two t minus four and t plus
608:20 - two
608:25 - the velocity vector then
608:29 - is the derivative of that which is two t
608:31 - minus three
608:33 - 2 and 1.
608:39 - the acceleration vector is the
608:42 - derivative of that vector
608:43 - derivative of the velocity which is 2
608:46 - 0 0.
608:51 - so it's only accelerating it turns out
608:54 - in the x
608:55 - direction or towards the i vector every
608:58 - other vector
608:59 - the acceleration is not changing it's a
609:01 - constant velocity of two or one
609:05 - if we just want v of t remember that's
609:08 - the magnitude of the velocity vector so
609:11 - we take the square root of each
609:12 - component squared
609:14 - which becomes squaring two t minus three
609:17 - we get
609:18 - four t squared minus twelve t
609:21 - plus nine plus two squared is four
609:25 - plus one squared is one and so for our
609:29 - speed
609:30 - it's going to be the square root of 4 t
609:33 - squared minus 12
609:36 - plus 14.
609:52 - and so we have our acceleration velocity
609:54 - and speed
609:56 - values one nice application
610:06 - of these vector valued functions with
610:08 - velocity
610:09 - acceleration position is this idea of
610:13 - projectile
610:16 - motion projectile motion is when an
610:20 - object is moving
610:25 - through space
610:32 - and the only force
610:35 - acting on it
610:40 - is gravity
610:46 - and in two dimensions projectile motion
610:48 - can be represented with the
610:50 - vector valued function s of t the
610:53 - initial velocity times
610:55 - time times the cosine of the angle
610:59 - that it begins moving at
611:02 - times the i vector plus
611:07 - the initial velocity times time
611:11 - times the sine of the angle
611:15 - but since the second component
611:16 - represents the vertical distance we also
611:18 - have to subtract the force of gravity
611:21 - which is one half times gravity
611:24 - times time squared
611:27 - times the j vector
611:31 - this formula can be used to model
611:34 - projectile motion into space
611:39 - so let's see if we can do an example
611:43 - where we use that formula
611:53 - let's say a cannonball
611:59 - is fired
612:03 - from a cannon
612:08 - on a cliff
612:11 - towards water
612:20 - the cannon
612:23 - is aimed
612:27 - at a 30 degree angle
612:31 - or pi over 6
612:34 - above the horizon
612:42 - which just means above the flat line
612:47 - and the initial
612:53 - speed
612:56 - of the cannonball
612:59 - is 600
613:03 - feet per second
613:06 - we also know that the cliff
613:11 - is 100 feet
613:15 - above the water
613:23 - so if we were to draw a picture we've
613:25 - got a cliff
613:29 - with a little cannon
613:35 - and it's all above water
613:39 - and the idea is we're going to shoot
613:40 - this cannonball and it's going to go up
613:43 - and ultimately land in the water
613:46 - we know the cannon makes a
613:50 - 30 degree angle with the horizon
613:54 - we know the initial speed
613:58 - coming out is 600 feet per second
614:02 - we know the cliff is a hundred feet
614:05 - above the water
614:10 - and the first thing we're going to do
614:13 - is model this situation
614:17 - with a vector valued
614:22 - function
614:25 - and as a hint since we're in feet we're
614:28 - going to do
614:28 - the english version of
614:32 - gravity which is 32
614:35 - feet per second squared
614:42 - well using our model up above
614:46 - the vector s of t is equal to the
614:49 - initial velocity
614:50 - which is 600 times time
614:54 - times the cosine of my angle i
614:59 - plus 600
615:02 - times time times the sine
615:06 - of my angle
615:09 - minus one half
615:13 - of gravity and since we're in the
615:15 - english system we're going to use 32
615:16 - feet per second
615:18 - times time squared times the j component
615:25 - we can do a little bit of cleanup
615:29 - that our vector s of t is equal to
615:32 - the cosine of 30 a 30 degree angle
615:36 - is at the point root 3 over 2
615:40 - comma one half so the cosine of 30 is
615:44 - going to be root 3 over 2
615:46 - and then divide by 2 will reduce with
615:48 - the 600
615:51 - leaving behind 300
615:55 - root 3. actually let's put the t in
615:57 - there 300 t
615:59 - root 3 times the i vector
616:04 - plus the sine of 30 is going to be one
616:09 - half so half of 600
616:11 - is 300 t
616:15 - minus half of 32 is 16 t
616:18 - squared times the j vector
616:23 - this vector valued function then is
616:26 - going to represent
616:27 - both the horizontal motion over time in
616:30 - the i component
616:32 - and the vertical motion over time with
616:34 - the j component
616:40 - so now that we have our equation we can
616:43 - answer questions
616:44 - such as finding
616:47 - the maximum height
616:58 - if i'm interested in the maximum height
617:01 - all i really care about
617:03 - is the component that describes the
617:05 - height
617:06 - and that height is going to be at its
617:09 - maximum point when the velocity
617:11 - is zero or
617:14 - as we know in terms
617:18 - versus put on velocity equals zero
617:22 - or in terms of what we talked about in
617:23 - calc one the maximum height
617:26 - is when the first derivative
617:29 - s prime of t is equal to 0.
617:33 - and we particularly only care about the
617:36 - y
617:36 - component because we just want to know
617:37 - how far vertically it is so we're going
617:39 - to
617:40 - look just at the 300
617:45 - t minus 16 t squared
617:49 - and we're going to take its derivative
617:51 - which is 300 minus 32 t
617:56 - and set that equal to zero
618:00 - which is a quick solve 300 equals 32 t
618:04 - and dividing by 32 t is equal to about
618:09 - 9.375
618:13 - so at 9.375 seconds
618:17 - this cannonball has reached its maximum
618:20 - height
618:22 - but the question wanted us to actually
618:24 - find the maximum height
618:26 - not just the time when it occurs so what
618:28 - we need to do is plug that time
618:32 - in to the position vector to see how
618:35 - high it actually
618:36 - is so we've got 300
618:40 - times 9.375
618:47 - minus 16 times 9.37
618:51 - squared and if i work that out on my
618:55 - calculator we should get 14.06.25
619:00 - feet so it shoots from 100 feet
619:05 - up another 1400 feet
619:08 - into the air at its maximum height after
619:11 - 9.375 seconds
619:15 - if i was also interested in how far
619:19 - horizontally this reaches over the water
619:21 - we could plug that 9.375
619:24 - into the x component or the i component
619:28 - to see how far horizontally over the
619:31 - water
619:32 - we are but the question didn't ask about
619:34 - that
619:35 - so let's move on to question c
619:42 - question c i want to know how long
619:47 - until it hits
619:50 - the water
619:59 - i'm going back to my picture
620:04 - cannonball hits the water all the way
620:05 - out on the right side here
620:10 - what we know there is the y component
620:13 - the vertical distance is not zero
620:16 - because zero is when it
620:17 - hits the same level of
620:20 - as the original cannon we've got to drop
620:23 - another 100 feet down
620:24 - so we actually are asking when
620:28 - does the vertical component
620:37 - equal negative 100 100 feet below the
620:40 - cliff
620:43 - and we know that the vertical component
620:45 - is 300
620:46 - t minus 16 t squared
620:50 - so we want to know when that equals
620:53 - negative 100.
620:58 - well putting things in order and moving
620:59 - the 100 to the other side actually let's
621:02 - make everything positive let's move
621:03 - everything to the right side
621:05 - when we do we get 0 equals 16 t squared
621:09 - minus 300 t minus
621:12 - 100 and we know we can solve this using
621:17 - the quadratic formula
621:19 - t is equal to the opposite of b plus or
621:21 - minus the square root of
621:24 - b squared minus 4 a
621:27 - c all over 2 times
621:31 - a although
621:34 - we know that we want time to be a
621:36 - positive number so we're probably
621:38 - not going to need to worry about the
621:39 - subtraction that's probably going to
621:40 - give us a negative number
621:42 - and so when i put this in my calculator
621:45 - we get 19.08
621:50 - seconds
621:53 - which means putting our answers together
621:55 - after nine
621:56 - and nine seconds and change the
621:58 - cannonball reaches its maximum height
622:01 - and then after 19 seconds and change the
622:03 - cannonball has crash-landed
622:05 - into the water
622:11 - well if it crash lands into the water
622:13 - what i might be interested in as a
622:14 - military personnel
622:15 - is how far out
622:20 - to see
622:24 - will the cannonball
622:30 - travel in other words what is my range
622:34 - with my cannonball on shore here
622:38 - well we just found out in part c that it
622:40 - hits the wall hits the bottom
622:42 - or hits the water at 19.08
622:46 - seconds and we're asking how far
622:49 - out does the cannonball travel
622:51 - horizontally
622:53 - that's going to be the x component this
622:56 - time we're going to be
622:57 - interested in the 300t divided by the
623:00 - square
623:01 - or times the square root of x
623:05 - so 19.08 seconds in
623:08 - the x component
623:12 - or the i component
623:16 - so the i component then is 600 times
623:20 - time and we just found out time was
623:22 - 19.08 seconds
623:25 - times the square root of 3.
623:28 - plugging that in the calculator we end
623:31 - up with 9914.26
623:36 - feet the cannonball can travel
623:40 - just shy of 10 000 feet in those 19
623:43 - seconds
623:44 - when it crashes into the water
623:50 - so today we're looking at an application
623:52 - of these vector valued functions
623:53 - motion in space we're basically taking
623:56 - our vectors which represent the position
623:59 - velocity and acceleration in each
624:01 - direction
624:03 - knowing that the velocity is the
624:05 - derivative of the position
624:06 - the accelerations the derivative of the
624:08 - velocity and if we're also interested in
624:11 - general speed
624:12 - that's not a vector it's a scalar it's
624:14 - the magnitude of the velocity vector
624:17 - take a look at the assignment practice a
624:19 - few of these and we will see you in
624:20 - class to discuss them further

calculus 3 calculus 3 takes a look at some different applications and more advanced uses of derivatives and integrals the actual calculus part of finding derivatives and finding integrals we're very comfortable with at this point we know how to do it all now we're going to see some uses of it and chapters five and six we're going to look at together and they look at these things called sequences and series we've got to lay a little bit of foundation with sequence in series first and then we'll start to see how the calculus plays into these so first to start this whole conversation off we're going to talk about sequences as we answer the question how do we work with sequences and really what a sequence is is an ordered list of numbers so for example 1 4 9 16 we say the first number is one the second number is four the third number is nine the fourth number is 16 they're in order in fact we usually label them a sub 1 is the first number a sub 2 is the second number a sub 3 is the third number and a sub 4 is the fourth number and so on well with calculus we're often interested in the infinite so let's take a look at what is called an infinite sequence the idea of an infinite sequence is the sequence really never ends it starts with the first term then you'll see the second term then you'll see the third term and will keep going on and on and on forever there's no last term there's a first term but no last term and we'll often express the infinite sequence in one of two ways we can use what's called an explicit formula which can define each term you'll often see a sub n is equal to some function that defines each term at that function so if we want the fifth term a sub 5 we would just plug 5 into the function so for example in the sequence i have up above 14916 you might notice those are all the perfect squares so we could express that as a sub n equals n squared and then when i want a sub 1 that's in the first term is 1 squared or 1. when i want the second term we plug 2 in we have 2 squared which is 4. when i want the third term we want three squared which is nine we're just plugging the subscript into the function to find out what that term is this way we could quickly find the tenth term by plugging 10 in 10 squared is a hundred that's an explicit formula and we could keep going on and on and on with those but another way to express them is what's called a recurrence relation which can define each term based on a previous term so for example we might say okay the first term is equal to one and then the nth term is equal to the previous term a sub n minus one plus 2 n minus 1. so to get the next term we have to know the previous term and so we can build this recurrence relation one term at a time based on what happened previously so here for example a sub 1 we already know is 1. so a sub 2 the second term is the previous term which is 1 plus 2 times the term number which is 2. minus one this makes the second term four if i want the third term a sub three we take the previous term which was four plus two times the term number three minus one and this becomes four plus six minus one which is nine and what you might notice is we're really building the same sequence this is the perfect squares 1 4 9 the next one is going to be 16. so there's different ways to represent the same sequence both explicitly and as a recurrence relation in terms of the previous terms now there are a couple sequences that are very important to us and so we're going to look at them separately we're going to look at what's called the arithmetic sequence and the idea of the arithmetic sequence is we have a common difference added to the previous term so for example i might have the number 5 then 8 then 11 then 14 and so on and what you see is happening in the sequence is we have a common difference of three that's being added to each term to get to the next term five plus three is eight eight plus three is eleven eleven plus three is fourteen we're adding three to get each term and we can represent an arithmetic sequence here with recursion by saying okay the first term is equal to five so the nth term is equal to the previous term and as we said above we're just going to always add three to the previous term maybe we could generalize this and say the first term is the first term whatever that is and the next term is the previous term plus that common difference although we also know how to express this with an explicit formula the explicit formula is going to be that any given term is equal to what we really have is a linear relationship we're going by three each time we really have a y equals mx plus b situation where we can take the common difference as our slope and we're going to have to say n minus 1 plus the yintercept or the starting value of 5. now we have to do n minus 1 instead of n with this y equals mx plus b because we don't call the first term the zeroth term but the yintercept is the zeroth term so we're kind of staggered off by one unit so what we really have is our slope or common difference and we have our yintercept or our starting number often we call that v so maybe generally we would say a sub n is equal to the common difference times n minus 1 plus the first term that's the arithmetic sequence another important sequence though that we work with is called the geometric sequence if the arithmetic sequence has a common difference that's always added the geometric sequence has a common ratio that is multiplied so for example we've got 4 negative 12 36 negative 108 and so on what you see here is from to move from one term to the next term to the next term we have a common ratio that we're multiplying by we're multiplying each term by negative three to get the next term 4 times negative 3 is negative 12 negative 12 times negative 3 is 36 and so on well if i wanted to express this with a recurrence relationship we again will say well the first term is equal to four and then to get that oops sorry the first term not the nth term the first term is equal to four and then to get the nth term just take the previous term n minus 1 and multiply by that common difference of negative 3. maybe generally we say the first term is the first term and the nth term is that common ratio times the previous term but we can also express this with an explicit formula here we're multiplying by the same number over and over again repeated multiplication we should know is an exponential so we can take our first term times the ratio to the n minus 1 power telling us we multiply by negative 3 over and over and over again here we have to do n minus 1 because the 4 the first term a sub 1 is not multiplied by negative 3. so if we plug 1 in for the n you'll notice 1 minus 1 is 0 negative 3 to the 0 is 1 and we're just left with 4 for the first term so we've got to be careful sometimes with that n minus 1 bit so kind of generally an explicit formula for a geometric sequence is the first number times the ratio to the n minus 1 gives us that geometric sequence we might even label that the 4 is the first term and the 3 is the ratio okay so if that's a geometric sequence we're ready to actually start combining what we know about arithmetic and geometric and also pattern recognition we're going to see if we can build and find explicit formulas and as we do this our general strategy is to just look for patterns and do a little guess and check because sometimes you have to try stuff is the exponent in is it n minus 1 is it in plus 1 let's guess and check a few and see how we do so for example if i have negative onehalf comma twothirds comma negative threefourths comma fourfifths negative five sixth we're going to break this down and see what we observe first thing i observe is it's alternating it's going from negative to positive to negative to positive to negative and the way we can generate an alternating sequence like this is we just take negative 1 raised to an exponent now i always check the first term the first term is negative so if i plug 1 in for n negative 1 to the first power is negative if the first term was positive we'd need to use n plus one so that we shift the negative sign down one so the first thing we saw is that we're alternating second thing i observe here is i just look at the numerators the numerators are counting 1 2 3 4 5 and so on well what we see is the first term is a numerator of one the second term has a numerator of two the third is three the fourth is four that's just n the term number is the numerator one two three 4 5. when i look at the denominators they're a little different the denominators go 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 five six i see the denominators are kind of a shift of one they don't start the first term doesn't start at one the first term starts at two it's always one more than the term number it's n plus one so the fifth term has a denominator of six one more than that and so when i put it all together what we end up with is that the nth term is alternating negative 1 to the n times the numerator of n divided by the denominator of n plus 1. and this becomes the explicit formula for our series let's try another one see if we can continue finding these patterns let's do threefourths ninesevenths twentyseven over ten eightyone over thirteen and so on if i look just at the numerators again the numerators are three nine twenty seven eighty one what i see is those are powers of three three to the first three to the second three to the third three to the fourth and that exponent is always matching the term numbers so three to the n seems to create my numerators so for the fourth term three to the fourth is eightyone in the numerator in the denominator we've got 4 7 10 13 4 7 10 13. what i noticed there is we are adding 3 to get the next term if we're adding 3 to get the next term what we actually have is an arithmetic sequence my arithmetic sequence says i can take the common difference of three times n minus one plus the starting number of four well let's simplify if i distribute the three three n minus three plus four combining like terms we have three n plus one so when i combine this together any term the numerator is 3 to the n the denominator is 3n plus 1. and we've got an explicit formula for what's going on with this sequence let's do another example then let's try 2 over 2 i know it's not reduced but we're going to go with it negative 4 over 10 12 over 50 and negative 48 over 250 and so on again the first thing that i'll notice on something like this is we're going from positive to negative to positive to negative we're alternating again to get an alternating sequence we take negative one to some exponent the problem is is we've got our first term second term third term fourth term notice if we use the term number of 1 plugging 1 in for n negative 1 to the first power is negative 1. our first term is not negative our first term is positive we've got the wrong signs we're set up for negative positive negative positive and this one's positive negative positive negative so to shift by 1 we just need to add 1 to the exponent now when we plug 1 in we get 1 plus 1 is 2 and negative 1 squared is a positive 1 and we're set up for a positive negative alternation let's look at the numerators 2 4 12 48 to go from 2 to 4 you might notice we multiply by 2 but from 4 to 12 we multiply by 3 and from 12 to 48 we multiply by four we're multiplying by one more number to get to 48 we have four times three times two to get to twelve we have three times two notice that counting down of multiplication we should recognize that as a factorial to get the fifth term it should be five times four times three times two times one however this doesn't quite work because the first term isn't one the first term is two plugging 1 and 1 factorial is 1 how do we get a 2 well let's shift by multiplying that by 2. let's see if that works let's test that out on the third term the third term has a numerator of 12. well 3 factorial is 3 times 2 times 1 which is 6 times 2 is 12 and it looks like we've got our numerators figured out all that's left to look at then is the denominator the denominators are 2 10 50 250 2 10 50 250 and what you might see there is we seem to be multiplying by five every time we know that if we're multiplying by 5 every time that's a geometric sequence where we take our first term times the ratio to the n minus 1. and now if we put all of that together we can say the nth term is negative 1 to the n plus 1 times 2 n factorial over 2 times 5 to the n minus 1. but one thing you might notice we've got twos in both the numerator and denominator we can divide those twos out so our reduced formula then becomes negative one to the n plus one n factorial over five to the n minus one so that's kind of how we can play and observe patterns in order to find the nth term of any geometric or any sequence really whether it's geometric arithmetic or neither but sometimes we're more interested in as these terms go out as these terms get to the infinitieth term kinda what's the last term approaching we call this the limit of the sequence are the terms getting closer and closer to some number are they asymptotically getting closer to some value or what is the infinitieth term well to do that we will say if the limit as n goes to infinity of a sub n of all the terms is equal to some limit l that means the sequence is approaching l as in becomes large if this happens if it approaches a specific limit we say then the sequence is convergent or the sequence converges to a specific number kind of the opposite case then is if the limit as n goes to infinity of the terms does not approach a value l it is called a divergent sequence let's do some examples got quite a few of these to look at let's take the explicit formula of one minus one half raised to the n power well if we take the limit as n goes to infinity of one minus one half to the n power we end up with one minus and one half times one half times one half is getting smaller and smaller and smaller that's approaching zero and so one minus zero equals one therefore as n gets really large these terms are getting closer and closer to one we can say that this series converges or the sequence converges sorry converges to one let's try the sequence one plus three n well if we take the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 plus 3n well we know that becomes 1 plus 3 times as n gets huge it becomes infinity basically these numbers are just going to get bigger and bigger because we're always just adding 3 each time this sequence diverges because it goes off to infinity how about the sequence three n to the fourth minus seven n squared plus five over six minus four n to the fourth well if we took the limit as n goes to infinity of that entire thing we know from our work with limits that the largest exponent is going to take over and that largest exponent is the fourth powers and basically the fourth powers take over and we get three over negative four and this series does converge i'm sorry the sequence does converge to negative threefourths now we have a good friend named l'hopital that can help us with these as well let's say we've got a sequence that's two to the n power over n squared we would try and take the limit as n goes to infinity of 2 to the n over n squared to see if it approaches a value but the numerator goes off to infinity and the denominator goes off to infinity so what we can do is we can apply l'hopital's rule and take the derivative of the numerator and denominator and see what limit that gives us the derivative of 2 to the n is 2 to the n times the natural log of 2 over the derivative of n squared is 2n but those still are each going off to infinity so that doesn't help us so i guess we'll take another derivative so we have the limit as n goes to infinity the derivative of 2 to the n is still 2 to the n natural log of two times the constant natural log of two all over the derivative of the denominator which is two and now what you see happening is the numerator natural log of 2 squared that's just a constant divided by 2 that's just a constant but this numerator 2 to the n goes off to infinity we have infinity divided by 2 which is still infinity so this series or this sequence diverges the sequence diverges because it goes to infinity let's do one more with our friend l'hopital let's say the nth term is five n squared plus one over e to the n again the numerator is off to infinity and the denominator is off to infinity so we can use l'hopital's rule to say that the limit as n goes to infinity is the derivative 10 n over the derivative e to the n but as n goes to infinity these are still both going off to infinity so we'll do l'hopital's rule again the limit as n goes to infinity of 10 over e to the n and now when we plug infinity in e to the infinity is infinity we're taking 10 divided by a very large number basically we end up with zero this sequence converges it's a convergent series now sometimes we can't just take the limit very clearly and see what it's approaching so we need a slightly different strategy and there is another nice strategy that we can use sometimes not always but it works out nice when it does with what are called bounded sequences and the idea of a bounded sequence is all the terms are smaller than a constant that's called bounded above because they're never going to be bigger than this constant number and or all the terms are larger than a constant and that's what we call bounded below for example a sub n equals 1 over n is bounded above by one and below by zero what you see is the first term when we plug one it is one over one which is one then it's onehalf onethird onefourth onefifth they're gonna get smaller and smaller but they're never gonna get to zero so it's always smaller than one bounded above by one but always bigger than zero bounded below by zero and this idea of being bounded is very useful because of what we call the monotone convergence theorem if we are bounded above means i'm never larger than some number and increasing so i'm always getting larger then the sequence converges kind of visually what we're talking about is let's say we're bounded above by some constants we'll call it c my series is always increasing but it's never going to get bigger than that constant you can see it's going to kind of converge to that constant it's approaching some number and really the opposite is also true if we are bounded below and decreasing then the sequence converges and visually that's almost the same thing we've got some constant c and the series is always decreasing i'm sorry the sequence is always decreasing but it's never going to pass that c it's going to get closer and closer to that c we see it converges at that point let's do one example where we can see this work out let's say a sub n is equal to 4 to the n over n factorial okay what we'll do then is we'll look at the next term to see if it's getting smaller or getting bigger the next term oops the next term a sub n plus one is equal to four to the n plus one over n plus one factorial but we can break that up a little bit 4 to the n plus 1 is really 4 times 4 to the n over and n plus 1 factorial is really the n factorial or let's if we break it out into its terms the first term is n plus one break it out into its factors not terms times the next term is n then n minus 1 n minus 2 that's really n factorial which means we've broken this up into two fractions we have 4 over n plus 1 times 4 to the n over n factorial what we see is we're taking the previous term and multiplying it by four over n plus one when we multiply by 4 over n plus 1 with large numbers of n because we're always interested at infinity if n is large 4 over n plus one we're really multiplying by a really small number we're multiplying by four over infinity we're we're not really multiplying by much it's always going to be positive four over n plus one is getting smaller but never negative this means we are bounded below by zero and decreasing each term is smaller than the previous term because we multiply by some fraction four over a large number and it's smaller and smaller and smaller and it's decreasing decreasing decreasing but it's never going to pass zero so therefore by the monotone convergence theorem we know therefore the sequence converges and that's how we can use the monotone convergence theorem so this is a little introduction to sequences to in our next video we're going to look at what we can do with sequences in a little bit more of a useful fashion but today we're just trying to get familiar with using those sequences expressing them as an explicit formula finding out if they converge so take a look at your homework practice a few of these and we'll discuss them more in class now while sequences are very interesting to take a look at what we're more interested in with calculus is what are called series specifically infinite series so our question is going to be how do we work with infinite series and first let's define what exactly we mean by an infinite series basically a series is a sum of a sequence it is a sum of an infinite number of terms and we'll write it with this notation we'll take the sum as our n goes from 1 to infinity of each of the terms a sub n which basically means we take the first term and add the second term and add the third term and just keep adding all the way up to infinity kind of an example of this might be to say that the sum of some number of terms is equal to the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of maybe n over n plus one so if i want the first sum that's just the sum of the first term the first term is one over one plus one which is really just saying one half or as a decimal 0.5 the second sum then says take the first term which was one half and add the second term which now is putting two in for n two over two plus one or one half plus two thirds which is equal to about 1.17 and change so if i want the third sum that means we're going to add the first three terms the first term was one half plus the second term was twothirds plus the third term which is three over three plus one or one half plus two thirds plus three fourths now my sum is equal to about 1.92 and change and we could keep doing this but ultimately what we're interested in is if these are kind of the partial sums the first sum the second sum the third sum we're interested in kind of what happens with the entire sum so we've got these things called the kth partial sum we'll call it s sub k is equal to the sum as n goes from 1 to k instead of infinity of each of the individual terms well if the partial sum diverges goes to infinity then the whole series will diverge as well and if the partial sum converges then the whole sum or the whole series will converge as well let's take a look at what that means in an example we've been talking about the sum as n goes from one to infinity of n over n plus one and uh we found out that the sum of the first term was equal to one half the sum of the second term was one half plus two thirds the sum of the first three terms was one half plus twothirds plus threefourths and the sum of the fourth term is onehalf plus twothirds plus threefourths plus fourfifths and so on and what we're interested in is if we kept going what would we know about the kth sum does it converge or diverge to a specific value well what i notice is if i look at each one of these terms they're either one half or bigger than a half one half or bigger and bigger than a half onehalf and bigger and bigger and bigger than a half what i could say is that the first term is greater than equal to onehalf times the number of terms which is one therefore the second one is going to be greater than or equal to onehalf times the two terms because twothirds is bigger than the onehalf and then the third series is onehalf times three we've got one half times the three terms but our answer is going to be bigger and similarly we're going to be bigger than one half times the fourth term which means ultimately the last k is going to be greater than or equal to one half times the k number of terms but here's the catch with that if i were to take the limit of this stuff the limit as that k term goes to infinity of one half of k we know that is equal to infinity because we're just taking one half times a large number it's still a large number therefore we can conclude that this series is unbounded and that the sum as n goes from one to infinity of n over n plus 1 is just going to keep getting larger and larger and larger ultimately this series diverges because the kth term diverges but this is not always the case let's take a look at another example let's take a look at the sum as n goes from one to infinity of one over n times n plus one to get an idea of an example of what's happening let's take the individual first few sums the first sum is just the first term 1 over 1 times 2. which is one half the second sum is equal to that first term of one half plus one over two times three which turns out to be onehalf plus 1 6 which is equal to twothirds the third sum is the twothirds the prior sums plus the third term which is one over three times four or two thirds plus one twelfth which is equal to three fourths and with this one you might start to notice a pattern approaching for what each term is equal to can you tell what the fourth sum is going to be 3 4 plus the 1 over four times five is equal to three fourths plus one over twenty which turns out to be four fifths did you catch the pattern the kth term is going to be equal to notice our numerators are always equal to the term number k over the denominators are one more than the term number k plus 1. so this time if i were to take the limit of that stuff as k goes to infinity as we get to the infinitieth term of k over k plus 1 we know the ks are going to get really large the plus 1 isn't going to really matter and this is ultimately going to be 1. therefore we know that the sum as n goes from one to infinity not just k of one over n times n plus one is equal to one therefore i know this series converges basically as we get more and more terms added in we're going to get closer and closer to the number one so we converge that's kind of a really brief introduction to deciding if series converge or diverge i want to talk about three special series that come up quite a bit as we work through series and the first one is one of the most famous series of calculus it is called the harmonic series and the harmonic series is the sum as n goes from one to infinity of one over n basically it's one over one or one plus one over two plus one over three plus one over four plus one over five one over six and so on and so forth we should recognize this harmonic series quickly as we continue to study in calculus here well let's take a look at what's happening with that harmonic series first let's take a look at the first sum well the first sum is one over one that's just one the second sum is one plus one over two the third sum is one plus one half plus one third and the fourth sum is one plus one half plus one third plus one fourth and now what i want to do is stop here for a moment and take a look at these last two terms onethird plus onefourth notice onethird is bigger than onefourth each term is bigger than the next term after it which means this is bigger than onefourth plus onefourth if i replace the onethird with something smaller the onefourth we end up with something smaller well onefourth plus onefourth is onehalf so the sum of the first terms is greater than one plus onehalf and i'm going to say onehalf times two because we've got the first half and then the next one's bigger than another onehalf similarly if i kept going all the way down to the eighth sum the eighth sum is one plus onehalf plus onethird plus onefourth plus onefifth plus onesixth plus oneseventh plus oneeighth and we've already established that onethird plus onefourth that part is greater than onehalf but what's interesting is if i looked at all the other terms the next four terms what i have is that the onefifth plus onesixth plus oneseventh plus 1 8 1 8 being the smallest meaning all four of those are bigger than if they had all been replaced with 1 8 plus 1 8 plus 1 8 plus 1 8 and 4 8 adds up to one half so the eighth sum is greater than one plus one half times three because we've got a half another half and the next four terms add up to a half and in fact in general if we were to continue this pattern out s sub 2 to the n power it has to be a power of two notice the ones we played with were the fourth power and the eighth power the next one half would come off of the sixteenth power but it will always be greater than one plus one half times whatever that exponent is on the two so for example with the eighth sum eight is two to the third we had three one halves multiplied together which means on the sixteenth there'll be four onehalfs added to the one we said though if we can take the limit as n goes to infinity of the sum which is one plus one half of n this one gets there really slowly but as the n gets larger and larger and larger half of infinity is still infinity and if you add one you still get infinity so therefore the partial sums diverge to infinity which means the big idea in fact let's change colors we'll do this in brown therefore the harmonic series also diverges to infinity the sum is n goes from one to infinity of one over n which is one plus one half plus onethird plus onefourth and so on is going to equal to infinity the harmonic series diverges this is one of the most important series of calculus and we should recognize that whenever we have the sum of one over n it will always go to infinity very slowly but it still diverges so that's the first important series the harmonics series the second of three important series i want you to see today are what is called the geometric series and it comes from the geometric sequence the geometric sequence was some number then some number times the ratio then some number times the ratio squared because we kept multiplying by that ratio and so the geometric series says we're going to add those all together a plus a times r plus a times r squared plus a times r cubed in other words we're taking the sum as n goes from one to infinity of a times r to the n minus one it turns out and the proof is a lot more involved but it turns out that this geometric series will diverge actually i'll write the series again here because we're going to highlight this is very important the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of a times r to the n minus 1. it will diverge if the absolute value of r the common ratio is greater than or equal to 1. and if the absolute value of the ratio is less than one it converges to whatever a divided by one minus r is so the geometric series which we should recognize diverges if our ratio is greater than or equal to one and it converges if the ratio is less than one let's take a look at some examples let's take a look at the sum as n goes from one to infinity of negative three to the n plus one over four to the n minus one we have to be careful here because this isn't quite a geometric series yet let's take a look at what this series is doing and see if we can convert it into the right form of the geometric series so starting when n is one we end up with negative three squared over four to the zero power plus when n is 2 we have negative 3 cubed over 4 to the first power plus we've got negative 3 to the fourth over 4 to the second power and so on and so forth which means what we really have four to the zero is just one so this is really just saying negative three squared plus negative 3 that negative 3 squared gets multiplied by another negative 3 over 4. plus then that negative 3 squared is multiplied this time by a negative 3 over 4 twice giving us a total of 4 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator and so on which means really what we have is positive 9 plus 9 times negative 3 4 plus 9 times negative 3 4 squared plus and so on and what we see is the starting value for this series is nine and the ratio that we're being multiplied by is negative threefourths the negative threefourths squared the negative threefourths cubed and so on because that ratio is smaller than 1 the absolute value is smaller than 1 we know it converges to the starting value over one plus or actually one minus the ratio which is negative threefourths well let's clean up that fraction by multiplying by 4 all the way across and we get 36 over 4 plus 3 or 36 over 7. so this series as it gets closer and closer to infinity is ultimately going to converge to 36 sevenths getting closer and closer because the ratio is smaller than one or the absolute value of the ratio let's compare that to the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of e to the 2n now i could rewrite this because that e to the 2n is really e squared to the n power as the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of e squared raised to the n power what we see here is we're multiplying each term gets multiplied by e squared and then e squared and then times an e squared what we're really doing is we've got a ratio of e squared being multiplied over and over again the problem is e squared is greater than one whenever the ratio is greater than one we know the entire series diverges to infinity so that's the geometric series it diverges if the absolute value of the ratio is greater than one and it converges if the absolute value of the ratio is less than one one last series i want to talk about it's called the telescoping series this one doesn't come up much but when it does it's really nice it is a series where most terms subtract out what i mean is in general we've got the sum as n goes from one to infinity of one term minus the next term that comes after it in other words what you end up with is the first term minus the second term and then when n is two we get plus the second term minus the third term and then when n is three we do plus the third term minus the fourth term and so on and so forth all the way up to basically infinity and what you see happening is the second subtracts out with the next and then the next one subtracts out with the next one and so on until we end up with the kth partial sum is equal to the first term minus the last term well if the limit as k goes to infinity of b sub k converges in other words that last term is approaching a specific number not infinity or negative infinity then the partial sum also converges so if i have a telescoping series where we're subtracting out the next term it's going to basically come out to the first term minus the last term if the limit converges so for example if we're working with the sum as n goes from one to infinity of the cosine of one over n minus the cosine of one over n plus one if i recognize we've got a telescoping series that we're subtracting the cosine of the next term every two terms is going to subtract out all the way down to the kth term which is the cosine of the first term 1 over 1 which is 1 minus the cosine of the last term which is 1 over k plus 1. well if i think about the limit as k goes to infinity of the cosine of one over k plus one ultimately as k gets huge we have one divided by a huge number which is zero and the cosine of 0 is 1. so overall this series converges to the cosine of one minus the very last term at infinity is going to be one and we found the sum of this telescoping series let's do one more let's do the sum as n goes from one to infinity of e to the one over n minus e to the one over n plus one notice we are subtracting the next term n plus one so then i know the k partial sum is e to the one over one or e to the first power everything else subtracts out all the way down down to the last one of e to the one over k plus one so what we think about is what is the limit as k goes to infinity of the last term e to the 1 over k plus 1. well again 1 over k plus 1 ends up going to 1 over infinity which becomes 0 and e to the 0 is 1. and so what we find out is if that converges then the entire sum converges the sum is equal to e minus the last term here is approaching one and that gives us our telescoping series so we've taken a look at these infinite series and begun to play with them we talked about the harmonic series geometric series and telescoping series three important series as we continue moving forward and we're playing with this idea of when does it converge and when does it diverge in our future lessons we're going to talk about some tests we can do to get a better idea about when it's converging and diverging but for now take a look at your homework assignment practice those and come to class with questions as we're working with series the big question we're really interested in is does the series go to infinity or does the series add up to a finite number so that's going to be our question that drives us today how do we know if a series converges meaning goes to a specific number or diverges meaning goes to infinity and actually this is the question that's going to keep with us throughout this entire unit does the series converge or does the series diverge we're actually more interested in whether or not it converges or diverges then what it actually adds up to so the first way we can do this and this is really the first test we should always do when trying to decide if a series converges or diverge it's called the divergence test it's a quick test that will tell us if a series diverges or if we're not sure what we do is we consider the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of a sub n we're looking at some series some sum if the limit as n goes to infinity of those individual terms is not equal to zero basically what that means is as we get up to infinity are we adding numbers are we adding zero if we're adding zero it may or may not converge but if we're adding anything else but 0 it's definitely not going to converge because it's always going to be getting bigger and bigger in fact that also works if the limit does not exist or if the limit is infinity then the sum as n goes from one to infinity of a sub n diverges so if the terms aren't ultimately going to zero then the series is not going to converge let's take a look at some examples let's first try the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of n over three n minus one well to use the divergence test to see what's happening we can take the limit as n goes to infinity of n over three n minus 1 and we know that the higher powers the n over 3n are going to take over and that's going to ultimately equal 1 3 which is definitely not equal to 0. in other words once we get out to enough terms we're basically doing plus onethird plus onethird plus onethird plus onethird and that's going to keep getting bigger and bigger so because that does not equal zero therefore we will say this series will diverge any time the limit as n goes to infinity of the individual terms is not zero it will diverge so if we try to find the sum as n goes from one to infinity of the cosine of one over n squared we can do the same thing we'll take the limit as n goes to infinity of the individual terms cosine of 1 over n squared well if n gets huge this becomes 1 over a huge number which basically means we're taking the cosine of 0 and we know the cosine of zero is equal to one which again is not equal to zero so eventually we're just doing plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one that's never going to settle out at a number therefore this series as well let's try one more example let's take the sum as n goes from one to infinity of n plus one over n squared minus three n plus one well again our strategy for the divergence test is we're going to see what happens with the limit as n goes to infinity of n plus 1 over n squared minus 3n plus 1. here you'll notice the n squared has the highest exponent so it's going to take over which means the denominator is going to become huge and we'll have a small number divided by a huge number which is 0. so now in the end this one is eventually doing plus 0 plus 0 plus 0. but here's the catch about the divergence test if the limit equals 0 that does not mean it converges because sometimes it will converge and sometimes it will diverge so when the limit equals zero we say the test is inconclusive when we're inconclusive we're going to have to do some other testing and that's really what the rest of this chapter is going to be about but for now we're just going to say inconclusive so that's the divergence test if it the limit as n goes to infinity of the individual terms goes to anything but 0 we know it diverges if it equals 0 we don't really know anything so we have another option to test and this is what is called the integral test by the way the integral test only works if all the terms are positive if we have negative terms the integral test will not work so alternating series don't work even if there's one term that's negative the integral test won't work but if all the terms are positive and we're looking at the sum as n goes from one to infinity of some series what we'll do is we will let the function f of n be equal to the individual terms and we will take the integral from some number any number we want up to infinity of f of n dn this integral and the original sum will either both converge or both diverge so if we can take the integral they will both do the same thing so if the integral equals infinity the sum equals infinity if the integral equals a number the sum also equals a number but they are not necessarily the same number it just means that they both converge to a number so let's take a look at some examples let's take a look at the sum as n goes from one to infinity of one over n to the fourth if we use the divergence test on this the limit as n goes to infinity we see a zero so that's inconclusive so what we'll do instead is we will use the integral tests to see if it tells us something we'll take the integral from let's go from the first term 1 to infinity and we don't like to integrate fractions so i'm going to write this as n to the negative 4 dn which we know is equal to n to the negative 3 divided by negative 3 which we know let's simplify that a little bit further we'll bring the n to the bottom so we've got negative 3 into the third and we're integrating from one to infinity well if we plug infinity in we get one divided by a huge number which is zero minus if we plug one in we get a negative onethird and minus a negative onethird is positive onethird and it equals onethird the number doesn't matter so much as the fact that it equals a po a number it doesn't equal infinity because the integral converges the sum also converges because both the integral and the sum are going to do the same thing let's take a look at one more of these examples let's take the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of n over three n squared plus one again the divergence test says that this is going to zero so it's inconclusive so let's try the integral test let's take the integral from one because that's the lower limit to infinity of n over three n squared plus one well we're kind of set up for a u substitution where u is three n squared plus one d u is six n so oops i forgot the dn so we'll multiply by six and we will multiply by one sixth and so that's going to give us 1 6 times the integral and let's go ahead and plug the limits in 3 times 1 squared plus 1 is 4 to infinity of 1 over udu which is equal to 1 6 natural log of u integrated from 4 to infinity but when we plug the infinity into the natural log the natural log always gets bigger and bigger we end up with infinity so the integral diverges to infinity and because both the integral and the series do the same thing if the integral diverges then the sum will also diverge and so we see here is a great example of the how the divergence test is inconclusive because both of these the limit was zero so we had to use a different test to decide one converged and the other diverged before we wrap up here though i want to talk about one special series and this is a series when we see it we're going to just recognize whether or not it converges or diverges it is called the p series a p series is a series of the form as the sum going from 1 to infinity of 1 over n to the p power if we were to do the integral test on this we would take the integral from one to infinity of one over n to the p d n or the integral from one to infinity of n to the negative p d n and the exponent property says we increase that exponent by one and we divide by the new exponent negative p plus one and if that's the case we're integrating from 1 to infinity when we plug that in what we really end up with is and this is going to be kind of loose notation here not quite correct we should be doing the limit as n goes to infinity but i'm just going to write infinity in for the n we get infinity raised to the negative p plus one over negative p plus one minus then when you plug one in one to any power is one over negative p plus one but the important thing to note here is infinity has an exponent of negative p plus one if this is in the numerator then the whole thing goes off to infinity but if that infinity ends up in the denominator the whole thing goes to 0 and it converges so this means it will diverge if the exponent negative p plus one is greater than 0 because if we have a positive exponent then it will diverge and if we solve this by subtracting 1 and dividing by negative 1 if p is less than 1 or really or equal to 1 because it is the harmonic series if it's equal to one we already know the harmonic series one over n diverges very slowly but it diverges and then the opposite is true that it converges if the exponent negative p plus 1 is negative which moves the infinity to the denominator or if we add 1 and divide by negative 1 if p is greater than 1. so this is kind of the important idea that the p series will diverge if p is less than one or equal to one let's go ahead and write the or equal to in there and it will converge if the exponent is greater than one and that can save us doing all the tests we just have to look at the exponent if we're actually working with a p series let's try some examples really quick to wrap up this video first let's consider the sum as n goes from one to infinity of one over n to the five thirds well this is a p series because it's one over n to some exponent and that five thirds is greater than one because it's greater than one we know it converges similarly we can look at the sum as n goes from one to infinity of one over n to the two fifths power we're looking at that exponent twofifths is less than one because it's less than one this p series diverges so this will be an important series to add to our other series that we're familiar with the harmonic series the geometric series the p series these are ones we should recognize really quickly when they converge and when they diverge so we're going to wrap up here give you a chance to practice some of these trying to to decide using the divergence test and the integral test or recognizing a p series does this series converge to a number we don't really care what number or does it diverge to infinity take a look at the practice and we will see you in class to discuss it further when working with theories and trying to decide if they converge or diverge we have the divergence test to see if it diverges and if that's inconclusive we can try the integral test however the integral test only works if all the terms are positive and if we can take the integral some integrals are difficult or impossible to take and so we need another method to try and determine if series converge or diverge if one of those first two fail and so one idea that might come up is to use a series we know to establish something about a series we don't know the question here is going to be can known series help determine convergence of an unknown series and obviously the answer is yes because that's what we're taking a look at so let's see about this first one called the comparison test the idea of the comparison test is if i know a series converges so we'll say if the sum as n goes from one to infinity of maybe the series b converges and i've got some other series where each term is smaller than the b term but still positive still greater than one then well if every term of a is smaller than b and b converges then the series a must also converge to something smaller than whatever the b converges to but again the important question is does it converge or not and we can kind of take the opposite logic as well let's say we've got a series that diverges the series that we know diverges maybe it's the harmonic series or something like that and every term of this series a sub n is bigger than every term of the series b which we know already goes to infinity which is also bigger than zero that's important these actually should have or equal two on them then well if series a is bigger than series b which is infinity series a must also diverge as well let's take a look at some examples where we can use this logic number three let's consider the sum as n goes from one to infinity of one over n to the fourth plus three n squared plus two and with the divergence test this clearly goes to zero but the integral of this is going to be very difficult to take so let's see if we can compare it to something we know we know something about the sum as n goes from one to infinity of one over n to the fourth that's a power series where the exponent is bigger than one so it converges sometimes reciprocals are harder to think about so first i'll look at the fact that if i take n to the fourth and i add something to it and add something more to it that's going to be bigger than just the n to the fourth by itself well if we took the reciprocal of this inequality it's going to switch the direction of the inequality just going to show what we did there um off to the side here on the left 10 is bigger than 2. if we took the reciprocals 1 10 that would be smaller than the reciprocal onehalf when we take reciprocals the inequality switches direction so what we've shown is our series is smaller than a known series we know that known series converges and so then our series being smaller must also converge because it can't go to infinity if it's smaller than a convergent series let's try one more example let's consider the sum as n goes from one to infinity of one over the natural log of n again as n goes to infinity this goes to zero and so what i might try and say is the natural log of n compared to some either an n or an n squared or some other p series that we know well how does the natural log of n compare to n if i think briefly about the graphs natural log comes up and moves slowly but n is a straight line that's going to grow much faster the n is bigger than the natural log of n well if i took the reciprocals 1 over the natural log of n then must be bigger than 1 over n and 1 over n we know that's the harmonic series so it's going to diverge but if we've got something bigger than infinity it must also go to infinity it must also diverge as well so if we can find a series that is bigger than our series that converges we must also converge if we find a series that's smaller than our series that diverges we must also diverge the order's important because if i found something bigger that diverges that doesn't necessarily mean i diverge and if i find something smaller that converges that doesn't necessarily mean i converge so we need to make sure the order is right to make this comparison test work and sometimes it's not so clear from our comparison test exactly how the pieces come together so maybe a more powerful test will be what we call the limit comparison test and the limit comparison test says consider a sub n and b sub n are greater than zero for all n in other words we've got all positive terms if we were to divide them if we took the limit as n goes to infinity of their quotient a sub n divided by b sub n and that actually equals a limit but not zero maybe it equals four or two or one third one half if it equals a specific limit that's not zero then both converge or both diverge they both do the same thing if the limit equals a number besides zero if the limit equals zero though then we only know something if the denominator converges if the denominator converges that tells us the numerator also converges if the denominator diverges and we equal 0 we don't know anything it's inconclusive similarly if the limit of the quotient is equal to infinity and we add to that that b sub n the denominator diverges then the numerator will also do the same thing then a sub n diverges as well so what we can do is take a known series and divide by the known series and take the limit as n goes to infinity what we hope happens is that it equals a constant that's not equal to zero if that's the case they will both do the same thing whether it's converge or diverge if it does equal to zero we hope that denominator converges because then our numerator also converges if it goes to infinity we hope the denominator diverges because the numerator also diverges but if we don't get that second half then the test also is inconclusive and you have to use another test but let's see how we can use this test with some examples let's find the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of 3 over the square root of n minus 2. now i see that square root of the n in the denominator so i think okay let's compare it with 1 over the square root of n or 1 over n to the one half that's a p series it diverges because the exponent is smaller than one let's see what happens when we take the limit as n goes to infinity of our unknown series 3 over the square root of n minus 2 divided by our known series 1 over the square root of n well let's simplify that by multiplying by the square root of n on top and bottom when we do the square roots of n's divide out and we get the limit as n goes to infinity of 3 root n over the square root of n minus 2. and that's really nice because those square roots of n being the highest exponent are going to take over and we end up with three over one or just three because that three is not equal to zero they are going to both do the same thing so we said our comparison diverges therefore the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of 3 over the square root of n minus 2 doing the same thing also diverges when we equal a number not equal to 0 they both do the same thing let's try another example let's consider the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of 5 to the n plus 2 over 6 to the n divergence test the 6 to the n takes over it equals 0. the integral is difficult to take so let's try a comparison test let's try to compare it with kind of a simple form of the 5 to the n over 6 to the n which is 5 6 to the n plus 2 is probably not going to matter when we get off to infinity so it's probably going to behave similar to the 5 6. well 5 6 to the n is a geometric series where the r is less than one multiplying by 5 6 over and over and over again when the r is less than 1 we know that it converges so let's see what happens when we take the limit as n goes to infinity of what we don't know 5 to the n plus 2 over 6 to the n divided by what we do know 5 to the n over 6 to the n well uh we're dividing fractions so dividing fractions means we multiply by the reciprocal so we get 5 to the n plus 2 over 6 to the n times 6 to the n over 5 to the n 6 to the ends will reduce out and we get the limit as n goes to infinity of 5 to the n plus 2 over 5 to the n and as the ends get huge we see those 5 to the ends are going to take over ultimately the plus 2 is going to make very little difference and this will equal 1. which is not zero because it equals a number that's not zero they both numerator and denominator will do the same thing well we said it converges in the numerator in the denominator so therefore our unknown sum of five to the n plus 2 over 6 to the n also converges because our limit equals a number they both do the same thing let's try one more example let's take the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of the natural log of n divided by n squared well the natural log of n is smaller than n so if i pick something bigger we'd be thinking like n over n squared which is one over n so let's try that one over n let's compare it to one over n 1 over n is the harmonic series it diverges so let's see what happens when we take the limit as n goes to infinity of the natural log of n over n squared divided by the known series 1 over n multiplying by the reciprocal we get the natural log of n over n squared times n the n divides out with the n squared and so we get the limit as n goes to infinity of the natural log of n divided by n well both of those go off to infinity so let's try to l'hopital it to see if that can help us figure out what the limit as n goes to infinity the derivative of natural log of n is one over n the derivative of n is one and now if n goes to infinity if n goes to infinity we got one divided by a large number which is zero divided by one which is zero so remember our rule about zero if we equal zero we need the denominator to converge uhoh our denominator diverges so that is inconclusive that doesn't actually tell us anything so let's try a plan b uh 1 over n did not work so let's compare it maybe with one over n squared we know one over n squared converges because it's a p series where the p is greater than one so let's take the limit as n goes to infinity of the unknown natural log of n divided by n squared divided by one over n squared well this one's going to simplify quite nicely when we multiply by the reciprocal the natural log of n over n squared times n squared over 1. the n squareds divide out and we're left with the limit as n goes to infinity of the natural log of n which is infinity so we go up to our rule and if it equals infinity that's only useful if the denominator diverges well our denominator converges so this tells us nothing back to the drawing board so squared made us diverge first power made us converge let's go somewhere in the middle between one and two so we might try one over n to the three halves that's right in the middle it's still bigger than one is an exponent so it's a p series that converges so let's take i didn't cross off the last one that one was bad let's take the limit as n goes to infinity of the unknown series the natural log of n divided by n squared over the known series 1 over n to the 3 halves well if we multiply by the reciprocal we get the natural log of n over n squared times n to the three halves over one now when we reduce we're going to end up with a half left in the denominator so we have the limit as n goes to infinity of the natural log of n over n to the one half as you plug infinity in you'll notice the numerator is going to infinity and the denominator is going to infinity so we'll use l'hopital's rule which allows us to take the derivative of the numerator and denominator the derivative of natural log of n i'm just going to come down here to the next row limit as n goes to infinity the derivative of natural log of n is one over n the derivative of n to the one half pull out the one half and then subtract one from the exponent you get n to the negative one half that sticks it in the denominator and so we'll multiply by the reciprocal again one over n times two n to the one half all over one subtracting the exponents we get the limit as n goes to infinity of 2 over n to the onehalf reducing the exponents and now as n gets really really huge in that denominator we get two divided by a large number which is zero so we go back to our rule if it equals zero we're happy if the denominator converges here the denominator we used converges and so we finally have a solution because the denominator converges and we equal zero therefore the natural log of n over n squared also converges so we're not as flexible when the limit equals zero or infinity when it equals zero or infinity it either needs to converge or diverge depending on the direction we're at but if it equals any other number it's really convenient to use the limit comparison test because if it equals a number other than zero they both converge or both diverge working with these takes a little bit of practice identifying which which series to use in the denominator so practice a few of these take a look at the homework assignment we'll discuss them more and practice more in class up to this point we've been mainly working with series where the terms are all positive but when the terms are negative we have what's called an alternating series where we have positive and negative terms bouncing back and forth there's another strategy we can use to determine the convergence of an alternating series so our question for the day is how do we determine the convergence of an alternating series and first we'll just really define the alternating series a little clearer oh turn 18 series there's two types and they're almost identical uh if we have the sum as n goes from one to infinity of negative one to the n plus one times some other series basically what that does is when n is one we get one plus one which is two and negative one squared is a positive one so we just end up with uh the first b term but then when we go to the next one we end up with an odd exponent so we end up subtracting the second b adding the third b subtracting the fourth b and so on and so forth alternating between positive and negative the other type and it's really the same idea the difference is that the negative one just has an n power and what that does is it allows the first term to start out negative and then we add the second term subtract the third term add the fourth term and so on those are alternating series and an interesting question that can kind of come up out of this introduction of alternating series we've talked about the harmonic series which diverges to infinity what if we made the harmonic series into an alternating harmonic series in other words we were to take a look at the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of negative 1 to the n plus 1 over n because if we look graphically at what this does if we call this one over to the right the first term is going to be a positive one so we'll add one the second term is a negative onehalf so we subtract onehalf then the next term adds onethird and then we end up subtracting 1 4th and what you see is happening is we keep going back and forth but we don't go quite as far as we did last time and it looks like we're actually converging down to a point on the line and in fact it does the alternating harmonic series turns out to converge at the natural log of 2 and we can look at that a little more closely in class because there's some interesting stuff that happens there but for now what i want to point out if we change a divergent series like the harmonic into an alternating series sometimes it could turn out to be a series that actually converges but this is not always the case so we need some better rules to test the convergence of an alternating series and so we have what is called the alternating series test and the alternating series test says that an alternating series such as the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of negative 1 to the n plus 1 times sum b sub n terms converges if two things are true first each b sub n is positive and the n plus one term is smaller than the nth term in other words every term we go to next is smaller than the one before it and that's what happened with the alternating harmonic we didn't quite go back as far and then we didn't quite go back as far and we didn't quite go back as far and eventually that's going to pull us down to a point on the line so it each term needs to be smaller than the one before it and the other thing that's important and it's just the divergence test that the limit as n goes to infinity of b sub n has to equal 0. we have to pass the divergence test with the b sub n without the alternating part if that's true if each term is getting smaller and the divergence test works on the nonalternating part then the series will converge so let's take a look at some examples where we can use this alternating series test let's take a look at the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of negative one to the n plus one over n cubed well to do that we will consider n plus one and n ignoring the alternating part the negative 1 to the n plus 1. if we ignore the alternating part we end up with 1 over n plus 1 cubed and 1 over n cubed well if i think about the fact that n plus 1 cubed is going to be bigger than just n cubed because we've added one we've got a bigger number we're cubing the reciprocals then one over n plus one cubed must be smaller than one over n cubed in other words we've shown that the next term is smaller than the first term if that's the case the terms are getting smaller therefore we can say the series converges let's try another one let's try the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of negative 1 to the n times n over 2 to the n to use the alternating series test we consider the n plus one and the n to see if n plus one is smaller ignoring the alternating part we just have n plus one over two to the n plus 1 and just n over 2 to the n what i notice here is n does not grow nearly as fast as the denominators the denominators grow faster two to the fifth is a lot bigger than five two to the twelfth is a whole lot bigger than twelve the denominators are growing much larger so they're going to kind of take over so when we compare those denominators 2 to the n plus 1 is going to be bigger than just 2 to the n because we've added 1 to the exponent making it bigger so the reciprocals 1 over 2 to the n plus 1 must be less than 1 over 2 to the n therefore multiplying both top and bottom by n or n plus one they're basically the same amount we can conclude that n plus one over two to the n plus one is less than n over two to the n so we found out is that the next term is smaller than the first term and when that happens we know that we will ultimately converge with our alternating series so now that we've got some idea of this uh work with convergence and divergence with alternating series we're ready to talk about what's called absolute convergence versus what's called conditional convergence the idea behind absolute convergence is that the sum as n goes from one to infinity of your terms exhibits absolute convergence if the sum is in goes from one to infinity of the absolute value converges however we have conditional convergence if the sum as in goes from one to infinity of your terms exhibits conditional convergence if the sum is then goes from one to infinity of the original series converges but the sum as n goes from one to infinity of the absolute value diverges an example of number two here would be the harmonic series when the harmonic series is positive it diverges but when the harmonic series is alternating where we've got negatives and positives it does converge so we have conditional convergence with that example conditional convergence isn't very exciting to us because we're forced to use the alternating series test but what's really interesting is the fact that absolute convergence if the positive form in other words ignoring the alternating part if that converges it implies convergence in other words if the sum as in goes from one to infinity of the absolute value of a series converges then we know for sure that the sum as n goes from one to infinity of all the terms positive or negative also converges notice the opposite isn't true if the original converges does that mean the absolute value converges not necessarily the alternating harmonic is a great example of that but if the absolute value converges then we know the entire thing converges well what that means is if we can prove the absolute value converges we can then work with alternating series by using the other convergence test looking for absolute convergence so if we have maybe the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of the alternating negative 1 to the n over 4 n minus 1. we're going to take a look at the absolute value version of it which means we're going to really see if the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of 1 over 4 n minus 1 converges well i notice 1 over 4 n minus 1 is really similar to 1 over n which diverges that's the harmonic series so let's use the limit comparison test to see what happens when we divide these and take the limit as n goes to infinity we take the unknown one one over four n minus one over the known one one over four n multiplying by the reciprocal we have the limit as n goes to infinity of n over four n minus one we know from experience the ends take over and we get onefourth which is not zero or infinity therefore we conclude that they both do the same thing so because our one over n diverges therefore this one diverges absolutely which doesn't really tell us much we like it when it converges absolutely because then the original one converges but this one does not divert does not converge absolutely but it might converge conditionally so now we go to the alternating series test we will consider n plus 1 and n when we use n plus one we get one over four times n plus one minus one and one over four n minus one which if we simplify these that becomes one over four n plus four minus one is plus three and one over four n minus one well if we were to compare these denominators 4 n and 4n are the same so if i add 3 to 1 and subtract 1 from the other the one we added 3 to is going to be bigger so then the reciprocals one over four n plus three must be less than one over four n minus one and so what we've shown is that the next term is smaller than the first term if that's the case the alternating series will converge therefore it converges not absolutely because when we did the absolute value thing we diverged absolutely but we do converge conditionally similar to the harmonic series if it alternates it converges if it doesn't alternate it diverges so we've got conditional convergence here let's do another one example number two we're going to do the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of the sine of n over n cubed this doesn't look like an alternating series at first but if you think about sine of n sine of n goes from positive to negative to positive to negative oscillating between one and negative one so we're really going to end up with alternating signs here so what we'll do is we're going to compare it by getting rid of the negative part the sine is what makes it oscillate between 1 and negative 1. we can compare it with 1 over n cubed and that we know converges because it's a p series where the exponent is bigger than one all right let's compare it to the absolute value of the sine of n over n cubed because the absolute value forces everything to become positive we're looking for absolute convergence well if we do that compare it to having n cubed in the denominator the absolute value of sine is never going to be bigger than one which means our series every term is going to be less than or equal to one over n cubed so we've got a smaller series than a known conversion series therefore our series by the comparison test that we saw in the previous video the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of the absolute value of the sine of n over n cubed must converge if the absolute value converges then we have absolute convergence and the original series without the absolute value also converges so if we can prove the absolute value converges with either the integral test the comparison test the limit comparison test or another test then we have absolute convergence and the alternating series converges if the absolute value diverges then we check for conditional convergence by using the alternating series test so that's how we can work with alternating series take a look at practicing these again series take lots of practice to get comfortable with so practice practice practice come to class with questions and we'll talk about it more at that time as we wrap up chapter 5 we're going to ask kind of the last question which is what other tests do we have that can be used for convergence that's kind of been the theme of chapter five we started with the divergence test to see if the limit goes to anything but zero then it definitely diverges but if it goes to zero it's inconclusive so we could use the integral test if we could take the integral easily we could use a comparison test to see what's happening compared to a known series whether by dividing or being smaller or bigger than that known series we then looked at if we have an alternating series what we can do in terms of converging absolutely or if it doesn't converge absolutely does it converge conditionally because the terms are getting smaller each time and then to wrap it up we've got two more tests that i want to look at here today the first one is called the ratio test and the ratio test is particularly helpful with factorials if we have factorials in the problem you can pretty much bet the best way to get at convergence is by doing the ratio test and here's what the ratio test says we're going to let the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of all of our terms be the series that we want to see if it converges or and we're going to define greek letter rho it kind of looks like a p but it's a greek letter rho rho is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of the absolute value of the n plus one term divided by the n term and this is going to be useful because when we take that limit one of three things is going to happen if zero is less than or equal to rho which is less than oops not equal to just less than one if we get a number that's less than one for rho then the sum as n goes from one to infinity of the entire series converges absolutely positive or negative it will converge if rho is less than one if rho ends up being bigger than 1 then the series as n goes from 1 to infinity diverges this is because if we're dividing and the next term is bigger dividing will result in a bigger number than one however there's a problem that comes out of this test and that is if rho equals one we get no information it doesn't happen often but that's kind of the worst case scenario if rho ends up equaling one we need another test so let's see if we can do some examples with the ratio test and see how it works out let's start by doing the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of 3 to the n over n factorial i mentioned that this test is best with factorials so we define our rho as the limit as n goes to infinity of in the numerator we replace n with n plus one we have three to the n plus one actually let's do it this way over n plus 1 factorial and then the denominator is just the a sub n term which is 3 to the n divided by n factorial well if we simplify this by multiplying by the reciprocal we get rho is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of 3 to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 factorial times n factorial over 3 to the n which is very interesting because n plus 1 factorial represents n plus 1 times n times n minus 1 factorial multiplies by everything below it specifically i could write n plus 1 times everything below it which is n factorial which is nice because then the n factorials would divide out leaving behind an n plus one with the with the threes three to the n plus one over three to the n we can subtract the exponents and the three to the n divide out and we're just left with three so we have now the limit as n goes to infinity of three over n plus one and we know as n gets huge this becomes three divided by a huge number which is zero well if rho is zero our ratio test tells us in letter a up there that if rho is greater than or equal to zero therefore the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of 3 to the n over n factorial converges absolutely actually we could probably just say converges because there's no negative terms in this case but we did determine from the ratio test that this first series converges let's do another example let's look at the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity let's take n to the n power over n factorial let's see what happens there well now rho is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of the numerators the n plus one terms so it's n plus one to the n plus one power over n plus one factorial divided by the regular series n to the n power divided by n factorial well if we multiply by the reciprocal and i'm going to even break this up the n plus 1 factorial we're going to write that as n times in oops sorry we're going to write that as n plus 1 times n factorial that way it's going to match down there and the n plus 1 to the n plus 1 power i'm going to rewrite that as n plus 1 to the n times n plus 1. that way when you add the exponents you get that n plus one so now multiplying by the reciprocal we have n plus one to the n times n plus one over n plus 1 times n factorial times n factorial over n to the n power and that's nice because one of the n plus ones can divide out with the denominator the n factorials can divide out and we're just left with n plus one to the n limit as n goes to infinity n plus 1 to the n over n to the n power which if we play with this we get n to the infinity both of those are to the n powers so we have n plus 1 over n to the n power which is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity if i divide both terms by n we get 1 plus 1 over n raised to the n power but this guy the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 plus 1 over n to the n power should look familiar way back when we talked about limits we found out that the limit as n goes to infinity of 1 plus 1 over n to the n power that goes to e that's one way that we can define e is that limit right there so the whole thing's equal to e which is definitely greater than one it's almost three a little less than 3 and we know from the ratio test that if we're greater than 1 the series has to diverge so therefore the sum as n goes from one to infinity of n to the n over n factorial diverges to infinity so a lot of these we massage algebraically to reduce so we can figure out the limit let's do one that's an alternating series before we step away from the ratio test let's consider the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of negative 1 to the n times n factorial squared over 2 n factorial well row technically row we've been leaving it off on the past two but technically row says it's the absolute value of the quotient so because it's the absolute value of the quotient we don't really need to worry about the negative one to the n part because the absolute value will just always make it positive so really our numerator we've just got n plus one factorial squared over 2 times n plus 1 factorial all over n factorial squared divided by 2n factorial well as i simplify this the 2 times n plus 1 is really 2n plus 2 factorial so if we break that up counting down so that it will divide out with a 2n factorial that's really 2n plus 2 times 2n plus 1 times 2n factorial as it counts down similarly the n plus 1 factorial squared is an n plus 1 squared times n factorial squared just counting down and putting the squared on both parts because the whole thing is squared so when we multiply by the reciprocal oops i forgot the limit as n goes to infinity the limit as n goes to infinity of we have n plus 1 squared times n factorial squared divided by n factorial squared oops i'm getting ahead of myself finish out the first fraction divided by two n plus two times two n plus one times two in factorial and then multiply by the reciprocal which is 2n factorial over n factorial squared and let's see what we can divide out here the n factorial squareds are gone the two n factorials are gone and that's it so we've got the limit as n goes to infinity of and let's go ahead and multiply out to that numerator becomes n squared plus two n plus one multiplying out the denominator two n plus two times two n plus one is four n squared plus six n plus two and we know that the larger exponents are going to take over so it's going to become onefourth which is less than one and so the ratio test tells us that if we're less than one it's going to converge absolutely and we know if it converges absolutely it also converges for the actual series so the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of negative 1 to the n times n factorial squared over 2 n factorial converges absolutely so that is the ratio test really helpful with factorials because it allows us generally to reduce out the factorials by just breaking up maybe the n plus one from the n factorial maybe up to a couple terms and then if our row is less than one it converges absolutely if it's greater than one it diverges and we hope it doesn't equal one because then we have no information and we need another test a second test that's useful as we wrap up the chapter though is what's called the root test and the root test is really helpful with powers of n the reason it's helpful with powers of n is because it ultimately is going to take the nth root and get rid of that power of n so let's let the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of a sub n be what we're looking for trying to decide does it converge or diverge we're going to also define a row in this case but here rho is going to be equal to the limit as n goes to infinity it's a terrible infinity as n goes to infinity of the nth root of the absolute value of the a sub n term if rho equals that one of three things will happen very similar to the ratio test if zero is less than or equal to rho which is less than one then the series converges absolutely and if that row is greater than one then the series diverges and just like last time if rho is equal to 1 we have no information so we'll have to use some other tests to decide if it converges or diverges again this root test is really helpful with powers of n so let's take a look at a couple of examples starting with taking the sum as n goes from one to infinity of three n cubed minus seven n squared plus one raised to the n power all over four n cubed plus two n squared minus one all raised to the n power well when i see those powers of n we're going to use the root test with rho equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of the nth root of our terms three n cubed minus seven n squared plus one to the n over four n cubed plus two n squared minus one to the n and what's nice about that is the nth root takes care of those nth exponents as we take the nth root of the numerator and denominator so we're left with the limit of three n cubed minus seven n squared plus one over four n cubed plus two n squared minus one and we know the largest exponents take over which is going to leave this with just threefourths threefourths which is less than one and the root test just like the ratio test tells us that if we end up with a limit a row that is less than one the whole series converges absolutely so therefore the sum as n goes from one to infinity of three n cubed minus seven n squared plus one to the n over 4 n cubed plus 2 n squared minus 1 to the n converges absolutely whether positive or negative it converges let's try one more example of the root test let's take the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of n to the n power over the log or let's do the natural log the natural log of n raised to the n power again rho is going to be equal to the limit as n goes to infinity because we have n powers we're thinking the root test where we take the nth root of n to the n over the natural log of n to the n power well the nth root and the nth exponents will be inverses of each other leaving us with just the limit as n goes to infinity of n over the natural log of n the problem here is that as n goes to infinity the numerator goes to infinity and the denominator also goes to infinity so what we'll have to do is use l'hopital's rule which says we can take the derivative of the top and bottom the derivative of n is one the derivative of natural log of n is one over n which means we have the limit as n goes to infinity multiplying by the reciprocal is just n and as n goes to infinity n goes to infinity which is much larger than one and so the root test just like the ratio test tells us if rho is greater than one then the series as n goes from one to infinity of n to the n over the natural log of n to the n power diverges so we have two tests today to wrap up our work with sequences and series try to decide if series converge or diverge we have the root test which is good for powers of n where rho is the limit as n goes to infinity of the nth root of the absolute value and we have the ratio test where rho is the limit as n goes to infinity of the n plus one over the nth term and that one's helpful with factorials once we do that and calculate our row the process is the same if rho is less than 1 we converge absolutely if rho is greater than 1 we diverge if row equals one we have no information take a look at the homework assignment and try a few of these and we'll discuss them in class further and answer any questions that you might have now that we've gotten comfortable with various series and decide if a series converges or diverges we're going to look at some specific series that have some important properties that actually make calculus a lot easier to work with when the equations are complex our is going to be when does a power series converge so first we got to make sure we understand what we're talking about when i say power series a power series is a very special series it can be either centered at zero or any other value so first kind of the simple version of a power series is a power series centered at x equals zero is of the form the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of some constant and that constant varies based on the term times x to the n power in other words if i wrote it out it's basically a polynomial the first constant plus another constant times x plus another constant times x squared plus another constant times x cubed and so on and so on and this is when the power series is centered at zero we can shift it and actually do a power series centered at x equals a some other number which is of the form the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of those same constants but now instead of x it's going to be x minus a to the n power which means if we were to write this out when n is 0 the x part goes away and so we get the first constant or c sub 0 plus c 1 times x minus a to the first power plus the next constant times x minus a to the second power plus the next constant times x minus a to the third power and so on and so forth and so let's take a look at some examples of power series so we can get an idea of what we're talking about an example of a power series would be something like 1 plus x plus x squared plus x cubed and so on and so forth that's a power series because we're looking at all the different powers of x we could even write that as equal to the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of x to the n power in fact we can make our power series as interesting as we want maybe we could make it 1 plus x plus x squared over 2 factorial plus x cubed over 3 factorial plus and so on where we're dividing by the exponent factorial you know you can kind of see the first one we're dividing by 1 factorial and 0 factorial as well but both those are equal to one so we don't need that so this power series then is really the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of x to an exponent and then we divide by that exponent factorial let's look at one more example of a power series we're going to do 1 plus the x minus 2 divided by 2 times 3 plus x minus 2 squared divided by 3 times 3 squared plus x minus 2 cubed divided by 4 times 3 cubed and so on and so forth this is also a power series because we see that x minus 2 squared cubed fourth power and so on so what we end up with is the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of the x minus 2 raised to the n power divided by and what we notice is if we look in the denominators we've got two which is one more than the exponent of one three which is one more than the exponent of two four which is one more than the exponent of three so we're really dealing with x plus one times 3 to the and you notice the exponent is always one no the exponent's always exactly the exponent so the exponent on 3 is the same as the exponent on the numerator and so we end up with this power series in fact we go one step further to classify these power series you notice the first two don't have that x minus a property the first two are centered at zero while the last power series because it's x minus two is centered two so that's what a power series is now that we've defined what a power series is the real question is when does that power series converge we're going to take a look at the convergence of a power series and as it turns out the power series the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of those constants times x minus a raised to an exponent we'll always satisfy one of the following it will either a converge only when x equals a or only where it's centered or b it will converge for all real numbers x maybe it converges everywhere or c and this one's a little more involved it will converge if the absolute value of x minus a is less than some value r for some r that represents the radius of convergence i'll underline that term because we're going to use that a lot today and what's really interesting though is while when x minus a the absolute value is less than r what we don't know is when the absolute value of x minus a equals r it may or may not converge kind of to visually see these three options option a if i've got a number line of all possible values for x and right in the middle is a it could converge only on that value a and then diverge everywhere else so that's the case where it converges only at a or same number line we might have a value a in the middle where it's centered and it really converges everywhere it converges for all real numbers or c that same number line and then off to the right we're going to add the radius and off to the left we subtract the radius and what that does is give us a range of values where it converges and outside of those values it diverges but what's important to note in this case we have a radius of convergence it is not immediately clear what happens at those edges it may converge and it may diverge so we'll have to test those edges to get an idea of exactly what's happened but only converges on the radius of convergence where the absolute value of x minus a is less than r and then we have to really decide what happens exactly at r so if these are the three cases for x when the whole series will converge or diverge what we're ultimately interested in finding then is what is the radius of convergence on what interval does the series converge and diverge to find the interval and radius of convergence the easiest thing to do probably is to use the ratio test which we know if rho is less than one it converges so let's take a look at an example of a power series and see if we can determine where it converges or where it diverges we're going to look at the power series as n goes from 0 to infinity of x to the n over n factorial and see if it converges using the ratio test then we're looking for rho which is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity careful not to confuse your variables we're always taking n to infinity of the absolute value of the next term x to the n plus 1 divided by n plus 1 factorial divided by the current term x to the n over n factorial so if we simplify that we get the limit as n goes to infinity of x to the n plus one over n plus one factorial we know is n plus 1 times n factorial times the reciprocal n factorial over x to the n which is nice because it reduces with the n factorials dividing out the x to the n divides out with the x to the n so we're left with the limit as n goes to infinity of x to the first power over n plus one and really it doesn't matter what x equals as n gets huge we're taking x divided by a huge number which means this is going to equal zero in other words rho is equal to zero which is less than one for all real numbers for x whatever number i pick for x rho will always be less than one it's always going to be zero so in this case what that tells us is the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of x to the n over n factorial this power series converges for all x in other words the radius of convergence is infinity it will converge no matter what x equals if i wanted to express it as an interval it converges from negative infinity all the way up to positive infinity because rho is always less than one this power series will always converge but that doesn't always happen let's take a look at the power series the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of n factorial times x to the n let's run through the same process with this and see when it converges well we have rho is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of the next term which is n plus one factorial times x to the n plus one divided by the current term n factorial x to the n using our ratio test and we simplify that we get the limit as n goes to infinity of n plus 1 is n plus 1 times n factorial x to the n plus 1 over n factorial x to the n which is nice because the n factorials divide out the x to the n divides out and we're just left with the limit as n goes to infinity of n plus 1 times our x well in this case regardless of what x is actually equal to when n goes to infinity this whole thing is going to be infinity times our x and it comes out to be infinity to converge we need this to be less than one but it is never less than one because we're never less than one we don't really have a radius of convergence in other words what we can conclude therefore the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of the power series n factorial times x to the n it will diverge everywhere except one place recall that we always converge at least on the center at least when x is equal to a well this power series is centered at 0 because we're not doing x minus anything so it diverges for all x not equal to zero in other words the radius of convergence because we're only on one point the radius is zero in the interval of convergence there's not really an interval it's just the value at the center which happens to also be zero so that's the second case where it diverges everywhere except the center which in this case happens to be zero so when do we end up with an actual radius of convergence well let's try that other series we played with earlier let's try the power series as n goes from zero to infinity of x minus two to the n divided by n plus 1 times 3 to the n using the ratio test rho is equal to the limit as n goes to infinity of the next term which is x minus two to the n plus one divided by n plus one plus one is n plus two times three to the n plus 1 divided by the current term which is x minus 2 to the n divided by n plus 1 times 3 to the n and when i multiply by the reciprocal we get x plus two to the n plus one divided by n plus 2 3 to the n plus 1 times the reciprocal n plus 1 times 3 to the n oops i put x plus 2 that should be x minus 2. careful not to change the signs x minus 2 to the n in the denominator reducing here things become really nice the x minus 2 to the n divides up with the n leaving 1 behind the 3 to the n divides out with the n leaving 1 3 behind and so what's left is the limit as n goes to infinity of an x minus 2 times an n plus 1 over a 3 times n plus two not forgetting the absolute values that are around everything because that's important here well as n goes to infinity we know the n term is going to take over but notice it's the same in on numerator and denominator which means we're going to end up with the coefficients of n which is the absolute value of x minus 2 divided by the absolute value of 3 which is just 3. well that's interesting because the first time when we took the limit we ended up with a value that was always smaller than one so we said it was all real numbers the second time we took the limit in example number two we end up with a value that's never less than one so we said it's basically has no radius but here we got x minus two's absolute value over three which we want to be less than one which means what we've ended up with is an equation that we can solve for x we've got the absolute value of x minus 2 over 3 is less than one multiplying both sides by 3 the absolute value of x minus 2 is less than 3. remove the absolute values puts x minus 2 between negative 3 and positive 3. and adding 2 to both sides puts x between 5 and negative 1. what we have is a radius of convergence the radius is what the absolute value is less than it's less than 3 which means it's going to have a radius of convergence of 3 wide 3 to the left and 3 to the right from the center and it will converge on the interval from negative 1 negative 1 to 5. however we don't know what happens at negative 1 and at 5. recall we have to actually check those values so let's go back and check those values specifically let's see what happens at negative one actually i'll say at x equals negative 1. when x is equal to negative 1 our original series we're going back to the beginning here this original series that we're working with if i plug negative 1 in for x i get the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of negative 3 to the n over n plus one times three to the n which is nice because the three to the n divide out leaving behind a negative 1 to the n and so we have the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of negative 1 to the n divided by n plus one notice those denominators are just counting up one uh when n is zero it starts at one two three four we have one half one third onefourth onefifth onesixth we should recognize that as the harmonic series but because we have negative one to the n in the numerator this is actually the alternating harmonic which we know converges so on our interval when x equals negative 1 we can put a square bracket because we know the alternating harmonic series which we end up with at negative 1 does converge but we still need to see what happens at x equals 5 the other edge if x equals 5 we have the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of 5 minus 2 which is 3 to the n over n plus 1 times 3 to the n which when the three to the ends divide out leaving one in the numerator is the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of one over n plus one and so when we start plugging in values of n we get one over one plus one over two plus one over three plus one over four plus one over five we should recognize that as the harmonic series and the harmonic series which is not alternating we've shown diverges so at five it actually diverges so we're going to do a curved bracket which means we have a power series with a radius of convergence of 3 meaning x can be 3 away from its center x can the whole series will converge when x ranges from negative one including negative one to five excluding the five so that's how we can decide if a power series converges we'll use the ratio test and find out does it converge only at the center for all real numbers or within some radius of convergence and we can figure out what that radius is and exactly what interval works for x so that the series converges but why are power series important power series are important to us because quite often we can represent functions as power series and usually the power series is easier to do calculus with than the original function so if we can represent the function as a power series we'll do the calculus on the power series and save us a lot of grief for example we know the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of a times r to the n that's the geometric series the geometric series is equal to the starting value a divided by one minus the ratio given the ratio is less than one because if the ratio is greater than one it ends up diverging so if i have the function f of x equals 1 over 1 plus x cubed i could represent that as a power series if i can make it look like a over 1 minus r well we're not too far away from a over 1 minus r because we've already got a 1 over 1 but instead of plus if i make it a minus and i think what could i subtract that would be the same as adding x cubed well if we subtract a negative x cubed then we're in the same form where r is equal to the negative x cubed so we can go to our power series as n goes from zero to infinity of a a is the numerator the starting value of 1 times r which is what we're subtracting which is negative x cubed to the n power or cleaning that up we have the sum as n goes from zero to infinity one times anything is just that and i'm going to separate out the negative signs so we can see it's an alternating series negative 1 to the n times x to the 3n this power series then comes out to be the same value as one over one plus x cubed or we could write it out as the individual terms when n is one everything comes out to just a positive one minus because we're alternating i'm sorry starting out when n is zero now when n is one we get a negative x to the third plus when n is two we get x to the sixth minus when x is 3 we get x to the ninth plus and so on i want to take a look visually at this function coming together all right what i've done here on desmos is i've graphed the function we were working with 1 over 1 plus x cubed and then i'm going to start to build the power series that we found the power series that we found was 1 minus x cubed is the first two terms and notice that the blue line starts to kind of follow the red line now look what happens when we add x to the sixth it gets a little closer minus x to the ninth it gets a little closer plus x to the twelfth it gets a little closer minus x to the fifteenth it gets closer and as i continue to work through this power series the graph will start to get closer and closer to the graph of one over x one over one plus x cubed eventually leveling out at exactly the right value so that's how we can find a power series that gives us the exact same graph let's do one more example before we wrap up let's look at f of x equals x squared over 4 minus x squared now if we want to be in power series form we're ok with the numerator but we do need a 1 minus right now we have a 4 minus so what i'm going to do is i'm going to factor that 4 out of the denominator leaving behind a 1 minus and now it's x squared over 4. but we don't like to have a constant in front of the denominator so i'm going to pop that up to the numerator which is going to give us x squared over 4 in the numerator divided by one minus another x squared over four now we're in power series form of a geometric series where we've got the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of the first term which is the numerator x squared over 4 times r which is what's subtracted in the denominator x squared over 4 raised to the n power well if i want to clean that up a little bit we'll have the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of if i multiply the exponents we've got x to the 2n times x squared adding those exponents we get x to the 2 plus 2 n over 4 to the we've got 1 4 and putting the n on the denominator as well 4 to the 1 plus n power and we end up with a power series that's equal to the original function so we looked at several things today in this video we defined a power series we're going to continue to work with them over the next couple videos and then we looked at when the power series converges by identifying the radius of convergence in the interval where it converges it'll either converge at the center everywhere over a specific interval and we use the ratio test to decide when that is and then we concluded it looking at why power series are important by converting a known function into a power series specifically looking at the geometric series later we'll look at other series that aren't in the geometric series form that we can still convert into power series but this is where we're going to start with for now so take a look at the homework practice a few of these and we will see you in class now that we've taken a look at what a power series is and how to work with a power series we're ready to actually do some calculus with power series the question is going to be how can power series make derivatives and integrals easier and the brief answer to this is that often calculus is easier with a series than the function for example if the function f of x is equal to some power series from n to 0 to infinity of the constants times x minus its center a raised to the n power then we know that the derivative of the function would be equal to the derivative of a power series well what's nice about power series is it's a sum of many terms that have the exact same form so we can take the derivative term by term or really we can take the derivative of the entire sum as n goes from 0 to infinity and this c sub n is a constant and the exponent we know comes out front and then x minus a stays the same and then the exponent is decreased by 1. just using our exponent property we've taken the derivative term by term and we can do the same thing with the integral the integral of f of x dx is equal to the integral of the power series well going to the original power series as n goes from zero to infinity this time we keep the same constant out front and we know that we increase the exponent by 1 and divide by the new exponent now there's a couple adjustments that we need to make to these definitions though first let's look at the blue one the derivative when we take a derivative remember the first term in a power series is a constant and the derivative of a constant is always zero so actually it doesn't go from 1 to infin 0 to infinity it actually goes from 1 to infinity because that first term's derivative is 0 so we don't need to include it in our derivative with the integral we make up for that first term by having an extra constant now i'm going to add the constant before the sum because i don't want that constant to look like it's part of the sum but the power series antiderivative does have a constant plus the sum of the antiderivative and that kind of sticks that extra term back in there so minor adjustments to the intuitive formula just a couple things to be aware of so if that's true that we can just take the derivative term by term and the antiderivative term by term what we can do is we can use what we know to find derivatives and antiderivatives we know that for the function f of x equals 1 over 1 minus x we know that's a geometric series sum as n goes from 0 to infinity where the first term is 1 and we take the x to the n power based on what we know we're going to find a power series for the function g of x equals 1 over 1 minus x squared which is really equal to one minus x to the negative two well you might notice that that's very similar to the function that we know that we started with at the beginning so we know that the function f of x is equal to 1 minus x to the negative 1. and if i take the derivative of f f prime of x we would bring the exponent out front bring the exponent down by one times the derivative of the inside the derivative of negative one is positive one i'm sorry the derivative of negative x is negative one a negative and a negative makes a positive which means our derivative is one over one minus x squared which is what we're trying to find a power series for so we know the power series for the first original function is the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of x to the n and we know the second function is its derivative so we'll take the derivative term by term remember we have to have n equals one because the first term goes to zero to infinity bring the n out front and we have x to the n minus 1. and we have just found a power series for an unknown function because it's the derivative of a known function so if we can make that connection with something we know we can use calculus to find the new power series here's another one what if we want to find a power series for h of x equals the negative natural log of one minus x well again the function we know is 1 over 1 minus x we also know that the antiderivative of f of x dx would be the natural log of the stuff 1 minus x and then we have to divide by the derivative of the inside which is negative 1. and so the antiderivative of our known function is the negative natural log of 1 minus x well if we know the power series for the original function is the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of x to the n we're just going to integrate that to get our new power series don't forget we need a constant plus the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of x to the n plus one divided by n plus one one little thing that remains though is what is that constant c so we make sure we're equal to the original function well to figure out what's going on with that constant we'll take the zeroth term and see how much it is off by so if we plug zero in for our x we get negative natural log of one minus zero which is the negative natural log of one which is just 0. so our constant in this case is equal to 0. so we don't need the constant here it's equal to 0 we're just going to say it's equal to the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of x to the n plus one over n plus one and actually all that n plus one stuff kind of seems silly to me that we're shifting one over in the numerator and shifting 1 over to the denominator instead of shifting 1 over in the formula let's shift one of our ends over starting with n equals 1 to infinity and now it becomes just x to the n over n so that's how we can use calculus to move from a known series to a power series for an unknown series if we can connect the known series to a derivative or antiderivative of the known series we can just take the derivatives term by term and we end up with our new power series another place that calculus comes in handy is with partial fractions and power series so let's take a look at that really quick partial fractions and power series and we're actually not going to take the antiderivative but we're going to use the idea behind partial fractions to build an unknown power series let's say f of x is equal to one over one minus x times x minus two and we wanna build a power series for this well if we were to break it up into two fractions a over 1 minus x plus b over x minus 2. we could use what we know about the form of a geometric series to change these into gmet2 geometric series but first we have to figure out what a and b is so if we multiply across we get 1 equals a times x minus 2 plus b times 1 minus x if we let x equal 2 we end up with one equals b times negative one so b is negative one if we let x equal one we end up with one equals negative one times a so a also equals negative 1. and so what we end up with then is that f of x is negative 1 over 1 minus x plus negative 1 over x minus 2. okay let's see if we can massage these to get them in the right format where we have a geometric series form remember a geometric series form is going to be a over 1 minus the ratio the first one is actually already there the second one we're going to do a little bit of work with one thing we can do on the second one is we're going to switch the order so we have negative 2 plus x that way the variable is on the right side and then like before we can divide out a negative two so that we just have one minus x over two and then that negative two needs to move up to the numerator so that we're in power series form so we finally end up with is negative one over one minus x plus negative one over negative two is one half over one minus x over two which means we're dealing with a power series two power series added together we've got the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of the first term is the numerator so that's the negative one times the ratio which we're just subtracting x in the denominator so the ratio must just be x to the n plus the second power series which has a first term of one half because it's in the numerator times what's subtracted in the denominator x over two to the n power and maybe i want to clean that up a bit we've got the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity i want to factor out ultimately an x to the n so i'm putting that in onto both top and bottom because it's not a power series unless we're multiplying by x to the n everything else becomes that constant out front and so we factored out that x to the n we're left with negative 1 plus a 1 over in the denominator we've got a 2 and a 2 to the n so combine that together we get 2 to the n plus 1 is our coefficient and now we ended up with a power series that represents this function we were able to do that because our partial fractions allowed us to break it into two geometric series looking parts and we could make each part into a geometric series and factor out the x to the n to end up with our final partial fraction power series one last point then to wrap up this video let's take a look at how we can take a power series and find a function doing the exact opposite process we were doing before before we started with the function and we worked to find the power series now we're going to start with the function which is the sum as n goes from 1 to infinity of 1 over x plus 4 to the 2 n minus 1 and we're going to see if we can build this into a function that's equal to the sum well one thing i notice is we're trying to make it into a geometric geometrics like to be start at n equals zero so what we're going to do is we're going to shift this power series down to n equals zero which means we need to account for an extra in if you will so where we see the n we're gonna call it n plus one and that'll shift to the zero over one so if we replace that n with n plus one we get one over x minus four to the two times n plus one minus one and a little bit of algebra in that exponent gives us one over x minus four to the two n plus two minus one gives us a plus one well i'm going to keep trying to massage this as we work to figure out where our geometric series form might be when we see that addition inside an exponent we can break that into a product so let's see what that gives us the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of 1 over and i'm going to do the first power first x minus 4 times 1 over x minus 4 to the 2n well notice we're getting really really close oops it's a plus 4 isn't it i've been writing this wrong make sure we're not changing our signs halfway through the problem sorry about that we're getting really close to that geometric form because the geometric form says we've got our first term times our second term which needs to be raised to the n power so if we could write that second part as something to the n power we'd be in business and if we go as n goes from zero to infinity of one over x plus four times what's nice about a numerator of 1 is it can be written as 1 to the n so if i pull out an n power we're left with x plus 4 squared in the denominator in fact we could even write that as 1 over x plus 4 the entire thing squared because the one squared doesn't matter and now what we've got is we've got our first term which becomes the numerator and the ratio which is subtracted in the denominator recall that the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of a times r to the n is equal to the numerator a over 1 minus the r so in our case the numerator a is the 1 over x plus 4. over the denominator one minus the ratio that's multiplied is one over x plus four squared but this is really an ugly format so to get rid of the fractions and fractions remember we've got x plus 4 squared in the denominator so we're going to multiply by x plus 4 squared on top and bottom it's going to distribute through and so what we'll end up with is a single x plus 4 in the numerator and x plus 4 squared minus and the x plus 4 is divide out so it's just minus 1. and we end up with this final function that is equal to the original sum that we started with so sometimes we can kind of parse this power series apart to find the pieces of the geometric sum if we are in fact in a geometric form if it's not a geometric series we're going to need a new game plan and that's what we're going to take a look at in our next video but for now take a look at how we can take derivatives and antiderivatives of known power series and unknown power series and then also how the partial fractions can help us find power series and break up a power series to find a function good luck and we will see you in class thus far we focused our attention of power series on geometric series everything relates to a geometric series and can be written in the form of a geometric series but that's actually not the case in fact most functions cannot be written in the form of a geometric series so the question that we're going to try and address today is how do we find a power series for other functions and the answer to that is what are called a taylor series and mclaren series and taylor and mclaren developed these processes independent of each other there's a slight difference between the two of them taylor's is probably the most wellknown because it's the most versatile taylor said a series for a function at the point a is the function at a plus the first derivative at a divided by 1 factorial times x minus a to the first power plus the second derivative at a over 2 factorial times x minus a to the second power plus the third derivative and we'll just put a little 3 at a divided by three factorial times x minus a to the third power and so on and so forth ultimately we're adding the nth derivative at a divided by n factorial times x minus a to the nth power on and on and on to infinity in other words it is the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of the nth derivative at a divided by n factorial times x minus a to the n this is what is called a taylor series now mclaren wasn't quite as versatile when he came up with his version of this same result mclaren said basically the same thing a series at but mclaren kept it at a equals 0 and didn't expand it to any a so if we plug 0 in for all the a's we basically get what's called a mclaren series which is f of 0 plus the first derivative at zero divided by one factorial times x to the first plus the second derivative at zero divided by two factorial times x to the second plus the third derivative at zero divided by three factorial times x to the third and so on and so forth and so what you see is we're ultimately taking the nth derivative at zero dividing by n factorial times x to the n and we keep going all the way up to infinity in other words it can be summarized as the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of f to the n at 0 divided by n factorial times x to the n and we get a mclaren series and really a mclaren series is a special case of the taylor series because it's just when a equals zero turns out the algebra is a lot nicer when a is zero for a mclaren series but the process is exactly the same the idea is if we can identify the generic form of all of the derivatives at the point we can write it as a mclaren or taylor series let's take a look at how we can write any function as a power series we're going to find either the well let's start with maclaren actually let's start with the mclaren series sometimes they're called mclaren polynomials a maclaren polynomial is not infinite it stops at a certain point but if we make it into a series going all the way to infinity we can find a mclaren series for example for f of x equals e to the x so we're going to start to look for a pattern that's going to occur with the derivatives so f of x actually start with f of x we know f of x is e to the x the first derivative is also e to the x the second derivative is also e to the x and so we can see pretty quick that any derivative is just e to the x and since this is a mclaren series we're actually going to plug 0 into all of these well e to the zero is one the first derivative at zero is also one the second derivative at zero is also one and so on and so forth we see that any derivative at zero is e to the 0 which is equal to 1. so we can build this mclaren series by saying okay e to the x is equal to first the function at 0 which is 1 plus the first derivative which is one over one factorial times x to the first plus the second derivative which is one over two factorial times x squared plus and so on continuing with this pattern until we have the nth derivative which is 1 over n factorial times x to that n power and so on well if we've seen this pattern building essentially we have the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of all of the x to the n's divided by n factorial this series then is equal to the e to the x function in fact in certain context as we continue our study of mathematics it's more convenient instead of working with e to the x to work with the power series the sum of x to the n over n factorial this one wasn't too interesting though because all of the zero points ended up being equal to one so let's see if we can find a mclaren series for something a little more interesting how about f of x equals the sine of x well if we start building our derivatives f of x is the sine of x f prime the derivative of sine is cosine the second derivative is negative sine the third derivative is negative cosine and the fourth derivative then becomes positive sign and so we're starting to cycle back through sine cosine negative sine negative cosine okay let's plug 0 in because that's what mclaren wants us to do the sine of 0 is equal to 0. the first derivative at 0 is the cosine of 0 which is 1. the second derivative at zero is the negative sign well negative sine of zero is zero the third derivative at zero is negative cosine which is 1 so negative 1 and then the fourth derivative at 0 is going to start to cycle back through our answers and so we end up with coefficients of 0 1 0 negative 1 0 1 0 negative 1 which means all of the odd terms the first term the third term the fifth term and so on are all going to be 0 because we're multiplying by that derivative so we don't really have any odd terms the first term 0 or the 0th term is 0. and now for the first term we'll take x to the first power divided by one factorial times the derivative of one the second derivative is zero so we have zero when we do the third derivatives the third derivative is negative one times x to the third over that three factorial the fourth derivative is zero but the fifth goes back to x to the fifth over five factorial then we're going to do minus and you start to see the pattern forming the sixth power goes to zero but the seventh power is negative x to the seventh over seven factorial and so on so we need a way to represent this pattern so we can convert it into a series well one thing that i notice is we are alternating positive negative positive negative so we've got a negative 1 to the n to give us that alternating series notice when n is 1 actually we're going to start at 0. so when n is 0 negative 1 to the 0 is a positive 1 which matches our first term so that's good then we've got x raised to an exponent but the exponents on x are all the odd numbers so we can't just say n what we can say though if 2n is the odd numbers 2n plus 1 i'm sorry 2n is the even numbers adding 1 2n plus 1 becomes all the odd numbers so as you can see when n is 0 the first term has x to the first when n is 1 plugging 1 in we end up with x to the third when n is two the second term remember that we're starting at zero zero one two we end up with two times two plus one which is five so those exponents work out and we're dividing by that same exponent two n plus one factorial and that's going to continue forever as we end up taking the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of that exact thing we just found negative one to the n x to the two n plus one over two n plus one factorial this is our mclaren series our power series that is exactly the same as the sine of x i want to take a look at this on desmos because i really think this is amazing when you see the graph work out okay what i've done on here is i've graphed sine of x we know sine of x starting at zero going up and down period of two pi amplitude of one that's that's not very exciting but what we've just found out is that the mclaren series which starts with x over one factorial and then it's going to be alternating with the odd exponents should be exactly the same as this graph and this is really neat to watch it build when we subtract x cubed over three factorial it starts to bend with the graph then we add x to the fifth over five factorial and it continues to bend with the graph subtract x to the seventh over seven factorial and it gets even better add x to the ninth over nine factorial and it gets even better and if we keep going we're gonna get more and more of the graph building up as it stretches out and out and eventually when you get to an infinite number of terms you've got the entire sine x curve from this power series so what we've done is we've changed the sine of x into a polynomial polynomials are much easier to work with as we get to more complex operations so that's how we can build a mclaren series we find all the derivatives we plug 0 into all the derivatives and we look for patterns in this mclaren series format where we're taking the first term then times x over 1 factorial times x squared over 2 factorial times x cubed over 3 factorial all the way up and ultimately we're just trying to find that generic form so that we can change it into a series that's mclaren let's take a look at taylor because taylor's a little bit more versatile we're going to find some taylor polynomials and series a polynomial is finite a certain number of terms a series goes off to infinity and we're going to start simply with f of x equals 1 over x and we're going to find this taylor series at a equals 1. we're going to plug 1 into all the derivatives and then we're going to have x minus 1 squared cubed fourth power fifth power and so on so first f of x our function is one over x or let's actually write it as x to the negative one we can convert it so that we can see what it is our first derivative then is negative x to the negative 2 or negative 1 over x squared our second derivative is positive 2 x to the negative 3. so 2 over x cubed and our third derivative notice if we pull the negative 3 out we end up with negative 3 times 2 times x to the negative four or negative three times two over x to the fourth and the reason i write it like that is you can sort of start to see a factorial forming in this numerator you can see next time it's going to be 4 times 3 times 2 then 5 times 3 4 times 3 times 2. it's going to count down so we're ending up with those factorials in the numerator that's going to be really helpful to us as we come up with a generic form all right we're doing it at one so we're gonna plug one into each of these one divided by one is one the derivative at one is negative one over one which is one the second derivative at one well the denominator is just one so we end up with two the third derivative at one gives us negative three times two and you can kind of see we're building towards the nth derivative at one is going to have an n factorial as we said next time it's gonna be four times three times two times one we just have to worry about the fact that it's an alternating series we want it to start out positive on the zeroth term on the zeroth derivative so we'll just do the n power and in much the same way we can use the taylor formula to start building then that one over x is equal to and let's see if we can jump right to the generic form the sum as n goes from zero to infinity of the derivative pattern notice our derivative pattern was negative 1 to the n times n factorial then we divide by an n factorial times x minus our a which is 1 raised to the n power but this one's really interesting because the n factorials actually divide out so what we really have is the sum as n goes from 0 to infinity of negative 1 to the n times x minus 1 to the n power and we have ended up with a power series that is equal to the function one over x let's try one more finding another taylor series we did cosine last time let's do i'm sorry we did sine last time let's do cosine this time and let's do it at a is equal to pi pi is a nice number to stick into cosine and so in much the same way we're going to run through the derivatives the zeroth derivative is cosine x that's the regular function first derivative is negative sine x second derivative is negative cosine x the third derivative is positive sine x and the fourth derivative we start to see it cycling back to cosine this time because it's a taylor series though we're not plugging 0 in we're plugging pi in well the cosine at pi is negative 1. negative sign at pi the first derivative is zero the second derivative negative cosine well cosine at pi is negative one the opposite of negative one is positive one and then the third derivative at pi is also zero and then you can start to see it the fourth derivative it's going to start to cycle around might be a little trickier to see the pattern of the derivatives off the bat here so we're going to go ahead and build a couple terms and see if that helps us see the pattern the first term is or the zeroth term i should say is negative one so cosine x equals negative one then our first derivative is going to be a zero so that all goes to zero for the second derivative we end up with one times the x minus pi to the second power divided by two factorial then a zero then another negative one x minus pi this is now the fourth derivative fourth power divided by four factorial and you start to see the pattern this time it's the even exponents times x minus pi the next one is going to be to the sixth power over six factorial and so on can we come up with a generic formula well it's an alternating series but this time the first term is negative so we need to stagger negative 1 to the n will make the first term positive negative 1 to the 0 is positive 1. so if we do n plus 1 that'll stagger us by 1. and then all we have left is the x minus pi to the oh what power now this time we end up with the zeroth term the second term the fourth term the sixth term this time we have the even exponents the even terms so to get even numbers we'll do 2 times n and we'll divide by that 2 n factorial as it keeps going so what we end up with is that the cosine of x is really equal to the taylor series as n goes from 0 to infinity of negative 1 to the n plus 1 times x minus pi to the 2n over the 2n factorial we should have that 2n in parentheses and this one is centered at pi because we did at pi at a equals pi what does that mean centered at pi as opposed to the mclaren series which was centered at zero well let's go back to the graph to discuss that notice when we started to build the sine of x as a mclaren series it was centered at zero and if i start deleting these terms off you see ultimately where the function started building was from the center of zero but if i do a cosine x i have to move the graph over a bit and now if i start building negative 1 plus x minus pi squared over two you start to see where it's building is right at pi if i do x equals pi and put a line here that's the center and now if i go minus x minus pi to the 4th power over 4 factorial that 2 should be factorial as well but that doesn't really make a difference you see it's starting to build that cosine but it starts building from the center of pi and if we keep going we'll get closer and closer to the actual function over eight factorial and we've almost got a full period now and if we keep going off to infinity you can see how we'd end up eventually with the entire graph forming from a center of pi so taylor allows us to start building the graph from any point mclaren always builds the graph from zero but let's take give you a chance to look at the homework assignment try and build some of these taylor and mclaren series get comfortable with what they are and how they work and then we will see you in class to discuss them more after looking at the conic sections what we realize is that we have nonfunctions that are relationships between x and y that we use quite often it would be nice if there's a better way to to express those relationships that are not functions and so what we're going to take a look at in the next couple sections is some different ways to express relationships between our variables we're answering the question is there a better way to describe relations that are not functions we're used to this whole xy relationship and x determines y and that's what allows us to graph our points and our function to represent all the solutions however there might be another way to represent functions what if instead of just having x dependent on y what if x and y were both defined to be dependent on another variable and this is where we get what are called parametric equations and the idea of a parametric equation is the x value comes from some function x of t and the y value comes from some function y of t where t now is the independent variable and what's really important is that independent variable moves over an interval in other words we're graphing x and y with relationship to time as time passes we have this movement of our x and y values and so the time can quickly determine the graph let's take a look at an example let's say we have a relationship where x of t is equal to three t plus two sometimes you just see x equals and y of t is equal to t squared minus 1 and negative 3 is the lowest value for t and 2 is the highest value for t what if we wanted to graph this parametric equation well what we can do is we can make a value a table of values for our t values going from negative 3 to 2 negative 3 negative 2 negative 1 0 1 and 2 and we can look at what happens to our x and y values so that we can graph what happens at each of these moments in time as the time progresses so when t is negative 3 we plug negative 3 into the x equation and so we end up with 3 times negative 3 which is negative 9 plus 2 is negative seven then we plug negative three into the y function when we plug negative three into the y function we get negative three squared which is nine minus one is eight then we plug the negative two in three times negative two plus two is negative four negative two squared minus one is three plugging the negative one in three times negative one plus two is negative one negative one squared is one minus one is zero plugging zero in we get two and negative one plugging one in we get five and zero and plugging two in we get eight and three and so what this does is give us the coordinate points that we can graph to see our function popping up some graph paper to help us graph this x starts at negative seven comma eight then it's negative four three then it's negative one zero then it's 2 negative 1 then it's 5 0 and then it's 8 3 and what we end up with is this graph turns out what we have is the forming of a parabola but what's really important to note is that the graph also has direction and that's something that's unique about parametric curves is you end up with direction to your graphs so this is our function x of t is three t plus 2 y of t is t squared minus 1. now sometimes it might be useful to convert our parametric equation and eliminate the parameter so that we can see the relationship between x and y a little more straight forward and really the way we can eliminate the parameter is we can solve one equation for the variable for the parameter t and substitute into the other function so let's take a look at some examples starting with x is equal to 2 plus 3 over t and y is equal to t minus 1. what would this look like as a regular function well the y equation is really easy to solve for t by adding 1 to both sides and then we can take that y plus 1 and replace the t with that y plus one when we do we end up with x equals two plus three over the y plus one and then we might wanna solve this for y because we're used to seeing functions solve for y so if we subtract 2 from both sides we can multiply both sides by y plus 1 and divide both sides by x minus 2 and subtract 1 from both sides to get y is equal to 3 over x minus 2 minus 1. and this would give us the exact same function but with the parameter eliminated let's take a look at a little bit more of an interesting function let's look at the parametric equation x equals 4 plus 2 cosine of t and y equals negative 1 minus 3 sine of t this is actually a very familiar graph to us let's see what happens when we work to solve it if it becomes something more familiar we can start by working with the x equation i'm going to subtract 4 from both sides and then divide by 2 so we've solved for the cosine of t and the same thing with the y i'm going to solve it for the sine of t by adding 1 and dividing by negative 3. one way we could attack this is to take the cosine inverse and then plug it into the sine that's going to be a lot more work than we need to do though because we know that sine squared of t plus cosine squared of t equals one so let's do that we're going to take the sine of t which is y plus 1 over negative 3 squared plus the cosine of t which is the x minus 4 over 2 squared must equal one and if we put that squared on top and bottom we end up with y plus one squared over nine plus x minus four squared over four equals one and we should recognize that function that is an ellipse that is centered at four comma negative one with a vertical major axis equal to the square root of nine is three double that at six and a horizontal minor axis equal to the square root of 4 is 2 and double that we get 4. so this is an ellipse centered at 4 negative 1 with a vertical major axis of 6 and a horizontal minor axis of 4 that is what the graph looks like but what we've done because this is a parametric equation is x and y depend on t the independent variable now the ellipse is defined as a function of t this is one advantage of parametric equations is we can start working with nonfunctions and define them in terms of this parametric variable this parameter t today's assignment is designed to have you get familiar with parametric graphs and converting between parametric and rectangular coordinates with the x's and y's take a look at practicing those and then in our next video we'll look at how we can do calculus when we're working with parametric equations now that we've taken a look at parametric curves and how to work with uh parameterized equations we're ready to take that up to the level of calculus and ask ourselves the question how do we do calculus with parametric equations and really calculus is very similar in parametric as it is in rectangular coordinates but there are a few adjustments that we're going to make first we're going to take a look at derivatives with parametric equations and the big thing with derivatives is normally when we find a derivative we call it d y d x well d y and d x are now separate equations so we have to take their derivatives separately so we'll take the derivative of the y equation with respect to t and divide it by the derivative of the x equation with respect to t in other words we're taking y prime of t divided by x prime of t to get d y d t so some examples of doing this would include if x of t is equal to t squared minus 3 and y of t equals 2t minus 1. so if we want to find the derivative of this the derivative is d y over d x so first we need to find d y well y prime the derivative of the y function with respect to t we know is 2. over the derivative of x with respect to t well x prime of t is equal to 2t so our denominator is 2t and when we simplify by reducing out the twos we get the derivative d y d x being one over t and this becomes the function of the slope of the tangent line at any point on this parametric curve with respect to t let's do one more example let's try x of t equals 5 cosine squared of t and y of t is equal to 5 sine squared of t well again we need the individual derivatives first we need y's derivative which we know is 5 times bring the 2 out front sine of t times the derivative of the sine which is the cosine of t using the chain rule there so really that's tan sine cosine and now the derivative of x with respect to t is we have the 5 times bring the 2 out front 2 cosine of t times the derivative of the inside which is negative sine of t and so if we clean that up we get negative 10 cosine t sine t and so when we want to find the derivative which is d y dx we simply plug those in the derivative of y was tan sine t cosine t over the derivative of x with respect to t which was negative 10 cosine t sine t and this time we get a lot of reducing that happens leaving just the negative in the denominator really we have one over negative one which is just negative one which means the slope of this function is negative one now when we were back in calculus one we didn't just want to find the derivatives because the derivative was the slope of the tangent line but we actually wanted to find that tangent line quite often through a given point so let's see if we can do that as well let's find the tangent line what you remember is y minus y1 equals m times x minus x1 where m is equal to the slope dydx at the point x one comma y one so if we have the function x of t is equal to t squared minus four t and y of t equals 2t cubed minus 6t and we want the equation of the tangent line at the point t equals 5. we can build this in much the same way first we're going to find the slope y prime of t is equal to six t squared minus six and x prime at t is equal to two t minus four and then the derivative d y over dx is equal to the y six t squared minus six over the x two t minus four and this represents the slope of the tangent line to any point we're specifically interested in the slope at t equals five so if we plug five into that we have six times five squared minus six over two times five minus four six times 25 minus six is 144 over six and dividing we get exactly 24. now we've got the slope of our tangent line we still need to go back and find what point that is actually the slope at so if we go back to our x of t equation and find out what's happening at x of 5 we'll have 5 squared minus 5 times 4 or 4 times 5 same thing which is 25 minus 20 which is 5. and y at that point of 5 is 2 times 5 cubed minus 6 times 5 which is 125 times 2 is 250 minus 30 is 220 so we also have this point then of 5 comma 220. now we have a point and we have a slope we're ready to make the equation of our tangent line which is y minus the y coordinate of 220 equals the slope of 24 times x minus the x coordinate of 5 and we now have the equation of the tangent line through this curve when time is equal to five let's do one more example let's say x of t is equal to the sine of t and y of t is equal to the cosine of t and we want the tangent line at t equals pi over 3. well the derivative of y with respect to time is negative sine of t and the derivative of x with respect to t is cosine of t so our derivative d y d x is equal to the negative sine of t over the cosine of t which we should recognize sine over cosine is tangent so we get the negative tangent of t and we want to know specifically what happens with that slope at t equals pi over three so what we're really working on is negative tangent of pi over three and the tangent of pi over three is the square root of three so we have negative square root of three is the slope of our tangent line at pi over three now we just need our point if we plug pi over 3 into the x equation careful not the derivative in the equation x is equal to sine of t so we have the sine of pi over 3 and the sine of pi over 3 is onehalf plugging pi over 3 into the y function y is going to be cosine of pi over three which is root three over two which gives us the point one half comma root three over two to go with our slope of negative root 3 and make our tangent line which is y minus onehalf the ycoordinate equals the slope negative square root of 3 times x minus the xcoordinate square root of three over two and we found the equation of our tangent line so it's kind of a brief overview of doing derivatives with parametric equations we can also do antiderivatives with parametric equations and they just need a little bit of a tweak to what we've done before so let's take a look at the antiderivatives these would be our integrals and remember with antiderivatives or integrals the fundamental theorem of calculus told us what we're really finding is the area under a curve and it turns out that if we want to find the area under a curve in parametric equations we still take the integral from a to b but we need to account for the fact that our dx's is split up into an x function and a y function with respect to t so we've got the y function that we're going to integrate with but when we use the chain rule with the dx we end up with an x prime of t dt also it's important to note that a is the left endpoint because sometimes with parametric equations the graph ends up being graphed from right to left in which case we need to switch the order of the integration or just take the opposite of the final integral we'll take a look at what that means when it comes up but for now we'll say if we want the area under the curve we take the antiderivative from a to b the integral from a to b of the y function times the derivative of the x function dt here's an example of what that looks like if x of t is equal to 2 cosine of t plus the cosine of 2t and y of t is equal to 2 sine of t minus the sine of 2t we're going to find the area under the curve between 0 and pi well the first thing we need to know if we're going to use this function this operation to find the area under the curve is we need to know the derivative of the x function so first the x derivative the antiderivative of two cosine is negative two sine t and the antiderivative of cosine of 2t using the chain rule is negative 2 sine of 2t so when we plug that into our integral function the area under the curve from 0 to pi of the y function which is 2 sine t minus the sine of 2t times the derivative of the x function which is negative 2 sine t minus 2 sine of 2t dt and then all we have to do is evaluate that integral to find the area under that curve this integral is going to take a little bit of work to work out so let's give ourselves a little bit more space to work with and let's see what happens first thing i'd notice is that i've got a gcf of negative 2 inside this last factor i can factor out that negative 2 and pull it all the way out of the integral so let's do that negative 2 times the integral from 0 to pi of 2 sine t minus the sine of 2 t times now it's positive sine t plus the sine of 2t dt and then to keep integrating let's take let's foil this out yeah let's boil this all out so we've got two sine squared of t plus 2 sine of t times the sine of 2t minus the sine of t times the sine of 2t minus the sine squared of 2t dt let's go ahead and combine the like terms in the middle so we have negative 2 times the integral from 0 to pi of 2 sine squared of t plus sine of t sine of 2t minus the sine squared of 2t dt a couple things that i notice here we each piece of this integral we need to do some work with using some trig formulas in order to simplify we see the sine squared of t and we remember that the sine squared of t is equal to one half times or minus one half times the cosine of double the angle two t so we're going to replace that sine squared with this property and what's nice when that 2 distributes through it's going to clear out those one halves so we end up with negative 2 times the integral from 0 to pi when the 2 distributes through we have 1 minus the cosine of 2t plus another thing i notice is we've got a sine of 2t we have a a formula from trig that says the sine of 2t is equal to 2 sine of t cosine of t and when we multiply that by the sine we'll end up with 2 sine squared of t times the cosine of t and that's set up now for a nice easy substitution where u is sine and du is cosine minus and again we see the sine squared so we'll use the sine squared formula again to say one half plus because we have to distribute the negative through one half cosine and we double the angle we get four t dt let's go ahead and combine there's not much for like terms but we do have one minus a half so now we have negative two times the integral from zero to pi of onehalf minus the cosine of two t plus 2 sine squared t cosine t plus 1 half cosine of 4t dt and after all that algebra we finally have something we can integrate we have negative two times one half of t minus the antiderivative of cosine is sine of two t but we need a one half to take care of the two on the inside plus sine squared comes from a sine cubed but we need to divide by three to take care of that and then using the chain rule gives us the cosine you can check that using substitution plus antiderivative of cosine is sine of 4t but we need to divide by a 4 which means we have a total of divide by 1 8. and we're integrating this whole thing from 0 to pi what's nice is when we plug pi into sine pi or zero both pi and zero of sine go to zero which means all the terms go away except for the very first one so we end up with negative two times one half of pi minus zero because when we plug in half of zero is zero and then when we multiply this together negative two times pi over two is negative pi but wait why is it negative we made a small error at the beginning and that we didn't take the time to notice if a was a left endpoint or a right endpoint if we start integrating at 0 we're claiming that 0 is the left endpoint let's take a look at this graph really quick what i've done here is i've asked desmos to graph this parametric curve for us as t grows from 0 to some value a and a is going to be a video that's going to scroll from 0 up to pi and i want to notice when this graph is drawn it's going to start here at 3 0 and as a gets bigger it goes off to the left this curve is actually drawn backwards until our time is equal to pi and this then becomes the curve that we're trying to find the area underneath down to the xaxis but because it was drawn from right to left the leftmost endpoint was actually pi not zero which means we should have integrated not from 0 to pi but from pi to 0 to make it integrate from left to right that way our dt is positive well we could fix that easily at the end because if we switch the order of integration that would have stuck a negative out front well let's just make that adjustment at the end and say this is drawn backwards which means the area under the curve is actually equal to a positive pi so if it's drawn backwards you'll end up with a negative area and that should be your hint oh this is probably drawn from right to left we need to take the absolute value and say it's equal to the positive value because area can never be negative i want to take a look at one more use of integration of calculus with parametric curves we've talked about the area under a curve but let's actually talk about another interesting thing and that is i think this is number two arc length arc length was generally one of the most difficult formulas to work with in rectangular coordinates and there are some situations where arc length is actually easier to work with in parametric equations we just need a slightly different formula to account for the fact that we have an x and a y function to find the arc length it's going to be the integral from a to b of the square root of and instead of 1 plus the derivative squared it's going to be dx dt squared plus d y dt squared it really comes from the pythagorean theorem the change in the x plus the change in the y squared dt one thing we need to be careful of as we use this formula and it's a property from precalculus that we don't spend a lot of time on but it does become important here is when we take the square root of something that's been squared it's not actually equal to that something it's actually equal to the absolute value of that something and so sometimes if you get a weird answer we might need to go back and say let's take the absolute value of what was under the square root instead of what was what we ended up with it doesn't become an issue often but when it when you get a weird answer like an arc length of zero something like that that's probably what happened all right let's try an example let's say x of t is equal to 3t squared and y of t is equal to 2t cubed and we're going to find the arc length as t runs from 1 2 3. well to use the formula we need to take both derivatives and square them so let's take the derivative of x which is 6 t and when we square the derivative of x we get 36 t squared with the y's the derivative of y is 6 t squared and when we take that derivative and square it we'll get 36 t to the fourth so using our formula we're going to take the integral as t runs from 1 to 3 of the square root of the x derivative squared which was 36 t squared plus the y's derivative squared which is 36 t to the fourth dt and if we can integrate this guy we'll end up with our arc length from one to three let's do a little simplifying with this we've got a common factor of 36 t squared that can come out that's going to leave behind one plus t squared dt and we can take the square root of 36 t squared it's 6t times the square root of 1 plus t squared dt and we're set up then for a nice substitution where u is equal to one plus t squared d u is equal to two t dt well to get that six to be a two we're going to divide it by three so we'll divide by three inside and multiply by three outside so we end up with three times the integral make sure we plug our limits of integration into the u one plus one squared is two one plus three squared is ten and we're left with just the square root of u or u to the one half d u which is equal to three times u to the three halves times the reciprocal which is two thirds integrated from two to ten the threes divide out and so we're just left with two times u which will start by plugging in 10 to the three halves minus plug the two in two to the three halves and that's not going to be any pretty numbers so let's just leave our arc length as that value 2 times 10 to the 3 halves minus 2 to the 3 halves and that's how we can find arc length in parametric curves so we've taken a look at both derivatives and antiderivatives specifically in the context of tangent lines and arc lengths and area under curves take a look at the homework assignment to practice a few of these and we will talk about them more in class see you then now that we've taken a look at parametric equation there's an alternate way to graph x and y coordinates using two different functions we're going to look at another option for graphing in a completely different graphing system the question is going to be what other graphing systems can we use normally when we've graphed a point up to now we've said we're going to graph a point really with an x y coordinate where x is how far we go to the right and y is how far we go up however we could graph using a different version of reference points and this leads to what are called polar coordinates the idea behind polar coordinates is we've got the coordinate system and instead of giving an x y coordinate what we're going to do is we're going to have some distance which we will call r that is going to be some angle theta away from the polar axis or the what we traditionally have called the x axis to get to our point so a point is now made up of an ordered pair of r comma theta where r represents the radius or distance from the center and theta represents the angle that we open up to now what's interesting about polar coordinates then is unlike the x y coordinate system where there's only one way to get the to the point four comma seven with polar coordinates there are multiple ways to get to the same point they are not unique coordinates to represent the same point let's say we want to look at a point over here and if i were to draw it out let's say that radius has a distance of 2 and the angle is a distance of pi over 4 a 45 degree angle if that's the case then our radius is 2 and our angle is pi over 4 and that's going to represent that point but that's not the only way to get to that point i could have taken my angle and gone around a full circle and a little bit more 2 pi plus another pi over 4 would be 9 pi over 4. and so we end up with the same radius of 2 but an angle of 9 pi over 4 representing the exact same point in fact there's a third way to represent to that exact same point and that is to take an angle that goes around to the distance exactly opposite it that angle would be 5 pi over 4 but then our radius is going to come out the other direction and to show the radius coming the other direction we'll say the radius is negative and so we end up with this point negative 2 comma 5 pi over 4 and we've got three ways to represent the exact same point in fact there are infinite number of ways that we could represent this exact same point including negative angles and angles that are several times around the entire unit circle so polar coordinates are not unique but they do provide a way to do a lot of graphs in a much more convenient way but before we do that let's take a look at how we can do conversions between polar and rectangular coordinates and to set these conversions up let's take a look at a point that is drawn by some radius r and some angle theta and if we were to drop a triangle on that we end up with an x distance to the right and a y distance up well we know that the cosine of theta the cosine of the angle is the adjacent x over r and multiplying by r tells us that the x coordinate is equal to r cosine theta similarly if we took the sine of the angle it would be the opposite over r or y over r and multiplying both sides by r we get r sine theta is equal to the y coordinate we also have ways to convert the other direction we know from the pythagorean theorem on this exact triangle that x squared plus y squared is equal to r squared and so if we know x and y we should be able to calculate r also if we know x and y we can use the tangent of theta to equal the opposite over the adjacent or y over x and so tangent of theta is equal to the ratio of our coordinates let's see if we can use these conversion properties to help us convert maybe the point 3 comma negative 4 to polar coordinates well we've got the x and y so we know that r squared is equal to x squared plus y squared so r squared is equal to 3 squared which is 9 plus 4 squared which is 16. so r squared is 25 and our radius must be 5. we also know that the tangent of the angle is equal to the ratio of y over x negative 4 over 3. and if we take the tangent inverse of both sides it's not a pretty number but we get negative 0.9273 approximately and so we end up with the polar coordinate of 5 comma negative 0.9273 for our polar coordinate that's equal to 3 comma negative 4. let's go the other direction let's convert the polar coordinate four comma two pi over 3 to a rectangular point well to do that we know x is equal to r cosine theta and we know that y is equal to r sine theta from our formulas up above so now we just have to plug in what we know that x is equal to the radius of four times the cosine of two pi over three or x is equal to four times cosine of two pi over three is negative one half so the x coordinate is negative two for the y coordinate y is equal to the radius of four times the sine of two pi over three so y is equal to four times the sine of two pi over three is root three over two which reduces down to two root two and we end up with the rectangular coordinate of negative two comma 2 root 2 being the exact same as the polar point 4 comma 2 pi over 3. now that we've taken a look at how we can convert between rectangular and polar coordinates we're ready for our next task which is to see if we can actually plot points and we're going to plot two points on this graph we're going to plot the point 4 comma 5 pi over 3 and we're going to plot the point negative 3 comma negative 3 pi over 2. now when we're graphing in polar coordinates we can convert them to rectangular coordinates and figure out where they should be or we can just graph them using our angles in what's called a polar grid this here is our polar grid and each circle represents a radius of one so we can kind of count out just like we count on our xaxis of one two three four five and so on and we can see the growing radii coming out of the center here on this polar grid every pi over six has been labeled so we've got zero pi over six two pi over six which is pi over three then we end up with pi over two then two pi over 3 and 5 pi over 6 and then pi and then 7 pi over 6 and then 4 pi over 3 and then 2 pi or 3 pi over 2 and then 5 pi over 3 and 11 pi over six and then we're back around to two pi and so you can see you're working yourself around this one does not label the pi over fours but those would be just kind of in the middle so if you wanted to you needed a pi over four you could stick it right up in the middle and you could label the pi over fours in this graph as well just kind of like a unit circle but with a different radius established for each coordinate point so when we want to plot point a as four comma five pi over three i'll go over to an angle of five pi over three and i'll count out four radii one two three 4 and that fourth radius out from 5 pi over 3 is point a similarly with negative 3 negative 3 pi over 2 negative angles count backwards so we're going to go the opposite direction i'll do this one in green because we did the first one in blue going the opposite direction we've got negative 3 pi over 2 if you count 1 2 3 negative 3 pi over 2 is up here at the top but instead of coming vertically up towards negative 3 pi over 2 because the radius is negative we're going to count backwards to 3 points and that gives us a negative 3 radius because we're going backwards away from the negative 3 pi over 2 and there becomes point b so if that's how we plot points then we're one step away from being able to actually graph polar equations let's take a look at that let's take a look at polar graphs the first polar graph we're going to look at is r equals 4 plus 4 cosine of theta and to set this up we're going to take a bit of time with this so we can get good comfort with how these polar graphs work we're going to look at all the common angles theta and see what radius they give us and see if we can graph what shape this is going to give us our common angles that we're going to look at is we're going to count every pi over six it does skip the pi over fours and we could include the pi over fours if we wanted to but uh for the sake of time i'm just going to do zero one pi over six pi over three pi over 2 2 pi over 3 5 pi over 6 pi 7 pi over 6 4 pi over 3 three pi over two five pi over three and eleven pi over six and then 2 pi would be coming back around to the same point so i'm going to use my calculator to take a look at these so let's pull up our calculator on your calculator in order to graph polar equations we need to change the mode that we're in if we click mode down a couple spots you see function is highlighted next to function is par that's for parametric equations if you want to use your calculator for those and the next is the polar equations let's go down to polar equations and hit enter to highlight polar equations and now when i hit the y equals instead of saying y equals it's actually going to say r equals and we want r to equal 4 plus 4 cosine of theta and now when we hit the x button the x t theta n we're going to end up with a theta for our variable and then i'm going to hit second table and i'm going to delete all of these values out that i don't want and now i can start entering in my values i enter in 0 and i see that the radius should be 8. if i enter in pi over 6 we see the radius should be 7.5 approximately and then i can enter in pi over 3 and i see the radius should be approximately six and so i can go down and finish filling in to figure out what values i want to fill into my table so when the rate when the angle is zero the radius ends up being eight pi over six is approximately 7.5 pi over 3 is approximately 6 pi over 2 is 4 2 pi over 3 comes out to 2 5 pi over 6 comes out to 0.5 pi is zero seven pi over six is point five four pi over three is two three pi over two is four you start to see it's kind of looking symmetrical five pi over 3 is 6 and 11 pi over 6 is 7.5 and you can see it's going to go to 8 next so let's see what this graph looks like when the angle is 0 the radius is eight so i'll count out one two three four five six seven eight on a zero radius then at pi over six that's the first line it's 7.5 pi over three it's six pi over two is four two pi over three is two five pi over six is one half and then at pi it actually comes down and hits zero and then one half and two and 4 and then 5 pi over 3 it goes out to 6 and 11 pi over 3 it comes out to 7.5 and then you can see it's gonna go back around to eight and so what we end up with is this interesting little curve that comes in it almost looks like a squished heart actually i'm going to make that line a little bit thicker so we can get a real good c on what what that graph looks like here it curves in and then balances out and that's our polar graph that is the function r equals 4 plus 4 cosine of theta and actually we can end up with some pretty gnarly looking graphs in polar coordinates to save us some time we're going to cheat and we're going to look at some graphs on desmos and kind of graph what these things look like first we're going to graph theta equals pi over 3. actually this pi over 3 option let's see if we can kind of talk through what it's going to do pi over 3 means the angle is going to stay consistent at pi over 3 regardless of what the radius is equal to theta equals pi over 3 is just a line so let's see if we can find something a little more interesting than that let's do r equals 2 cosine theta minus 3 sine of theta when we graph that r equals 2 cosine theta minus 3 sine theta what we end up with is a kind of offcentered circle this is the equation of a circle kind of was offcentered but it was a circle nonetheless let's take a look at another equation this one's kind of gnarly let's take a look at r equals theta over three r equals theta over three gives you a gnarly spiral and as you scroll out you see this only goes up to 12 pi yeah the spiral only stops here because theta has been programmed to only go to 12 pi but if theta keeps going the spiral is going to keep going out and out and out so theta equals pi over 3 is actually equal to a graph of a spiral which is kind of cool how about this one r equals 3 plus 3 cosine of theta r equals 3 plus 3 cosine theta that's kind of similar to the one that we saw earlier it looks like a squished heart something like that how about this graph r equals 2 plus 4 sine of theta this one's interesting because it ends up with a little squiggly in the center a little tiny circle on the inside so that one's kind of neat in that it comes around and then it loops around before it finishes in the center kind of the classic polar graph is what's called the rows r equals 3 sine of 2 theta let's take a look at this graph this one gives us a nice little rose with four petals on it we can actually play with the number of petals by changing what's in front of theta turns out if the number's even you end up with twice as many petals so if i do six theta i've got a 12 petal rose but if it's odd we end up with exactly that many petals so if i do 5 theta we get a 5 petal rose so you can play with that and get some gnarly looking graphs in polar coordinates now it might be useful though to change a polar graph into a more familiar rectangular coordinates and that takes a little bit of creative spark so let's take a look at how we can do one last thing and that is letter c to transform polar to rectangular functions let's start by doing theta is equal to pi over 3. well we know this is probably going to be a line based on our little experiment with functions up above in desmos where we said if that angle is going to stay constant and the radius is going to change you're just going to end up with a straight line but to find out what that line is what we know about theta is that the tangent of theta is equal to y over x by definition so we can take the tangent of the angle pi over 3 and that must be equal to y over x and the tangent of pi over 3 is the square root of 3 equal to y over x and so if we multiply both sides by x we end up with x square root of 3 equals y and that's a line through the origin with a slope of the square root of three that one's not too exciting let's try another one let's do r equals three well if the radius is going to stay consistent and the angle is going to change you might expect this to be a circle because we keep the same radius and go all the way around the unit circle we also know we've got a property that x squared plus y squared equals r squared so plugging in what we know x squared plus y squared equals three squared or nine and that really doesn't need any simplifying we recognize that from our conic sections as a circle with radius of 3. so let's try a more interesting graph than just r equals or theta equals let's try r equals 6 cosine theta minus 8 sine of theta now this one we're going to have to be a little more creative with a nice little trick that can help us quite often is we're going to multiply both sides by r and when i do that we end up with r squared equals and when i distribute the r r cosine theta minus eight r sine of theta and the reason that's nice is we know that r cosine theta is equal to x and we know that r sine of theta is equal to y and we know that r squared is equal to x squared plus y squared and so if we put that all together we get x squared plus y squared equals 6x minus 8y now it might not be clear what shape this is exactly so let's move all the x and y's to the same side so we have x squared minus six x plus y squared plus eight y equals zero and then if i try and complete the square on the x's by adding nine half of 6 squared and adding 16 half of 8 squared to both sides the x's are a perfect square x minus 3 squared plus the y's are a perfect square y plus 4 squared equals 0 plus 9 plus 16 is 25. you recognize this as a conic section as well it is a circle centered at 3 negative 4 with a radius of five let's do one last function let's consider r equals secant theta tangent theta well we don't really have any formulas with secant and tangent but we do know that secant is one over the cosine and tangent is sine over cosine and if i multiply both sides of this equation by the cosine squared of theta to clear out the denominators we get r cosine theta squared equals the sine of theta and where this gets interesting is if we multiply both sides by r that's kind of our favorite trick of polar coordinates to multiply both sides by r we get r squared cosine theta equals r sine theta and we should recognize that r sine theta is just y and r cosine theta is x and if it's all squared that must be x squared so we really have is x squared equals y is the same function as r equals secant theta times tangent theta this is a parabola so this video was a quick introduction to this new coordinate system of polar coordinates where we can graph things using a radius and an angle theta take a look at the homework assignment to practice some of these and good luck to you let me know if you have any questions and we will see you in class now that we've taken a look at using polar coordinates we're ready to do some calculus with polar coordinates as we answer the question how do we find areas in polar coordinates or polar curves would be more accurate before we actually get to working with area in polar coordinates i want to go over some tips on how we can use the ti 83 or 84 calculator to help us with finding the correct areas in the polar curves because it's really easy to find the incorrect area the wrong part of the graph so the first thing that we want to do is we need to make sure that the mode is set to polar so you'll hit the mode button and make sure polar is selected and what's nice about that as we found out in our previous video is now when you hit the y equals button it will give us r equals equations when we're going to graph these though a little tip is when you graph a polar graph i would not recommend that you do not hit the graph button it's a button for the first drawing because some of these polar graphs are too large or too small you're not going to see much in hitting just the graph button so we're going to say rather we're going to hit the zoom button and select zoom fit and what zoom fit will do is it will center the graph as large as possible on the screen so we'll use zoom fit to get a good view now sometimes it skews this graph when we do this maybe the x's will count by twos and the y's will count by sevens and so we end up with a significant skew but it does provide us a really good view of what the graph looks like something else to be aware of is the window button because the window button not only gives you a chance to set the minimum and maximum values for x and y the window buttons will also allow you to select a range for theta for the angles and then if you adjust that to reset it we will use 0 to 2 pi that's kind of the default so whenever we change it we need to remember to change it back to 0 to 2 pi otherwise some weird things might happen so let's take a look to see if we can correctly use the calculator to graph one petal of r equals three sine of two theta three sine 2 theta is your typical rows we're going to graph it first so i'll pull up my calculator here first we'll go to mode to check to see if it is in polar coordinates which it's not right now so i'm going to scroll over and select polar coordinates second quick to go back home now when i hit the y equals button i have r equals equations let's delete out the old equation and we want to graph 3 sine of 2 theta 3 sine of 2 theta and when we close the parentheses that will give us the graph but instead of just hitting graph because i'm probably going to get a bad view of it this first time i draw it i'm going to click the zoom button and i will scroll down to find zoom fit it's number zero on my calculator depending on the version of your calculator you it might be a different number so if you hit zoom and then that number it'll automatically zoom you don't have to scroll so it might be worth memorizing what number it is on your calculator so i can hit enter and it'll quickly graph its four petaled rows our task is to try and graph only one petal let's try and graph this first petal what i notice is it starts and ends at the origin at that point regardless of the angle the radius i know is zero that's what pulls it in towards the center so we need to figure out what angles give us a radius of zero so we can just graph one petal well to do that we'll go back to our equation and we'll set that radius to zero equals three sine of 2 theta and solving this for theta will tell me what angles give me that center point dividing by 3 gives me 0 equals the sine of 2 theta and i know from my unit circle that the sine is equal to 0 at the left and right points so 2 theta is equal to maybe 0 1 pi 2 pi 3 pi and so on and so forth dividing everything by 2 then my theta my angles are equal to 0 pi over 2 pi 3 pi over 2 and so on and so forth we just want one petal so let's just connect from 0 to pi over 2. we're going to take theta and stick it in between those two values and hopefully that will give us exactly one petal of the rose when i hit window i see the x min and or the theta min and the theta max these are our range for our theta so we're going to go from 0 enter to pi over 2 and if i type in pi and divide by 2 and hit enter it's going to give me a decimal approximation for that and now i can hit graph because it's already been graphed for me and what i notice is that does give me exactly one petal of my rose like we were hoping for so all that to give you kind of an orientation to how to get what we want on the calculator let's see now if we can use that to help us actually do what we wanted to do which was to find areas to find an area in polar coordinates is similar to rectangular coordinates in that we're going to take an integral from a to b but a slight difference is we're going to take half the integral from a to b of the radius squared d theta that is going to be the big formula for today half the integral from a to b of r squared d theta so going back to the example we were just looking at let's see if we can find the area of one petal of r equals 3 sine of 2 theta well to do that we'll take one half times the integral and we need to usually do some work to find our a to b however we just found out in our previous example that that theta is going to go from 0 to pi over 2 to give us one petal of the radius squared so 3 squared is 9 sine squared of 2 theta d theta this integral then should give us the entire area of one petal i'm going to pull that 9 out because it's a constant gives us 9 halves times the integral from 0 to pi over 2. then we're integrating sine squared and we know we can't really integrate sine squared but we have a nice property that says that's one half minus one half of the cosine of double the angle four theta d theta and now i can integrate that to get nine halves times half of a theta minus the antiderivative of cosine is sine but we have to divide by that 4 so we actually end up with 1 8 sine of 4 theta and that's going to be integrated from 0 to pi over 2. so we have 9 halves times one half of theta which is pi over two minus one eighth of the sine of four times theta four times pi over two is two pi minus one half times zero plus one eighth times the sine of 4 times 0 which is 0. and when we simplify all that we get 9 halves times pi over four and all the rest of the pieces actually go to zero so for our final area of one petal we get nine pi over eight so that's how we can find area with these polar coordinates let's do one more example to make sure we've got it let's find the area inside r equals 1 minus the cosine of theta well first you get an idea of what's going on we'll go back to our calculator we'll clear out the old function we're doing 1 minus the cosine of theta under window remember we've got to reset our min and max otherwise weird things happen we want to go from 0 to 2 pi as a default and then we'll zoom on my calculator hitting zero will give me a zoom fit your calculator might have a different number and this is kind of the shape we're trying to find the area inside of well what we see is it seems to start and end again where the radius is 0. so again we're going to figure out when that radius is 0 so 0 equals 1 minus cosine of theta if i add cosine of theta to both sides we want to know where the cosine is equal to one and if i think about my unit circle cosine is equal to one over here on the right so theta is equal to 0 2 pi 4 pi and so on but we just want to get one loop of it which goes from zero to two pi so we want theta to range from zero to two pi and that's where we set the defaults so we don't need to adjust it at all we're ready now to go to our formula that says the area is one half times the integral from a to b which we just found out was zero to two pi of the radius squared one minus cosine theta squared d theta and it might be worth on this one to go ahead and square that out 1 minus 2 cosine theta plus cosine squared of theta d theta we recognize that cosine squared we should be really familiar with what to do with that one from 0 to 2 pi of 1 minus 2 cosine theta plus let's break this up to one half plus one half cosine of two theta d theta we could combine like terms if we wanted to but there's not much combining that happens so let's go ahead and take the antiderivative which is going to be one half times a theta minus two sine theta plus one half of a theta plus the antiderivative of cosine is sine of two theta but to account for that 2 theta we have to divide by 2 which gives us 1 4 and we're integrating from 0 to 2 pi plugging that in then we get one half times theta which is 2 pi notice when we plug 2 pi into sine we'll get 0. actually i shouldn't cross it off just in case we get something on the subtraction step so we have two pi plus one half of theta one half of two pi is just one pi and one fourth sine of two two times two pi which is the sine of four pi which is also zero and then when we plug zero in everything goes off to zero the sine of zero is zero theta is zero half of zero is zero so we end up with a total of three pi over two is the area inside that curve one minus the cosine of theta so as long as we've got this important formula down one half integral from a to b of r squared d theta the integrals the area inside these polar curves is not too difficult to find we can do one twist on it though and instead find the area between curves and just like we found the area between curves with rectangular coordinates by subtracting the top from the bottom we're going to do much the same thing to find the area between curves we want to find the area outside of r equals 2 plus 2 sine theta and inside r equals 6 sine theta well first we need to get an idea of what shape we're looking at so we're going to use the calculator to help us with that clear out the old function the first function that we want to be outside of is 2 plus 2 sine of theta and we want to be inside 6 sine of theta as i graph this i'm going to take very careful note of which graph graphs first because i want to be outside of the 2 plus 2 sine theta i want to be outside of the first curve and inside the second curve the 6 sine theta so as it graphs i need to be very aware of outside the first inside the second let's go ahead and hit zoom fit which is zero on my operating system outside that first one inside the second one so i want to be outside the first curve and inside the second one it's kind of this sideways half moon on top is what i want to be inside of let's kind of draw a quick picture of it so one function was this half circle the other function was kind of this upside down heart looking thing but the top function the blue function is the six sine theta i want to be inside that one and outside the 2 plus 2 sine theta which means the area we're finding is this kind of sideways half moon on top which means we really need to know what are the two points of intersection so i know where to integrate from and to well those lines intersect where the radii are equal so we'll set the two functions equal the first is two plus two sine theta the second is six sine theta subtract 2 sine theta from both sides to get 4 sine theta divide by 4 and one half equals the sine of theta i think about my unit circle sine the y coordinate is one half at pi over six and five pi over six so theta is equal to pi over six and five pi over 6. to test that let's set our minimum and maximum on our calculators hitting window we're going to go from pi over 6 to 5 pi over 6 and now when it graphs it's going to graph the exact shape that we want to find the area of we're ready to integrate we know that the area is found by taking one half times the integral from our limits of pi over six to five pi over 6 and we know from our prior study that we take the outside function minus the inside function so the outside function is 6 sine theta but remember in polar coordinates we have to square them so we have 36 sine squared of theta and we'll subtract the other function which is 2 plus 2 sine of theta squared d theta we now have the integral that we can use to find the area between these curves a little simplifying as we square out the binomial so one half from pi over 6 to 5 pi over 6 of 36 sine squared theta minus that minus has to distribute through 2 squared is 4 minus 8 sine theta minus 4 sine squared of theta d theta i'm gonna combine like terms so we have one half times the integral of pi over six to five pi over six 36 minus four is 32 sine squared of theta minus 4 minus 8 sine of theta d theta noticing here that all my terms in that integral are even i'm going to go ahead and distribute that one half through the integral so i don't have to worry about it anymore pi over 6 to 5 pi over 6 of 16 sine squared theta minus 2 minus 4 sine theta d theta now i'm going to break up that sine squared and we're going to multiply by 16. so when we have the one half sixteen times a half is eight minus sixteen times a half is eight cosine of 2 theta minus 2 minus 4 sine theta d theta i'm going to combine like terms again pi over 6 to 5 pi over 6 8 minus 2 is 6 minus 8 cosine of 2 theta minus 4 sine of theta d theta and now we're finally ready to integrate we end up with six theta minus the antiderivative cosine is sine of two theta when we divide by two we get four minus the antiderivative of sine is negative cosine so we have 4 cosine theta integrated from pi over 6 to 5 pi over 6. so let's plug it all in we have six times the five pi over six minus four sine of two theta which is five pi over three plus four cosine of theta which is five pi over six minus six times the pi over six plus 4 times the sine of 2 times pi over 6 which makes it pi over 3 minus 4 times the cosine of pi over three oops sorry pi over six so to help us out we might want to think about our unit circle we need to know a 5 pi over 3 which is going to be down in the fourth quadrant this is 5 pi over three it has coordinates of one half comma negative root three over two we're also going to need to know about five pi over six which is over here five pi over six that has coordinates of negative root three over two comma one half we need to know about pi over three which has coordinates of onehalf comma root 3 over 2 and pi over 6 is another one we need a lot of them on here that one's pi over six has coordinates of root three over two comma one half all right plugging it all in then we have the let's switch colors six is divide out so we have 5 pi minus 4 times the sine of pi over 5 pi over 3 assigns the y coordinate which is negative making it positive root 3 over 2 plus 4 times the cosine of 5 pi over 6 cosine's the x coordinate making it negative root 3 over 2 minus the 6's divide out just pi plus 4 times the sine of pi over 3 sine being the y coordinate root 3 over 2 minus 4 times the cosine of pi over 6 cosine being the x coordinate root 3 over 2 and this simplifies quite nicely because we've got a couple opposites in there 4 root 3 over 2 and negative 4 root 3 over 2 is 0. 4 root 3 over 2 and negative 4 root 3 over 2 is 0. so we're just left with 5 pi minus pi leaves us with 4 pi the area that we're looking for on that curve beneath the 6 sine theta and above the 2 plus 2 sine theta area there is four pi let's do one last example make sure we've got a really good grip on this number two we're gonna find the area inside the curve r equals 4 cosine theta and outside the curve r equals 2. let's take a look at our calculator all right first thing we need to do is plug this formula in so let's delete out these old formulas from the previous problem our first one is 4 cosine theta which means the first graph we want to be inside of so we'll take note of the first graph the second graph of 2 we want to be outside of for our window we have to reset it to 0 to 2 pi and then i'll zoom fit so we get a good picture we want to be inside this first curve on the right outside the second curve on the left so we're really looking for the right area here shaded so if we draw a quick picture of what we're working with the first function was the circle on the right the second function was the circle in the center and if you can excuse my crude drawing you see we want the area the right part of that which means again so we know our limits of integration we need to find where those points intersect that's where our functions are equal so we will say four cosine theta equals two divide by two cosine theta is one half so if i think about my unit circle where is the cosine onehalf the xcoordinate is onehalf up on top and near the bottom that happens at pi over three and 5 pi over 3 so we're going to say theta is probably going to go from pi over 3 to 5 pi over 3 but just to make sure we'll go back to our calculator and check to make sure that's going to give us the area on the right that we're looking for we'll click window for the minimum we want to go from pi over 3 to a maximum of 5 pi over 3 and when we hit graph what you notice is something unexpected happens it does not give us this section to the right we want it gave us everything else that we didn't want so we were going from pi over 3 to 5 pi over 3 and that didn't work maybe what we want to do is go the other direction and get that other grouping well we can't go from 5 pi over 3 to pi over 3 but what we can do is continue around the circle and after 2 pi the next top point 6 pi over 3 one more pi over 3 is 7 pi over 3 because remember our trig formulas have an infinite number of solutions the next point we could try is 7 pi over 3 and we're probably going to be between those values so let's take a look at the graph and see if going from a window of 5 pi over 3 to the next lap around at 7 pi over 3 does that give me the graph i want hitting graph you see it does give us that half moon shape that we were looking for so these now are our limits of integration for this problem now that we have our limits of integration we're ready to use our formula that the area is onehalf times the integral from 5 pi over 3 to 7 pi over 3 of the outside function which was the blue one before cosine theta squared makes it 16 cosine squared theta minus the outside function that we crossed out which is just 2 squared becomes 4 d theta and now we have the integral we need to solve to find the area between these two curves again one thing i notice is all the terms are even so i'm going to go ahead and distribute that one half through so we have the integral from 5 pi over 3 to 7 pi over 3 of 8 cosine squared theta minus 2 d theta and it seems like the trig formula that we use the most anymore is that cosine squared or sine squared so we're going to integrate from 5 pi over 3 to 7 pi over 3. cosine squared gives us a onehalf but when multiplied by 8 that leaves us with 4 plus 1 half times 8 is 4 cosine of 2 theta minus the 2 still d theta let's go ahead and combine the like terms of four minus two so we're integrating five pi over three to seven pi over three of two plus four cosine of two theta d theta and now we're ready to actually integrate when we integrate we get 2 theta plus the antiderivative of cosine is the sine of two theta we have to divide by the two which just leaves us with two sine of two theta integrated from five pi over three to seven pi over three so when we plug that in we get two times our theta which is seven pi over three plus two times the sine of two theta which is fourteen pi over three minus two times theta which is five pi over three minus two times the sine of two theta which is ten pi over three let's think about our unit circle to help us with those strange ones we've got to figure out 14 pi over 3 and 10 pi over 3. that's going to loop us around the circle a couple times so to help us out i'm going to count in three pies so we've got zero three pie over three six pie over three nine pie over three and twelve pi over 3 looping us around the circle over and over again uh that should help us see that 14 pi over 3 is right here 14 pi over 3 is going to be the same as 2 pi over 3. so the coordinates there are negative onehalf comma root 3 over 2. and later when we get to the 10 pi over 3 10 pi is a little more than 9 so it's going to be down here 10 pi over 3 turns out to be the same as 4 pi over 3. so the coordinates there are negative onehalf negative root 3 over 2. so when we simplify to bring it all together we get fourteen pi over three plus two times the sine of fourteen pi over three sines the y coordinate root three over two times two gives us just a root three minus 2 times 5 is 10 pi over 3 minus 2 times the sine of 10 pi over 3 sine being the y coordinate is going to be a negative negative times a negative is a positive root three over two times two is just root three combining like terms fourteen minus ten is four pi over three plus root 3 and root 3 is 2 square roots of 3 which means the area between these two circles is going to be 4 pi over 3 plus 2 square roots of 3. so now it's your turn to take a look at some of these on the homework assignment to practice them get really good the key formula here for the area we've been using it all the way through is that the area is one half times the integral from a to b of the radius squared d theta try a few of these and we'll look at them more in class this video is going to start a chapter that goes a completely different direction than the sequences and series that we've been focusing on up to this point we're going to start by looking at these things called conic sections answering the question what are conic sections and we're going to just barely touch the surface of what a conic section is each one of these different conic sections we could probably spend a whole day or more on and instead we're going to do them all in one day so we're just going to hit the highlights there are several conic sections the first one is the circle and we actually have a very precise definition for the circle it is all points that are equidistant from a point so if i have a point here in the center and i have some set distance we'll call that distance r no matter where that set distance goes that distance is going to be the same and if we collect all of the points that are exactly a distance of r away from that point we should get a perfect circle with radius r the equation that builds a circle like this is x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared where the point h comma k is the center of the circle and r is equal to the radius of the circle so if i wanted to find the equation of a circle centered at five comma negative two with radius 3 we could build that knowing that the center is h comma k and the radius is that radius of 3. so my equation becomes open a parenthesis x minus h which is the x coordinate of the center 5 squared plus y minus k which is the y coordinate of the center subtracting a negative 2 is the same as adding 2 squared equals the radius squared the radius is three three squared is nine and this gives us the equation of the circle centered at five negative two with a radius of three now a circle is the most basic of the conic sections and we don't actually spend much time on it because of how basic it is so let's go to the next most interesting conic section and that is the parabola a parabola has a very specific definition also that has to do with distance as well a parabola is all the points with a distance from a point and we call this other point the focus equal to the distance from a line and that line we call the directrix so what this means is we've got this parabola there is a focus inside the parabola and there is a directrix outside of the parabola and the idea of a parabola is if i take the distance from the focus to the line let's call that a it's going to be the same as from the parabola to the directrix that distance is going to be the same now it's going to be a different distance if i go maybe more diagonal and slightly to the right we'll call that b but then we'll get the same distance as you drop down to the directrix b so wherever this line is drawn c that length is the same as the length to the directrix c those lengths are always the same now this drawing is not to scale and not a perfect parabola so it those don't look quite the same but if it were a perfect parabola those distances from the focus to the graph would be the same as the distance from the graph to the directrix for the equation of the parabola it is based on the direction of the parabola the most common type of parabola that we are familiar with is the parabola that opens upwards the parabola that opens up where it has a vertex we'll call that vertex at the point h comma k and then up above the vertex is the focus and then below it is the line that is the directrix the equation of a parabola like this is y equals 1 over 4p times x minus h squared plus k where h comma k is that vertex point also it's important to note that this letter p p is the distance to either the directrix or focus depending on which direction we're going from the vertex and we already said the vertex h comma k is the vertex coordinates and the equation y equals since we drop from the vertex down to the directrix we can take that k coordinate of the vertex and subtract the p to get the directrix also of note just a little side note if the parabola is upside down the only difference is we make the whole thing negative so we would have y equals negative 1 over 4p times x minus h squared plus k exactly the same but the negative in front would make the parabola go the other direction so that's the first direction of a parabola the second direction we have a parabola actually goes the other direction it goes opening to the right with a vertex still at our point h comma k but now the focus is off to the right and the directrix is vertical this equation is x equals 1 over 4p times y minus k squared plus h and p on here is still the distance to either the directrix or the focus from the vertex so again that distance between them is p just like it was before h comma k is still the center notice the k is always with the y so it's y minus k here but that is the vertex and the directrix equation then is an x equals equation it's x equals h minus that p that distance from the vertex to the directrix and again we have a little side note that if the parabola opens off to the right that just means we have a negative in front of everything so it's x equals negative 1 over 4p times x minus k i'm sorry y minus k squared plus h so with the parabola the equation is based on the direction so with this in mind let's see if we can find some equations of parabola first let's say we want a parabola that has a focus at three comma two and directrix at y equals 8. i always try and draw a rough sketch of what's happening to help me decide what type of equation i'm using if i look at the point 3 comma 2 for the focus 3 comma 2 is the focus and the directrix is a y equals equation but it's y equals eight y equals is a horizontal line the parabola then needs to go between them and the only way we can get between them is to have our parabola come up kind of like this with our vertex in the center so the focus is at three comma two the directrix is at y equals eight we need to know first what is our p that p distance that separates the focus from the vertex and the vertex from the directrix well because we're going horizontally with our p distance we look at the y values of 8 and 2. the distance from eight to two eight minus two is six and that covers notice the p is there twice so six is equal to two p we can see that p value is going to be equal to three so the vertex coordinate then we're still going to the right the same three but now we're going to be off by a distance of p which is three well the focus had a y coordinate of two three more would give it a y coordinate of five so the vertex has a coordinates of 3 comma 5 and we know the p is equal to 3 so we're ready to make our equation it's a y equals equation because it's a vertical parabola but it opens downwards so we know it needs to be negative negative 1 over 4 times p which we found out was 3 times x minus the x coordinate of 3 squared plus the y coordinate which we found out to be 5. a little simplifying in that denominator we find out that y is equal to negative 1 12 times x minus 3 squared plus 5. and so in this way we can really use our sketch of the parabola it doesn't have to be to scale or perfect but our sketch really helps us build the pieces we need the vertex and that distance p between the vertex and the focus or the vertex and the directrix let's try one more example let's find the equation of the parabola that has a focus of negative 4 comma negative 1 and directrix of x equals negative eight so this time if we were to draw our rough sketch the focus is at negative four negative 1 which is the focus and the directrix is an x equals equation which means it's a vertical line x equals negative 8 which is even further to the left so that tells us our parabola has to come in through the center we need to find our vertex coordinates the focus is negative four negative one the directrix is x equals negative eight so as we go after our p value remember p is the distance between the vertex and the focus or between the vertex and the directrix so we have two p's of total distance between the vertex and the directrix the directrix has an x of negative eight the focus has an x of negative four if we subtract those we find the distance between them is four units so p here must be equal to two so if we have a distance of two between them we know that the x coordinate of the vertex is two away from our vertex i'm sorry from our focus and the directrix two away from negative four is negative six and we keep the same ycoordinate of negative one and we now know our vertex is at negative six negative one well since our parabola opens to the right it's an x equals it's positive because it's open the correct direction one over four 4p which we found out was 2 times y minus the k the y coordinate of the vertex which is negative 1 so plus 1 squared plus the x coordinate which is negative six cleaning up that denominator we have x equals one eighth times y plus one squared minus six and we now have the equation of our parabola so the parabola is our second conic section we've had circles and parabolas our third conic section is kind of a variation on the circle and it is what is called the ellipse the ellipse is also defined in terms of distance the ellipse is all the points where the sum of the distance from any point to two foci which is the plural of focus is constant an ellipse is traditionally called the oval shape and the idea of the ellipse if i had drawn it perfectly is we have two foci in the ellipse and if i were to pick any point on the ellipse and look at the distance to both foci we'll call them maybe a1 and a2 and then i picked a different point on the ellipse and took its distance to the two foci we'll call that b1 and b2 and it doesn't matter which points i pick i could pick a point that's way off on the side and i end up with c1 and c2 connecting to the two foci what happens is the sum of the distances a1 plus a2 is always constant so from the beep from the point with the b's b1 plus b2 is exactly the same distance same thing for the c1 plus c2 no matter what point i pick if i go from that point to the two vertices the total distance is always constant that's what makes an ellipse and we have two equations four ellipses and it really depends on which direction the ellipse is going the first is for the horizontal ellipse where we have x minus h squared over a squared plus y minus k squared over b squared equals one or if the ellipse opens vertically we'll put the y's first y minus k squared over still a squared plus x minus h squared over v squared equals one where the a is always bigger than the b that's important the a is always bigger than b the first denominator is always the biggest so whichever x or y has the bigger denominator we have that one come first and we have this other variable called c where c squared is equal to a squared minus b squared that's going to be an important relationship for us as we attempt to define some of the properties first the major axis which is the distance across we'll call it the long distance across it could be horizontal or vertical depending on which way the ellipse opens up but the major axis has a distance of 2 a and the minor axis which is the other direction depending on its vertical or horizontal it's the shorter distance across the middle that shorter distance is to be we also know the distance between the foci plural of focus is to c and that's where the c comes in identifying those focus or foci and of course we're getting used to seeing in all of these conic sections that the center is always the point h comma k so if all this information is true about our ellipse we should be able to find some equations let's find the equation of the ellipse that has end points of the major axes at negative three comma five and negative three comma negative seven that also has the foci at negative three comma one and negative three comma negative three notice the major axis and the foci all have an x coordinate of negative 3. the endpoints what moves is actually the ycoordinate so that tells me the ycoordinate is where we get the tall and narrow shape where we've got a center which we don't know where the center is yet but we've got two foci one above and one below the higher one has a higher y coordinate so the higher one must be negative three one the lower one must be negative three negative three and the end points of the major axes means if we draw the long line through the center the major axis is the longest line possible so the endpoints must be at negative three comma five and negative three comma negative seven we need to find a b c and the center h comma k let's do the center first that's probably the easiest to do you can see all these are in a line on negative 3 for the x coordinate the y coordinate is going to be in the middle of the foci so the folk i go from one to negative three the distance between them if we subtract one minus negative three is four so the distance between the foci let's go ahead and label that the distance between the foci is 4 and remember that is equal to 2c so we're also figuring out here at the same time that 2 equals c when we divide both sides by 2. so if the total distance is 4 half of that is 2 so to get to the center from one of the foci we'll either add or subtract 2 when we figure out the ycoordinate of the center right in the middle is at negative 1. so we've got our center we also know that the distance between the endpoints of the major axes is 2a the distance from 5 to negative 7 if we subtract is a total distance of 12 which means if we divide by 2 a is equal to 6. we still need to figure out what b is though we don't know b from this drawing but we do know that c squared is equal to a squared minus b squared and c we know is 2 2 squared is 4 equals a we know is 6 6 squared is 36 minus b squared if i add b squared to both sides and subtract 4 i find out that b squared is 32 and that's actually all we need is b squared because b squared is in the formula our formula then becomes notice this opens vertically so the y's come first y minus the y coordinate of the center is negative 1 so plus 1 squared divided by a squared 6 squared is 36 plus x minus the x coordinate which is negative 3 on the center squared divided by b squared which we just found out was 32 equals 1 and this then is the equation of the ellipse that has endpoints of the major axis at negative three five and negative three seven it also puts the foci at negative three one and negative three three let's do one more ellipse leave that on the screen let's find the ellipse that has the end points of the minor axis this is the smaller one at one negative two and one negative four also has foci at negative two negative three and three negative three notice the foci the y coordinate is consistent which means it must open up around the x's so this is going to be a horizontal ellipse we know the foci are at negative 2 negative 3. and three negative three we're going to need to find the center we're also told the end points of the minor axes the minor axis goes the short distance through the center the endpoints of the minor axes are at one negative two and one negative four well the center we know is right in the middle of those so we obviously have a y coordinate of one and right in the middle of negative two and negative four we see is negative three we also can use our distances to help us conclude a few things the distance between the foci we're looking at the x coordinate here from negative 2 to negative 3 is 5. and the distance between the foci is 2c so c equals 5 halves we also know the distance between the minor axis the minor axis gives us two b's the minor axis goes from negative two to negative four that's a total distance of two so b must be equal to one we can then find our c because c squared equals a squared minus b squared well c is five halves that's 25 fourths is equal to a squared we don't know minus b squared which is one add one to both sides that's four fourths gives us 29 fourths is equal to a squared and we're ready to make our equation because this one opens up horizontally on the x's we have the x's come first x minus the x coordinate of the center which is negative 3 plus 3 squared divided by a squared which is 29 4 plus now the y coordinate y minus the y coordinate is 1 on the center squared divided by b squared which is 1 equals 1. and even though it's a little ugly this is probably the preferred format of the ellipse because it shows all of that information we want to see it helps us identify how big the minor axis is the major axis is where the center is so we'll go ahead and leave it in this form and so that's our third conic section the ellipse there is one last conic section conic section number four we'll call it d here it is called the hyperbola and the hyperbola is defined really similar to how we define the ellipse it is all points where the only difference is the ellipse was a sum the hyperbola is the difference of the distance from any point to the two foci is constant and the idea here is a hyperbola is going to look something like this where there's going to be two vertices and we take a look at the distance if i pick a point on one hyperbola the two distances the longer one we'll call the first point the shorter one we'll call the second point no matter what point i pick on whichever one the longer one i'll call the first point the shorter one the second point no matter which points i pick when i subtract the a1 minus a2 i'll get the exact same value as if i took the b1 minus the b2 or wherever i want to draw these lines the hyperbola has that distance constant just like with the ellipse there are two equations that we use for the hyperbolas the first equation is used if it opens kind of the traditional way off to the left and right this is where x minus h squared over a squared minus y minus k squared over b squared equals 1. and here it doesn't matter which one's bigger a or b what's important here is the x is positive and the y squared is negative because if we switch that and we have the y minus k squared over a squared minus the x minus h squared over b squared equals one then the hyperbola is open vertically we also still have this relationship with c c squared this time is equal to the sum of a squared plus b squared and with that we end up with these important properties the distance between the foci is 2c and the distance between the vertices that's the corners of the hyperbolas is 2a we still need to find b to figure out how wide everything's going to be and then of course we still have our center at h comma k so using this let's see if we can find some equations starting with a hyperbola that has vertices at negative four comma three and two comma three and also has foci at negative seven comma three and five comma three so again i like to do a rough sketch just so i have an idea of what's happening with this i see the vertices the xcoordinate is changing and the ycoordinate is constant so the xcoordinate is going to change left and right well the ycoordinate is going to remain constant so we have vertices at negative 4 comma 3. and 2 comma 3. we also have foci out here at negative 7 comma 3 and 5 comma 3. we need to know where the center is and also find our a b and c well the center is going to be right in the middle of the vertices our vertices the x's are changing from negative 4 to 2 and if we subtract that's a total distance of 6. we know the distance between the vertices is 2a so that tells us that a is equal to three the distance to the center is also equal to three so if we back up three or add three depending on which point we're going from we'll end up with negative 1 comma 3 as the coordinates of our center point we now have our h and k we also have our a the only other thing we can pull off of the graph is c which we get from the distance between the foci the foci go from x of negative 7 to 5. that's a total distance of 12 which we know is 2 c so c must be equal to six now we can go after the b because we know c squared is a squared plus b squared c was six squared is thirty six a was 3 squared is 9 and subtracting 9 from both sides b squared is going to be equal to 27. so go into our equation then the equation is because it opens sideways we start with the x x minus h h it comes from the center so three i'm sorry negative one so we'll add one squared divided by our a squared three squared is nine minus y minus the y coordinate of the center which is 3 squared divided by b squared which we just found out is 27 equals 1. let's try one last hyperbola before we step away from them let's find the hyperbola that has vertices at two comma three and two comma negative one it's also going to have foci at two comma five and two comma negative three this time i see the x's staying consistent which means the hyperbola is going to go up and down around the y's so the vertices are at two comma three and two comma negative one the foci are at two comma five and two comma negative three we need to find the center and a b and c well first we know that a comes from the distance between the vertices the x's are the same so we'll focus on the y's the distance from three to negative one is four so four must equal two a therefore a equals two so the distance from the center to the edge is two x coordinates stays the same the y coordinate is two off from the vertices so three minus two is one the center must be at two comma one the vertices are two c apart so from five to negative three is eight that's two c's so c must equal four and then we're ready to go after our b because we know a squared plus b squared equals c squared a is two two squared is four plus b squared equals c which is 4 squared is 16. subtract 4 from both sides and b squared equals 12. now we have all the pieces we need to build our equation this one opens vertically so it's going to be a y first y minus the y coordinate of the center which is 1 squared over a squared 2 squared is 4 minus x minus the x coordinate is 2 squared over b squared which is 12 equals 1 and we have our hyperbola so this video was a quick overview of all of the conic sections that we're going to work with in this course we talked about hyperbolas we talked about ellipses we talked about parabolas and we talked about circles four common conic sections that we're going to talk about further in class so take a look at the homework assignment try a few of these there's a lot of pieces to keep track of but they're not too hard as a whole so take a look at them and we will see you in class this next chapter is going to take a look at vectors and how vectors can help us in calculus and in other contexts so the question we're going to do as we set up this new study of vectors is what exactly are they what are vectors and quite simply a vector is a quantity with magnitude which is a fancy word for size and direction and an example of a vector we might represent a vector from a point out to another point with direction that would be a vector we might label it vector v and what's interesting about vectors is they're not necessarily unique let's say we've got a vector u and we use the little kind of vector looking symbol above it to let us know that's a vector vector u goes from the origin to the point three comma two and vector v goes from negative 3 negative 1 to 0 comma 1. i want to notice really quick a bit of notation i have this little arrow looking thing above the vector that i'm going to write to represent a vector the textbook uses bold letters to represent vectors it's really the same thing it's just hard to type by handwriting a bold u and a bold v so my notes are going to be slightly different than the textbook but that line above means we're talking about a vector so let's look at what these vectors look like the first vector it says goes from the origin to the point three comma two so the vector goes from the origin to the point three comma two that's vector u the second vector goes from negative three comma one to zero comma one and you notice that both vectors are going the same direction and both vectors are the same size because both vectors have the same magnitude in the same direction we can say that those are equivalent vectors they both represent the same vector the same size and the same direction now we need a good way to represent vectors and one way we can represent vectors it's what's called component form which basically means it is the size and direction from the origin and usually we represent the vector with square brackets the xcoordinate and the ycoordinate from the origin now vectors aren't always set up from the origin so to find the component form what we can do is we can subtract the terminal point minus the initial point so for example if we were asked to find the component form of a vector with initial point of negative 3 negative 1 and terminal point of negative 2 comma three we could do that by finding the x component and the y component by subtracting the terminal point minus the initial point so the terminal point for x starts at negative two minus the initial point of negative three so negative two minus the negative 3 is going to equal 1. the x component is 1. for the y component we take the terminal point of three and we subtract the negative one and we end up with four and we take the x and y components together to represent our vector v as the x component comma the y component and this is our component form of the vector again i want to make sure i emphasize that we use pointed brackets when talking about a vector pointed brackets and that vector of 1 4 tells us that if this vector was centered at the origin it would go to the point 1 comma 4 with that same magnitude and direction speaking of magnitude quite often we're going to be interested in how exactly we can find that magnitude and the way we represent the magnitude of a vector is it looks like our double absolute values and if i think about a vector if i want to know the total distance of that vector the magnitude of the vector we could look as it added as set up with an x component and a y component and you can see the pythagorean theorem could be used to find the size of that vector x squared plus y squared equals the magnitude squared or if we take the square root of both sides the magnitude is the square root of the x component squared plus the y component squared and this gives us a nice little formula to find the magnitude of any vector so for example if i wanted to find the magnitude of a vector v equal to negative five comma four we would say that the magnitude of the vector is equal to the square root of the x component squared 5 squared is 25 plus the y component squared 4 squared is 16. and 25 plus 16 is 41 and so the magnitude the size of this vector is the square root of 41. let's try one more example let's find the magnitude of let's do the vector w is equal to fourfifths comma threefifths well the magnitude of vector w is the square root of the x component squared which is 16 over 25 plus the y component squared 9 over 25 which is the square root of 25 over 25 or the square root of 1 which is just 1. and this is actually kind of interesting to us whenever a vector has magnitude of 1 we call that a unit vector a unit vector has magnitude of one in fact there are some special unit vectors that we are particularly interested in we call these the standard unit vectors there are two standard unit vectors that we're going to talk about in this video and there's a third one that we're going to talk about in the next video the first vector is vector i which has an x component of 1 and the other component is 0. other one is j j has an x component of zero and a y component of one basically i is a horizontal vector with magnitude of one and j is a vertical vector of magnitude of one and what's important is the vectors i and j meet at a ninety degree angle because we have these two special vectors i and j that are universally accepted we can write our vectors can be written as a linear combination of i and j vectors whatever i is multiplied by represents the x component and whatever j is multiplied by represents the y component so for example we talked about this vector an earlier example of negative 5 comma 4. this same vector could be expressed as standard unit vectors as negative 5 times the i vector because negative 5 is the x component plus 4 times the j vector which represents the y component another example would be the vector 2 comma negative 1. because 2 is the x component we could write that as 2i and negative 1 being the y component can be written as negative j this even gives us a way to write vectors that have zero for one of the components maybe zero comma three there's zero i components but there are three j vectors combined together similarly negative 2 comma 0 would just use the x component so we have negative 2 i so in this way every vector could actually be represented in two different ways it can be represented as standard unit vectors or it can be represented as a component vector as we go through this video we're going to express the vectors in both ways so we get used to seeing them both ways but make sure as you're working on the assignments and ultimately quizzes and tests you take the time to be aware of what format the question's asking you to express the answer in all right now that we've taken the time to define vectors let's see if we can do a little bit of work with vectors working with vectors it's really what we're going to do this entire chapter but looking at some basic operations with vectors one thing we can do with vectors is we can combine them together we can combine vectors let's say vector v is equal to x1 y1 and vector w is equal to x2 y2 two operations that are very common with vectors one is called scalar multiplication and this is the idea if k is just a number and we wanted to multiply it times the vector v what that really means is take vector v which had an x component of x 1 and multiply the x component by the k and multiply the y component by the k it kind of feels like we're distributing as we multiply by the scalar or multiply by the number k vectors can also be combined with other vectors though with what is called vector addition where we end up with vector v plus vector w and when we add vectors together what that really means we want to do is add their components together x1 plus x2 to get the new x component y1 plus y2 to get the new y component and similarly using the idea of an inverse we could also do vector subtraction where we subtract the components and so we end up with addition and subtraction of vectors and also a multiplication by a scalar in future videos we'll take a look at how we can multiply a vector times a vector there's actually two different ways to do that depending on what we're looking for specifically so for now we'll stick with vector addition and scalar multiplication so let's let the vector a be the vector seven comma one and the vector b is going to have an initial point of 3 comma 2 and terminal point of negative 1 comma negative 1. i'm going to pause here because before we get too far before we can do any linear combinations of vectors with each other we need to know what vector b actually is in component form so we already know vector a is 7 comma 1. to get vector b we need to subtract the terminal point minus the initial point so for the x component negative one minus three is negative four comma negative one minus two is negative three so we have these two vectors first problem we're going to attempt to solve is figure out what negative 2 times vector a is this is scalar multiplication because we're multiplying by a scalar or a constant negative two times vector a which is seven one and similar to distributing we end up with the vector negative 14 negative 2 or if you prefer an i j form negative 14 i minus 2 j let's look at vector a plus vector b here we're adding two vectors together vector a is seven comma one plus vector b is negative four negative three and for vector addition we just add the individual components together seven minus four is three and one plus negative three is negative two and in component form our sum is 3 negative 2 with i j we have 3i minus 2 j let's subtract the vectors a minus b well vector a is seven one minus vector b which is negative four negative three subtracting component by component seven minus a negative four becomes eleven one minus a negative three becomes four and we have our component form of a minus b which is equal to 11 i plus 4 j we want to make sure we always have that vector notation above i and j one last one of these let's find 3a minus 4b to do this we have three times the a vector the a vector is seven comma one minus four times the b vector negative four comma negative three well when we do that operation initially we have scalar multiplication which gives us 21 comma 3 plus i'm going to go ahead and take that negative in negative 4 times negative 4 is 16 negative 4 times negative 3 is 12 and now we're ready to add these vectors together 21 plus 16 is 37 3 plus 12 is 15 and we have our component form solution which is equal to 37 i plus 15 j and in this way you can see how we can do lots of different combinations of our a and b vectors another thing we can do with vectors is we can find a described vector using our trig properties and to kind of set this up we'll think about the fact that if i have a vector v the x coordinate of that vector using trig we're used to saying that x coordinate is the cosine of the theta angle that is formed and the y coordinate is the sine of theta but that comes off the unit circle if the vector is not a unit vector we need to multiply by the magnitude of the vector so we have the magnitude of the vector times cosine gives the x component and the magnitude of the vector times sine gives the y component and in this way we can now find the vector with magnitude 10 that forms a 120 degree angle because the x component is the magnitude of 10 times the cosine of the angle and the y component is the magnitude of 10 times the sine of the angle magnitude of 10 sorry well we need to know what the sine and cosine of 120 is so if we draw our little unit circle on here 120 degree angle is right up here it's the same as 2 pi over 3. so the x coordinate is negative one half and the y coordinates root three over two so ten cosine of one twenty would be ten times the x coordinate of negative one half our x components negative five for the y coordinate the sine of 120 is the y coordinate of root three over two which gives us 5 root 3 and so for our final vector that has a magnitude of 10 and is going to form 120 degree angle it's going to be negative 5 comma 5 root 3. or negative 5 i plus 5 root 3 j let's try one more and do this next one in radians instead of degrees let's find a vector with magnitude for forming a seven pi over four angle if i think about my unit circle 7 pi over 4 is down here with coordinates root 2 over two comma negative root two over two so when we want the x component it's the magnitude of four times the cosine of seven pi over four which is 4 times cosine the x coordinate root 2 over 2 or 2 root 2. to get the y component exactly the same we're just going to take the sine instead of 7 pi over 4 which is 4 times negative root 2 over 2 which gives us negative 2 root 2. and so our vector with magnitude of 4 that forms a 7 pi over 4 angle is 2 root 2 comma negative 2 root 2 in component form or in terms of i and j it's going to be 2 root 2 i minus 2 root 2 j so trig can be very helpful as we work with vectors we're going to do quite a bit of trig as we do different angles with vectors throughout this course but i want to do one other thing with vectors as we finish out our introduction to vectors and that is looking at this concept of finding unit vectors in the same direction and the trick here to get a unit vector is we're going to use a scalar multiplication basically we want to divide the vector down so it just has a magnitude of one so its magnitude is currently eight we need to divide by eight if its magnitude is 12 we need to divide by 12. we are going to take 1 over the magnitude of the vector times the vector to give us a unit vector in the same direction so for example let's say we've got the vector v is equal to 9 comma 2 and we want to find a unit vector in the same direction well first we need to know the magnitude of the vector so we know how much we have to shrink it by the magnitude is the square root of the x component plus the y component squared each so here we end up with the square root of 85 as the magnitude which means we can take 1 over the square root of 85 times the vector which will keep the vector going in the same direction but it will shrink its magnitude down so it's a unit vector this gives us our new vector of 9 over the square root of 85 comma 2 over the square root of 85 or if you prefer 9 over the square root of 85 i plus 2 over the square root of 85 j that is a unit vector in the same direction as the original vector 9 2 by multiplying by the reciprocal of the magnitude one nice thing about knowing the unit vector is it makes it very easy to get a vector of any size in the same direction to get a vector of magnitude k in the same direction we not only take one over the magnitude of the vector times the vector but we're also going to multiply by our desired magnitude of k so for example if we want a vector let's stick with 9 2 we're going to find a vector in the same direction but instead of a unit vector we want it to be of magnitude five well we already found out in the previous example that the magnitude of the vector is equal to the square root of 85. we want to get a magnitude of 5 so we're not only going to divide by the square root of 85 but we're also going to multiply by 5 and we use that as our scalar times the vector 9 2. and that gives us 45 over the square root of 85 for the x component comma 10 over the square root of 85 for the y component or in terms of i and j 45 over root 85 i plus 10 over root 85 j and that now is a vector of the same direction but now with magnitude 5. we haven't really done any calculus yet we've just been kind of exploring with this concept of a vector using scalar multiplication vector addition i k j vectors calculating the magnitude of a vector so it's been a really brief overview of vectors in the plane twodimensional vectors but it's really important we're comfortable with these before we get to too many complex topics that these are built on so i want you to spend a day practicing with these vectors on the homework assignment we'll talk about them more in class and answer any questions that you may have now that we've taken a look at how vectors work in two space we're ready to answer the question about how do vectors work in three d in three dimensions in space but before we do that let's take a quick look at 3d graphing because we do not have as much experience with 3d graphing as we do with 2d graphing and we can think about 3d graphing as graphing in space where it's kind of like the corner in a house where one wall coming out becomes your xaxis the other wall coming out becomes your yaxis uh intersecting with the floor and then coming up vertically is what we will call the zaxis and in this way we end up with our x y z space and you can also go negative y and negative x and negative z so we get the origin is just kind of a fixed point out in space and so then if we were asked to actually sketch a point let's sketch the point one comma two comma three this becomes quite a tricky task to do in two dimensions but we'll do the best we can here uh we'll have our zaxis our yaxis and the xaxis forming the corner of the house and we can almost think about these as counting out on the yaxis one two three counting out on the xaxis one two three and on the zaxis one two three and it might be easier to kind of visualize where the point one two three is if we graph a threedimensional box that sits in this corner where the box has dimensions of one by two by three so the box is gonna have a dimension of one down the xaxis two across the yaxis so we kind of end up with this shape and then vertically we're going to go up three units and so you almost end up with this three dimensional box sitting in the corner and that front corner closest to us becomes the point one two three because it goes a distance of one down the xaxis a distance of two down the yaxis and then vertically up a distance of three and so that's kind of how we can sketch a point in three dimensions and where we're ultimately going is from the origin we're going to have a vector that goes out to that point diagonally across the box but before we can get to that idea of vectors which have direction and magnitude to calculate the magnitude we need to know how distance works in three dimensions now in two dimensions we're familiar with the pythagorean theorem so we could take the xcoordinate squared plus the ycoordinate squared and take the square root to get that distance or the x distance squared plus the y distance squared the square root of that equals the distance we can extend that same logic out into three dimensions so that the distance is the square root of the x distance squared plus the y distance squared plus the z distance squared so a really quick example of that would be to find the distance between the point one comma negative five comma four and the point 4 comma negative 1 comma negative 1. well if we look at our x's the distance the x's travel from 1 to 4 that's a distance of 3 when we subtract them when we look at our y's the distance the y's travel from negative 5 to negative 1 that's a distance of 4. and the z's traveling from 4 to negative 1 they cover a distance of 5 when we subtract those points so then using our distance formula the distance between them is the square root of the x distance 3 squared plus the y distance squared plus the z distance squared which gives us the square root of 9 plus 16 plus 25 which is the square root of 50. and if we want to simplify that that's 5 root 2. so distance the pythagorean theorem in three dimensions works very much the same as it does in two dimensions we just add the extra z squared to our distance formula all right that was a very brief introduction to graphing in 3d because our main interest is not graphing in 3d our main interest is in 3d vectors that go through the space and basically 3d vectors are very similar to 2d vectors we just have to add the third component to get x y z or we could add a third unit vector which is the vector k in our i j k vectors where k is equal to the vector 0 0 1 giving us one unit in the z direction so for example we could have the vector v could be equal to 1 negative 2 3. and in terms of i j k vectors then that would be i minus 2 j plus 3 k or if i had the vector u equal to 0 1 negative 2. because 0 is the i vector we don't really have an i so we just have 1j minus 2 k and that tells us that this is a vector that goes from the origin diagonally to those points either 1 negative 2 3 or 0 1 negative 2. let's see if we can find a vector with initial point of 3 8 2 and terminal point of 2 negative 1 3. well our vector we know from twodimensional vectors that we can take the terminal point and subtract the initial point and that'll give us the distance that vector's traveling so looking at the x component 2 minus 3 gives us negative 1 looking at the y component negative 1 minus 8 gives us negative 9 and looking at the z components 3 minus 2 is equal to a positive 1 or if we prefer we could say that's negative i minus 9 j plus a single k and this is that same vector and what's nice about vectors in three space once we're comfortable with vectors in two space is that we can do all the same operations from those two d vectors that we worked with in the prior video so for example if vector v is equal to negative one four three and vector w is equal to two comma zero comma negative three we could do things like find 2v minus 3w scalar multiplication and vector addition or subtraction 2 and 3 are scalars that's just 2 times the v vector of negative 1 4 3 and then a negative 3 times the vector w of 2 0 negative 3. so when we multiply those scalars through because multiplication comes first in order of operations we get negative 2 8 6 plus let's take the negative through negative 6 0 9 when those are multiplied through and finally vector addition adds those together to get negative 2 plus negative 6 is negative 8 comma 8 plus 0 comma 15. or if we do those as i j k's we have negative 8 i plus 8 j plus 15 k let's keep with these same two vectors and let's find the magnitude of vector v well magnitude is just the distance formula where we take the square root of the x component squared plus the y component squared plus the z component squared it's that pythagorean theorem we saw earlier so vector v negative 1 squared is 1 plus 4 squared is 16 plus 3 squared is 9 and we end up with the square root of 26 is the magnitude or size of vector v and once we know the magnitude we're ready to find a unit vector in the direction of v and just like with two dimensional vectors to make a vector into a unit vector in the same direction we scale or multiply by the reciprocal 1 over the square root of 26 the reciprocal of the magnitude times the vector v negative 1 4 3 which gives us the vector negative 1 over the square root of 26 4 over the square root of 26 3 over the square root of 26 or if we prefer with i j k vectors negative 1 over the square root of 26 i plus 4 over the square root of 26 j plus 3 over the square root of 26 k so as you can see working with vectors in 3d is very similar to working with vectors in two dimensions there's an extra component to work with but we follow the exact same patterns so i'll give you a chance to practice some of these on your own take a look at them and we will answer any questions you have in class working with vectors we discussed how we can add and subtract vectors together we did a multiplication with vectors called scalar multiplication where we multiplied a constant or a scalar by a vector but we haven't talked about how we can multiply two vectors together there's actually two different ways to multiply vectors together and so we specify the difference by not calling it multiplication but we call them a dot product and a cross product the difference is one gives us a scalar as a product and one gives us a vector as a product and they both have different uses depending on what we're trying to accomplish in this video we're going to look at the dot product as we answer the question how do we multiply vectors to get a scalar or a constant in other words when we multiply these vectors together using the dot product the answer is going to be a scalar not a vector so let's define this dot product let's say we've got a vector u and that vector u is x1 y1 z1 and there's another vector v that's going to be our second vector so we'll call it x2 y2 z2 as its components the way we define the product u dot v the dot product is we're going to multiply the components together and add the products so we'll take the x coordinates and multiply them together x1 x2 plus then we take the y components and multiply them together y1 times y2 plus and then we take the z components and multiply them together z1 times z2 and when we add those together we'll get some scalar so this is just a new operation we really just need to do a little bit of practice with to learn and then we'll talk about how it's useful to us when talking about vectors so for an example here we're going to do vector u is equal to 2 9 negative 1. and vector v is equal to negative 3 1 negative 4 and we're going to calculate u dot v well to do u dot v we're just going to multiply the common components together we take the x's 2 times negative 3 is negative 6. then we take the y's nine times one is a positive nine and then we take the z's negative one times negative four is a positive four and when we add those together negative six plus nine plus four we get seven so our dot product of u and v is equal to seven let's try one more example let's say vector u is equal to three i plus five j plus two k and vector v is equal to negative i plus 3k if we want the dot product u dot v we'll start by multiplying the i components together three times negative one is negative three the j components together five times and you notice there's no j component on v since there's no j component that really means there's 0 j's so 5 times 0 is plus 0. and finally on the k's 2 times 3 is a positive 6 and so when we add those together we end up with three and that's the dot product it's a very simple straightforward multiplication of vectors where we multiply the components together and add the individual products what is this useful for though well one common use of the dot product is the dot product can be used to tell us the angle between two vectors we have an important formula that says that the cosine of the angle between the vectors is equal to u dot v divided by the magnitude of u times the magnitude of v this is going to be an important formula for us to know you'll probably have it memorized by the time you finish the homework assignment because we use it a lot as we try and find the angle between two vectors so let's do some examples where we find the angle between two vectors let's start with the vector a is equal to one to zero and b is the vector 2 4 1. i like to find the individual pieces of the formula before i plug them in just makes a little more straight forward so let's find the numerator first the a dot b which is going to be 1 times 2 is 2 plus 2 times 4 is 8 plus 0 times 1 is 0. so a dot b is ten next we need the magnitude of both vectors so the magnitude of a is the square root of one squared plus two squared plus 0 squared or the square root of 5. we also need to know the magnitude of vector b vector b is the square root of 2 squared plus 4 squared plus 1 squared which is the square root of 21. now we put it all together and know that the cosine of the angle between the vectors is the dot product 10 divided by the product of the magnitudes and we multiply square roots we multiply underneath five times twenty one now we just go to our calculator to figure out what the cosine inverse of that fraction is and we can type it in just like it is cosine inverse of 10 divided by the square root of 5 times 21. make sure we close the parenthesis on the cosine inverse and this tells us that the angle is about point 22 radians so theta is equal to 0.22 radians let's do one more example finding the angle between let's say a is equal to i minus 2 j plus k and b is the vector i plus j minus 2k again i'm going to find the pieces of the formula first and then we'll go to the formula first we need to know what a dot b is 1 times 1 is 1 negative 2 times 1 is negative 2 and 1 times negative 2 is negative 2 gives us a total of negative 3 for the dot product then we need the magnitudes the magnitude of a is the square root of one plus four plus one or the square root of six the magnitude of b is the square root of one plus one plus four which is also the square root of six and so when we put that all together we know the cosine of theta is equal to the dot product negative 3 over the square root of six times six which is actually thirtysix and the square root of thirtysix is six which means this reduces to negative onehalf well here we don't have to go to the calculator because negative onehalf is one of our key points on the unit circle the xcoordinate is negative onehalf at the point two pi over three so theta must equal two pi over three this is our angle between the vectors as we're discussing the angle between vectors one important relationship comes out of this we'll go ahead and call this number three and it's this concept of what are called orthogonal vectors and orthogonal is just a big fancy word that means perpendicular or right angles basically two vectors that meet at a right angle and to set this up let's say if u dot v turned out to be zero then as we're trying to find the angle between the vectors we would say the cosine of theta is equal to the dot product divided by the magnitude of u times the magnitude of v but zero divided by anything is zero and we know from our unit circle that the x coordinate is 0 at pi over 2 so therefore the angle theta is pi over 2. we have a right angle formed between these two vectors those vectors are orthogonal if u dot v is equal to zero the vectors are orthogonal so that can save us a little bit of work if we end up with orthogonal vectors if i asked you to find the angle between vector p which is at 1 0 5 and vector q which is at 10 3 negative 2. we would start going through that same process that we had before we would first find the dot product p dot q and then we'd find the magnitudes and set up our formula but look what happens when we do p dot q we end up with 10 plus zero minus 10 to give us a dot product of 0. as soon as i see that dot product is 0 i know the vectors are orthogonal which means the angle between them has to be pi over 2 and i can stop there saves us a little bit of time in fact we can even go a step further and we can find components to make vectors orthogonal we can find maybe an x so that vector p equal to 2 8 negative 1 and vector q equal to some missing component x negative 1 2 such that those two vectors are orthogonal well if i want these vectors to be orthogonal p dot q has to equal 0. so let's calculate p dot q multiplying the x components we get 2x the y components negative 8 the z components negative 2 and to be orthogonal that has to equal 0. well this is a real simple algebra equation by adding 10 to both sides and dividing by 2 we find out if that first coordinate is a 5 p and q will be orthogonal vectors so in this video we've taken a quick look at the dot product the dot product is a way to multiply two vectors together to end up with a scalar and that dot product is commonly used to find the angle between two vectors go ahead and take a look at the homework assignment to practice these and then in our next video we'll take a look at how we can multiply vectors together to get a vector we'll see in class the second type of multiplying vectors is called the cross product and the cross product has a very specific purpose it's to answer the question how do we find a vector orthogonal to two vectors and as i said the answer to this is the cross product it's a product where we multiply two vectors together and end up with a another vector that is orthogonal or perpendicular to the other two vectors in fact let's write that down always orthogonal to the other two vectors and unlike the dot product the cross product only works in three dimensions so let's say i've got a vector u that has component form of a b c and another vector v that has component form d e f if i want to calculate the cross product of u crossed with v the way we calculate that is we take b f minus c e to get the x component c d minus a f to get the y component and ae minus bd to get the z component now while this technically is the formula for the cross product and if you really like memorizing formulas you can memorize this formula i find it very difficult to memorize the cross product formula so instead i look at a thing that comes from linear algebra that's quite simple called the determinant and here we're not going to go into detail with the determinant we're just going to look at how a determinant works with what's called the 2 by 2 matrix if i want the determinant of a b c d the way the determinant is calculated is we take the first diagonal a d and we subtract the second diagonal cb or actually let's put it alphabetically let's call it bc and if i can remember this pattern of multiplying one diagonal and subtracting the other diagonal it's actually really easy to find the cross product the cross product is the determinant of the other rows actually overcome other columns with a little caveat that the middle component we do backwards here's what i mean by that let's say we'll take the same u and v vectors and put them on top of each other u is a b c and v we said was d e f to combine these to get u crossed with v first we look at the x component when we do the x component we ignore the x column and find the determinant of what's left which is b f minus the other diagonal c e then when we do the middle component we ignore the middle column and the middle works backwards so we're going to do the backwards diagonal first so we're going to diagonal and do cd minus the af diagonal then for our third component we can ignore the third column and we've got ae minus bd and you notice that gives us the exact same formula we had up above that i highlighted in yellow but by using this determinant strategy we don't really have to memorize the formula we just have to remember ignore the column we're working on find the determinant in the middle works backwards so let's try a few examples let's say vector p is equal to 5 1 2 and vector q is equal to negative 2 3 1. if i want to do p crossed with q we can take the 5 1 2 above and the negative 2 3 1 below and we can cross them for the first component we ignore the first column and we find the determinant 1 times 1 is 1. minus two times three is six for the second component we'll ignore the second column but we have to work backwards two times negative two is negative four five times one is five and we subtract so minus five and then for the third component we ignore the third column five times three is fifteen minus one times negative two is negative two so it becomes a plus two and when we put that all together we get our cross product which is negative five negative nine seventeen and what we've done is we have found a vector that is perpendicular orthogonal to both p and q vectors now here's an interesting question though with multiplication including the dot product order does not matter does order matter with the cross product let's take a look at it let's do b here and we're going to cross them in the opposite order we're going to do q crossed with p and when we do that now we've got the q vector first negative 2 3 1 and the p vector second 5 1 2 and when we cross those let's see what we get ignoring the first column 3 times 2 is 6 minus 1 times 1 is 1 comma ignoring the second column and working backwards in the middle one times five is five minus negative two times two is negative four so plus four comma ignoring the third column negative two times one is negative 2 minus 3 times 5 is 15. and now what we end up with is 5 9 and negative 17. how does that compare with the answer we got before when we did peak.q notice every positive is negative and every negative is positive they are not the same but they're very similar because they're both perpendicular to our vectors they just need to go in opposite directions which kind of starts to lead to some properties of our cross product p cross q and q cross p are very similar they're just opposite directions let's list some properties of the cross product so first we'll do some general properties and we'll start with the one we just talked about that if we do u cross v that's going to be the opposite of v cross u another interesting thing about our properties is if you have a constant or a scalar that's multiplied by a vector it doesn't matter when or where you multiply that scalar you can take that scalar times the cross product of uv or we can do the scalar times u and then cross it with v or we can do the u crossed with the scalar times the v it doesn't matter where that scalar appears with the u with the v or in front of the cross product you'll get the same result either way another interesting result is if we take a vector and we cross it with the zero vector zero comma zero comma zero you can imagine the multiplication working out there you're ultimately doing a lot of multiplying by zero you end up with the zero vector the zero vector is just a vector filled with zeros and if we took a vector when we crossed it with itself if you imagine what's happening there is when we do that determinant step you're going to be subtracting the same thing that you multiplied and so you'll also end up with the zero vector so those are some general properties of the cross product some specific properties though with our ikj vectors that are interesting if i is crossed with j we end up with k and if j is crossed with k we end up with i and if k is crossed with i we end up with j so it kind of looks like if we cross we just end up with the other vector but one thing we have to be careful of is with cross product the order matters that means if we were to actually calculate j crossed with i we can't just say it's the missing k it's actually the opposite of k and k crossed with j is the opposite of i and i crossed with k is the opposite of j so the order does matter there with those properties so let's see if we can use some of these properties to help us simplify some of our cross products let's leave those ijk properties on the screen as we go to number three using the properties let's take a look at doing 2i crossed with 3j and the answer crossed with j well one thing we know about scalars is we can pull those scalars out front and we still get the same result so we're really talking about is 6 times i crossed with j crossed with j well we know that i j crosses to k so we have 6 k crossed with j we also know that k crossed with j notice that's backwards so we're going to get a negative out of it negative 6 i and so we end up with our final solution using the property of negative 6 i let's do another one let's do i crossed with k cross that with k crossed with j well i k crosses to j and kj actually i k crosses to negative j because the order's backwards j k or k j cross to negative i well we know these scalars these negative scalars can pull out front so negative one times negative one is a positive one we're really just doing um j crossed with i and j crossed with i we know is negative k and so in this way we can simplify using some of our cross product properties rather than having to go through all the work of the determinant to find our final cross product that's what we're looking at today though is the cross product you can either memorize the formula or remember the cross product pattern remember the center is the opposite order but the other two follow that determinant pattern we'll take a look at these in class practice some of these on the homework and we'll answer your questions when we see you vectors provide us a great transition into talking about equations of surfaces in threedimensional space we're going to start here in this section talking specifically about lines and planes so we're going to answer the question how do we find equations of lines and planes in space in 3d graphing and we'll start with the first one being the equation of a line and similar to how we do equations of lines in two space y equals mx plus b in three space we also get a slope intercept feel to a formula but we're going to set it up with vectors we're going to let r naught be a vector we're going to call it x naught y naught z naught be a vector to a point on the line we're going to let v which is going to be represented with abc be a parallel vector to the line in other words vector v is going in the same direction then actually let's look at a visual of what we have here so we've got our threedimensional space and let's say there's some line floating out here in three dimensional space we're going to take a point on the line and that point we're going to call x naught y naught z naught and so the vector that points at that is going to be vector r naught and then we're going to have another vector that's parallel to the blue line we're going to call that vector v so that's kind of visually what pieces are if we combine those pieces together the line is the vector r equal to the r naught vector plus the parallel vector times t which is going to create a parametric equation in terms of t so the line is the vector r naught plus the vector times t where we kind of have a slope intercept field where we've got a slope of the vector which is parallel and the intercept or a starting point is that r naught point so it kind of feels like that y equals mx plus b format now we can break this vector out r is the vector x y z is equal to the r naught which is the x naught y naught z naught plus the parallel vector which is a b c times the parametric variable t this is the vector equation of the line and then if we take that vector equation of the line and simplify to get a parametric equation where the vector x y z you can see if we multiply the scalar t through the abc we get a t b t c t and then we add the components together and we get x naught plus a t comma y naught plus b t comma z naught plus ct and if we take this apart component by component we end up with the parametric equations x is equal to the x component x naught plus a t y is equal to the y components y naught plus b t and z is equal to the z component z naught plus c t and this becomes the parametric equation for a line where x not y naught z naught are on the line and abc is a parallel vector and in fact we can go one step further and solve each of these equations for t to get what we call the symmetric equation for a line solving the first equation we would subtract x naught and divide by a that equals t but also the second equation is y minus y naught over b is equal to t and z minus z naught over c is equal to t and these become the symmetric equations for the line so if these are the equations for a line let's see if we can make one let's do an example where we find the equation of a line through two points we're going to find the equation of the line through the points one negative three two and five negative two eight any two points in space can be connected with a line and we can find that line first we need to know a parallel vector and a point on the line so for the parallel vector that's just going to be the vector that connects these two points together let's take the 1 negative 3 2 as the initial point and the 5 negative 2 8 as the final or terminal point let's call that t for terminal point and we know to get the vector that connects them we subtract the coordinates 5 minus 1 is 4 negative 2 minus negative 3 is positive 1 and eight minus two is six so now we know four one six is a parallel vector in the same direction as this line we can use either one of these points so see we've got our parallel vector let's do our uh r naught vector being just the first point we could have picked either point but one negative three two and from this we should be able to get a vector equation for the line the vector equation for the line is x y z is equal to the initial vector 1 negative 3 2 plus the parallel vector 4 1 6 times t and once i have the vector equation we can find the parametric equations for the line by simplifying the x coordinate is equal to a 1 plus 4 t the y component is equal to the y's which is negative three plus one t and the z component is equal to the z's which is two plus six t and this becomes the parametric equations that will build this threedimensional line that connects the two points we can then solve each of these equations for t to find the symmetric equation form of each of these lines when we do that we get x minus 1 over 4 equals t is equal to y plus 3 over 1 which we don't need to do the divide 1 which is equal to z minus 2 over 6 which are all equal to t so we have three different ways to represent this same line either in vector form parametric form or symmetric form but this gives us the equation of the line that connects the two points any two points we can find a line that connects them if we have three points though three points can be used to define what's called a plane let's look at finding the equation of a plane and a plane is just a big flat surface kind of like a piece of paper or your screen but it goes on forever just like a line goes on forever but it's incredibly thin the flat surface is this big flat space that spreads out forever and we're going to set this up in a similar but slightly different way than we set up the line we're going to let r naught be a vector to a point on the plane and just like before we can represent r naught as x naught y naught z naught and we're going to have another vector we call it the vector v before because it was parallel but this time we need a normal vector or an orthogonal vector that's perpendicular so because it's normal we're going to call it vector in be a normal which means perpendicular or orthogonal vector to the plane so visually what we have if i were to draw a picture somewhere out here is this big flat space that goes on forever and we've got a point on the plane that's our point x naught y naught z naught the vector that goes to it that's our r naught and then there's this other vector that's going to come straight out of it it's going to be perpendicular to the plane that is our normal vector what we know about vectors that are normal or orthogonal is the dot product of the vectors must equal 0. so if i pick any random point on here we'll call that vector r and i look at the vector that connects r to r naught it's going to be perpendicular to vector n well the vector that connects r to r naught is the vector r minus r naught and if i dot that vector with something that's normal to it or orthogonal to it we know orthogonal vectors have a dot product of zero so we can say that the plane is the product the normal vector with r minus r naught similar to before that normal vector we said uh let's call that normal vector just like before is going to be the vector abc so the vector a b c is dotted with the difference between our general vector at any x y z point minus the specific point on the plane x naught y naught z naught we know that product is going to be zero which means if we simplify we've got a b c dotted with x minus x naught y minus y naught and z minus z naught equals zero which means if i keep going this simplifies to what we call the scalar equation of a plane the dot product says we multiply the components a times x minus x naught plus b times y minus y naught plus c times z minus z naught zero and remember abc is the components of the normal vector and x naught y naught z naught are the coordinates of a point on the plane this is the scalar equation of a plane good one two no now i could go through a step further and i could distribute and combine like terms to get rid of the parentheses this gives what we call the general form of a plane and so when we distribute we get an ax we get a b y we get a c z and then we get a lot of constants that we're going to say all those constants are going to add together to a d equals 0. and that becomes the general form of a plane so we looked at an example where we connected two points to get a line let's do an example where we connect three points which always define a plane i guess there's one exception if those three points are linear they don't define a plane but let's say these three points are not collinear let's say our points are 3 negative 1 2 q is the point 4 negative 2 1 and r is the point negative five three negative one well the first thing we need to find the plane that connects these three points is we need the normal vector a plane is built with a normal vector and any point so we need a normal vector and the best way to get a normal vector or an orthogonal vector is to use a cross product of two vectors on the plane so we can connect p q and r in any two ways there's three or six if you count backwards ways to connect these we need to connect two of them let's connect p and q in a vector which is going to be the vector four minus three is one negative two minus negative 1 is negative 1 and 1 minus 2 is negative 1. then let's connect the vectors p and r together i could have done q and r we get the same final result any two but p to r negative five minus three is negative eight three minus a negative one is four and negative one minus two is negative three to get a vector that's normal to both of these because both these vectors actually lie on the plane connecting points that are on the plane we want a normal vector we're going to cross them and when we cross ignoring the first column negative 1 times negative 3 is 3 minus four times negative one is negative four so three plus four comma ignoring the middle column going backwards negative one times negative eight is eight minus one times negative three is positive 3 comma ignoring the third column 1 times 4 is 4 minus negative 1 times negative 8 is positive 8. and so our normal vector then is equal to seven eleven negative four we can pick any point on the plane a vector that points to any point so let's just use the first point it doesn't matter which one we use 3 negative 1 2 and now that we have a normal vector and a point we should be able to build the scalar equation and you recall the scalar equation is a times x minus x naught plus b times y minus y naught plus c times z minus z naught equals zero where a b and c come off the normal vector so a is 7 times x minus the x point which is 3 plus b which is 11 times y minus the y point which is negative 1 plus c which is negative 4 times z minus two equals zero this then is the scalar equation form of the plane that connects the three points we can do a little algebra to get the general equation form of the plane and we can get that general equation by distributing 7x minus 21 plus 11y plus 11 minus 4z plus 8 equals 0. combining like terms we get 7x plus 11y minus 4z and then we combine the negative 21 plus 11 plus 8 to get negative 2 equals 0. what i've done here is try to give you a visual of what we just graphed the 7x plus 11y minus 4z minus 2. and as you can see we end up with this flat plane that we can see from all angles in three dimensions and if we were to try and find the point on here of negative or if positive 3 on the x negative 1 on the y it should also put us at about z of 2 and this graph doesn't quite get us there exactly but it should be around here you can see 4 on x negative 2 on y it's approximately a 001 again the graph doesn't quite hit it perfectly because it's in between these points and you can also see negative 5 on x 3 on the y it's going to be approximately negative 1 on the z if i could get in there perfectly but this graph only lets me hit on the grids which are off slightly but you can see we've made this plane that connects our three points using our vectors so that's what we're looking at today the equation of a plane is found by using a normal vector and a point on the plane the equation of the line is found using a parallel vector and a point on the line take a look at the homework assignment to practice some of these and we will see you to work on these further in class now that we've taken a look at the graphs of lines and planes in 3d we're ready to extend that conversation as we ask how do we graph other shapes or other curves or surfaces in space and we're going to start with kind of the basic graph and that is going to be the graph of a cylinder and a cylinder in 3space graphing is not what we think of with a normal cylinder normally we think of a cylinder like a soup can but actually a cylinder is going to be defined here as any 3d shape made of parallel curves and the most basic form of that and there are others but the most basic form of that is when one variable is missing from the equation what we'll do in that case is we will graph in the other planes and copy down the missing variable in other words if x is missing we'll graph it in two dimensions on the y z plane and then we'll copy that y z graph all the way up and down the x graph let's take a look at some examples so we can see that happen first graph we're going to do is z equals x cubed first thing i'll observe with z equals x cubed is that the y variable is missing so if the y variable is missing we're going to graph it on the x z plane so we'll graph it two dimensionally but we'll graph it on x z and we know that the graph of anything cubed is going to be this graph that comes up from the negative levels off at zero and then kind of takes off after that that graph on the x y plus on the x z plane then is going to be copied down the yaxis so now we try and transition that twodimensional graph into a threedimensional graph where we've got x y and z and we've already graphed on the x z plane let's go ahead and draw the negatives also on this coordinate system so we can kind of see in three dimensions there so the xz plane we've already got this graph that comes up on the xz levels off and then takes off where kind of y is zero but that same graph is going to be able to slide up and down the yaxis and so we'll see it levels off at zero and takes off or back down the yaxis where it comes up levels off and takes off and so what we end up with is this kind of threedimensional sheet with a little bit of a curve to it maybe emphasize that the peaks and the valleys line up here this threedimensional shape it's a cylinder of all of these parallel graphs these parallel lines made of y of z equals x cubed all the way up and down the line let's take a look at another example let's graph z equals y squared because we just have z and y we're going to graph it on the y z plane so we'll start with our two dimensional graph so we know what that looks like on the y z plane and we know that the squared variable gives us that parabola graph and so we're going to copy that graph down the other variable down the xaxis so let's see if we can do that we've got x y and z let's include the negatives even though we don't really need them in this graph what do we do on the x and now with the z y plane that's almost the actual twodimensional plane that we're used to here the zyplane is this parabola and that parabola is going to go all the way down the xaxis and all the way down the xaxis the other direction and so you can see we kind of end up with this threedimensional curve it's a parabola going all the way down the xaxis and this then becomes our threedimensional graph of z equals y squared now this idea of graphing a twodimensional version of the graph and then seeing how it stretches along the graph there's actually a name for that twodimensional version for the graph so let's go ahead and formally define that here we call it a trace or a cross section that is created when a surface intersects a plane parallel to a coordinate plane we've been focusing thus far when one of the variables is zero so we've got the either the x y plane the y z plane or maybe the x z plane were on that center point but it doesn't have to be on that center point it could be anywhere so let's say we've got you know your typical cosine graph and let's see if i can make it 3d by drawing another cosine graph back here there's your three dimensional graph it's a cylinder because it's that same graph stretched all the way through and the idea is if we were to cut it in the middle what you end up with is a nice little cosine graph cut in the middle it's that twodimensional representation when it's sliced down and then that twodimensional is stretched throughout the rest of the graph to give you the 3d version of it these traces become very helpful when we try to graph other shapes that aren't just this cylinder shape that stretches throughout the whole graph but it changes as you go through the graph we talked about lines and planes the next level up lines and planes are made with x y and z the next level up are made with x squared y squared and z squared these graphs are called quartic surfaces and now in general a quartic surface is of the form ax squared plus b y squared plus z i'm sorry c z squared and then we've also got combinations of the x's and y's so we've got d x y plus e y z plus f x z and then we've got x's and y's that could appear by themselves g x plus h y plus we have to skip i because that's the square root of negative one so we'll jump to j z or there's also possibly having a constant k equal to zero some combination of x squared y squared z squared x y's and z's combinations thereof we call those the cortex surfaces this is the three dimensional version of our parabolas ellipses hyperbolas circles the conic sections now in 3d let's look at trying to graph one of these quartic surfaces let's try and sketch x squared over 4 plus y squared over 9 plus z squared over 25 equals one one thing you might notice is this kind of has the feel of an ellipse but we're going to see if the traces can confirm that suspicion what we can do with traces is we're going to take a trace in each direction first we're going to do a trace on the x y plane which means we don't want any z's we can make z equal to any convenient number we want the easiest one's probably going to be zero if that didn't work we'd have to pick another number if sometimes if z is zero everything goes to zero and it's useless to us but in this case it doesn't we end up with x squared over four plus y squared over nine plus zero equals one and we recognize this graph as an ellipse on the x y plane in the x direction we're going to go two each direction in the y direction it goes three each direction and so we end up with this nice little ellipse in the x y direction we need to know what's happening in all the directions so we're also going to draw a trace in the x z direction when we do this y is equal to zero so we end up with x squared over 4 plus z squared over 25 equals 1. all right in the xz direction the x's because the denominator is 4 the square root is 2 each direction the z's go this each direction 5 units and so on this xz graph we end up with this tall skinny ewips and i'm not going to quite fit it all on one screen but we do need to also do a trace in the y z direction which means our x is equal to zero when x is equal to zero the equation becomes y squared over nine plus z squared over 25 equals one and so if we were to try and draw that we end up with the y's we've got our y z axis the y's are going three each direction so it's a little wider than the green one the z's still going five each direction and we end up with this slightly fatter ellipse and now what we're going to try and do is put these three graphs together in one what we see is in the y z direction we get a fat tall ellipse in the x z direction it's a skinnier ellipse in the x y direction it's really a small ellipse and so when we put it all together into a 3d graph what we end up with is the short skinny one one direction tall and skinny another direction and fatter and skinnier pattern a little wider the other direction we end up with this threedimensional what we call an ellipsoid so that's how we can use the surfaces to kind of combine them each together to end up with our threedimensional ellipsoid what i've done here is i've drawn on a online calculator the 3d ellipsoid and what you can see is if we look at the top we see that ellipse that goes from two to three if i look from one side we see the ellipse that goes from two to negative two one direction and five to negative five another direction and if we look at the other side we see the slightly fatter 3 to negative 3 and 5 to negative 5 and this 3d shape is our ellipsoid we've been trying to draw now there are some common quartic surfaces that we're going to work to get familiar with in this section and your book has a really nice introduction to them on page 221 through 222 and so i want to hop over to a picture from the book of those shapes just that we can talk about some characteristics really quick about each of these we've already talked about the ellipsoid the ellipsoid is similar to the ellipse we've got an x squared over something plus y squared over something plus a z squared over something what really makes an ellipsoid defined is you notice that x squared y squared and z squared are all positive and they're not going to equal zero they're going to equal a number that's going to create the ellipsoid and if a b and c all are equal we actually end up with a perfect sphere because all of those major and minor axes are going to be equivalent and just like we saw before the traces were all ellipses in the various directions now if we make a minor change and we make one of them negative so we've got a positive a positive and you see that we've got that negative z squared if one of them is negative we end up with what's called a hyperboloid of one sheet so with two of the variables positive coefficient one with a negative coefficient and then the way we know which direction this hyperboloid is pointing is that the axis corresponds with the negative coefficient so in this case the z squared was negative and so you see the graph here goes around the z axis if the y squared was the negative one it would turn sideways and go around the y axis now if two of the terms are negative here we've got two variables with negative coefficients and one with a positive coefficient a positive a negative and a negative we end up with what's called a hyperboloid of two sheets the hyperbola with two sheets doesn't connect in the middle and what we also notice is that the axis of the surface corresponds to the variable with a positive coefficient so here the z squared was positive and that's why it goes around the z axis if the y squared was positive it would go around the y axis if the x squared was positive it would go around the xaxis now each of these have been equal to a number but sometimes our equations are equal to zero which changes things slightly one example here is the elliptical cone with the elliptical cone we've got two positives and one negative but this time it equals zero if it equals zero then the axis of the surface will correspond to the variable with the negative coefficient so again here the z is negative that's why the cone goes around the z axis we end up with an elliptical paraboloid if we have a constant term z and the x and y terms are each squared that constant term is called the linear term and the axis will correspond with the linear variable which is why this graph goes around the zaxis finally the last one we're going to look at for our purposes is the hyperbolic paraboloid the hyperbolic paraboloids really interesting because in one plane you have a hyperbola in the other planes you have parabolas and the way we get that very similar to our last example except we've got the middle term is negative or there's a negative in between the x squared and y squared still equal to a linear term and that linear term that it's equal to is going to be the axis of the surface that it's all built around also interesting is it's going to wrap around the positive variable so these six shapes you can see them in your book it also lists all the traces that you're going to get from each of these x y z directions there's going to be some problems on the assignment where it's going to ask you to identify what shape you're dealing with and the way we can do that is by paying attention to what's positive what's negative and what does it equal so let's see if those are our common quadratic surfaces let's see if we can identify some quartic surfaces let's say we're given the surface 16 x squared plus 9 y squared plus 16 z squared equals 144. what i would notice on here is looking at the squared terms x squared y squared and z squared all the squares are positive we've got a positive 16x squared a positive 9y squared a positive 16y squared it also does not equal zero so if i were to go through and divide the whole thing by 144 it would be equal to 1 which is exactly the form of the ellipsoid let's take a look and see what this graph looks like in the 3d graphing calculator so here's our 3d graph just as we expected it's an ellipsoid all the traces are ellipses just like we predicted so we're doing good on that one let's try another example let's see if we can identify the shape of 9x squared minus 18x plus 4y squared plus 16y minus 36 z plus 25 equals zero well what are we going to note about this shape i do see that there's an x and a y term but those could be paired with the x squared and the y squared and through a process of completing the square we could make that x or y plus or minus some number the whole thing squared so those kind of come in groups but i do notice that the z is a linear term so we have x squared and y squared are positive and the z is linear going back to our graph we saw x squared and y squared positive and the z linear with the elliptic paraboloid and it could be either variable linear what we have is two squared variables in one linear variable and the linear variable is going to tell us which axis this graph is going to wrap around so we end up with an elliptic paraboloid here and if we go to the graphing calculator let's see if our guess was correct and here is our shape graft what you see is it does have that bowl shape that we were expecting from the elliptic paraboloid it's an ellipse from one angle and a parabola from the two other angles we have an elliptic paraboloid let's do one last example of identifying our shape we're going to do 9x squared plus y squared minus z squared plus 2z minus 10 equals 0. and let's see what we can note about this shape again we've got a z linear term but it can be paired with the z squared through a process of completing the squared so we have x squared and y squared are positive but you notice that z squared is negative so we have two positive squares and one negative square and that plus 10 can bump to the other side so it's not going to actually be equal to zero which one did that two positive squares and one negative squared that's going to be a hyperboloid of one sheet it is a hyperboloid of one sheet let's look at this example on the graphing calculator here's our hyperboloid of one sheet on the graphing calculator you notice one direction it's a hyperbola other direction it's an ellipse and the other direction it's a skinnier hyperbola we've got our hyperboloid of one sheet because it's going to go through the origin the hyperbola hyperbolas connect in the middle if we had two negatives then they wouldn't connect in the middle but it is hollow in the center so today that's what we're taking a look at three dimensional shapes whether they're cylinders or aquatic surfaces hopefully you can get some familiarity with the different shapes as you work through the homework assignment and in class we'll discuss them further and answer any questions and that you may have as we wrap up chapter 2 on our discussion about graphing in 3d and how vectors can help us with that i want to address another question that asks what other coordinate systems do we have for graphing in space just like with the rectangular coordinate system in 2d we had the x y coordinates but we also had polar coordinates that used a radius and an angle theta with the xaxis sometimes the polar system was easier for graphing equations and interpreting situations and sometimes the rectangular was better do we have the same situation with threedimensional graphing and the answer is yes we've got two other coordinate systems that we can use the first of the two are called cylindrical coordinates and cylindrical coordinates are kind of like polar coordinates in 3d with polar coordinates we had a radius and an angle theta to make it in 3d we're just going to add an extra coordinate z that tells us how far vertically the graph point is in that z direction so let's formalize that here let's say it is similar to polar coordinates which have r theta a radius at an angle theta and angle with the xaxis we're just adding this z which is the vertical distance in the plane or in space so visually what we're talking about here is we've got our x y z axis from rectangular and instead what we're going to do is we're going to have some radius that makes some angle theta to a point and then we go vertically to some point some distance z and that vertical z makes a right angle with the radius r so if we've got this cylindrical coordinate system let's talk about how we can make conversions between the rectangular system and the cylindrical system very similar to polar coordinates x is equal to r cosine theta and y is equal to r sine theta we just have this new coordinate z which is just the vertical distance which works the exact same way in both systems and similarly if we're going the other way we know that r squared is equal to x squared plus y squared from the pythagorean theorem and that the tangent of theta is equal to the y distance over the x distance and again the z coordinate is just the z coordinate now there is one thing we got to be careful of in three space with the tangent of theta we want to make sure that we check the domain as we take the tangent inverse because on our calculators tangent inverse is always between pi over 2 and negative pi over 2 and sometimes we want to be in the opposite half of the grid so we have to really think about where our point is and we'll look at an example of that right now let's do some examples where we can use these conversions let's say we have the cylindrical point 5 pi over 6 4 and we're going to convert it to a rectangular point well very similar to what we did with polar coordinates x is equal to the radius of 5. let's go ahead and label 5 so the radius pi over 6 is the theta and 4 is the z so x is equal to the radius of 5 times the cosine of the angle pi over six y then is the radius of five times the sine of the angle pi over six and the z coordinate is just what the z coordinate is which is four simplifying our x and y then cosine of pi over six is root three over two so we end up with five root three over two for the x coordinate the sine of pi over 6 is one half so we end up with five halves for the y coordinate and so our cylindrical point change to rectangular x y z becomes 5 root 3 over 2 comma 5 halves comma 4 and we have our rectangular point that is equivalent to the cylindrical point 5 pi over 6 4. we can also go the opposite direction we can take a rectangular point and convert it into a cylindrical let's take the rectangular point negative eight five negative seven and convert it to a cylindrical point for the cylindrical point we now have x y and z that we're converting to an r a theta and a z our formula says that r squared is equal to x squared 64 plus y squared 25 which is equal to 89 taking the square root of both sides the radius must be equal to the square root of 89 theta comes from the tangent the tangent of theta is y over x so we're going to take the tangent inverse of y over x 5 over negative 8 which is equal to negative doing it on our calculator it'll give you a negative point five five eight six but here's where we have to be careful with the tangent inverse if i think about just the x y plane z it's going to be vertically or below this looking at the x y x is negative eight y is five our point is going to be above some point in the second quadrant however theta of negative 0.55 is a negative angle negative 0.5586 goes the wrong direction we need to move it so it goes to the correct direction well the distance that we need to move it is halfway around the unit circle we need to add pi to get to the correct spot so when we do negative 0.5586 plus pi on our calculator we'll get approximately 2.583 and that's going to be the number of radians that we want it to open up to get us in the correct quadrant so again we want to make sure we're careful tangent inverse on our calculator will always stick us on the right half of our xy graph which means if your point ends up in the left half you have to add a pi to it to get to the correct place and a quick sketch can help you see what's happening there now with z z straightforward with these cylindrical points z is just the z so negative seven so we end up with our cylindrical point of the square root of 89 for the radius 2.583 radians for the angle and negative 7 for the z value we've got our rectangular point we can even switch between equations equations in rectangular and equations in cylindrical let's say we've got the equation that r is equal to 3 sine of theta and we want to convert that equation to a rectangular equation well we know that r sine theta is equal to something so if we multiply both sides by r we end up with r squared equals three r sine theta and we know from our formulas that r squared is x squared plus y squared three is just a constant we know that r sine theta is equal to the y coordinate and so we've converted this to a rectangular equation x squared plus y squared equals 3y represents the same equation in cylindrical as r equals 3 sine theta so that's cylindrical coordinates very very similar to polar coordinates which we're already familiar with but there is a second threedimensional graphing system that i want to talk about called spherical coordinates and with spherical coordinates we end up with three greek letters for our coordinates rho theta and phi rho theta and phi rho is the distance from the origin to the point and i want to be careful not to confuse that with the r from the cylindrical coordinates r was the radius in the x y plane and then we moved vertically up rho is going to be the diagonal distance from the origin to the point almost like a vector that goes diagonally through space it's the actual distance to the point not just in the x y plane but through space theta is the angle with the xaxis just like we did before it's the same theta that we saw in the cylindrical coordinates also from polar coordinates theta is the angle with the xaxis and phi our new greek letter v is going to be the angle with the zaxis so visually what we're talking about here is there's some distance diagonally through space rho that comes off of a projection if it makes a right angle it comes off of an angle theta that's made with the xaxis and an angle phi made with the zaxis so we end up with two angles and a distance that give us the coordinates to the point so then the next logical question is how do we do conversions between the rectangular system that we're more familiar with and this new system the spherical coordinates well our xcoordinate is equal to rho times the cosine of theta times the sine of phi notice the first part looks very similar to what we had with polar coordinates and cylindrical coordinates the distance times the cosine of the angle we're just also multiplying by the sine of the last angle y is going to be rho sine theta sine phi and z is rho times the cosine of phi if we're going the other direction from the pythagorean theorem rho squared is equal to x squared plus y squared plus z squared the pythagorean theorem in three dimensions because this time we're going straight to the point instead of just the x y plane because theta is the same theta we saw before it's still tangent of theta is y over x just make sure that you check the domain again and finally to find phi we solve the last equation here for phi z equals rho cosine of phi dividing both sides by rho we get that the cosine of phi is equal to z divided by rho that's usually going to be easier to solve but it does require us to know rho first so if we don't know rho we basically just calculate it it's the square root of x squared plus y squared plus z squared but it'll be usually quicker just to do z divided by rho all right let's see if we can do some examples where we make these exact conversions let's start with taking a spherical point let's take 2 negative 5 pi over 6 comma pi over 6 and convert that to a rectangular point well we need to know what x y and z are in rectangular points and our conversion formula say it's going to be rho which is 2. let's go ahead and label these as rho theta and phi times the cosine of the first angle negative 5 pi over 6 times the sine of the second angle pi over 6. y is 2 sine of negative 5 pi over 6 times the sine of pi over six and z is equal to rho two times the cosine of the last angle just pi over six simplifying these will give us our rectangular point that's equivalent to the spherical point so we've got 2 times the cosine of negative 5 pi over 6 is negative root 3 over 2 and the sine of pi over six is one half and that gives us negative root three over two for the y coordinate we have two times the sine of negative five pi over six that's in the third quadrant so it's negative onehalf sine of pi over six is still onehalf and so we end up with negative onehalf for our ycoordinate and finally with z we have 2 times the cosine of pi over 6 which is root 3 over 2 which is just the square root of 3. so our spherical point of 2 negative 5 pi over 6 pi over 6 is the same as the rectangular point negative root 3 over 2 negative onehalf square root of 3. let's try going the other direction let's look at the rectangular point of negative one one square root of six and we're going to convert that to a spherical point well to get spherical we need to know what rho theta and phi are going to equal from our x y and z well our row formula actually says rho squared is equal to the sum of all the squares so negative 1 squared is 1 plus 1 squared is 1 plus the square root of 6 squared is 6. and so that gives us rho squared is equal to 8 taking the square root of both sides rho is equal to the square root of 8 which simplifies to 2 root 2. with theta theta is equal to the tangent of y over x so if we do a tangent inverse of y over x 1 over negative 1 or the tangent inverse of negative 1 negative one tangent inverse is going to be pi over negative pi over four but again we need to take a quick look at where this point is gonna be it's a rectangular point of negative one comma positive one and negative pi over four sticks us in the wrong quadrant so we need to add pi to it and when we add pi to a negative pi over 4 we're adding 4 pi over 4 we end up with 3 pi over 4 is the actual point for phi the cosine of phi is equal to z over rho z is the square root of six divided by rho which we just found out was two root two and when we simplify that we're actually doing the cosine inverse dividing by the square root of two we get root three over two and we know the cosine inverse of root three over two is pi over six and so we've ended up with a spherical point that is equal to the rectangular point of negative 1 1 root 6 that point is 2 root 2 3 pi over 4 pi over 6. similar to what we did with the cylindrical coordinates spherical coordinates can also be expressed as equations or surfaces can be expressed as equations let's do rho equals 5 cosine of phi we can manipulate these equations to try and convert them into the other form into rectangular form and you can see on this one similar to the other example if we multiply both sides by row we end up with rho squared equals 5 rho cosine of phi and rho squared we know from our formulas is x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals the constant of five and then rho cosine of phi that is directly equal to z and so we end up with the equation x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals 5z as being the equivalent equation in spherical coordinates as rho equals 5 cosine of phi so those are our two new systems we're looking at spherical coordinates and cylindrical coordinates sometimes we might want to make a conversion though between these two new systems and it is a lot of work to have to go to rectangular in the middle so let's take a look at how we can make a direct translation between the two how we can convert between our new systems between spherical and cylindrical coordinates well just as before we have some conversions remember that spherical we just did is expressed as rho theta phi and cylindrical is what we started with is expressed as a radius theta times the z distance so if we want to change spherical into cylindrical our conversion for r is that r is equal to rho times the sine of phi theta i mentioned earlier is the same theta between both systems so there's really no conversion needed for that center coordinate and z is going to be rho times the cosine of phi if we're going the other direction we have cylindrical and we want the spherical rho squared from the pythagorean theorem is the radius squared plus z squared again theta is the same theta so there's no work to do there we just need to get after the phi which if we take the z equals equation that we just had and divide both sides by rho we end up with the cosine of phi is equal to z over rho which usually by this point we will have already calculated rows so that's easier but if we haven't calculated rho we just use our row equation and rho is the square root of r squared plus z squared so let's see if we can do some examples where we convert directly between these new systems of graphing in space between spherical and cylindrical let's do a few examples let's take the spherical point first the spherical point two negative five pi over six and pi over six we're going to convert that to cylindrical well for cylindrical we need to know the radius the angle theta and the vertical distance z the radius is equal to rho 2 times the sine of the angle pi over 6 the phi the last angle theta is just theta of negative 5 pi over 6 and z is rho 2 times the cosine of phi times the cosine of pi over 6. simplifying the sine of pi over six is onehalf so we end up with a radius of one the cosine of pi over six is the square root of three over two which gives us square root of three and so we now have our cylindrical point of one negative five pi over 6 square root of 3 which is equivalent to the spherical point of 2 negative 5 pi over 6 comma pi over 6. let's do one more example where we go the other direction let's take the cylindrical point of the square root of 2 3 pi over 4 square root of 6 and we're going to convert that to spherical so because it's a cylindrical point we've got a radius a theta and a z i didn't label on the spherical back then we had the rho the theta and the fee so for finding the spherical point we need to know what rho is what theta is and what phi is our row equation says that rho squared is equal to the r squared plus the z squared r squared is two plus the z squared is six which means rho squared is equal to eight taking the square root rho is the square root of eight or two root two theta is the same in both graphing systems so we have three pi over four for phi we know the cosine of phi is equal to z over the rho so we'll do the cosine inverse of z the square root of 6 over the rho to root two and i think we simplified this one before we have the cosine inverse dividing out the square root of two of root three over two cosine inverse of root three over two is pi over six and so we've taken our cylindrical point of square root of two three pi over four square root of six and we've ended up with the spherical point two root two three pi over four and pi over six so that's what we're focusing on today with these new coordinate systems spherical graphing and cylindrical graphing can we convert between all three systems spherical cylindrical and rectangular i want to wrap up really quick by summarizing the three graphing systems visually in three dimensions so we'll make our little coordinate plane here and normally we label them x y and z but just to make it really clear i'm going to call this i j and k as vectors in the x y z direction when we're graphing with the rectangular system with the rectangular system we go a distance x and then we go a distance y and then we can vertically go a distance z to our point that is x y z and each turn makes a right angle that's the rectangular coordinate system when we do cylindrical we say instead what we're going to do is we're going to take a radius that stretches out to where we go vertically at z and that radius is going to make an angle theta with the xaxis and when we do we end up with a point that is the radius theta z with the spherical coordinates instead what we're going to do with spherical coordinates is we're going to go directly from the origin to the point and we're going to call that distance row and that row is going to be formed with an angle of theta with the xaxis it's the same theta as we had with the cylindrical coordinates but also with an angle phi from the z axis and in that way we end up with our point rho theta phi so we now have three ways to represent that same point in space and depending on the context sometimes one context is much easier to work with than the other context but for now we're focusing our energy on learning about the three systems converting between the three systems and interpreting where those points will be so take a look at the homework assignment practice some of those and we will discuss them more in class our next chapter is going to focus exclusively on these things called vectored valued functions so this first lesson we're going to answer the question what are vector valued functions and put quite simply a vector valued function can be defined and 2d as r of t the vector valued function is going to be some function of t times the i vector plus some function g of t times the j vector or in component form f of t comma g of t and similarly it can be defined in 3d as the vector value function r of t is equal to some function of t times the i plus some function of g times the j and some function of t times the k or in component form f of t comma g of t comma h of t basically it's a vector made up of functions in fact we've seen this type of a function before noting that this is really just a parametric equation or a parametric function in vector form when we had parametric equations or parametric functions from a previous chapter we said x was equal to some function f of t y is equal to a g of t and z is equal to some h of t and as t changed it gave us our entire graph our function now we're just expressing those three functions as one function as a vector so now if i was asked to evaluate some vector valued functions for example let's say we have the vector r of t is equal to t squared minus three t i plus four t plus one j and we were asked to find the vectored value function when time is negative four all that really means is we're going to plug negative four into our vector valued function and so we have negative four squared minus three times negative four times the i component plus four times negative four plus one times the j component and simplifying 16 plus 12 is 28 i plus actually we're going to make it minus because we have negative 16 plus 1 is negative 15 j and we've evaluated the vector valued function at time of negative 4. let's try one more let's find the vector valued function r of t is equal to the cosine of t to sine of t and the natural log of one minus t and we're going to find the vector function at pi over 6. well that means we're just going to plug pi over 6 into each component so we have the cosine of pi over six comma two sine pi over six comma the natural log of one minus pi over six and when we simplify we know the cosine of pi over six is root three over two the sine of pi over six is one half times two is one and then we're left with the natural log of getting a common denominator that's going to be 6 minus pi over 6 and we've evaluated the vectored valued function at pi over 6. now as with any case since a function is just a mapping from the domain to the range we can talk about what exactly is the domain of our vectored valued function and similar to functions that you've seen in the past for example we can't have 0 in the denominator we can't have negatives under the square roots or in a natural log similar to those we can apply those concepts of a domain to our vectored value function the only rule that we have to add is our domain must work for all components of the vector valued function so if r of t is the function 3 over the square root of t plus 1 comma the natural log of t minus 5 comma secant of 3t we can go piece by piece to start building a domain that works for the entire vectored valued function one thing we see is t plus 1 is under a square root so we know t plus one must be greater than zero or equal to zero subtracting one we find out t is greater than or equal to negative one another thing we see is we've got a denominator and we know denominators cannot be equal to zero squaring both sides and subtracting one t cannot be equal to negative one which then if we combine that with the first conclusion now we're saying t is just strictly greater than negative one it cannot be equal to negative one because of our work there in the green continuing on we see a t minus five inside a natural log well natural logs must always be greater than zero so we can say t is greater than five which already is greater than negative 1 so we kind of have built this new domain t greater than 5 is the more restrictive domain so we're going to stick with that for now but we still have to deal with the secant because the secant we can take the secant of anything but secant is the reciprocal of the cosine and we can't have zero in the denominator so cosine of three t cannot be equal to zero well if we do the cosine inverse then we get that 3t cannot be equal to cosine is 0 at pi over 2 and then again it's 0 at 3 pi over 2 5 pi over 2 7 pi over 2 basically every plus n pi where n is the natural numbers to get the t alone then we just have to divide both sides by 3 and we get t is equal to pi over 6 plus n over or n pi over 3. and let's get a common denominator by multiplying the second one by two so we have pi plus two n pi over six and that's actually not equals two because that'll make the secant undefined at all of those points and so we can combine all of this together and say our domain is all t greater than 5 where t is not equal to pi plus two n pi over six and that covers all of the components of this vectored valued function now since ultimately we're interested in doing calculus with these vector valued let's talk about the first step of calculus and that's finding the limit of a vectored valued function and we'll start with a definition which might be exactly what you expect that the limit as time goes to any value we'll call it a of the vector valued function r of t is really asking us to just take the limit of each component the limit as t goes to a of the first function comma the limit as t goes to a of the second function and if it's in three space the limit as t goes to a of the last function so doing a couple quick examples if we're trying to find the limit as t goes to negative 2 of the vectored valued function the square root of t squared minus 3t minus 1 times i plus four t plus three times j plus the sine of t plus one times pi over two okay well basically we're just going to take the limit of this vector valued function component wise so we're going to plug negative 2 in for all of the t's as long as it doesn't make anything undefined so we get the square root of negative 2 squared minus 3 times negative 2 minus 1 i plus 4 times negative 2 plus 3 j plus the sine of negative two plus one pi over two okay simplifying negative two squared is four four plus six is ten minus one is nine square root of nine gives us three i four times negative two is negative eight plus three negative eight plus three is a negative five j and then when we do negative two plus one we get negative one half or negative pi over two the sine of negative pi over 2 drawing a quick unit circle negative pi over 2 is straight down at the point zero comma negative one sine being the y coordinate so we get negative 1 or negative k and so this vector valued function is approaching 3i minus 5j minus k as time is approaching negative 2. let's do one that's a little more involved than just plugging in values for the limit we're going to find the limit as t goes to zero three t squared minus five t all over six t squared plus t comma the cosine of t minus 1 over t squared and to make this a little more straightforward i'm going to look at one component at a time first looking at the i component or the x component depending on how you want to look at it if we were to plug 0 in we'd end up with 0 in the denominator of this fraction and that is not acceptable so instead what i'm going to do is i'm going to factor a t out leaving behind three t minus five and a t out of the denominator leaving behind six t plus one and that allows the t's to divide out so now we can take the limit as t goes to zero by plugging zero in for the t's which will leave us with negative five over one which equals negative 5 because we've removed that discontinuity if we look at the j component what we find is plugging zero in for cosine we end up with one minus one or zero over zero squared which is zero and so this is an indeterminate form of zero over zero so what we're going to do is use our old friend l'hopital and take the limit as t goes to 0 of the derivative of cosine is negative sine of t the derivative of t squared is two t but now if we plug zero in the sine of zero is zero and this two times zero is zero we're still going to zero over zero so we'll use l'hopital one more time to take the limit as t goes to zero of negative cosine of t over two and now when we plug the zero in cosine of zero gives us one so we are left with negative one over two which means the limit as t goes to zero of our vectored valued function is going to be negative five comma negative onehalf taking the limit componentwise of each part speaking of limits and i've kind of alluded to it with this idea of continuity to remove the discontinuity in order to find the limit let's talk about when a vector valued function is continuous a continuous vectored valued function a vectorvalued function is continuous if and only if the limit as time approaches a of the vector valued function r of t is exactly the same as the vectored valued function evaluated at that value a the limit is the same as the value which means the limit has to exist and the value has to exist they have to both be defined and quite often instead of determining where something's continuous as we found in calc 1 it's easier to describe when it's discontinuous when the limit is not equal to the value at the function when we have a gap a jump or an infinite discontinuity so let's say we have the vector valued function r of t is equal to e to the t i plus the sine of t j what we know about the part e to the t is e to the t is continuous for all values we never have to lift our pencil as we graph it similar with sine of t sine of t is continuous for all values there's no gaps no jumps no asymptotes vertical asymptotes it's actually defined for all real numbers and the limit is also defined for all real numbers so this is continuous for all real numbers so let's do an example that might be a little more exciting let's take the vector valued function r of t is equal to the vector 1 over x comma tangent inverse of x well looking at the first component 1 over x is undefined at 0 which means while the limit exists at 0 the function does not and so we're going to say it's not continuous at zero because we have an asymptote we're also not continuous when tangent inverse is undefined we know tangent inverse is undefined tangent is y over x so it's undefined whenever the x coordinate of the unit circle is zero that happens at pi over two and every n pi after that so we have a two points of discontinuity from one from each component so this video is a real brief introduction to these things called vectored valued function really it's just a fancy way to take a parametric equation and put it into a vector form so it's one single function we'll be using these vector valued functions to do a lot of modeling of different situations do a lot of different calculus tricks but for now we're going to do some homework problems get comfortable with vector valued functions in general and we'll see you in class to answer any questions you may have now that we've taken a look at what vector valued functions are we're ready to answer the question that we really care about because this is a calculus class how do we do calculus of vectored valued functions and let's start with the first part of calculus calc 1 where we took derivatives and quite simply to take the derivative of a vector valued function we're going to take the derivative of each component so let's do some examples where we do just that first let's take the vectored valued function r of t is 6 t plus 8 i plus 4 t squared plus 2 t minus 3 j the derivative of the vector valued function which will denote r prime of t is simply the derivative of each component the derivative of 6 t plus 8 is just six i's plus the derivative of the polynomial is eight t plus two times the j vector and there is our derivative let's try and make them a little more interesting let's say the vector valued function r of t is e to the t sine t times i plus e to the t cosine t j minus e to the 2t k and we're going to find the derivative of our vector valued function r prime of t well our first pr derivative is a product so we remember we have to use the product rule which is the derivative of the first part e to the t times the second sine of t plus the derivative of the second part which is cosine of t times the first e to the t times the i component plus again using our product rule the derivative of the first times the second plus the derivative of the second which is going to give us negative sign times the first which is e to the t times the j component minus the derivative of e to the 2t is e to the 2t using the chain rule times the derivative of the inside is 2 times the k component and now we've got our derivative let's try r of t is equal to t natural log of t i plus 5 e to the t j plus the cosine of t minus the sine of t k and so our derivative r prime of t again we've got a product rule so we take the derivative of the first which is one times the natural log of t plus the derivative of the second which is one over t times the first which is t all times i plus 5e to the tj that's a pretty straightforward derivative plus derivative of cosine is negative sine the derivative of sine is cosine times the k a little bit of simplifying just simplifying that t over t is one so we find out our derivative of the vector vectorvalued function is the natural log of t plus 1 times i plus 5 e to the t times j plus negative sine of t minus the cosine of t k and we have our derivative of the vector valued function one of the most common and useful purposes for the derivative of vector valued functions is to find what are called tangent vectors and similar to a tangent line being tangent to the curve at a point being the first derivative it works exactly the same with vectors we're going to find the tangent at a point let's say the vector r of t is equal to the cosine of t times i plus the sine of t times j and we're going to find the tangent vector at the point t equals pi over 6. well the derivative is just component wise gives us the negative sine of t times i plus the cosine of t times j and we're being asked to find the tangent vector specifically at the point pi over six negative sine of pi over six i plus the cosine of pi over six j which if we simplify the sine of pi over 6 pi over 6 is at root 3 over 2 comma one half sine being the y coordinate gives us the one half so we have negative one half i plus the cosine of pi over six is root three over two j this vector then can be positioned so it's tangent to the point at time equals pi over six visually what we're looking at if you remember from parametric equations graphing x equals cosine y equals sine that's actually just the unit circle going around counterclockwise and we're specifically interested at when time is pi over six and if we were to draw a tangent vector right there it could be written in component form as negative one half i plus root three over two j and that would be the same as the component vector coming out of the origin it's going in the same direction because remember vectors don't have a location they just have a direction in magnitude speaking of magnitude there's no rule by just taking the derivative that really dictates the magnitude of that tangent vector and so usually we like to standardize how we think about tangent vectors by saying we're going to be particularly interested in the unit tangent vector that way no matter how you get your tangent vector it's always going to be the exact same length the unit tangent vector is a very special vector that we're going to use throughout this chapter we're going to call it capital t of t and it is simply just the derivative of the basic vector r of t divided by the magnitude of that derivative so first we're going to find the tangent vector and then we'll make it a unit vector by dividing by its magnitude so let's try an example where we do just that let's say the vector r of t is equal to t squared minus 3 i plus 2t plus 1 j plus t minus 2 k and we want the unit tangent vector to this vector we're going to do this generally not at any specific point we're going to do it generally for any point t we could find it at a specific point if we had a t value we were particularly interested in but for this example let's just do it generally so first we need to know the derivative of our vector valued function r which is two t i plus two j plus 1k but that is not a unit vector so to get our special vector our unit tangent vector we're going to find the magnitude of the derivative and we remember the magnitude is the square root of the square of the components two t squared plus two squared plus one squared which gives us the square root of four t squared plus four plus one which is five that tells us then that the unit tangent vector that special vector t of t is 1 over the square root of 4 t squared plus 5. times the derivative which is 2t comma 2 comma 1 in component form if we wanted to we could distribute that divide by the square root giving us just the vector two t over the square root of four t squared plus five comma two over the square root of four t squared plus five comma 1 over the square root of 4 t squared plus 5. and now we have a vector of unit length it's always going to have a length of 1 that will always be tangent to the vector r of t we're going to come back to unit tangent vectors in our future sections and explain why they're so important and helpful to us as we're working with vector valued functions but for now we're just going to find them generally like we did in this example or we could find them specifically at a point if i knew t was equal to 7 seconds we could evaluate that but for now let's step away from derivatives we still have to look at the second half of calculus which is integration and just like derivatives we can take the derivative component at a time we can take the antiderivative of each component but just like before in calc 2 when we took an integral we would always have plus a constant we need to reflect that here also but we need to express that constant is a vector so we're going to say it's plus a constant vector which we will represent with a c with the vector symbol above it representing some vector made up of three constants constant one constant two constant three so for example if we're being asked to find the integral of two t plus four i plus three t squared minus four t j dt we can integrate this one component at a time integrating the i component we end up with t squared plus 4t times the i plus the j component becomes t cubed minus 2 t squared times the j component but because this is not a definite integral we need to also add a constant vector to our final solution and so we're integrating a component one component at a time to get our final solution let's do one last example let's do a definite integral this time let's go from zero to pi over three of the vector valued function sine of two t i plus the tangent of t j plus e to the negative 2 t k dt evaluating one component at a time the antiderivative of sine is the cosine of two t actually the negative cosine to account for the times two we need a one half out front times the i component plus the antiderivative of tangent might remember is negative natural log of the cosine of t j remember that comes from writing tangent to sine over cosine and then using substitution to integrate plus antiderivative of e to the negative 2t is e to the negative 2t but we have to multiply by a negative onehalf to account for that 2 times the k component and we're just going to integrate this entire thing from 0 to pi over 3. and we'll do that substitution one component again at a time so first with the i we have negative onehalf cosine of two t or two pi over three plus one half cosine of two times zero is zero times i plus plugging pi over 3 into the natural log we get negative natural log of the cosine of pi over 3. plus the natural log of the cosine of zero all of that's your j component plus negative one half e to the negative two pi over three plus one half e to the zero all that times the k component simplifying let's see what we have left cosine of 2 pi over 3 is going to be 2 pi over three is over here on the unit circle so that's going to be negative one half comma root three over two so the x coordinate is the negative one half so negative one half times negative onehalf plus onehalf times the cosine of zero is one i plus the negative natural log of the cosine of pi over three one pi over three is a positive one half root three over two so the natural log of one half plus the natural log of cosine of zero is one that's going to be nice because the natural log of one is zero times the j component plus not much simplifying that we're left with on this last part i'm going to put the positive onehalf in front just because it makes it pretty minus onehalf e to the negative two pi over three times the k component and so one time through left to simplify we end up with one fourth plus one half is three fourths high minus the natural log of one half j plus one half minus one half e to the negative two pi over three k and now we found the antiderivative of our vector valued function from zero to pi over three so calculus with vector valued functions not too difficult it's just basically extending what we saw in calc 1 and calc 2 with derivatives and integrals just doing it with every single component all the way through we also introduced this idea of the unit tangent vector that's going to be very important to us as this chapter progresses so take a look at a few of these on the practice assignment we will see you in class to answer any questions you may have today's video is going to look at answering the question of how do we measure arc length and curvature and we'll talk about curvature a little more when we get to it but first we're going to address the question of arc length for our vectored valued functions and we're going to build this based on what we know from parametric curves when we did parametric curves we said arc length s is equal to the integral from a to b where a and b were the edges of the curve of the square root of x of t prime squared plus y prime of t squared dt well similarly if the vector valued function r of t is equal to the component form f of t g of t h of t then we have arc length is equal to the integral from a to b of the square root of the first component's derivative squared plus the second component's derivative squared plus the third components derivative squared dt and really actually finding the square root of all the components squared we've seen that formula before this is the formula for the magnitude of the vector so instead we can simplify our arc length formula to the integral from a to b of the magnitude of the derivative of the vector and that becomes our formula for arc length we take the derivative of the vector we find its magnitude and then we integrate it over its range so let's do an example using this new formula let's say r of t the vector valued function is equal to two t squared plus one comma two t squared minus one comma t cubed and we're gonna find the arc length as time goes from 0 to 3. well first we need to find the derivative of our vector valued function which is going to be 4t comma 40 comma 3t squared next the formula says we need to know the magnitude of the derivative of the vectorvalued function and magnitude we know is the square root of the square of its components 16 t squared plus 16 t squared plus 9 t to the fourth which simplifies to the square root of 32 t squared plus nine t to the fourth and actually if we factor out a t squared we get the square root of t squared times 32 plus nine t squared and we can take the square root of the t squared to get our total magnitude is t times the square root of 32 plus nine t squared now we're ready to go to our formula which says that the arc length is equal to the integral we're going from zero to three of the magnitude of the derivative of our vector valued function which we just found out was t times the square root of 32 plus 9t squared dt we can take this integral quite quickly using u substitution where u is 32 plus nine t squared that makes d u equal to 18 t dt so we'll multiply by 18 inside and one over 18 outside to get one over 18 times the integral plugging 0 and 3 into the u equals equation we get 32 plus 0 and plugging the 3 in 3 squared is 9. 9 times 9 is 81 81 plus 32 is 113 the 18t dt becomes our du and the square root becomes u to the one half which we know is u to the three halves times twothirds with the one over eighteen on the outside integrated from thirtytwo to one thirteen two over eighteen is going to reduce to 9 so we're going to have 1 over 27 times and i don't think this is going to simplify so we'll leave it as 113 to the three halves minus 32 to the three halves and that's an ugly decimal so we'll call that good for the arc length of our vectored valued function so using our formula arc length is simply the magnet the integral of the magnitude of the derivative of the original vector valued function really we've done arc length before when we worked with parametric curves so we're going to move to the next topic which is curvature and curvature is an important concept to us as we look at a curve curvature measures how sharply a smooth curve turns if it's got a real sharp tight curve then you'll get a larger curvature if it's a nearly flat wide curve you're going to get a much smaller curvature curvature measures how sharply the curve turns similar to slope or the derivative measuring how fast the curve changes curvature measures how sharply the curve turns and there's a couple formulas for curvature depending on the context that we're working in we use looks like a k it's kind of a cursive k for our curvature symbol curvature is equal to the magnitude of the unit tangent vector derivative divided by the magnitude of the regular vector's derivative this function works best in 2d so if we have a twodimensional vector we'll find the unit tangent vector and the magnitude of its derivative divide by the magnitude of the derivative of the valued function however if we're in three dimensions there's a quicker formula that can help us because we can use the cross product in three dimensions in three dimensions we'll take the derivative of the vector valued function and we'll cross it with the second derivative of the vector valued function find its magnitude and divide by the magnitude of the derivative raised to the third power that formula is going to be best when we're working in three dimensional vector space now this can be simplified using functions to show that this is the absolute value of the second derivative of y divided by one plus the first derivative of y squared raised to the three halves power and this function this equation is the one we'll use best with y as a function of x so if we just have a function y equals we'll use the last equation if we have a twodimensional vector valued function we'll use the first equation if we have a threedimensional vector valued function we'll use that center equation so let's take an example where we use each of these equations to measure the curvature or how sharply the graph curves these three equations are going to be really key to this section so let's highlight them as we go into our first example let's say we have the function r of t is equal to 5 cosine of t i plus 5 sine of t j since we're just working with i and j we have a vector valued function in the plane in two dimensions so we're going to use that first equation the magnitude of the derivative of the unit tangent vector divided by the magnitude of the derivative of the vector valued function probably easier just to start finding all the pieces and then dividing at the end so first the derivative of the vector valued function r of t is negative five sine of t i plus five cosine of t j well for the denominator we need to know the magnitude of that so the magnitude of the derivative of the vector valued function is the square root of the component squared which is 25 sine squared of t plus 25 cosine squared of t which is really nice because if we factor out the 25 we get the square root of 25 times sine squared of t plus cosine squared of t and we know sine squared plus cosine squared is one so this is just going to be the square root of 25 or five which means it should be really easy to find the unit tangent vector we know the unit tangent vector is the derivative vector divided by its magnitude so onefifth dividing by the magnitude times five sine of t i plus i'm sorry that's negative five sine of ti plus 5 cosine of t j distributing the 1 5 through making it a unit tangent vector it becomes negative sine of t i plus the cosine of t j the numerator is the derivative of the unit tangent vector so we'll take this unit tangent vector that we just found negative sine of t i plus the cosine of t j and find its derivative which gives us negative cosine of t i minus the sine of t j well the numerator is the magnitude of this vector the magnitude of the unit tangent vector which in this case is really nice because it's the square root of the components which is cosine squared of t plus the sine squared of t and we know sine squared plus cosine squared is one and so now we're ready to go to our formula for curvature in 3d in 3d the curvature is the magnitude of the unit tangent vector's derivative divided by the magnitude of the vectorvalued function's derivative well the tangents derivatives magnitude we found out was one the magnitude of the derivative of the vector we found out was five and so we have a curvature of onefifth it turns out in this case that the curvature is constant because this entire shape is a circle it's a circle of radius five and so it curves at a rate of onefifth all the way around the entire graph but that's just a 2d example let's take a look at an example in 3d let's take the vector valued function r of t is equal to 4 cosine of t for sine of t and three t now it's off my screen so i'm just going to copy again that curvature in 3d is going to be the magnitude of r prime of t crossed with r prime prime of t divided by the magnitude of r prime of t cubed just to remember the formula which is off my screen so we just need to start finding these pieces so let's start with finding r prime of t r prime of t is negative four sine of t comma four cosine of t comma three we also need to know r prime prime of t which is negative four cosine of t negative four sine of t and zero to make the numerator we need to cross those two vectors so r prime of t crossed with r prime prime of t and when we cross these we get 0 minus a negative 12 so positive 12 sine of t comma 3 times negative 4 is negative 12 cosine of t minus 0 comma 16 sine squared of t minus a negative so plus 16 cosine squared of t which if you factor on that k component factor out a 16 we have sine squared plus cosine squared so that's actually going to simplify just to 16. so let's rewrite this vector simplified with 16 in the k component the numerator of the curvature is the magnitude of r prime crossed with r prime prime of t so let's find the magnitude of this vector which is the square root of 144 sine squared of t plus 144 cosine squared of t plus 16 squared which is 256. factoring out the 144 we're left with cosine squared plus sine squared which is one so we're left with 144 plus 256 which is the square root of 400 which is 20. so our numerator for the curvature is 20. the denominator is the magnitude of our prime of t cubed well we found r prime of t already in our first step up above in blue so let's just run the magnitude formula which is the square root of the components 16 sine squared of t plus 16 cosine squared of t plus nine again if you pull the 16 out of the first two terms you're left with 16 times sine squared plus cosine squared which is one plus nine we get the square root of 25 which is just five and so finally we're ready to calculate the curvature of our vector valued function curvature we said using the formula in the top right here is the numerator is the magnitude of the cross product we found out was 20 divided by the magnitude of the derivative which is 5 cubed which is 20 over 125 which dividing by 5 will give us 4 over 25 as our final curvature curvature in three dimensions measuring how sharply a corner is turning we had a third formula though for curvature so let's take a look at it the third formula is used best when we have a function written out like f of x equals x squared how sharp is this function turning how is the curvature measured well again it's off my screen but you have it on your notes up above that the curvature when we have a function is the absolute value of the second derivative divided by one plus the first derivative squared raised to the three halves power so let's find all those pieces first derivative is two x the second derivative is just 2. and so if we plug into our curvature function we get the absolute value of the second derivative which is 2 divided by one plus the first derivative which is two x squared all raised to the three halves power cleaning up a little bit the absolute value of two is just two over one plus four x squared raised to the three halves power and this time our curvature is not a constant but it depends on how big x is and that makes sense because we know x squared starts out with a real sharp curve in the center but on the outsides it's becoming more and more flat in fact let's take a look at what the graphs of x squared looks like compared to the graph of its curvature so here i've graphed the graph of x squared and now i'm going to graph its curvature which we said was two over one plus four x squared raised to the three halves power and what we see is the curvature is at its largest value its steepest point at zero but as it gets out further and further and further the curvature gets less and less and less and so we see the curvature increases as the curve sharpness increases and that's what we're measuring with curvature how sharply how fast is this smooth curve turning so we've got three formulas for curvature one formula that helps in two dimensions one in three dimensions and one when we have y as a function of x instead of a vector valued function take a look at the homework assignment also doing some arc length problems to see if you can get comfortable with them come to class with questions and we will see you then now that we've gotten comfortable working with these vector valued functions we're ready to address the question how do we model motion in space over time and the idea is very similar to when we were working with derivatives and integrals we can talk about the position of a particle we can talk about its velocity and we can talk about its acceleration in fact there's one more thing we can talk about too now that we have vectors and that's the idea of speed but we'll get to that in just a minute and what's nice with vector valued functions is now we can extend those ideas of position velocity and acceleration into three dimensions the vector valued function r of t can represent the position of a particle at time t in each direction so the i component can represent how far it's moving horizontally over time the j component represents vertically over time and the k component can represent the third dimension over time and so with each component we can represent motion in each of the directions then we can come up with a velocity vector which is equal to as you might expect from calculus 1 the derivative of the position vector and this represents the velocity at time t in each direction so it might be moving faster vertically than it is horizontally maybe if you shoot a canon vertically up it's moving vertically really fast and maybe horizontally just a little bit the vector v of t can show that velocity in each direction and then as you might expect the acceleration vector a of t is the derivative of the velocity vector or the second derivative of the position vector representing the acceleration at time t in each direction and we're going to introduce a fourth thing to this discussion and that's going to be what we call v of t and notice this is not marked as a vector this is a function that's not a vector but it's going to have a scalar solution and the reason for that is the v of t is going to represent the speed and the way we calculate that is we take the magnitude of the velocity vector so we want to be very careful that if it's a vector it represents the velocity if it's a scalar it represents the speed another way we could say that because the velocity is the derivative of the position we could say that's the magnitude of the position vector this represents speed not in any particular direction but the overall speed of the particle so let's do some examples where we look at these concepts let's say we've got the position vector r of t is equal to t squared i plus the square root of five minus t squared j if we wanted to find the velocity vector with respect to time then we just take the derivative of the position vector taking the derivative of each component we get 2t times i plus square roots of onehalf power so we have onehalf times five minus t squared to the negative one half times the derivative of the inside which is going to be negative two t times our j cleaning that up a little bit we've just got two t i dividing out the twos minus a t times five minus t squared to the negative one half j this then is our velocity vector at time t in the direction of i and j if i wanted to find the acceleration vector at time t we just take the derivative of the velocity so on the i component we just have 2i minus on the j component we've got a product rule the derivative of t is one times five minus t squared to the negative one half plus the derivative of the negative one half power is negative onehalf times five minus t squared to the negative threehalves times the derivative of the inside which is negative two t then we have to also multiply by the first factor which is t all that times j well let's clean that up a little bit so our final acceleration vector is two i minus five minus t squared to the negative one half the twos divide out and the negative times a negative is a positive so we're gonna have plus t times t is t squared times five minus t squared to the negative three halves all that times our j a little bit more complex but that is our acceleration vector we can also find our speed speed is v of t it's the magnitude of the velocity vector so magnitude is the square root of each component squared so we take the 2t squared is 4t squared plus we have a t squared and then the 5 minus t squared to the negative one because when we square onehalf the negative onehalf the twos divide out and that does not look like it's going to simplify at all so that represents the speed of our particle represented by the vector r of t let's try one more example to make sure we can do velocity acceleration and speed let's say we've got a vector r of t which is equal to let's do component form this time t squared minus three t two t minus four and t plus two the velocity vector then is the derivative of that which is two t minus three 2 and 1. the acceleration vector is the derivative of that vector derivative of the velocity which is 2 0 0. so it's only accelerating it turns out in the x direction or towards the i vector every other vector the acceleration is not changing it's a constant velocity of two or one if we just want v of t remember that's the magnitude of the velocity vector so we take the square root of each component squared which becomes squaring two t minus three we get four t squared minus twelve t plus nine plus two squared is four plus one squared is one and so for our speed it's going to be the square root of 4 t squared minus 12 plus 14. and so we have our acceleration velocity and speed values one nice application of these vector valued functions with velocity acceleration position is this idea of projectile motion projectile motion is when an object is moving through space and the only force acting on it is gravity and in two dimensions projectile motion can be represented with the vector valued function s of t the initial velocity times time times the cosine of the angle that it begins moving at times the i vector plus the initial velocity times time times the sine of the angle but since the second component represents the vertical distance we also have to subtract the force of gravity which is one half times gravity times time squared times the j vector this formula can be used to model projectile motion into space so let's see if we can do an example where we use that formula let's say a cannonball is fired from a cannon on a cliff towards water the cannon is aimed at a 30 degree angle or pi over 6 above the horizon which just means above the flat line and the initial speed of the cannonball is 600 feet per second we also know that the cliff is 100 feet above the water so if we were to draw a picture we've got a cliff with a little cannon and it's all above water and the idea is we're going to shoot this cannonball and it's going to go up and ultimately land in the water we know the cannon makes a 30 degree angle with the horizon we know the initial speed coming out is 600 feet per second we know the cliff is a hundred feet above the water and the first thing we're going to do is model this situation with a vector valued function and as a hint since we're in feet we're going to do the english version of gravity which is 32 feet per second squared well using our model up above the vector s of t is equal to the initial velocity which is 600 times time times the cosine of my angle i plus 600 times time times the sine of my angle minus one half of gravity and since we're in the english system we're going to use 32 feet per second times time squared times the j component we can do a little bit of cleanup that our vector s of t is equal to the cosine of 30 a 30 degree angle is at the point root 3 over 2 comma one half so the cosine of 30 is going to be root 3 over 2 and then divide by 2 will reduce with the 600 leaving behind 300 root 3. actually let's put the t in there 300 t root 3 times the i vector plus the sine of 30 is going to be one half so half of 600 is 300 t minus half of 32 is 16 t squared times the j vector this vector valued function then is going to represent both the horizontal motion over time in the i component and the vertical motion over time with the j component so now that we have our equation we can answer questions such as finding the maximum height if i'm interested in the maximum height all i really care about is the component that describes the height and that height is going to be at its maximum point when the velocity is zero or as we know in terms versus put on velocity equals zero or in terms of what we talked about in calc one the maximum height is when the first derivative s prime of t is equal to 0. and we particularly only care about the y component because we just want to know how far vertically it is so we're going to look just at the 300 t minus 16 t squared and we're going to take its derivative which is 300 minus 32 t and set that equal to zero which is a quick solve 300 equals 32 t and dividing by 32 t is equal to about 9.375 so at 9.375 seconds this cannonball has reached its maximum height but the question wanted us to actually find the maximum height not just the time when it occurs so what we need to do is plug that time in to the position vector to see how high it actually is so we've got 300 times 9.375 minus 16 times 9.37 squared and if i work that out on my calculator we should get 14.06.25 feet so it shoots from 100 feet up another 1400 feet into the air at its maximum height after 9.375 seconds if i was also interested in how far horizontally this reaches over the water we could plug that 9.375 into the x component or the i component to see how far horizontally over the water we are but the question didn't ask about that so let's move on to question c question c i want to know how long until it hits the water i'm going back to my picture cannonball hits the water all the way out on the right side here what we know there is the y component the vertical distance is not zero because zero is when it hits the same level of as the original cannon we've got to drop another 100 feet down so we actually are asking when does the vertical component equal negative 100 100 feet below the cliff and we know that the vertical component is 300 t minus 16 t squared so we want to know when that equals negative 100. well putting things in order and moving the 100 to the other side actually let's make everything positive let's move everything to the right side when we do we get 0 equals 16 t squared minus 300 t minus 100 and we know we can solve this using the quadratic formula t is equal to the opposite of b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4 a c all over 2 times a although we know that we want time to be a positive number so we're probably not going to need to worry about the subtraction that's probably going to give us a negative number and so when i put this in my calculator we get 19.08 seconds which means putting our answers together after nine and nine seconds and change the cannonball reaches its maximum height and then after 19 seconds and change the cannonball has crashlanded into the water well if it crash lands into the water what i might be interested in as a military personnel is how far out to see will the cannonball travel in other words what is my range with my cannonball on shore here well we just found out in part c that it hits the wall hits the bottom or hits the water at 19.08 seconds and we're asking how far out does the cannonball travel horizontally that's going to be the x component this time we're going to be interested in the 300t divided by the square or times the square root of x so 19.08 seconds in the x component or the i component so the i component then is 600 times time and we just found out time was 19.08 seconds times the square root of 3. plugging that in the calculator we end up with 9914.26 feet the cannonball can travel just shy of 10 000 feet in those 19 seconds when it crashes into the water so today we're looking at an application of these vector valued functions motion in space we're basically taking our vectors which represent the position velocity and acceleration in each direction knowing that the velocity is the derivative of the position the accelerations the derivative of the velocity and if we're also interested in general speed that's not a vector it's a scalar it's the magnitude of the velocity vector take a look at the assignment practice a few of these and we will see you in class to discuss them further
