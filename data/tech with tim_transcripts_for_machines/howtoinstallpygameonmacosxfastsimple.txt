hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so today's video I'm gonna be going over how to install PI game on a Mac OS X computer now personally what I was doing is I had a lot of difficulties and there's a lot of things I went through to try to get this to work but I think I found the easiest solution so I'm gonna be sharing with you sharing that with you today now to do so what we're gonna have to do is we have to install the hip now if you don't know what pip is that's package installer for Python as Pi game is a Python module so once we have pip then that's going to allow us to install any package which is gonna be extremely useful in the future so to do this we first need to open up our terminal so if you don't already have terminal open go ahead and go to your spotlight in the top right hand corner here and just search terminal if for some reason you can't find the spotlight it's probably somewhere in your dock at the bottom of the screen you just see mine's off to the side so it doesn't get in the way right now go ahead and open that up I already have mine open and then in here we're going to start just by typing curl and then we're gonna stop and not hit enter yet now what we need to do is we need to go to this website so you can either copy it down just by looking at the link up here on the top right in the top left hand corner of my screen or you can go down to this description below and copy that link just ctrl C and make sure that's on your clipboard so I've done that now we're gonna go back in here to our terminal now once we have this link and we're simply going to paste it in and then that's and then we're gonna put a sign that looks like this as you can see this right here and then we're just gonna type get tip dot py so I'll slow down here for a second so you can copy this down so curl that link I showed you and then get pipbuck py so this website here that I have open pretty much is just a way to install pip so it's just a module that you can run in Python that's gonna automatically install it for us so it's gonna make things a lot easier once you've done this you've typed this line and go ahead and hit enter and you can see we're going to be popped up at the loading screen and there we go so in pip has now been installed on my computer now that we have pip installed what we need to type is just sudo so we're gonna be running this as an straighter and then pip install hogging like this now once you do that it's gonna ask you for your password because you've typed sudo so you're not gonna see your password run you type this in but just go ahead and type it in nothing's gonna pop up on the screen once you've typed it in just hit enter and then you could see everything is gonna start running so you can see it says downloading pygame and installing pygame successfully installed pygame 1.9.3 now my PI game was already installed so this one a bit faster but if yours isn't installed you might see a few more lines now to verify that everything is working let's go ahead and open up our Python so I'm just gonna run my ID le here and then it should bring up the console for me and I'm simply just gonna type in here import hockey like this you hit enter and if you don't get an error that means that everything is working correctly and you've done everything right so that has been the video for today guys if you're having any trouble with anything make sure you leave a comment down below I'll be sure to try to help you out other than that if you enjoyed the video and it didn't help you out please leave me a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next video
