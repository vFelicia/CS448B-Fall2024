so let's begin here by walking through the steps that's involved in training a machine learning model or really developing some kind of artificial intelligence very little of what you're going to do as a machine learning engineer is actually building machine learning models or artificial intelligence most of your work is not going to be training a model coming up with a model architecture and doing all of that fun stuff you might see in YouTube videos or hear about In Articles a lot of it is going to have to do with data collecting data processing data and then testing and evaluating your model and continuing to repeat that process until you hit a point that you are satisfied with this is not as glorious and as glamorous as a field as you might make it out to be and there's a lot of very frustrating time consuming and difficult work that goes into actually being successful in training machine learning models and creating artificial intelligence
