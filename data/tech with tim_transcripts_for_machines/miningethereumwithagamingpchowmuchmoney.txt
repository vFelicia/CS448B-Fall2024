hey guys and welcome back to another youtube video in today's video i'm going to be talking about how much money you can make with a gaming computer mining ethereum so that pretty much means how much money you're going to be able to make with one graphics card mining ethereum today at the current price of 460 now this is going to change based on the price of ethereum and the difficulty of mining ethereum so this video may not be relevant in about a month or two but currently at this alltime high price of 460 dollars you can definitely make a lot of money mining ethereum with simply one graphics card so let's go ahead and get started with the video now i'm going to apologize before i even start um my voice is very raspy i've been sick for the past week so i'm just trying to get a video for you guys this weekend um so yeah please don't get too mad at me for my voice sounding like death but yeah all right so let's get started with the rx 480. so on the left here i have a bunch of different graphics cards i have six of them these are just common cards that may be in a mid to highend gaming pc that you're able to mine with so again if you don't know much about mining you have to have at least four gigabytes of video ram in your graphics card to be able to mine so this means the gtx 1060 three gigabyte model is not on here as you can't actually use that to mine at the current tag size of ethereum now i have also the estimated mega hash per second and the estimated power draw of all of these cards in my little chart over here these are just averages and they're going to be different depending on what card you have and what system you're running them in so i just looked online for the average mega hash per second on these cards obviously i don't have six video cards so i can't test them out all for you and this is just what i found so it's going to be different for you guys and it's going to vary a little bit all right so let's go ahead and get started so the website i'm going to be using for this is just cryptocompare.com and if you simply just type in ethereum mining profibility you'll find this website and you'll be able to see how much money you can make mining ethereum and other cryptocurrencies based on your hash rate and your power consumption so for the first car the rx 480 that's actually the card that i have we're going to be getting about 24 and a half mega hash per second now this again i get 23 mega hash per second some people get 27 so it's going to vary and this is just stock settings so not overclocked nothing done with the power consumption as well all right and we're going to be drawing about 130 watts at full load which is going to net us a nice 460 dollars per year uh mining ethereum and this is in u.s dollars so go ahead and put 460 in our chart here so we can compare later and this is your profit so if you aren't paying electricity you're actually going to be making about 600 per year as you don't have to pay for your power cost all right so let's go ahead to the next one the rx 580 it's a very similar card to the rx 480 gonna be getting about 25 megahertz per second on this card with a power drop slightly less 120 watts making us 483 dollars per year mining ethereum our next card the gtx 1070 so getting a little bit higher on the on the scale here this card is going to use about 180 watts and it's going to mine at about 28 and a half to 29 mega hash per second netting us 505 dollars per year and these are us dollars all right gtx 1080 so this is one definitely the highest end card um that most of you guys will probably have in your system with 11 gigabytes of video ram we're going to be using about 230 to 250 watts on full draw so i'll just put 230 in there to be conservative and we're going to be mining at about 32 mega hash per second which is getting us about 537 dollars per year all right the next one gtx 1060 six gigabyte so again going down a little bit not as a high end as a card 120 watts we're going to be getting about 20 megahertz per second close to that so we're going to be getting about 350 per year with this card all right now the gtx 750 ti so this is definitely a lower end card you can still run some pretty good games on it but for mining you can see its performance does lack with only getting about 12 mega hash per second here with a power consumption of 90 you're really not going to be making that much with this card a little more than the price of the card so about 197 dollars per year mining ethereum now these are all your estimated numbers on how much you're going to make in u.s dollars since i'm canadian i would want to go and convert these into canadian dollars to see how much they are um so right now at the current price of ethereum it's not bad considering these costs right here are about the same if not more than the cost of the video cards so you can see our best card the gtx 1080 is gonna get about 540 dollars and that is if the price of ethereum stays the same as it is right now so as you can see here the price of ethereum does fluctuate quite a bit and this is really going to dictate how much money you're going to be able to make mining it so when people were mining up here you're making a ton of money when you're mining down here at a low of about 200 maybe even lower than that you're really not making that much money it's all about knowing when to sell your cryptocurrency um and when to hold on to it so yeah that's pretty much been my video on how much money you can make mining ethereum um per year now again this is definitely going to vary depending on the system you're running um how much power you're running so here on this website i only actually put in the power draw of the card i didn't put in the power draw of the average computer because it's going to depend on what system you're running if you're running a low end motherboard low end processor that doesn't use a lot of power then this number is going to be lower for your overall computer power draw same thing if you're running a higher end system with a higher power supply a higher end cpu you're going to be using more power so yeah i just put in the power consumption of the card you can expect that you're going to be paying a little bit more in electricity cost as your system is going to be running as well as your graphics card so yeah that's been it for this video if you guys enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe and i will see you again in another
