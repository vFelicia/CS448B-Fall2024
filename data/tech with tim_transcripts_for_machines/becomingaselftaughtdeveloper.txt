how long should it take you to become a selftaught developer well this varies from person to person and based on the level of knowledge you want to have in a specific programming Niche like front end back end Etc but the reality is there's a finite set of topics that every developer is kind of expected to know and I would imagine that if you were doing this fairly seriously you had a good plan and a solid curriculum that you were following and you were very focused you could learn all of the topics you needed in under six months I've seen some people do this in three or four months I've seen other people take a full a year it depends again on your focus the type of curriculum you're following and the time commitment you're putting into it but I'd say for most of you if you're really serious about becoming a developer you could do it in about six months now if you want a full curriculum of topics you can follow you can check out my course programming expert you don't have to buy the course you can just look at the curriculum and see what we're recommending to get to a junior Dev position as fast as possible
