now I know this seems obvious but especially in a computer science degree you cannot rely on your professor or really anyone else to teach you the course content you need to learn it on your own a lot of people seem to think that they're gonna get all of the knowledge they need by going to a bunch of lectures reading the textbook and just following the basic thing that most people do in other degrees you're probably going to be watching videos like mine you're going to be going and searching stuff up on stack Overflow you're going to be looking at code examples I only went to about 20 of my lectures I just stayed at home pretty much all day and studied on my own I could then focus on what I found difficult rather than what other people found difficult and I just was much more efficient and learned a lot more when I did it on my own rather than relying on my professors
