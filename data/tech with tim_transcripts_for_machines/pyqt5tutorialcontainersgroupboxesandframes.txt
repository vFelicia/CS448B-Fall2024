hey guys and welcome back to their pine qt5 tutorial so in today's video I'm gonna be talking to you about containers and changing some colors and some other stuff in pi QT designer we're not gonna be working with any code today I'm just gonna be showing you some cool stuff in here and with that being said let's get started so the first two things I want to show you guys are containers now the two containers that I'm gonna show today our group boxes and frames so I'm just gonna drag a group box in here to demonstrate how this works and what it is essentially what these do are allow you to apply properties or attributes or whatever you want to call them to all of the widgets that are inside of the container now that means that say you want to have a bunch of labels that all share the same properties or attributes maybe they have the same text size the same color but you don't want to have to change all of them individually what you can do is use something like a group box set the property on the group box and then start dragging those widgets into the group box and they will inherit that property if you're confused just give me a second I'll show you how this works so what I'm gonna do is just go into this group box here which I've dragged in and change the text size to be 48 so you can see nice and large and I can go ahead and change this title and maybe I'll just say group like that now if I drag a label in and I don't put it inside the group box you can see that it by default starts at size 8 right and it's nice and small now if I take a fresh label so let's grab one here and drag it inside of the group box immediately it has that text size applied to it because it's inside that group box so this might not seem super useful right now but when you have a ton of different widgets and you're adding and removing them constantly from the screen it's really nice to be able to just add them into a group box and have all the styling and all the properties applied to them automatically so that's kind of the advantage of doing that now this works the exact same with the frame the only difference with a frame is it doesn't have this title at the top and this little line so it's more subtle and you don't notice it or you actually it's impossible to see because it doesn't show up on the screen so you see it gives us some like dotted lines right now but if I go and just preview this you don't see anything whereas with the group box if I one here and let's go ahead and preview this you do actually see those lines and you see that group box so those are the main differences but these are the exact same the way that they actually work so for this tutorial I'm just gonna use the group box now what I'm gonna do here is just show you kind of how to add a few things into here and make them I don't know a little more customized so what I'm gonna do here just name this labels and we're just gonna add a bunch of labels in here so the first thing I'm gonna do is just Center this text which is something you probably want to do quite often and to do that if I go down to alignment here I can change the horizontal alignment to align each Center now that's gonna put that in the middle for me now if I want to change the font size which I do I'm gonna change that to 22 gonna make that bold and actually it looks for another font that maybe I like better let's use I don't know that alright so that's gonna be our font for this now what I'm gonna do is also change the color of this font and show you how to do that so it applies to all of the other labels and you know what let's rename this red labels alright so to change the color what we do is when we look for something called palate which should be right above the font and rather than choosing inherited what we're gonna do is say change palate now this is where you can change all of the kind of color schemes for your program now what I'm doing is just changing all of the color schemes inside of this group box here but if you wanted to change them for the entire project then what you would do is simply click on this main window here go to change palette and then change that as well now anyways what I'm gonna do is just quickly change this color scheme to be green so if I click OK and then you can see that it shows kind of the differences and what things are gonna look like here now if I want to change the text color what I can do is go and find text color which should be a window text and rather than having it black maybe I'll change that to red alright so now you can see that the text for my radio buttons down here it's kind of give me a preview has changed to red and that is kind of how that works so if I go ahead and click OK now you can see that this changes to red and if I could and try to drag in any labels here we get a red label and you can see you red label like that now let's say you want to have a bunch of red labels let's drag a bunch in here just as an example but there's one label that you don't want to be red you want to have its own properties who wants to change it to color well to do that is really easy all you have to do is just specifically change that label and it won't affect anything else in the group box so what I can do is just go to change palette for this label go to window text change that to black and then you can see that this guy go ahead and changes to black as well and that's kind of all of it all there is two containers and working with them again the frame works the exact same way except you can't see it and just a quick note here you can actually put group boxes inside a group boxes and I'll demonstrate how that works really quickly so if I put another group box in here you can see that immediately it inherits the properties from this one the only thing is it doesn't inherit that pallet property but that's fine because we can go ahead and change that nice and easily in here so if I change this palette and I change the window text I don't know let's go to this color now you can see this group box is gonna change to that and if I go and try to put a button in here then you can see that we get a button and it has that same text property and all of that now for some reason sometimes the colors don't inherit they work for the label but I guess for the button the color scheme doesn't quite work or I have to change the palette even more in here so if I change palette I go to button text that's probably why and change that maybe to red now you can see that this button is gonna get that red text and I can throw a nother button in that one gets red text if I throw a button over here it still keeps this black text because we didn't change that in this main group box so you can kind of see how that was a useful and how you go about using them it's nicer when you're actually dynamically adding things from code into the window which I'll probably do in a later tutorial but that's kind of it for group boxes and frames just want to introduce you to those if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like I'll see you in another PI qt5 tutorial
