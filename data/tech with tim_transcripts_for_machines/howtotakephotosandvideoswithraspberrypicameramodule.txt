hey guys and welcome back to another Raspberry Pi tutorial so in today's video I'm gonna be talking about the Raspberry Pi camera module of v2 now what I'm gonna be doing is showing you as first of all how to hook this up to our Raspberry Pi just this will just take a minute or two just to make sure we get the same correctly and then I'm gonna be showing you guys how we can take photos with this and record video now in the next video I'm gonna be showing you how we can actually stream live video from this using sockets and some cool Python code but for now on we're gonna start with the basics so photo and video now once you guys unpackage this you should see that you get your Raspberry Pi camera in a package that looks like this now I'm just gonna take it out here I've already actually used this but I'm just storing it in there for now you can see that my cable is slightly bent but that's alright now this is a pretty small camera but I believe it's something like 8 megapixels and actually takes decent photo and video now we're gonna be going through all the settings today but the first thing we need to do is just plug it into this Raspberry Pi now you want to be careful with this because it is fairly fragile and what we're gonna want to do is actually plug it into this slot right here now to open this up what we're gonna do I'm just using a screwdriver here is lift up the kind of the edges of this plastic here just being fairly gentle and you should see that this is actually lifted slightly just a little bit now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this end here so where you can actually see the prongs I'm gonna plug them in so the blue is facing the back or the USB ports of the Raspberry Pi now once that's in there you're gonna make sure that's in nice and tight it's hard to kind of show this on video while I'm doing it and then you're going to press down on this black piece here until you hear it click snow since mine's in the case it's a little bit more difficult and I usually just use the screwdriver to make sure that I'm actually getting it completely down so there we go mine is in now and now that you have this plugged in correctly we're going to go ahead actually get on our Raspberry Pi and start using this camera alright so now let's start actually setting up the camera on the Raspberry Pi and taking some photo and video now I will warn you guys right now if you're not plugged in directly to your display so you're doing something like bien seeing into your Raspberry Pi which is what I'm actually doing right now which essentially means I'm just remote accessing my raspberry pi that's how I'm able to actually screen record here you're not going to be able to see the live feed of your camera what actually happens is when you do the live feed your raspberry try it your raspberry pi tries to spit that out to the actual display that's plugged into it so if your VN seed into it like I am right now like virtual network something whatever that means then you're not gonna be able to see the display so just make sure that you guys are actually plugged in like your keyboard and mouse is plugged in and you have a display plugged into this Raspberry Pi otherwise it's gonna be difficult to see and actually test if this is working so what I'm gonna do right now is just show you how to set up the camera so the first thing we want we want to do is actually just type rasp I config and I believe before that we might have typed sudo now when we do that it should bring up something that looks like this and what we're gonna do is we're going to scroll down to interfacing options I just use the number or the arrow keys to do that hit enter I'm gonna go to camera now this should be showing up if this is not showing up this means that you actually haven't plugged in the camera correctly now after we do that we're gonna click enter and we're going to click yes to enable the camera now mine's already enabled so I don't have to do anything past this but you guys will likely have to restart your Raspberry Pi go for a reboot so I'm just gonna hit finish here and that's all we need to do to actually set up the camera and now what we can do is actually start working with it and recording some video and taking photos so I'm gonna close this and what I'm gonna do now is go to ideally so if I can find that under programming I'm going to go to file new once this eventually loads up and I'm just gonna start first of all taking photos and then taking videos so new file and what I'm gonna do is start by importing PI camera and importing the time module and then I'll show you how to take cameras or take photos so we're gonna say from PI camera imports PI camera just capitalizing that P and bc there and now what we're gonna do is import time so we're gonna say import time like that now we're going to define our camera so I'm gonna say camera people's PI camera camera like that and now we can actually start using the camera now whenever you use the PI camera what you actually need to do is you need to let it kind of warm up before you start taking a photo or video so what we're gonna do every time we start using this is we're gonna type camera does start underscore preview like this and then we're gonna sleep for two seconds around your time don't sleep too now this is the minimum amount of time that you can wait before you start taking photos with the camera now some of you will probably try to do this without sleeping and it may work for you but to make sure that you're not gonna run into any issues always do this and just make sure that you're sleeping two seconds after you start the preview now starting this preview will actually display the camera onto the screen for you now you're only gonna see this again if you're plugged directly into the display because it just takes over the entire display to show the camera so on my screen we're not gonna see the live display of the camera but if you guys are plugged in you will be able to see this edging to make that clear so I'm gonna save this now and I'm just gonna save this as let's say camera dot pi and we'll save this onto my desktop now it's important actually I already named one of these cameras so I'm just gonna say tutorial maybe dot pi it's important that you don't name this file PI camera if you do that you're gonna run into a bunch of issues because then this import here is not gonna work properly alright so now if we want to take a photo what we can do is just simply type camera dot capture like this and then we can simply type the name of the file we want to save this to and it will sit you'll just save it wherever our directory is or wherever our script is running so in this case I'm on my desktop so it's gonna save it on the desktop as well so I'm just gonna save this as test dot jpg the standard file format and now if I run this we should actually see that it saves that file and I will be able to open up the image for you guys but again if you're gonna be viewing this image sometimes it may only work if you're actually directly plugged in to the Raspberry Pi so I'm gonna run this with f5 wait are two seconds it's gonna snap a photo I'm just now the camera now hopefully this can photo turned out good for you guys and now we should see on our desktop we have an image called test JPEG you should be able to open this by just doubleclicking let's see what we get for our photo and this one is a bit blurry cuz I was moving the camera but you guys can see that we get this photo now it actually saved in the resolution 1920 by 1080 so I can blow this up and you can see the beautiful photo of me nice and blurry while I move the camera but that's it for taking photos now if you want to change the resolution or you want to flip your camera around I'm gonna show you how to do that quickly so the first thing that we can do is we can set our camera resolution now the maximum camera resolution for this I believe is something like 2560 by 1440 or something like that I don't know the exact resolution but I'm just gonna go ahead and set mine to 640 by 480 for right now just setting it at a low resolution cuz we're gonna start doing some video in just a second now if I want to flip my camera vertically so say I notice when I took my photo it was upside down to do that we just type it me flip so FL IP equals true and this is just gonna vertically flip our camera so now let's go ahead and do this again so f5 I'll look at my camera right this time and give a nice little wave big smile and then now if we run this and we look at test dot JPEG you can see a beautiful photo of me flipped correctly and a smaller resolution this time is 640 by 480 alright so that's it for taking photos pretty straightforward you can obviously put this into a while loop and take a bunch of photos or wait for some kind of motion and then take a photo you guys can play with that but now I'm going to show you how to take video so to take video is very similar except all we're gonna do to do this is do camera don't start underscore recording so start underscore recording like that now inside of here we're gonna put a file name again but the encoding on this has to be dot h.264 now this is a raw video recording which means that to open this is kind of a bit finicky but I'll show you guys that in just a second so I'm gonna record this under my underscore movie h.264 and then all I'm gonna do is simply sleep for as long as I want to wait for this recording so if I want to record for 10 seconds I'll sleep for 10 seconds if I want to record for 5 seconds I'll do it for 5 and then once we're done we're gonna do camera dot stomp underscore recording like that and that'll stop recording our camera now that's actually it to saving this and recording a file essentially you're recording a video now the only thing is to view this video is a little bit finicky and I'm going to show you guys how to do that so let's run this first of all and let's see if this is actually working again my camera is down here so that's why it's kind of like coming up like this we'll wait that five seconds and get our movie recording and I'll show you guys how we can actually view this alright so now it's finished recording and if we want to view this what we can do is actually use something called omx player that should come with your Raspberry Pi so if you want to see if this first of all is on your Raspberry Pi what we're gonna do is just type omx player like this and then if it gives you no errors you have olmecs player and you're ready to move on otherwise you're gonna have to install it and I can't tell you how to do that because I don't know so you gonna have to look that up so what I'm gonna do next is just CD on to my desktop so that I can actually play this video so I'm gonna say o MX player and then I'm just gonna simply gonna type my underscore movie dot h.264 and hit enter now when you do this you should see the video pop up on your screen and you should be viewing it at about 25 fps now for me obviously since I'm BNC it into this and I'm not actually in the display I don't have an HDMI cable plugged into my Raspberry Pi you can see it's just the camera and the power cable I can't view it per few guys you should be able to so that is actually it for recording and taking video if you want to change the resolution just change this if you want to change the vertical flip you can do that you can also do a horizontal flip so camera dot each flip I believe is that one and set that equal to true or false accordingly and if that is how easy it is to record to video and to take photos with your Raspberry Pi camera in the next video I'm gonna show you guys how we can actually stream this tweet live feed so that we can view this from any other computer and that's gonna be kind of cool it's gonna be a bit of a longer video but we're gonna be using sockets and that'll be an interesting video as well so with that being said if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you pay the like and subscribe and I will see you again
