in this video i'm going to share with you three practical and realistic ways that you can make 500 a month or more from coding now i'm not going to tell you to make a global game you sell for tons of money or run a youtube channel or start a blog or anything like that these are realistic things that you can start today even if you are a beginner programmer if you're someone who's 12 13 14 years old you can definitely do these things and the reason why i'm saying these are realistic is because everything i'm going to mention in this video i have actually done and i did it mostly when i was at the age of between 14 and 18 years old these are meant to be kind of short tasks you take on on a freelance basis and do whenever you have free time to make a little bit of money and gain a bit of experience working with clients and the last thing i will say for this introduction is that you can definitely make much more than 500 and as i grew up and got into first second third year of university my income from these tasks increased drastically but i think 500 is a really realistic target and a lot of people would be happy to make that each month especially if you're only spending a few hours and not working on something as a fulltime job so with that said let's get into these three methods all right so let's dive into method number one here which is tutoring now this is personally my favorite method and i found that this makes the most amount of money when you average it out per hour now i understand there's a lot of concerns here with tutoring a bunch of you are probably already yelling at the computer and saying i'm not skilled enough i'm not good enough to tutor i don't have any clients and you're going to list off a thousand excuses that's fine but the reality is you can always find someone to tutor and if you know even one thing more than they do you're still gonna be valuable in being able to teach them or help them out the thing is when most people are looking for a tutor the reason they're doing that is because they struggle to learn stuff on their own they really just need someone to guide them through some content to read what their teacher would have read them in class again and again and again to help them solve a problem to help them work on a project if you have even the most basic skill in the area that this person needs to be tutored in you can definitely be valuable now i started tutoring when i was about 14 years old i actually was not tutoring in computer science i was tutoring in math and tutoring in just regular science in high school but you can definitely tutor in computer science and that's actually one of the more lucrative ways to make money when i started tutoring at 14 years old i was charging 20 an hour this is canadian dollars but still that was kind of the base rate you're not often going to see tutors that are charging less than twenty dollars per hour you have a oneonone session with someone 20 an hour at least from where i am that's kind of a standard rate in other countries that may vary but still that's pretty good especially if you compare it to a minimum wage job which in canada is about 15 an hour now as you become a more skilled tutor you can charge fifty dollars an hour a hundred dollars an hour i've done tutoring sessions for two hundred dollars an hour before now i don't do that anymore because i do feel bad charging people that much money but it does have to be worth my time right so you get the idea here but this is definitely scalable and if you have a few clients you do a few tutoring sessions per week that can definitely add up so now i know the question is how do i find clients how do i actually find people to tutor now for me the best way to do this is to reach out to people in your community and to actually have a kind of personal connection with the people that you're tutoring now what i mean by that is to have someone maybe introduce you to a client or to market in your school which i guess is more difficult now with covid but still i'm going to talk to you about how i gained some clients so when i was 14 15 years old i guess i would have been in grade 9 or grade 10 i was in a computer science class and there was a computer science class that happened kind of the year before me so in grade nine so what i did is i reached out to my computer science teacher and i said hey you know i'm a tutor i'm looking to tutor some people is there anyone you think could use a tutor in your class and then they'll go and do the work for you and recommend you assuming you're a good student to whoever it is that actually needs a tutor so from that i picked up about two or three clients and i was able to make about 60 a week when i was in grade 10 tutoring people now i also tutored in other subjects like science math but computer science was kind of the main one that i did and that was obviously the one that i was most skilled at so it's not that difficult to get clients and if you can't do it in that way one great thing you can do is just post stuff at your school now i understand a lot of people are not actually in school right now so this is a bit of a flawed method but back then i would just post a sheet of paper with the kind of tabs where you can pull off and get my phone number and say hey i'm tutoring in computer science if you want an exam prep session if you want me to help you with the project or with your homework i'll tutor you that way other things you can do is list yourself on tutoring websites there's tons of them out there you can list yourself on fiverr as a tutor that's how i've gained a bunch of clients before and if you know friends and family that have maybe younger children that you can help out then you can ask if they need a tutor right almost all the clients that i've found have been from connections that i've had and have not required me being on the internet to actually find people now last thing i'll say here is that i understand a lot of people don't want a tutor or they're too nervous to do this all i'll say is that this is really a learning experience for you as the tutor as well and if you're only charging someone 15 20 25 an hour you don't have to be an amazing tutor you don't have to have a phd all you have to do is provide a little bit of value and you'll learn how to do that as you go through the different sessions the first time i tutored someone i was not very good at it as i did it more and more times it got better and better and slowly increased my rate as my skill increased anyways this is method number one i think this is really practical and almost all of you can do this don't make excuses go out there try to find some clients and make a little bit of money from tutoring alright so moving on to method number two now this one is a bit more challenging than the other methods i have on this list but it can be a lot more lucrative and in my opinion a lot more rewarding and fun now this is to build software or tools or websites for local businesses in your community now i think this is great because you're actually helping out a local business maybe a place that you've been to before and this is something that's really attainable because you're not trying to target the costcos or the walmarts or these huge stores that won't even answer your email you're actually targeting a client that you could drive to their store and kind of convince them verbally why they need your services or products now of course don't do this in a way where you're harassing anyone i'm going to explain the process i would go through here and what i've done in the past so the first thing i would do right now if i was about 15 years old and i had the skill to build a really basic single page website is i would look at all of the businesses in my local community and i would find if they have a website or not now most of them are going to have a website you may find a few that don't have one now if they don't have one i would actually physically drive to their store if i had a car maybe i would get my parents to drive me i would walk their bus or whatever the way is that i could get there and i would ask them and say hey do you guys want a website if you don't want one these are all the reasons i think you should have one i could do one for you for 50 bucks 75 bucks whatever the rate is you feel comfortable charging and the reason why you're going to make your money back from this is because you only need 10 clients to walk through your door from this website to make all of that money back right this website is here forever i'll deal with hosting it i'll deal with putting all this stuff up you can of course charge them for those extra costs but it's really easy to prove to someone why a website would actually affect the bottom line of the business and how they would make money back from it now of course most businesses do have websites so maybe that's not going to work out very well for you another thing you could do is offer to redesign a website if it's really poorly done if it looks like it's from the 1990s or what you could do is offer to build some type of automation tool for companies now this is going to be easier if you're actually involved in the company already or you have some insider information about them but something i've done is in the past is when i was working at a summer camp i realized that the staff that were in the main office of the summer camp were automatically generating schedules for the uh the next week and they were going through and manually trying to find any conflicts and make sure there wasn't two groups of kids that were participating in the same activity at the same time it was essentially a really basic algorithm problem to generate a schedule that they were doing by hand it was taking them like three four hours every week so i noticed they were doing this and i said hey do you guys want me to build you a really basic software tool that does this and they said yeah that would be awesome that would be great and that would save us tons of time so i built that tool i charged the company to build that made some money while being able to help out the company and you know that affected their bottom line because if they can save four eight 12 hours over the course of a summer doing the automated scheduling then my 100 charge or whatever it was for that software is well worth it because they don't have to pay employees to be doing something that the computer can do so this here is really all about providing value to someone and proving to them why whatever you charge them they're going to make back from whatever the solution is that you implement so you have to be creative this does involve you know a little bit of entrepreneurship and kind of getting out of your comfort zone but this is something i would highly recommend to anyone especially if you're kind of in the high school level because you have the skill to build something that's really simple but actually will help a business and automation tools time tracking tools maybe something that tracks orders or gives kind of a database of what's going on that's really really helpful and really simple to build and you can make a lot of money from so hopefully this makes sense hopefully i gave you some decent ideas in this section again i know this isn't the easiest thing in the world but i think this is really practical and this is something i've done in the past and found some success with all right so now we're moving on to method three now this is my least favorite method on this list but it does still make some money and can be fairly lucrative depending on kind of how you position yourself in this market now this is freelancing now freelancing when it comes to coding is difficult if you don't have a very particular skill but i'm going to talk about some strategies here that can make it so you can increase the revenue you'll get from offering freelancing skills so if you're unfamiliar with freelancing essentially this is you post an ad on some type of website five or upwork whatever it may be and someone ideally finds that ad and then pays to complete some type of task the most common thing is like making a website for someone or making a discord bot or working on you know an api or whatever it is that people need done they'll go on these websites and they'll try to find essentially the cheapest person they can that's capable of completing a task now this is the issue with freelancing there's tons of people that are offering services for the most generic things right for the things that everyone needs done now there's a huge client base there there's also a huge amount of people that are offering services and that means it's pretty much a race to the bottom in terms of how much you're gonna have to charge for services it may realistically take you four or five hours to create something and you only can charge 25 or 30 because people mostly from around the world are offering way cheaper rates to do the exact same thing so i do find it difficult to make a lot of money from freelancing but you can absolutely make money and the best way to increase the rate you would charge when you're offering freelancing services is to do something that is very very niche and specific with a super small client base but also a super small number of people offering services now this kind of goes in every facet of business but what i mean by this is picking some task that's super super specific that like you couldn't even really imagine someone would be looking for something that i did when i was offering freelancing services about probably three or four years ago was i actually was pretty much completing people's homework and projects which is against fiverr terms of services don't tell them i told you that anyways that's what i was doing and i was doing this specifically for pie game projects so the ad i put on fiverr was you know i will make a pie game game for you or something like that and what would happen is i would get people with homework that was due in like two days or three days or an assignment or a project or something like that and they would reach out to me with a high degree of urgency to complete something and because of that fact i could charge them two or three times what i would normally charge because they needed it to be done in like two days three days now at this point in time it was like me and three other people on the entire website that were offering this service now i did actually make a video on how i did this i'll put it up on the screen and link it in the description so since then there's been tons of people that have just copied my exact same ad and now we're offering all these fiverr services for pygame but you need to pick something that's super specific super niche and that you can charge a fair amount of money for because there's only a few people offering that service so hopefully that makes a bit of sense if i'm thinking off the top of my head of things that you could offer services for they would be like specific python modules or a specific library in javascript or something that you know just not a lot of people do and that you might not get a ton of clients for but when you do get clients they'll actually pay you a fair price so it's worth your time again you got to look into this you have to do your own research all of these things require effort i can't just make you 500 a week but these are three things that i have done in the past and have made me lots of money obviously it's helped that i've had an online presence and i've had a youtube channel that's increased my reach and the number of people that i can get for these different services but before i had any of that i was still doing these things and still able to make about 500 a month so lastly here i will add that for all of these different areas it is really helpful to have some type of social presence online a linkedin a twitter an instagram a youtube whatever it is that you want to make maybe a basic blog or a resume website is helpful and you may be surprised on how many clients you end up getting from these social channels even if you only have say 500 followers or something really small i was surprised when i was younger and i only had say a thousand subscribers on youtube how many people actually reached out to me and asked for assistance because it was realistic for them to do that and i actually had the time to spend and you know tutor someone for an hour that reached out to me from my youtube email now before we end the video i will mention that i do have a course it's called programming expert it's designed to bring you to a software engineering level of programming and teach you all of the fundamentals and advanced skills that you need to know to become a
