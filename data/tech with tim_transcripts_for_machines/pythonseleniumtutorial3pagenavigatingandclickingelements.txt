hello everyone and welcome back to video 3 of these Python selenium tutorial series we're really doing in this shorter video is just working with page navigation so how can we get to specific pages by clicking on links how can we click on buttons and then how can we go back to the original page that we started on so you know I'm going back going forward like the back arrow the forward arrow how do we trigger those events these are pretty simple and then in later videos we'll get into some more complex stuff I think in video 5 we're actually gonna do the unit test framework where we talk about the classes and how to setup the actual automated test because this isn't really a test this is more of just a script right now so what I'm gonna do is use my website again to demonstrate this and what I want to do on the website is actually navigate from the home page let's go back there into beginner Python tutorials so I want to find a way where I can go through a bunch of different links so I want to click python programming and then after I click Python programming once this loads I want to click beginner Python programming and then what I actually want to do after I do that once this loads up is click on the get started button so essentially I want to find a way so we can navigate into a tutorial series and then a way to actually do what I just did so back all the way out so let's do that so what the first thing I'm gonna do is actually don't even need to inspect element for this beginning part because there's a fancy thing in selenium cult and I'm just gonna type it out here I will say link equals driver gets not yet find element by where is it link text so find element by link text what this does is allow us to type the like the text that would show up for a link and then actually access the element from that so in this case that link or that li item on on the side here let's find this so I can show you simply by having python programming here we can access this little check mark thing on the side and actually click it to move to the next page so to do that we say link equals driver to find element by link text and then we simply do link so I click like that so if we run this now for selenium we'll see give it a second load the main page and then it loads and goes to Python programming so that actually works that clicks that link now we need to find a way to click on this link so beginner Python tutorials but remember that when we go to a new page we need to make sure we're waiting for the element to exist before we can click on it so in this case it worked fine after we've loaded the page but sometimes the page loads in a weird way where we need to make sure that that element exists before we try to click it so we're gonna implement that same wait stuff that we have before I'm just gonna put that in there but the wait text I have it on my other side of my screen just so I can copy and some of the imports is this so we have from seleniumwebdriver comment by support UI import all this so that's what we need and then I'm literally just gonna copy paste that weight code in again because it is kind of a handful to type out off the top of my head so then we'll have here try element equals webdriver driver 10 until again what this is doing is saying the element we're looking for is equal to the webdriver weight which means we're gonna wait for up to 10 seconds for the driver to find an element present on the page that has the ID of X right now in this case we can't have it by ID we need to have it by in this case gonna be the link text and then here we'll paste in the beginner Python tutorials so take that here paste it in and we could reduce this delay if we want what's gonna happen is say we wait more than 10 seconds it will just timeout and it'll crash the program or well it would just quit I guess actually but that's what this delay is doing so we have that ec2 presence of elements that's fine beginner Python tutorials then we should say elements dot click so we go to the next page and we'll make this in except because I actually don't want it to quit unless this doesn't work so let's run this and let's see if we get some better luck this time all right so wait waiting for it to go to the next page I should have picked a faster website for this tutorial mind it's just so slow sometimes and there we go alright so now we're here although it doesn't look like we pressed on the beginner Python tutorials oh there we go so they're so it actually did it was just taking a fair amount of time to get us there so it actually loads us in here to beginner Python tutorials I promise it and click that it just was lagging and now we have this button that we're gonna have to look at with ideas that we can click so let's zoom in here inspect this is a actually a so this is an href and how are we gonna be able to accesses so this has an ID s o/w button some random integer so let's copy that there we go and now I'll close this window cuz this is the selenium one and inside of here now we'll look for that button which is going to involve this same kind of wait process so let's take all this and let's put this here and I guess we can leave it called element that's not really gonna be a big issue by link text no this time it's gonna be by ID we're gonna copy the ID and then put the ID inside of here like that and then we'll set element dot click alright so let's run this I think I've done everything correctly and wait and see what happens alright so loads goes to the next page gives us a second alright it goes to the enterprise on tutorials hits the get started button and there we go now we are on this page so already I think that's pretty cool that we can navigate all the way through the pages like that and then obviously this is the introduction to my beginner Python programming tutorials now assuming that s not doesn't work but after we do that what we actually want to do now is go all the way back to the home page so what I can do to do that is literally just do driver dot back now dot back just goes back to the previous page it's actually pretty cool that we can just do that so I'll do that three times and now let's run this and let's see if we go all the way there and all the way back so give it a second this is the longest part of the video just waiting for the website to actually load so python programming beginner python tutorials alright and boom there we go we're all the way back at the beginning the reason it's much faster on the way back is because the page is already cached right so there we go so that works and that is kind of the basics of like navigating pages now there also is this thing driver dot forward so if I decide to do that like I can go back three and then I could go actually I should have done that and go driver dot forward again and go back to that original page so let's just do this we'll go back three and then forward two and I'll show you how that works and then I think there was one more thing I wanted to show you but for now we might be okay so there we go there we go go to the overview and then get in and back back back forward for it right so now we're back here on this get started page and that is the basics of how that works so that's to go back that's to go forward pretty straightforward clicking something is dot click you can click almost any element but I think it has to be like a link or a button or something that is clickable obviously and I just want to show you one thing that I forgot to say in the previous video is when you're accessing a text field so say we're accessing like the search bar right what we want to do before we access it typically is the Clery so there's actually a method so let's say that this element was the search bar that we found we can do element clear and dot clear we'll just clear all of the text that's already inside that input field to make sure that it's empty so when we send keys to it it will have those keys not appended the keys on it because the way that send keys actually works is let's say the search field already has hello in it and we send another hello it'll append hello it won't replace hello so that was just something I wanted to say cuz I forgot to do it last time yeah that's pretty much been this video that's how you navigate pages it's how you click on links I mean this is a technically a link but it was like labeled as a button it works the same way if it was a button you just do click access it by ID and that has been this video so if you guys enjoyed make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next selenium Python tutorial
