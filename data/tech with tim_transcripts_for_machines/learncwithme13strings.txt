hello everybody and welcome to another c plus plus tutorial for beginners now in this video i'm going to be covering strings and when i say strings i really just mean talking about a few properties of strings that we haven't seen yet specifically how to access and change different characters within the string and then how to get the size and the length of them so with that said let's dive in so this is going to be a relatively short video all i want to show you is a few things relating to strings that i kind of forgot to show you in the previous videos so the first thing to understand about strings is that they are similar to arrays in the sense that we can access and modify elements within a string so if i say string str equals and then hello world like that i can actually access all of the individual characters in this string and change these characters as well so if i do something like c out string and then at index one you're going to see that we get e printing out because obviously well that is what is at position one so just like an array all of these different characters here can be accessed by their position in the string and just like we can access them we can also change them so i can do something like string one equals and then make this sorry needs to be a character make this equal to say character two and now you see that we get two so it's important to understand though that every single element inside of here is not another string it is a character so that is why this worked i assigned string at index one to the character two and the reason i used the single quotes ray is to signify it's a character rather than a string let's actually see what happens if i try to convert it to a string this may work but let's just see actually we get a problem right it says uh what is it invalid conversion from const char uh to value type of string or something okay so kind of a cryptic error message but regardless you can see that it didn't work when i used the double quotes because that was trying to add a string when really what we're trying to do is replace this with a different character and come on error message can you go away let's go here and close that all right so that is the basics in terms of indexing elements from a string now i'm going to show you how we can loop through a string so if i say something for uh and then i say int i equals zero i is less than and we'll fill that in a second and then i plus plus ideally what i want to do is loop through all of the characters or elements in this string so there is multiple ways to do this but the kind of standard way is to write a for that looks like this now the question is though what do i put for my condition so how many times do i need to loop essentially how do i get the size of this string well we could do it in the same way that we got the size of the array where we use that size of function but for a string there's actually a method or a property whatever you want to call it you don't have to worry about all the terms right now called dot length and dot size so let me actually just copy this for loop and i'll paste it back in in a second but i'll show you what i mean if i see out string dot size what this is going to do is tell me the number of characters in this string so when i do this you see that we get 12 characters so we will continue in one second we need to quickly thank the sponsor of this video and the series which is algo expert algo expert is the best platform to use when preparing for your software engineering coding interviews right now they have over 150 coding interview questions on the platform and more are being added constantly with that said check out go expert from the link in the description and use the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform now there's another word or another method attribute whatever that actually does the exact same thing as size it's called length when i do length it gives me 12 as well so feel free to use dot length or dot size i don't think one or the other is preferred they just both work they do the same thing and so that means when we put our for loop here well if we want to loop through all of the characters then we're going to say i is less than string and dot length because if we have 12 characters then the last index in our string is going to be 11. so then in here what i can do is say something like c out and then string at index i and then end l and now when i do this you can see that we get hello world kind of printing out vertically like this now last thing i'll show you obviously if you're going to store one of the elements from here from the string you need to store it in a char variable so i say something like char chr is equal to string i that is valid so now i can do c out char and then end l let's have a look at this and we get hello world i just want to show you this because sometimes you are wanting to actually store what the character is and you're oftentimes not printing it out you're going to be doing something with it so just make sure the data type you're using to store all of the characters is a char data type you can't make this a string actually let's just see what happens if we try to make this a string but i think we're going to get in there yeah you can see we get an error here we can't convert the character to a string all right so that's really all i want to show you with strings i just wanted to make sure you were aware that you can access elements in the way that we normally would like in an array you can change the elements as well same way as we would do it in an array and then of course you can loop through them i guess last thing we could do is we could change all of the elements in this string so we could say string or we'd say string i and let's make this actually equal to and let's just go with something like a and then what we can do at the end of here is we can just c out str and we can see if this works so when i do this notice that we get the string completely filled with a's because we changed all of the elements all right so that's going to conclude this video i hope this was helpful if it
