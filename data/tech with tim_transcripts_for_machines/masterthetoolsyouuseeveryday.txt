how efficient are you using different software engineering tools so like an IDE maybe GitHub Version Control maybe you're really good in the command line with terminal and stuff like that and you can even extend this to different framer so one thing that I always try to do when I'm using different softwares is I try to think about how can I make myself more efficient here what's something that I'm constantly doing maybe I should learn the shortcut for that maybe I need to add a keybind on my keyboard maybe I need to spend a few minutes really trying to learn this software better so that in the future I'm going to be more efficient with it
