hello everybody and welcome back so in this video we're going to be doing is talking about the menu aspect of ordering our pizza so if you weren't here in the last video I'd recommend you go back and watch that first as I kind of explained how we work with this API what an API is what we're actually doing here and you know what are all these lines of code because if you just read this this isn't gonna make any sense and there is no documentation online explaining what this is you kind of just have to figure it out which is what we did in the last video anyways before we get too far I do need to mention the sponsor of this series which is kite another Matthew massive thank you to them there will be a link in the description if you'd like to download kites and kite is definitely gonna save us a lot of time in this series by allowing us to kind of see the documentation from all these different modules that we've been exploring before as some Auto completions while we're typing and you guys will see that and I'll point that out as we go through these series okay so without further ado let's get started and let's look at the menu for our store so we've already found the store by using this line of code here so we're gonna go through the next part of the quick start here and just actually get a menu from our store so what we did here was we create a customer object found the closest store the customer printed out that store now what we're gonna do is I'm just gonna print a blank line like that and I'm also just gonna print menu backslash N and we'll do backslash n like this so we just get a little bit nice nicer formatting when we do this so what I'm going to do now is define my menu object so menu equals my local Domino's get menu and I'm gonna use the menu to search for a specific item and the name that I want to search for in this case it's just gonna be Coke so we're gonna look to see what you know items on the menu have Coke involved in them and then we'll print those out and have a look at them so let's look at this now if we just go here and run this oops not cos I want to run that code give it a second and we can see that it loads up the store and then it loads on that menu the prices and the different items for whatever thing of coke it is so in this case you know 500 milliliters coke that's 177 and obviously these prices will be in the currency of whatever country you're searching in so either United States or Canada and yeah that is pretty much how that works okay so now we kind of know how to work with this menu right so what we've done is you know we got the menu and we know to search this is pretty straightforward I'm sure none of you are confused so what I want to do now is actually write a function that's going to allowed the user to search for items on the menu so right now if we wanted to search for something we had to have that line of code which was you know dot search then we manually typed in the name but obviously that's like not very good if someone actually wants to use a program and we will be writing a program that essentially allows the user to do everything without having to you know come in here at hard code stuff so let's get started though you know by doing this with the menu allowing the user to query it and then we'll move into some more advanced stuff later on so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say define search menu like this and what we're gonna do is just take some menu object now in here what I'm gonna do is get the user to type in some item that they want to search for show them the results and then you know ask them do you want to search again are you done searching they say yes they can type another item and so on so the first thing we need to do is get what the users going to search for so we need to start by printing say you know you are now searching the menu or something you are now searching the menu dot dot type an item to look for we do something like that so print type an item to look for a colon and this needs to be an input and then what we're gonna do before this is just say item equals input and I'm just gonna do something here which is dot strip which is gonna remove any leading or trailing white spaces and then I'm gonna put this to dot lower so this is just gonna take whatever they type in and make it all lowercase now what I'm gonna do is capitalize the first letter of this string the reason I'm gonna do that is because when we search for something we need to have like the capitals it's kind of weird the way this API works if you have lower cases and you search for something it's not gonna find the item if it has a capital if that makes any sense like for example if I tried to search for coke but all the items had Coke like this this isn't gonna match so we need to make sure that we have capitals on whatever item that we're looking for so we need to correct this so to do that the first thing that I'm gonna do is I'm going to say if item so essentially that means it's not a blank string so say if item does not equal some blank string means they actually type something then we will turn this into an upper case so to do that we're gonna say item equals item 0 dot upper + item like this the answer 1 to the end what this is going to do is recreate the item string such that the first character of item is going to be an upper case and the rest of that is going to be whatever the rest of the string is now this should work for us but actually to even make this little bit safer we'll say and the Len of item like this is greater than 1 so essentially if we have two characters in the item that we're searching for then this will work otherwise what we'll do is we'll give some error message saying for them to try again and we're gonna put this all in a while loop in a second but just bear with me then we're gonna say print invalid and actually what we'll do is we'll say exiting search so if they insert some invalid string we'll just get out of the search so what I'm gonna do now is put all this in a while loop so I'm gonna say well true like that and we'll do all this and then inside this else I'm going to break and below here now if we have a valid item we haven't broke it out it wasn't invalid we'll search for that item and display so we'll just say print results for and then we can actually just format this using an F string so inside of here I'm gonna put F before my quotation marks inside of here I'm gonna put item which is gonna be the item that they search for and then we will simply search that item so say menu dot search and in here item and that should be good to go so now what I'm gonna do is call this function like this so search menu and again notice kite is giving us these completions which is saving us some time and this should actually be good to go so essentially what we've done is you know we've got the closest store of the customer we printed out that store we've now just printed you know menu we're gonna get whatever this menu object is we're going to need to pass that into our function like this when we search the menu we'll do that and then what this search menu function is gonna do is say you are now searching the menu while true so essentially until we get some invalid input we're gonna keep asking them to look for some item we're gonna strip off the white spaces we're gonna put everything to lowercase then what we're gonna do is say so long as the item is not a blank string which actually I can omit that and I can just say if the Len of the item is greater than one so there's more than one character in there then what we'll do is say item equals item zero which will be the first character to uppercase plus item 1 to the end which essentially means all the other characters in there will combine that together into one string if that's not true so if this condition isn't true will say that's invalid and will break otherwise we'll look for the results for that item and print them out so let's have a look at how this works if I made any mistakes or not which I likely did so python tutorial pie so manual says you are now searching the menu type an item to look for what should we look for let's look for a pizza and search takes one positional argument but two were given Oh interesting sorry we just need to do name equals item my apologies here guys so do that make sure that is a bug so let's do this one more time and you are now search an item let's look for pizza and wow look how many pizzas we get showing up and you know what we can search for another item so let's look for sprites see if there's anything there and it gives us some answers for sprite and this is how we can search and query the menu so that's the first step we've done I think I'm actually going to end the video at this and in the next video what we're gonna do is think about how we can get the customer information to come in so how can we write something like that and then once we have all of these items how can we get the user to select specific items and how can we add that to an order so that we can eventually place that and get the credit card information so you can see there's a lot of steps to go here but this is kind of what we're gonna be doing in this series building some of these functions that can do this for us and working our way towards a program where a user can actually order a pizza from their command line so with that being said if you guys enjoyed make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys in the next tutorial
