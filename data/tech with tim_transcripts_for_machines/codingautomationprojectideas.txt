some of the best programming project ideas are related to automation now that's because these are real world practical applications that you'll probably actually finish and if you do put them on your resume they're a lot easier to talk about because they solve a real world problem and you had a legitimate reason for building them so that's why in this video I'm going to share with you a ton of programming automation ideas now you can code these in any language with any tax stack or with some automated tools completely up to you some of these projects are very simple some of them are a bit more complicated and some of them I actually built myself so I can give you a quick demo in this video with that said let's dive in and learn about some great coding automation project ideas now as I go through these projects you're going to see that I'm using a very visual editor and platform to kind of demo them and show you the information flow and that platform is make.com now I've teamed up with them for this video but they're completely free to use and you can click my link in the description and you'll get one month of their Pro Plan for free plus 10 000 operations of course you don't need to use this platform you could code it out on your own but you'll see that it's a really nice low code editor that lets you build these automations and Integrations quite quickly foreign so with that said let's dive into the first project which is an admin or message Notifier now as you guys know I have a pretty large Discord server it has over 30 000 people in there and as you can see on the right hand side of my screen it's pretty chaotic we've got a bunch of channels people are pinging me all the time direct messaging me and I end up missing important messages from my admin and staff team so what I set up and make here is an integration where I connect to my Discord I listen to the admin Channel and anytime there's a new message sent in that channel I automatically go here to Gmail and send myself essentially a forwarded version of that message so that I know to go back to Discord and respond to that now that's because I checked my email much more frequently than I checked Discord and you can see I just put a subject here you received a new message and then I put the content but I could put who it was from I could put tags I could put all kinds of other information that make provides here from the integration pretty straightforward I'll quickly show you a little bit of a demo now I can't actually run this because it's not going to do anything since I ran this since I've received new messages but if I go to the explain flow here and make you can see that messages will be received and then they'll just be sent over there to Gmail and automatically sent to me now I can run this manually or I can set this on a schedule and run it every 15 minutes 30 minutes hour whatever time frame I want that's pretty much it for the first project but this could be useful for pretty much any type of platform you have slack Discord email whatever where you're kind of aggregating import messages and sending them to the place that you check the most alright so moving on to project number two a little bit more complicated this one actually uses Chad GPT and AI now what this does is actually aggregate all of the money that has been sent and received from my bank account through something known as etransfers now in Canada we have etransfer this is like an email money transfer whereas in US you guys have like venmo cash app all these other convenient platforms now unfortunately my bank account doesn't give me a history of all of the money sent in and out and there's no like aggregated report and I wanted to see okay how much money have I sent out and how much money have I received so I set up this automation where what I actually do is I go to Gmail and I search for any emails from this specific address now this address is where all of those email money transfers are um kind of sent from so it'll tell me like Chris sent you five dollars you sent John 20 whatever it gives me information kind of about the receipt of the email so what I do is I listen for any new emails here in Gmail and then I send those over to chatgpt and I actually ask chatgpt to break down the email essentially to parse it for me and to tell me what the value was in the email so whether it was ten dollars twenty dollars whatever the payment actually was and if this was to someone or from someone and who that contact was so you can see I say find the sender and the amount from the following etransfer make sure you return it exactly in the format below name comma amount then it says the subject and the content and there you go so this way I know how much money was sent or received and who it was from and now that I have a consistent format what I can do is take the content of the reply from chat GPT and then I can go to Google Sheets and I can actually add a new row or appends that to an existing Google sheet so you can see I use a little bit of kind of functions here at make.com to split up the choices or to split up the response so that I have first the contact as well as the amount and then I add that in a sheet now to give you an idea of what the sheet looks like it would be something like this where we have the date we have the uh this will be the contact I've just blurted out because I don't want to actually kind of leak any names this is the amount of the etransfer and then the subject of the email which is like you sent money received money Etc now obviously this would be a lot longer but I don't want to docs anyone or share you know too much financial information on here but I thought this was a pretty cool automation again goes to Gmail searches for all those different etransfer emails passes them to chat GPT uses chat gbt to parse the email goes to Google Sheets and then updates a kind of shared Google sheet or whatever sheet I have here with all that information so I could go in and be like oh crap I spent a thousand dollars this month paying people money or vice versa I've received x amount of money pretty useful and something that I definitely wish I had back when I was using etransfer all the time so the next automation is one that's a lot more complicated but something I've actually been using and that I really wanted to build regardless of the video so what this automation does is it essentially finds all of the receipts that are in my inbox and automatically uploads those to Google Drive now you may say well why do you need that well for me I have a bookkeeper that manages all of the accounting for my business but my bookkeeper needs to know all of the receipts all of the payments like all of that stuff they need and I don't want to give them access to my personal email so what I have to do every month is I have to go in I'll actually show you here and on Google Drive I create all of these different folders labeled by month labeled by day and I put in all of the different receipts all of the payments all of the transactions and then he can go look at this and file it correctly in our accounting software now that's fine it doesn't take me a ton of time but a lot of times I miss receipts and it's just really inconvenient to do that so what I did to mitigate that is I made this automation where what I'm doing is checking for any new email so it's rotting like every 50 minutes every 30 minutes whatever schedule I want it then takes the email content so any new emails received passes it to chat gbt and it pretty much says hey tell me if this is an email or not so rather than me having to write a big machine learning model or do something complicated I just dump all the content to chat EBT give it a really simple prompt that says you know tell me if this is an email or not I'm here and I'm checking sorry in this router uh oops didn't mean to do that it's right here uh is this an email so if it responds yes then what I'm going to do is save that email as a PDF then I'm going to go and I'm going to start looking for where I need to save this inside of Google Drive so you see this kind of mess over here what this is doing is essentially locating the correct folder to place this email in because if we go back here you can see that I have like the month that I'm in so 08 223 and then I would have this specific day so what I actually need to do is I need to First Look okay does the month exist if the month folder exists I need to go inside of it then I need to check if the day folder exists if the day folder exists I need to go inside of it and if either of those folders don't exist I need to create them so you'll see that what I'm doing here and I don't want to go into all of the code is I'm essentially checking okay does the month folder exist well if it exists go here and then I'm checking okay does the day folder exist well if it doesn't create it and then upload it if it does just upload it inside of that folder now appear is pretty much the same chain except we're just creating the month folder first because if the month folder doesn't exist we need to make that first before we can go ahead and upload into the day folder now that I look at it it looks a little bit redundant the way that I've set this up in make.com obviously if you guys were coding it you could do it probably a bit cleaner but you get the idea right so I have this kind of complex automation where I'm checking Google Drive folders uploading stuff to Google Drive and this actually works really well where anytime I get a new receipt now it just automatically uploads it to Google Drive obviously it can make a few mistakes but generally it's catching a bunch of receipts and putting them in there so I'm spending a lot less time updating this kind of accounting record that I have for my bookkeeper all right so now let's get into a few more ideas this one I actually didn't finish myself but I was working on it the idea was to look at all of the GitHub issues that were on a specific repository kind of compile them into some kind of summary and then send that to my Gmail now what I wanted chat GPT to do in this instance was actually rank all of the issues by severity based on the description of them and then kind of send me an email and say Hey you have two critical issues that you need to look at you have one moderate issue and you have a bunch of issues that don't really matter that way I don't have to manually go through them and say oh I really need to respond to this issue I would just wait every day for kind of a summary email from really chat gbt that would say Hey you know you need to respond to these ones you don't need to respond to this one and it would make my life easier couldn't really get that one working too quickly so I skipped doing that for now interesting idea though and you guys could probably build that out all right so those were all the projects that I actually attempted to build but I did have a few other ideas so I'll share them with you here one of them would just be an automated code reviewer now you could do this with something like chat gbt I think there's probably some other uh you know AI Bots that you could use as well the idea would be anytime a pull request is uploaded you take each of the individual files send them to chat gbt chat EBT reviews the code and then leaves comments or tells you what the comment should be that you should leave now there's probably someone who's already set up a GitHub integration for this if someone hasn't done that then you could go ahead and build that and that'd be a really cool and useful thing to have like an AI bot automatically reviewing your code pretty simple to do you could get some probably pretty valuable feedback and the nice thing is you're not relying on chat gbt for any critical changes or updates if it gives you some gibberish you just ignore it and you move on another idea is to do something like a slack summarizer let's say you're really busy or you're like a CEO or a boss you get a ton of slack messages maybe you're away for a vacation or something set up an automation where what it will do is summarize all of the main points that you've received on Slack are all the main messages so I can kind of read through the entire Channel or read through direct messages with specific people you set and give you a quick summary of kind of the important information and what you need to know I think that's pretty easy to set up you would just take all of that info pass that to something like chat gbt you guys can tell I use chat GPT for literally everything now and it could spit out a quick summary and be pretty useful foreign next something like an inbox organizer so you could actually set up an automation using something like make.com or you could just code this yourself where anytime you receive a new email it can automatically categorize that for you in some kind of folder now obviously you could set that up on Gmail itself but you may want some more advanced filters or some more AI behind that where you don't need to go and write all of these crazy filters in Gmail you can just do something like hey chat GPT categorize this email into one of the five following different categories get the response from chat gbt and then just set that flag or set that folder or category on the email lastly this is probably an easy one you could set up something like a weather forecast updater email or whatever you want to call it where maybe every Monday you get a text message that tells you what the weather's going to be like or you get an email or you get something in slack or Discord wherever you want to set it up I'm not sure how useful that would be because you could just go to the weather app and check it yourself but kind of a fun project if you wanted to work on it you'd hook into some weather API there are a ton of them available and then something like twilio or just Gmail and have that kind of automatically send you an email or some update where you can see it quite quickly anyways I think that's going to wrap up this video on different automation projects to work on the point here was to give you some real world automation ideas once and I have actually built that I use for real world use cases so you guys can get some inspiration and think of things that you could work on let me know what project ideas you guys are working on in the comments down below always nice to see those and obviously for other people to read through them and get some inspiration and motivation anyways I hope you guys enjoyed if you did leave a like subscribe to the channel check out make dot
