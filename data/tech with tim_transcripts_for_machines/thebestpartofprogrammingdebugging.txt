I know and I'm sure you guys all know from experience that it can be super frustrating to be given you know all these weird errors and bugs and especially when using thirdparty libraries and stuff and spend like five six seven hours debugging trying to find this issue going through and banging your head on the table when like every answer on stack Overflow doesn't work and I think it genuinely is a skill to learn how to kind of quickly debug and problem solve and how to deal with these really strange and weird problems that occur when you're programming and I think it's a decent skill and something maybe you guys should consider
