hello everybody and welcome to the third video in the Python Pizza ordering tutorial series whatever it's gonna be called later on but anyways what we're gonna be doing in this video is essentially working with the menu to allow users to actually type in the codes that they see and add that to an order so we're gonna need to do a few modifications to this search menu function that we've created before and a few other things but I need to quickly mention the sponsor of this tutorial series which we've heard about before which is kite now guys kite is actually amazing I use it for all of my programming I know they're a sponsor and you guys think I'm biased but genuinely even one you know they're not a sponsor I'm using kite all of the completions you've seen in this tutorial series so far have been from kites and there will be a link in the description of this video as well as all the other videos in this series to download kite for free so take advantage of that it genuinely is a massive time saver and another massive thank you them for sponsoring this video alright so let's get started now and let's actually start by just modifying this search menu function after I explain kind of what our problem is right now so what this search menu does and I mean we've seen this if I just run this here is allow us us to look for items on the menu right so I can say you know let's actually try route and see if we get something for like root beer which we do there I could do coke like that and you can see we get some different items for coke but there's not really any way to like insert the items you know how do we select these items when we search for them on the menu so what I want to do is make this so rather than having this just constantly search for things it just searches for one thing and just prints that out for us so it's actually gonna be much simpler than what we've had right now I'm gonna get rid of read of this wild troop and it's gonna say you were now searching the menu will keep all of this so we'll just tab this back so shift tab and now what I'm gonna do is simply rather than having this break statement will keep that else like that but we're gonna put all of this inside here the reason for this is because since we don't have the break anymore we need to just put it inside the actual if statement so it only runs if we have you know a valid item that we've typed in otherwise we'll print invalid and we can exit the search and actually we don't necessarily even need to print anything you know if they type an item that's not valid we just won't get any results so maybe we can just type no results like that okay so that's good we'll leave that like that for now let's just have a look at how search menus gonna operate now by doing a quick test so now it should just ask us for it one so let's search for pizza like that you can see we get all the pizzas and then our program exits and let's run this one more time and let's just hit enter we can see we get no results because obviously you know we didn't really type anything valid okay so the next method or function that I want to write is going to allow us to add items to an order but to do that we need to create an order so how do we do that well if we look at our API we can see that to make an order all we need to do is use this line of code so order equals order begin customer order customer my local Domino's so let's copy that and let's paste this underneath our menu line here like that and let's go to the top of our program and import order like such now we actually look at order which I have open here and we can see all the different things that are associated with it so obviously we initialize it with a store a customer a country this isn't really actually that important but it's fine we have begin customer order add item remove item add coupon remove coupon send validate all of these different methods right we're not gonna dig into all those right now but I figured I would show you so we've created this order object now and the main method that we're gonna use on this order object is dad underscore item what this will allow us to do is add some item code and again those codes correspond to what we've searched here so like 16s CSP you know whatever that is to our order so we need a way to do that we need some function that can do that for us so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a function and I'm gonna call it add to order and what this is gonna do is ask the user to essentially type in some different values from the you know search menu because they see that they want to add to the order so we really take order as a parameter and in here what I'm gonna do is start by printing say please type the codes of the items you'd like to order like that dot dot dot and now what we'll do is we'll say item equals input and we'll simply do code like that to dot upper because everything needs to be uppercase we don't want to make sure that we get an error if they types into the lower case so we'll put this in awhile true because we're gonna ask them this multiple times and what we're gonna do now is simply try to add whatever code that they have to our order so I'm gonna say try order dot add underscore item height and then we're gonna say accept and all we'll do in the except is break so if they type an invalid code I mean what we can do is we can print we can say invalid code like that dot dot dot but what I'll do is say if it's an invalid code and that invalid code is actually like just a space like they just hit enter we're gonna assume that they don't want to order anything else so what am i I'll do here is actually say hit enter to stop order so we'll do friends another line press ENTER to stop order dot dot like that alright we'll just do a period so if they if they have this order it doesn't work but this item that they typed in is like you they just hit enter then what we'll do is we'll exit this will say if item equals equals blank break so I'll break out of this wallet before us now we actually don't need to return anything from this function because all we've done is added these items to our order if they're valid and that should actually be good to go and now what I'm gonna do is say add to order we need to give it an order object so we'll pass it order and let's run this and see how this works so let's quit run this so it says menu and what is the issue we're getting here I'll have a look in one second I'll be right back alright so I've looked through the API here to determine what this issue was and I found that the issue has to do with the country that is defined in the API by default so by default the API or all this code assumes that we're ordering from the United States but since I am ordering from Canada I need to change some things to make it know that I am ordering from Canada so to do this is actually pretty straightforward all I need to do is do comma and then put CA after this order begin customer order in here if you're ordering from the US you can put us like this if you want to define that or you can just leave it blank because if we actually go into order and we have a look at begin customer order well I've changed this to say country Canada but this usually and for you will say country u.s. so in here it should actually say country u.s. which means that by default you're using country u.s. now if you're wondering where that variable actually comes from at the top here what was imported before was country USA and then same thing here so country USA was the default and then country USA was here as well I've just changed this to do some tests and if we look for where that was from if we go to the URLs library we can see that these are the codes that were referencing so us for country USA and CA for country Canada so I need to define inside of my tutorial here that I'm ordering from CA so that this is actually gonna work properly we're not gonna get some JSON request error so let me open up the command prompt and we'll run this again so desktop pizza CMD I'm just gonna activate an environment that I've been using and then I'm just gonna say Python tutorial dot pie okay so let's run this we say you are now searching the menu type an item to look for what I want to look for always the same example we'll go with coke we can see that we get all these codes here and that says please type the codes of the item you'd like to order so let's pick one in this case I want to do 500 coke like that let's add another item so 12c coke like that and then let's hit enter and we can see that that exits and we've you know added all those items to our order so now what we want to do though is after we've added items to our order we want to be able to search again and repeat this process and then at some point if you know they search the menu or they say they type in some specific input we can stop searching so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put a while true loop here and we're just gonna do both of these commands constantly and after we add items to the order I'm gonna ask the question inside of this while loop would you like to place your order now or continue searching and then if they say you know play order now or whatever it is but we're gonna ask for we will actually place the order which is what we'll do in the next video otherwise we'll keep searching so what I'm gonna do now is going to say answer equals input would you like to add more items question mark and then here we'll just put what we're looking for as a response so we can say y /n and then we'll say if answer does not equal or actually will say I've answered not in and in this case I'm just gonna put yes and Y and we even do answer dot lower here to make sure that they can type uppercase if they'd like to then we will simply break otherwise we will continue allow them to search the menu and then add some more items to their menu so our sorry to their order so once we've done all this I'd like to output what the order actually is so I don't actually know how to do that but I'm gonna look to see here if there's something to actually print it okay so this is what we can do we can actually just print the order object because if I'm looking inside order here we have this wrapper this method and what this will do is actually show us all the items that are in the order and this is kind of a crazy line of code that is gonna show that for us so let's do this let's just print that border object after so we'll say print your order is as follows like that and then we can see what they have in their order so let's run this one more time and see how this is working so would you like to look for an item let's look for an item I'm just gonna look for sauce we have these so I'm gonna add gar butter we can add marinara like that and then we'll hit enter would you like to add more items I'm gonna say no and now we say your order is as follows an order for 10 with two items in it okay so it only shows us the two items if we wanted to get those two items how would we do that well let's look at here so it doesn't seem like there is any method to actually show us all the items that are in our order let's see if there's a way that we can actually grab those so self data products so this is the Len of self data products so what that means is we should be able reference this actual attribute from inside tutorial here and print out all those items so what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna put a backslash n here just so this goes down one line and rather than just printing the order I'm actually gonna loop through all the items in our order and print them out so I'm gonna say for item in self dot R what am I saying self data this is gonna be order dot data and I believe this was products like that so let's see if that we actually have here so products okay and then what we'll do is simply print these out so we'll just print and here I okay so I'm not sure if this is gonna work we'll do a quick test here then we can always fix it after so python tutorial pi uh what do you like to look yeah let's search for coke one more time what we want 500 coke let's enter would you like to add more items no and then whoa okay so this is what we're printing out when we have all of the item in it Jesus okay so what do we need to do here if we just want to grab this code well we just need to reference the item like this and then the code so let's do this python tutorial pi let's look on the menu let's go coke let's add 500 coke let's hit enter say no and there's no code for code so let's try this with capital c cuz i think that's actually what it was so my apologies on that let's do this again so search for an item coke 500 coke enter no and there we go our orders as follows 500 coke okay so that should actually print out all the items that we add and at that I think I'm gonna leave the video here so there might be issues with this little bottom line of code yeah I'd recommend you guys to test this out a little bit before we move forward but in the next video I'll kind of tweak will clean some of this stuff up and then we'll actually get to you know placing this word or getting some credit card information and cleaning up some of this console stuff a little bit better just so this program is a little bit nicer to actually use so as always if you guys enjoyed make sure they but like subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys in the next video
