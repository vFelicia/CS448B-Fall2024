hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video today i wanted to make a shorter video showcasing five awesome extensions for visual studio code i won't be giving you a full demo or tutorial on any of these extensions but just briefly discussing what they do and showcasing some of their functionality so with that said let's dive in so i'm going to start by showing you how to install an extension it's pretty simple all you need to do is open up visual studio code click on the extensions pane and then you can search for different extensions in the vs code marketplace now once you find the extension you want you can just press install vs code may need to reload and then once it does you've installed the extension you can start using it once you've installed all the extensions you can manage them enable them disable them and so on within the extensions list so if you open up the extensions tab you'll see all the extensions you have installed there and then you can also select and install extension and press the gear icon to manage its specific settings alright so the first extension i have to show you is called code spell checker this extension does exactly what it says it checks for spelling mistakes as you write code by default vs code will check some spelling but it's not the best and only does so in specific file types but code spell checker will highlight any word it sees that is not in the dictionary and provides spelling suggestions for you it's smart enough to understand camel case snake case pascal case etc and it won't flag compound words in things like variable names to fix a word that's spelled incorrectly you can press on the quick fix button that appears after highlighting the word so putting your cursor over any of those blue squiggly lines or you can simply press control plus period that's the keyboard shortcut that will bring up all of the suggestions for the different words so the next extension on my list is called prettier prettier is a very popular extension that provides auto code formatting for most programming languages it's especially useful in html javascript and other languages where there's a lot of nested blocks and opening and closing tags after you install prettier you can configure your formatting by pressing control plus shift plus p or command shift p on mac and that is going to open up the command palette once the command palette is open you can type format there should be something there that says uh format document with you can press that and then select your default formatter if you do have multiple of them for most of you you'll probably just have one and then you'll just have one option to select obviously now by default whenever you save your document prettier will actually format it for you so if you want to manually format your document not by saving what you can do is simply open up the command palette and you can use format document with select the formatter and then it will format the document for you now if you want to save your document without formatting it because sometimes it will format stuff that you don't want what you can do is open up the command palette again and then you can simply press save without formatting now if you want to change any of the default behavior of prettier what you can do is select the printer extension from your extensions tab press on the little settings or gear icon and then select the extension settings that will allow you to look through some of the options there and change kind of how it's formatting and what file extensions it will format for lastly though if you want to make it so that by default your document is not going to be formatted on save what you have to do is go into the vs code settings so go into the vs code settings that's the big gear icon then you can type format and you should see some option that says format on save just uncheck that and then that will remove that default behavior moving on the third extension i have to show you is called bracket colorizer 2. this is the new version of the original bracket colorizer that simply colors corresponding brackets such that it's easier to see where each block starts and ends now we'll do that with parentheses brackets angle brackets square brackets squiggly brackets all the different type of brackets and really there's not much more to say about this one some people love this extension some people hate it and think it looks silly let me know you think of it in the comments down below now the next extension i have to show you is called get lens so this is an addon for git now git is integrated by default in vs code and so you can already do a lot of get related stuff in visual studio code but what git lens allows you to do is see more information about the code that you're working in in the git repository so specifically you can see things like authorship modifications you can go and look through all of the commit history and just gives you a better user interface than the default interface you have with vs code by default what it also does is provide file annotations related to commits authorships and also provides a bunch of different views for navigating revisions and changes so to demonstrate this i'll open up the commit view by going to the version control pane in vs code and then toggling the commit sidebar menu here you can see and view all of the commit history file changes and more related to the current repository and as you can see here there's a bunch of other different views you can click on so below the commit view you can look at the file history view the branch view so on and so forth now the final extension i have to show you is extremely useful especially if you work with vs code on multiple machines and that is called settings sync now as the name suggests this will allow you to sync all of your vs code settings keybinds extensions extension settings and more across all of your different devices you do need to manually configure and install this extension on all of your different devices before this will work but it's pretty straightforward to do that you simply install the extension sign up with github and then it's going to ask you to select an existing gist or to skip and then it will create one for you this is something that's kind of stored by github then what you can do once you've set up your gist is you can use shift alt u to upload all of your settings and shift alt d to download all of your settings now if you're on mac you can simply replace the alt key with the option key in those commands so shift option u shift option d to upload and download respectively now there's a bunch of other settings you can mess around with this so i'd recommend you read through the extension home page the one that you get when you actually just click on the extension before you upload or download any of your settings because you can kind of mess it up pretty easily if you don't know what you're doing but i found this extension extremely useful if you spend a few minutes reading about it it definitely saves you a ton of time especially if you're working on multiple machines like i do all the time with vs code alright so there you go those are five great vs code extensions that you can use regardless of the language you're using in vs code now before i end the video i'll mention that there are many other great extensions as well but many of these are language specifics like the python extension reactant js snippets cnc plus plus go jupiter so on and so forth there's like hundreds of thousands of extensions for visual studio code now if you're working in a specific language obviously it makes sense to install that language's respective extensions if you're working in python install the python extension all right so with that said i'm going to end the video here let me know what you guys thought of this video do you like these kind of shorter type videos where it's just very quick information not going into a ton of detail or do you prefer more detailed indepth explanations of all of this stuff anyways let me know hope you guys enjoyed if you did make sure that a like subscribe and i will see you in another one
