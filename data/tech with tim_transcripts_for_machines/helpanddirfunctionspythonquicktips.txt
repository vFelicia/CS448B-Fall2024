in this Python quick tips video maybe talking about the derp and the help function and how they can well help you and speed up your time developing when you're looking for simple syntax or methods for specific classes or objects now what is derp and what is help well some of you might have seen this before but essentially what derp will do which is a method like this is list all of the methods associated with any object so in this case when I say object I mean it could be an instance of an object or it could be the class name itself so if I do something like dirt int well obviously we know int isn't an object itself it's just the class and I run this what we get is a list of all of the methods that int has implemented so we see like ad and bool like all these different things it shows us all of them now I can do the same thing for string and you can see we get all these different methods like starts with strip all the ones that you know exist on string same thing with bool and you get the point that any object this will work on essentially listing all the methods that are involved which is pretty useful the next method we have is called help now what help will do is actually give you a bit more detail and read out the doc strings as well as the included kind of information with all the methods now this is kind of long because this is on string you can see it's giving us a little description as well as all the methods and what parameters they take now how do we use this on our own objects well this is where it gets kind of cool if I create a class let's call it my object like this what I can do is I can call help and I can call dirt on it so let me just implement a little bit of functionality here so that this makes a bit more sense and then we'll get into it so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna create a doc string here and what I'm gonna say is this is a custom object for testing like that and that's my doc string and now what happens if I call you know print help on my object like that is I will actually get this same helpless for my own custom object so it says class my object this is what inherits from builtin style object it has my object name which is the constructor for that and then it says this is a custom object for testing and gives me this init method with a default initialized self now if I want to change the doc string for this all I need to do is just write something here and say this is an it like that now if I run this we see that this now gives us this is an it so this is kind of how help and dirt work and the reason I want to make you aware of this is when you're writing code this is the reason you want to include dock strings and make your methods meaningful so that if someone is trying to use your code later on with classes and objects all you need to do if they want to see if something works is just call help on it they don't need to have the source code and then they'll actually be able to read all of the information about that so the parameter names as well as you know what this method kind of does from what's inside of your doc string so anyways this has been helping der pretty straightforward to use them can definitely save you a lot of time and something to think about when you're writing classes and just code for other people
