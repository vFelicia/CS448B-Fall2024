now this is something I despise doing I always procrastinate writing my tests testing your code is a very difficult thing if you write very very complex code it can be really time consuming to test it so it is a hundred percent a skill to understand how to test your code and more importantly how to write code in a way such that you are able to test it and you can actually catch any bugs before you roll that code out into production so please spend some time learning testing learn about different types of testing like unit testing integration testing system testing Etc and feel comfortable writing tests for the code that you write
