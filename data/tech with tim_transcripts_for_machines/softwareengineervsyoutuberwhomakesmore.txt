hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to be comparing the compensation for your typical software engineer to someone who actually works on youtube as a tech influencer or software engineering influencer or whatever you want to call it now the reason i'm making this video is because the other day i was looking at kind of the top tech channels or top software engineering channels on youtube and i realized that most the people that run these channels actually do not work as software engineers they may have worked as a software engineer previously maybe they were at facebook or amazon or something and then they quit and they started doing youtube but my idea behind this was that they must be making a good amount of money from their youtube channels if they're not actually working as a software engineer because the salaries for software engineers are so ridiculously high especially at these big tech companies now as someone that has both worked as a software engineer as an intern full disclosure there as well as runs a pretty large youtube channel i have a pretty good idea of how much money you make doing both of these things and well i wanted to compare them here and give you guys kind of a behind the scenes and inside scoop into how much youtubers are really making so that said let's go ahead and get started and i'll talk to you about how much youtubers make versus software engineers all right so we're going to dive in in just one second i've got a bunch of information to share with you on the computer we're going to go to a screencast in just a minute but i want to quickly state that it's pretty well known how much software engineers make right you can go to the internet you can look at videos you can go and look at specific websites that have listings of all of the different salaries and well for you guys you can probably figure out that information pretty easily the number that i'm sure you guys are curious about is how much a youtuber would actually make now obviously this is a lot harder to determine and when i go through these numbers in just a second i'm going to be using kind of my personal experience and my understanding of how this this channel and this business really generates revenue and applying that to kind of a sample channel and we'll pick some numbers and you'll see how that works but there's a lot of ways in which youtubers make money which people don't realize and one of the main ways is actually sponsorships like this one now if being a youtuber is not your thing and you want to become a software engineer you need to check out algoexpert.io which happens to be the sponsor of this video algo expert is the best platform to use when preparing for your coding

check out algo expert from the link in the description and use the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform all right so i'm here on the computer and the first thing i'm going to do is share with you the average salaries at large tech companies for software engineers specifically i'm going to show you how much google pays their employees and how much facebook pays their employees i want to be really clear here this information i'm about to show you is crowdsourced so i obviously cannot validate the accuracy of this information i have never worked at google or facebook i know people that have and i know there's salaries that they've shared with me but again this is crowdsource so keep that in mind this could be wrong this could be slightly inaccurate but i know this site to be pretty reliable and i know a lot of people in the software engineering industry that have you know somewhat validated that what is on this site is is pretty valid and pretty accurate so keep that in mind anyways before i show you this and actually talk more about this website i want to quickly mention that the numbers you're about to see here are not representative of the average software engineering salary in fact i looked it up before this video to make sure i wasn't misleading anyone in the united states as of 2019 according to indeed.com the average uh software engineering salary was 107 000 us dollars with an average bonus of 4 000 us dollars so still a lot of money you can make a bunch of money working as a software engineer software engineers are paid very well but that is nothing compared to what you're going to see here for google and facebook all right so let's dive into these numbers i'm going to be comparing google and facebook and let's start with an entry or new grad so l3 is uh google's i guess like entry level engineer and e3 would be facebook's entrylevel engineer so l3 at google has a total compensation according to this website of 187 826 dollars again remember this is an estimate the salary they're stating is supposed to be about 128 000 us dollars a year and then 38 000 in stock per year i believe when you work at these companies you get vested stock over three or four years so they'll say something like hey we're gonna give you a hundred twenty thousand dollars in stock over three years then you have a targeted bonus of twenty thousand dollars that seems about right most people i know that work at these companies tell me that they're targeting a bonus about 15 to 20 percent per year of their base salary so anyways that is what it is for l3 at google this is a lot of money right this is almost close to double what the average salary is for software engineers in general in the us next let's move over to e3 at facebook this is 179 000 so pretty close to what it was at google and well i mean you guys can read the numbers for yourself let's just kind of go down and i'll go through these quickly because i'm sure you guys can look at the website if you want to see it anyways level four i believe this is usually once you've worked about two years or maybe one and a half two years depending on how good you are you get promoted to an l4 and your salary is 155 000. stock is 80 000 a year bonus 27 000 total comp 263 which is a lot of money moving over e4 uh very similar so it seems like facebook is just slightly lower than google and while you guys can read the numbers here yourself uh yeah they're pretty much the same all right so now moving over to l5 this is a senior software engineer i'm not sure how long it would typically take you to get into this position but if i had to guess i would say probably four or five maybe six years uh but you would definitely have to work at a company for more than you know two or three years to get to this position anyways total compensation of 351 000 you can see the stock didn't really go up a ton or sorry not the stock the salary didn't really go up a ton but the stock is significantly higher and that's kind of the trend as we go through this list anyways you can read the numbers we'll move over to e5 at facebook 377 000 wow so that's actually more than l5 at google so that's kind of strange considering the other ones and then we can look at l6 and i'll kind of stop after that because it's not realistic that most people are going to work any higher than this anyways l6 493 000 us dollars a year that is a lot of money salary 225 stock to 11 and then let's look at facebook this is 572. wow so that is actually significantly higher than google i just give you a quick sneak peek we'll go to staff software engineer 642 e7 838 geez l8 this is 1.2 million dollars a year e8 1.2 l9 they don't have any estimates but someone's saying 1.75 million jesus and yeah i guess they don't have that for this either anyways that is kind of the salaries that you could earn at a big tech company i'm going to imagine and we're going to kind of compare it to this salary right here l5 at google so a senior software engineer that is realistic most people aren't going to work or be in a position higher than this okay so 351 let's put that down as kind of like the highest you would make working at a big tech company at least as an average employee and now let's move over and talk about how much youtubers are going to make compared to that alright so i'm here we're going to start doing the exciting stuff which is looking at how much the average youtuber would make now i'm going to be looking at large channels with the specific spreadsheet i've set up here as soon as you kind of drop the number of subscribers that we punch into this spreadsheet below a hundred thousand or even maybe let's say below 150 000 or 200 000 this is probably not going to be very accurate so keep that in mind and same thing once you go over about a million subscribers this probably is not going to be very accurate as well it's very difficult to actually estimate how much a youtuber or content creator really makes because there's so many different ways to make money online and a lot of the richest content creators do not make a majority of their money from the primary thing that you see them do they will make a lot of money from say selling courses or from doing small things on the side like merchandise that you wouldn't necessarily kind of know about or you wouldn't really be able to figure out how much they're really earning from that specific source so i'm going to try my best to give you the best estimate that i can but keep that in mind i'm not perfect this spreadsheet is not perfect and i've made a lot of assumptions here that are based on how the finance and kind of business side works for my specific company and my specific youtube channel anyways let's dive in so here the way the spreadsheet works is you fill in these values in the youtuber stats section and then based on those values it will populate these tables with the correct numbers so numbers you see right now are not accurate at all some of them are just hard coded in because it's it just only makes sense to put them in that way but just keep that in mind like negative 18 000 is obviously not you know the corporate net income all right so let's get started here and then i'll talk about all the tables as we go through so if you're confused by any of this don't worry but let's pick a channel that has say 800 000 subscribers and try to figure out how much money they would really make so put 800 000 in there now we have to pick the monthly views for this channel so if i'm looking at my channel i get about 2.5 million views per month and i have 500 000 subscribers so i'm going to assume that a channel that has 800 000 subscribers if they were doing something similar to me would probably get about 4 million views a month so let's put in 4 million looking at average video views the reason this is important is to estimate how much you would make from a sponsorship let's say if they have 4 million views a month they're averaging like 75 000 views of video that might be wrong could be lower or higher we'll mess with this number later on but anyways now let's look at monthly videos so how many videos do we think they post a month personally i post about 12 videos a month sometimes 10 like usually over nine a month let's just say that they post less frequently and they post eight a month how many of those videos are going to be sponsored well you could say eight if all videos are sponsored we could also say something like four let's go conservative with that and now let's look at our rpm and sponsor rate all right so rpm stands for revenue per mile and this is pretty much telling you how much money you are making oh by the way all of this is in us dollars if i didn't state that per a thousand views on youtube so youtube obviously pays its content creators based on the amount of ads that run on their video and if they're in the partner program which means you have to have a thousand subscribers and at least i think it's like 12 000 watch time hours in the past year anyways revenue per mile is after this figure is after youtube takes its 45 cut from your gross ad revenue so let's say i made 20 grand in ad revenue on youtube my gross ad revenue that's like what i made in total i would only keep about 11 000 of that because youtube takes 45 percent of all of the ad revenue so this rpm value is telling you how much you're actually going to get to keep pretty much it's after youtube takes its cut anyways the average rpm for a tech channel something in my sector i can't tell you what mine is but it's something close like 350 to 4. so i'll put 350 inside of there all right so moving on to sponsor rate this number here is how much you charge per 1000 views on a sponsored video now usually you negotiate this number beforehand and you actually will charge a flat rate for a sponsored video regardless of how many views it gets but you will take this average video views and multiply it by your sponsor rate then divide it by a thousand to figure out what the actual thing is going to be and well that will tell you how much you should charge for a sponsored video so you'll see how it works in one second but this number is highly dependent on what type of channel you are so if you are a general entertainment channel imagine you're like a gaming channel then your sponsorship rate is going to be a lot lower than something like my channel would be or something like makeup or beauty or cars anything that's more specific the reason for this is that the more specific or niche your channel is the easier it is to target as a marketer as an advertiser a specific customer right like if i'm advertising something tech on my channel chances are you know 95 percent of people that watch my video are into tech so i have to charge more for that because i'm actually having the advertiser target more people in tech than they would if they say got 75 000 views on some random entertainment channel hopefully that makes sense but the more niche the more specific your audience is which means the more you charge for sponsors because it's easier for an advertiser to target a specific customer hopefully that makes sense but anyways the average sponsorship rate again i can't tell you what mine is but for a tech channel would probably be between 40 and 50 dollars so this means you're charging about 50 bucks for a thousand views and you can break that down you know per person watching the video and do the math and all of that but anyways i'm going to put 50 here so once i put all of this in we can go over and look at the youtube revenue and this will tell you approximately how much a channel with these figures or these statistics would actually make of course you can modify these statistics i'll leave the sheet down below to do that but in ad revenue this says are going to make about 14 000 you can take your 4 million monthly views multiply that by your rpm so obviously you have to divide by a thousand then multiply by that number and what you get 14 000 you can see that's a calculation i'm doing right here so that gives you a monthly revenue of 14k us and a yearly revenue of 168 000 then we look at sponsorships we say okay you're doing four sponsored videos per month you're averaging 75 000 views on those sponsored videos and you're charging 50 per estimated a thousand views so if they did that they would be charging i guess what's the math there about thirty five hundred dollars or yeah a little bit over thirty five hundred dollars per sponsored video uh which sounds pretty reasonable to me and that gives them about fifteen thousand dollars a month if they do four sponsored videos a month making up a hundred and eighty thousand dollars a year a lot of money next course sales so this is a number i just hard coded that they were gonna sell about a thousand dollars of courses a month now keep in mind a lot of people are selling way more than this right you might make this number something like 10 000 a month or maybe at 800 000 subscribers something like 30 000 a month depending on how much your course is so i decided to go really conservative and just say that they're selling you know a thousand dollars worth of paid courses per month and that would give them 12 grand next merchandise i know personally for me i don't sell very much merchandise so i just put this at 500 bucks a month that would still give you six grand a year in merchandise sales again you can make that higher next affiliate sales now we'll leave this zero for right now because uh i don't really do affiliate links and well let's just assume this channel doesn't do it either and then i have this other section where you could just put in some other amount you're making per month maybe say something like donations you know 100 bucks a month right so there you go that gives you thirty thousand six hundred dollars a month in gross revenue and then that leads to three hundred and sixty seven thousand dollars a year so it's pretty easy when you look at this kind of breakdown and there's of course other revenue streams you could uh pursue as well to see how you would make a lot of money on youtube with a channel of a size of about eight hundred thousand now i would be willing to bet that most people that have a channel size of 800 000 if they know business well enough and they're like you know doing a lot of sponsors maybe more than four a month are making a lot more than 367 000 a year but that is how much you can make with the channel like this assuming these kind of figures and all the assumptions that i've made of course you could also make a lot less really depends and this average views per video you can see really drastically will change how much you're going to generate based on the sponsorship value you're going to get or how much you're going to charge for a sponsorship okay so now i'll quickly run you through the expenses i don't want to spend too much time on this but pretty much we have expenses like editing or graphic design thumbnails video editing accounting fees if you're making this kind of money you probably pay an accountant to do your books for you you might not but either way i threw that in here just to give you an idea equipment yearly expense of about 15 grand this is somewhat misleading because you wouldn't necessarily expense this entire amount because equipment is technically an asset to the business but anyways we'll just put that there for simplicity sake software subscriptions 200 bucks a month adobe creative cloud stuff like that website hosting straightforward phone canada we pay ridiculous phone bills so mine's like 100 bucks a month anyways that's the expenses let's move over to corporate net income and net income looking at corporate net income your yearly revenue is 367 000 your yearly expenses are 45 000 that leaves you with a net income before taxes in your corporation assuming you're running the business as a corporation of three hundred and twenty one thousand dollars now in canada if we come down to net income after tax the corporate tax rate for anyone who makes less than eight hundred thousand dollars a year is twelve and a half percent i might be slightly wrong on that it might be half million dollars a year but either way the corporate tax rate for most small businesses is 12 and a half percent if they're like very small businesses so if we have a look at that you can see that you're going to pay about 40 000 in corporate tax now for anyone that's confused here there's a lot of there's a big difference between how much you make in a company and how much you make personally right the company could generate a million dollars but you might only get paid from that company like 200 grand right you might have a ton of expenses that means that your company at the end of the year really only netted really only gained like 200 grand or whatever it may be so what i'm trying to show here is that the corporation is different from the individual so my corporation making money is different than me making money because i have to decide as the ceo of the corporation how much i'm going to pay myself at the end of the year i could pay myself the entire net income of the corporation or i could pay myself portions of that now this has to do with tax planning and a bunch of more advanced stuff but anyways the corporate tax rate is 12 and a half percent so if you have a look at this the corporate net income after tax is about 281 000 so that would be in u.s dollars i don't know what the corporate tax rate is in u.s it's probably lower than it is in canada it's kind of weird because i'm using us dollars and canadian tax brackets but anyways you get the idea so corporate tax rate 12 and a half percent and then the personal tax rate in canada it's extremely high it's actually probably higher than this i put it at 41 so if you have in your corporation 281 thousand dollars and you decide to pay yourself all of that money from the corporation you're going to pay about 115 000 in tax at least in ontario where i live and that's going to bring you after tax to about 165 000 so i just included this here for anyone who cares to know kind of how the tax works uh and this is a reason since this personal tax rate is so high well you may not actually pay yourself the entire amount or the yeah i guess the entire net income that you have in the corporation you could theoretically pay yourself less you could say invest money in the corporation and then just over years slowly pay yourself more money out of the corporations that you keep your personal tax rate lower because obviously your tax rate is based on how much money you make per year so anyways that gives you an idea of how much a youtuber could generate with a channel size of eight hundred thousand and with that i am going to conclude this video so full disclosure i am not a business expert a lot of you probably will think that i'm just an absolute rookie when it comes to doing this kind of stuff and well i would probably agree with you this is simply the knowledge that i have i wanted to share with you guys and give you an idea of how much money youtubers are really making so to draw the conclusion here youtubers that are running large channels can definitely make much more than they would be if they were working as a software engineer especially considering the fact that youtube channels grow and get larger as time goes on so keep that in mind but i hope you found this video insightful and informative if you did please leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another youtube video
