notes here to read here uh has a mission technology for mankind kindness for the world inspiration ahe all these projects you're about to see here were submitted in kind of like a a previous competition or like a previous round there was almost 700 proposals and these are the top five projects from the following three regions we have Boston in the USA we have shenzen China we have Bangkok Thailand these are the best projects the top five from each so we have 15 in total and they're competing here today to win up to $50,000 in Grants the opportunity to network connect with some top Oppo professionals um people to raise investment Etc I'm going to be kind of ranking these projects so I'm going to be giving my personal opinion on them impact presentation how good they are Etc going to be a really interesting stream I'm going to sit back for most of it we're just going to watch again I'm live in Singapore there's a huge Stadium over there where they're kind of doing all the

please allow me to introduce director of Industry Innovation at gsma fisel Zia to those of you guys in the live chat I'll talk more about this let's listen to the Asia investment at tamask International Cassie woo General partner at eight roads of Del International Shan Shan director of xote Freda Jung next we have our expert judges from opo head of opo research institute Jason Leo vice president head of finance and investment at opo Vivan Chu technical director at opal Health lab Timothy Wht looks like a good guy his name is last but not least we have head of investment department at opal Sophia Chow let's give a big round of applause for all our wonderful judges again they do have a hard time today I'm going to be PR to be joined by our media friends who will vote for today's media Choice Awards from all our 15 proposals so now ladies and gentlemen I would like to invite head of Oppo Research Institute Mr Jason Leo on stage for his opening remarks and to kick off our final challenge Mr Le please for any of you guys just joining there's going to be a bunch of tech projects that they're going to go through here okay going to be 15 proposals it's going to be about 10 minutes each it's you know professional presentation and they're going to talk to you about a ton of really Innovative Tech projects that they are proposing to essentially like change the world change the planet Etc we'll let this guy talk and tell you about it ladies and gentlemen good afternoon I'm Jason from Oppo it is my great pleasure to be here with you today welcome to the global final demo event of 2023 Oppo inspiration challenge we launched the first opo inspiration challenge in 2022 with the idea of virtuous Innovation and I would like to share the story of one winning proposal from last year's inspiration challenge Tangen diabetics digital solution this is the second year by the way after the competition our wearable devices team organized a work group to assist tanen in integrating their blood glucose monitoring app into op Watch series following the collaboration the app can now be used in the opo watch in the latest opal watch 4 Pro which I'm wearing today there is a customized widget that enables diabetic patients to monitor their blood glucose level level in real time it is also displayed in our demo area so feel free that earlier it's pretty cool during the break in 2023 we continue our journey on empowering Tech professionals and innovators worldwide we believe that we can innovate and bring value to the world together with innovators like you improving health and the environment are the shared goals of everyone on this planet so the 2023 inspiration challenge focuses on the two ENT categories of inspiration for people and inspiration for the planet calling for proposals exploring accessible technology digital health and sustainability we received an overwhelming response globally with a total of 687 Innovative coming from 66 countries and regions following a thorough evaluation process the top five solution in each region 15 startups in total were selected from three Regional challenges in Boston sunzen and Bangkok to guys all these startups are trying to win some money here too to compete recognition for the top five winners today the inspiration challenge is not a solo effort from opo it is the platform that connects relevant professionals to bring the benefit of technology to every corner of the world so so here I want to show my great gratitude to our partners this year including qualcom Technologies gsma 5G Innovation and Investment Group Amazon web services and Linkedin together we hope to empower technology professionals and entrepreneurs worldwide to bring their innovative solutions the first presentation will be in line minutes let's give the stage to our final competing teams best of luck to all of you thank you so much Jason going be 15 presentations here okay there only be like 10 minutes those will be the more exciting ones just got to get through all the information so you guys know what the heck you're actually watching here yes and I do believe The Virtuous Innovation and technology is the bright future that all of us are looking forward to so ladies and gentlemen today's Final challenge will offici ially begin as mentioned we have 15 proposals today each pitch will last for 9 minutes with 6 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for Q&A so teams please do manage your time wisely and accordingly the jury will score based on the following four criteria feasibility Innovation and originality longterm potential and social value so let's welcome our first team today hey anap intelligent technology Cod limited from China and their proposal anap haptic solution okay guys I actually messed with this one earlier this is really cool they're going to show you in the presentation but essentially it allows you to feel like all the audio so people that have like visual impairment can actually experience like games this is Jamie I'm the cofounder and CEO from anap and we are a small but cool company focusing on the heptic technology so today I will make a brief introduction of ourself anap was established in 2021 by three heptic experts and me our professors comes from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and bang University we have received the seed run investment from miracle and an angel run investment from seoa capital and City University of Hong Kong 2. million set of products actually we have a very complete ability of products of hatic capabilities which actually contains our hardware and software Solutions our Hardware products are the L Motors and haptic chipset so we can we have the fastest motor development R&D Technologies and for the software ourself developed uh developed heptic algorithm andin AI can generate heptic effects on smartphone controllers and every smart surfaces we use in daily life and we also have reduced the delay time into within uh less than 1 millisecond and which is a world living level so how can our products be integrated with the user experience so uh on the smart devices we can provide this kind of using on every smart devices surface we can provide a layer system heptic SDK which can gener generate all the haptic effects simultaneously and as all the As for the entertainment activities on phones we can perform the corresponding environmental materials for the users and th they we think the thing is much authentic show you some cases we have cooperated with some of our customers for this brand this is ail it is a word famous Windows game conso on each i product we provide the htic chipsets for their products so hundreds of games on I news product will have the heptic effect real timely without any human customized work and in every uh generation of products I has released this function has been the most popular feature and the game players call it the magic haptic I can agree I use this it's so cool you can't really see it from the presentation the top one VR brand in Chinese market so the haptic effects will performed on the two controllers so that the users can control it much more accurately and it can also improve the user experience and the next two scenarios are man focused on fun use so as I mentioned before we have a complete capability of hetic Designing and the product abilities so we have been the main and only product vendor for the world's largest two luxury groups they are every image and the current group we provide the effect for their branding advertisement videos and also we Pro provide some solutions from the marketing and htic interactive point of view such as um for example we have detected a solution named the hotbeat so we can let users to detect their hotbeat on their phone and our AI will transfer the data into a real touch in less than 1 millisecond so in addition to a necklace or a back you can also send your your heart your real heart to the person who you love and uh gu has released this solution in this year's Valentine's Day and FY we will do it in the coming Christmas D so for the gaming use on mobile uh this is a very famous IP in China named the D BG this is a aigc game with uh launched with much attention from The Game Plan players and we provide some tools haptic effect for its uh gaming and the users can play it on their phone a haptic feature has helped these game to increase their da by more than 30% daily active users so it's a very surprised data so um as we have found when we adapted haptic with the content user experience are highly improved so in addition I can agree I was using it it's honestly unbelievable experience as we know haptic is a sensory it's a sensory interactive channels so we can also help our customers to make connection with their end users more accurately and more quickly so finally it will contribute to sales growth and for opo we have special cooperation proposals since opo has a very strong and Complete product ecology so we are developing the haptic SDK with structure of the system for Apple phones and the smart pencils and also wearable scenarios and looking we also working with elos health lab to find the research of the linkage between the heptic and mental health so we all want to create a more comfortable peaceful and safely Digital Life for all op users and in the past year we have quickly acquired many high high quality customers uh the logos here are some of our customers who have really signed the contract with us so uh it's fun as you can see there you guys start in 2020 by the way pretty impressive they have these already so uh this is some my uh contact information please feel free to contact us and also today we bring some uh products and demos here so you can have a try and welcome to our exhibition corner and communicate later thank you very much thank you an intelligent technology Wonder use it was doing with the v head minutes 41 seconds it's it's crazy like you can feel everything that's happening even when they play uh like on your phone with no additional sensors or anything it's just like a way better haptic than what you normally have so they were showing me like a video on the phone of an R8 and it was it felt like it was in the car quick question on social values ESG ele I just wanted to kind of quiet turn B more to that uh yeah that actually it's a very good question and that's what the work we are doing trying to doing now uh as we know some disabled uh people do not have the hearing ability or they can they couldn't see the scenes very clearly so talking kind of users haptic will be a very sens uh very uh very unique channel for them to know what the environment they are in and what uh some what's the things they are touching with so we can provide the environmental materials such as uh what is a metal what is a plastic and so on to uh let this kind of users to know uh whether they are safely or not so that's a a kind of use and we are doing this kind of products I don't know how they do that with the AI guys but it literally like I did the VR headset the controller the phone it to drive the haptics you have the chipset and you also have the AI to automate the various types of hatic interactions um of those what is your strategic advantage and this which of those Technologies are these companies most interested yeah that's really good question as we know uh the motor is a metal metal thing and the uh heptic is a sensory of about human self so what's the linkage between these two things that's a very good question and before that nobody knows the secret of them and we have uh my team has more than 20 years of haptic research so we totally know the receptors along uh beneath our skin and we also know the linkage between the motor and our haptic so uh uh just to answer your question that we know the secret of haptic itself thank you these guys are they already raised this series a by the way atic or data mode around the business yeah uh actually we just launched our SDK product in last year so as you can see we customers last year from the luxury regions and also we are trying to expand this kind of ability to the smart devices and other scenarios uh contains with the electricity vehicles thank you so much team for your fantastic presentation judges please score our first proposal and that haptic solution meet your friends in our audience you can also vote via the link we shared with you earlier on for media choice award thank you I think I muted the stream audio accidentally guys next up please welcome our second team Hawaii medical Technologies cor Limited from China and their proposal contactless Health monitoring technology so guys once we get a break I'll kind of tell you my rankings for these teams this one I'm a little biased cuz I actually used their demo and it was really really cool this one I don't know as much about I'm going to flip to my notes here let's see what we can find on contact here everyone is my great pleasure to be here to share some of our wonderful Technologies today and I'm from shinen Hawaii Medical techn and we F on the next generation of Health sensoring technology here we use the word sensoring because we develop the hardware of sensor as well as the software and algorithm of sensing technology and here we are new startup for about only two years and we did three things in these two years first we established a co team from different background from financing to research engineering and operation and second we have finished our first generation technology and product development and applied several P patent and third we have cooperated with a lot of leading comp leading companies and Research Institute and University and Hospital in China and as we know there's a lot of people we should take care of every day for example the elderly people as we know uh it's about one3 of the ELD people have at least once for at home for at home yeah that's a big problem nobody knows and secondly is uh child we should take care of the child because as we know there are about more than .1% uh infant suffering from the suddenly death in North America and oh wow I know that fact there are some parameters such as the bra stre the C cardiac parameters and maybe the movement can show the abnormity in advance IND there no way to detect that and for another example the clinical clinical and postclinical patients they should monitor their health condition day by day time by time but so far there is no suitable method for example the medical devices too complex and the variable is not comfort and the compliance you're not going to get have variable there and we have provided a solution for the problem we use the millimeter wave R to detect the posture the position the movement and even very tetiny signal from the user the hot beat the Brae and maybe other signal in SLE qualtity and with as we know the mm wave read originally used by the military and recently used by the auto automobile industry and it's a big problem to use this technology to the home home scenarios because this compan raised 100 million object and with a huge movement so we proposed Technology Series we caed one track to solve the problem uh we developed the technology from the front and front end such as antenna design and to the detto pro detto signal processing and to the AI modeling and for example the antenna design technology of our company is totally different from the current commercialized method and therefore we can lower the cost and increase the performance and currently we have do a lot of clinical trials and our result uh our product result is as well as even better than the health watch and that's why there is so much money clinicaly is the first one in the world have proved the possibility to use the radar to detect the uh the cardiac AR Aria wow the the the the the parameters and we have learned our first generation product together with the least company in China ha and we are Co branding and this product is really uh user friendly and we have a lot of Clinic trial and to Pro uh to to uh make sure the Precision is very high compared with the clinical devices and you can see this our product very small and pretty and you can just put it on the wall and go to sleep it's untouched and can detect a lot of parameters your your life and as well as as well we want to we have to make sure it's hes and we have to make sure it privacy data security so we have get a certification of the fccc and our company have passed the uh Glo the international uh quality control system ISO several ISO system for the medical devices research and sale and some ISO standard for the data privacy and this is our partner on the for the business and research for example the the the Kon in we have launched the cobranding product and we now together with opo to do the clinical trials in uh sever disease and of course there are s some other partners and here is our co co team members and you can see is from the top the leading universities in China and from different background uh from the bank of the communication Shanghai Bank of communication for the financing and myself is a professor originally in chinai University and major on biomedical engineering and we these guys have FCC approval guys not FDA what it said you know is a expert in the AI field and here is our plan for our products currently we have uh launched the first two and next year we will launch our R together with the camera to monitor the infant the baby and then we will launch another one to monitor more than one person uh simultaneously and current we uh put our Rita and the watch and MOB phone of opo together to the hospital we have get about more than uh really 1,000 dat set and and we know the trend the the technology Trend the 6G and short dist distance uh date communication is the train for future and the minim wave is very similar to the the the the technology above so we want to integrate our intellect perception method together with that technology and maybe more options with opo so uh we have closed two round of our uh financing and about $4 million and with evaluation about $2 million what okay that's not what it says in my notes guys all right I guess that was incorrect team now you have one a lot of money to raise seconds for Q and A what what does that say that here total value of previous funding okay maybe that was meant to be 1.5 million I don't know what it's I have to install um the Hardware in every room or I only need to install one Hardware in one home so that I can monitor all the people family uh in fact since uh the Privacy reason and other technology reasons the mm wave we cannot allow it through the wall because you may monitor your neighbors problem so currently we use we use our device to in one room one device okay and my second question is um uh would that be okay that the data or the warning would be um installed in our phone so that I can know my family's situation yeah if your family is uh sharing her uh his or her data to you because uh the the data Pro privacy issue um if he allowed you can see her data or she data that means I still have to have set app yeah yeah yeah app or in China we have the we chat function okay yeah interesting so what they're saying guys this is device that you just put in the room you don't need to weable or anything your techical barrier your algorithm or your uh the chip uh in fact except the chip we designed the antenna and algorithm and AI model except the cheap uh how about compared with the competitors the cost and the accurancy of your uh solution I think uh currently as I just mentioned we are the only one company can detect the very tetiny signal from the maybe the the cardiac signal we are the that's insane that they can do that this kind of you're not wearing anything you can detect the signal when you're in the room of this thank you to Hawai medical technologist for your fantastic proposal judges please score this proposal contact L Health monitoring technology media friends please reminded to vote via the link we shared with you earlier on from media Choice also thank you yeah someone's saying it could be like a security device and you monitor like babies and stuff yeah this really I want to learn more about that 6 minutes is not enough to explain like how these things actually work right but I mean that that is what it is guys really that one is so I like the haptic one cuz I actually used that that's really cool but I could totally see like how much better would that be to just have that in the room you don't have to wear like a watch or aand you don't even worry just there you don't even know it's there solution for smarton okay let's see this is a bit of a different type here not as Hightech more sustainability Focus let me see F these guys sythetic biology Company from China uh it's my great owner to participate in this great event and I would like like s OPP to provide this opportunity that all these great ideas could be demonstrated here to realizing the innovate for better work today the topic will proposed is an Innovative ecofriendly packaging solution for opo smartphone today our world is choking on plastic year huge amount of the plastic waste leaked into the environment especially to the ocean this is a big threat to the marine animals and uh actually it will take hundreds of years for it degradable and uh this will create the microplastics to it safety to the safety threat to the human race ourselves you can see this photo that when people found this sea turtle there's a plastic in it nose so this is all because of the conventional manufacturer is based on the petrol oil it cannot change the situation fundamentally since the plastic created there's already 9 billion tons of plastic uh created according to the oecd data there's only less than 10% recycled and uh there's reports indicate that the synthetic biology can provide a new path to the global carbon neutral and bluea is a company based on the synthetic biology which is probably the one of the hottest track in the past decade and the most attractive thing is that it can produce almost everything without p 300 million materal and molecular Innovation and we build our Advanced R platform owering product development today the our first pipeline product is bluea PHA it's a natural material it is based on biomass f stock and it has excellent biodegradability and the most amazing thing is that it has v variety properties similar as the plastic just as other uh natural materials from plant or from animal our pH product is from another natural creatures is from the microorganism it's just like the fat in the human body microbial created inside the cell this is a t uh T TM photos we took from the fermentation process you can see the pH grow from the cell in the beginning and full of the cell at the end and from the biobased dimension and biodegrad uh biodegradable Dimension pH is regarded as the most uh most biodegradable material to replace the conventional plastic and it also has some very good properties Like Oxygen humidity barrier and it also has the hydroxy stability and we can use this properties to create all kinds of the applications currently blue P has already achieved the international sta certificates on the ecofriendly and sa that's a pretty big deal for fing this experiment we took that used the sea water from shenen you can see the straws that we based on the BHA uh pH that it will degradate very quickly and also we have the very good shelf life look at the difference there guys on the right side that's there on the left side we attended the uh China Road Show inspiration challenge we proposed this idea to opal that uh we can provide a ecofriendly package but at that time we don't have the prop prototype the idea needs to turn ground so the opal ID team industry design team quickly get into touch with us and they provide their design they help us to design the package and we quickly made out this demo product and I I saw this in the demo area f it because we don't want to just provide a product we want to Pro provide a consumer good experience so actually feels really cool compared to like a normal plastic yeah yeah he's right that is what it feels like it was really cool to see that actually for blue pH material it aligns with the circular economy it is from nature and ends to the nature we did a a calculation on the carbon footprint versus the conventional plastic PS and even with uh paper so we can see that we can reduce huge amount of the carbon foodprint versus the current material all this is based on our technology and the core team our cofounders are from the top universities in China and the core team is fromal companies and Industry experts and we also have a very good platform we call it Sy OS just like color OS for opal and we can uh can uh realize the the string uh stren screening and uh to the product development High effectively and this is the plant we built in y you can see wind we can use the green electricity and this is the first phase is 5,000 uh tons per year and we have plans to extend to uh 75,000 tons per year in the next W these guys are growing fast but start 2016 and I believe that hand in hand with opal we can you know build a better planet and make this world I'm here guys in Singapore thank you thank you blue for anyone just tuning in I'm in like a live streaming room the event happening like outside it's like 200 met away so after this I'll go out and like see everyone but now I'm like just streaming the event my question is regarding the manufacturing process uh what kind of waste and uh byproduct would come from this process and uh how do you deal with it yeah actually thanks for your question and uh it's a fermentation process so the most important thing is that we could you know separate the pH with the microorganism and in this part that the waste water will created from the process so our top priority is to treat the Water waste waste water during the process and we have already buil a uh Waste Water treatment uh sub plant in in the area so we will use use this to treat the Water waste thank you that's the M waste that's impressive yeah guys that's pretty cool I was messing with this at the booth thank you for the presentation I have a quick question capital expenditure I saw you have the plan to more than 10x your current capacity uh 3 4 years so could you comment on that what's the cap needed and billions of dollars oh my God yeah actually currently the land has already provided by the government so we can utilize this land uh that's interesting help from advantage and also we have already accumulated some funding from from the in China so that we can uh leverage the the the the benefit of the capitals to build our further uh projects yeah so so government collaboration I guess that makes sense because it's super sustainable yeah there was $300 million wow you mentioned uh some customizability in the formulations often when you're working with polymer polymers you need low molecular weight monomers for plasticizers exactly what I'm was going to ask and those can leech out uh into the water uh do you need these additives or in your customization process can you achieve the different materials properties that you need yeah actually PHA is a family uh material and we use uh different uh we we scen out a particular micr to produce this uh material and uh uh actually this material currently is the uh the best material we found in in this family yeah but you don't need to add any additional monomers to your material to achieve the right properties uh mechanical properties Yes actually we can adjust the second monomer in the uh in the uh molecular to achieve different kind of uh the the harness or or other properties thank you all right I have no idea what that means guys that's a bit beyond my my biology knowledge but hi just a Qui sounds it good question uh in terms of the commercializing since um it was indicated that the company was established in 2016 so any track records that you may share with us so far the the commercialized right yes means um the previous um products um by using the key technologies that you mentioned in the presentation yeah actually just like you see on the video we have already made the straws that and also cies that fit for the you know Environmental Protection yeah those were interesting I was playing with them will be a big Market they feel a bit weird butt create more lifestyle to the consumer so if you go to our booth we create the fibers and also the 3D printing so that it could be leverage the material property to create more you know markets so this material they made it 3D printable and they have a bunch of like figurines and stuff theyd and they have like col boxes it was pretty I was pretty impressed how much stuff they actually were able to make the link so this one I think is like probably one of the more established companies that's here but I mean there R $300 million guys that's insane from 2016 they built their own plant um um yeah if if they get those government relationships like they say they have they can grow super quickly right fromy progam for preventing by the way the weather is hot oh my God it's like 30° and so humid here compared to Canada all right let me get my notes for this one online Therapy Program for preventing myo FAS sheld I'm not sure how you say that pain syndrome and chronic pain these guys are pre Ser A2 do you feel stiffness do you have neck and shoulder pain yes definitely oh my God you guys probably have that too problem call office syndrome hi my name is Ben from the tical team an accessible and efficient solution for curing office syndrome do you believe that in the next 20 year people could look like this with the rapid growth in technology our body can keep it's going to be me in like 5 years guys suffer from Office syndrome muscle issues it's lower the productivity and sleep problem chronic pain and burnout syndrome not only it caused the pain to our body but it caused 3,860 economic lost really what we do to fix the problem right now wonder how they measured that we use pills needle and massage but how much more time we need to do in order to be Kure it's non continuous can fall off and have high cost like sitting up straight time for everyone vertical is here to make curing effective and efficient by check and train track then motivate H if you want to prevent and relief you can first come to perform a flexibility test AI poster shck up then you will get a personal Live program just for you with a ergonomically designed animation and pce matching tricks and white description you can follow it if your eye are closed if you go to the clinic to see physiotherapist uh our our partner Clinic can scan the QR code you show to them and then send you a personal light plan to the phone this way you can help improve the treatment efficiency a lot we also have an HR solution starting from a training then use article to create a personaliz and trackable plan we also have a reward program to keep employee motivated then if the employee learning to trat we can connect them to our partner clinics oh so this is meant for like is not just system where we have partner like HR solution yeah see that um Fitness and hospital they can use ero with their customer safely that we can also recommend and personalize our partner product to our users we have a user in 59 count with around 500 user around the world mly active users okay 500 that's pretty low for now guys they're like brand new with around 8 to 10 minute of Engagement time we have post test with our users and they got better after using ero 91% we have Jo Thailand hrx this year and we won a mer award for pitching then got around 150 Prospect we have four main competive advantage first alra personalization we can personalize the stretch to any kind of activities and lifestyle because we have various kind of assets and is highly customizable in the pace and length second is safe is safe safety because our expert design it one by one yeah and we can use it safely then it's trackable it can be used as tracking to for the use for the experts then it can redeem a real life reward starting in Thailand when compared to our compor we are more complete in term of treatments the market size is calculated to be 820 million that's it a business model like this we do a premier model everyone can download and then we with the slides here PR with a B2B customer we're working with a partner like Fitness Clinic looks like they're charging 59 is that per month or per year I wish bring that slide back I want to see what for insurance we are working with them to create a sponsorship where we can use artical with the customer and they can access to their selfcare data our go to make a strategy we are trying to increase the user right now and then the partner and B2B customer will come yeah they need more users toate goal is to be an SD for tele medicine and healthare system to create a UniFi muscle care experience for everyone so they want to like integrate with a bunch other prods and a 10 goal of sdg we want to make sure that everyone including the visual impair have access to muscle selfcare do you know that there is 1 billion which impair user around the world but they cannot use Fitness video and fitness media to take care of their muscles oh so they can use article because we have P matching wi description they can follow it even if they can see weuse to re up Corporation we want to use an oper panel system to the ople system that create to create the connection in the internet of experience along with a device like ople oel and opo bands how imagine at this event you sit a lot you use your phone a lot then we can personalize the stretch for you we can personalize and shoulder stretch and lower back stretch to the smart widget on your oper phone and at they should do that they should have done like a demo here that would be cool U monitor the help result and then we can use that to improve the algorithm of personalization this way a can help improve the preventive care in the opo ecosystem here is the implementation plan we will first explore the Pano system and see which data we can use to recommend the stretch then we will try to launch kind of beta testing next year is is possible the journey forward if we got the 5K Grant we will accelerate the process of SDK development for healthcare and tele medicine we'll do CSR development to create a solution self caring for visually impair then we'll expand and raise an awareness of this condition to the world we have a strong team in both Business technical and healthc care specialist we are ready to make your muscle healthy thank you well thank you team that kind of fits with the tie backg think Mass you mentioned you have 500 monthly active users um can you share what is the most used feature on the app yeah def is the stretching so most of the users tend to stretch in the neck and shoulder because it's the muscle that is easily strained yeah look like everyone watching exercise yeah we have an ergonomically designed animation it's the pace is going to match let's say when you want to relieve your muscle you need to stretch at least 10 or 15 second if you stret like 3 second it's not going to release the muscle yeah so that's how it work right now just follow along with some video or some guided stretch okay interesting idea but mentioned that you're to exit by developing an SDK and integrating this into a larger infrastructure um wondering what is your strategic advantage against your competitor I guess it's not in the app itself or the this guy good questions but in the content or the way that you're delivering that content yeah yeah so um we start by um exploring like a tie traditional stretching techniques so we focus on Mak sense not like the stretch that you need to take a yoga M and take like an hour of stretch we focus on the stretch that can be integrated in your life when you sit when you go to the toilet when you work when you at your share so the thing that we try to do is try to make it personalize to you like you get the music personalize playlist we have a personaliz stretching list that you can incorporate into your daily life and make your body work with the Le less least amount of efficience I'm not really understanding how they personalize that too much you like go in person or something mentioned um AI algorithms as being a source of improving the solution where do you get your training data from from the initial outset I would say right now we use an open source to detect the post right now yeah but the way we recommend we still use the condition where it's on like we try on thousand of research to do which thing because right now I think to recommend the data we need to base on the will and meal reseearch to recommend which um exercise match with each muscle but the AI we use to detect the post and skeleton yeah interesting I don't think you really answered the question mention um your one of your business model is B2 B2 c will you be able to illustrate a little bit more for this B2B it's just a app or you will just combine together with some off uh SDK he's talking about with your partners or clinics Etc yeah so B2B we mainly focus on the HR solution when we go to do a training for the employees okay and then after they do a training each one of the employee have different condition we will okay this employee have a neck and shoulder problem this one have this this um person have a leg problem so each one going to have a personalized and trackable plan so that our expert who do a training can uh follow up and really make an efficient training to the company like would you guys want this let let me know in the chat if you guys would actually use something like this or not approach and B2B solution right now it seems interesting like if your company said give this you for free would you guys actually use this like day today I don't know I might try it but don't know seems tough like online app I'd like to know their uh retention rate on on people right 91% of people said improve how many kept that's probably the most important for something like this let me know what you guys think in the chat here if you guys have questions uh put them in here I'll answer them as much as I can for anyone just tuning in I'm in Singapore right now this is a live event next going to be one more have a small break for AI Inc Froman with the proposal easy speech easy speech all right let's hear this one these guys have raised 40K no 400k us they're in preseries a 2023 brand new startup 11 to 15 employees speech is one of the most important and fundamental skills for both individual large we express our feelings using words we defend our position using verbal communication we connect with people by speaking to them we remember the day when our kids said their first word there are over 100 million people worldwide with various speech disorders including kids with cerebal Psy autism Down syndrome adults during poststroke Rehabilitation and Parkinson and unfortunately and unfortunately there is a uh lack of speech therapist everywhere in the world waiting list is uh in US is three months Germany is six is crazy trying to find these even for free fees are not affordable for families from lowincome communities insurance if any all covers only limited number of sessions and there is also uh no personalization to the tratment uh both parents and therapist lacked objective data to uh monitor the programs and if let's face it it's um difficult for kids to do boring exercises so easy speech uh will uh uh eliminate waiting list uh and we will transform the therapy into fun games for kids we also equip uh therapist with a powerful tool to customize the treatment plan based on the robot robust data and reports and all this at affordable price available anywhere anytime easy speech like uh human therapists only dig take a look at the sample video and do the same it's guys to use it throughout the entire process move tongue lower assesses accur performance provides feedback and generates reports and recommendations there are a lot of speech apps on the market but all of them are limited to demonstration of exercises and maybe one US covers limited sound assessments whereas most or many of the uh Speech disorders require initially to develop oral motor apparatus and F motoric the only one which covers both oral motor and sound practices and we are the only one which assesses the accuracy of performance do personalization realtime feedback and uh data and Reporting we have developed our application for children with children with the speech therapist and their parents we also trained our neural network on the kids and adults of varied age ethnicity and gender to minimize bias assessment and uh furthermore we have a controllable I AI our algorithms are highly customizable specific face parameters and individual abilities our business model is B2 b2c we planed the we plan that the app will be distributed uh primarily through the speech centers and rehabs uh initially we were concentrated only on b2c but all Pilots we had confirm a strong interest from institutional users to use the app as inhouse simulator and a tool for remote patient and monitoring those very interest you prescrib this from your doors generated by the app speech therapist I guess they will the clinics will be able to increase the number of patient Serv uh which will increase their revenues but also it will decrease uh the operating expenses because we will save up to 25% of time currently spent on paperwork but at the same time introduction of hibrid method of treatment will decrease the cost to the patient by 40% because they need less treatment I guess that's interesting I wonder how much they charge for this 19 mimic exercises covering uh tongue lips Joe's and brows and a model with over 200 uh sound practices assessing sounds at the beginning middle and end of the world we have collected and labeled our unique database data sets and we have achieved Precision accuracy and recall rate in the range of 70 to 90 in the lab and in the pilots we have been conducted for year and a half in various speech centers and rehabs and we filed a Pon application and start initiated C Mark preparation uh once we complete GPR compliance which is hopefully going to be uh this October uh we're going to launch as a Fitness and Wellness application but the plan is to get certified as a medical um device and uh to sign the contract with uh corporate uh users in 2024 and in 2025 to get FDA approval to get to US market but ultimate goal to become a plat matching platform between the therapist and the patients okay that makes more sense to me best prct ice worldwide you go on there they collect your data and then they send you the appropriate spee one of them uh we believe and we are piloting our solution in several markets including us uh UK and Spain uh so the uh uh we can be we believe that we can achieve breaking within seven months after we hit active uh 400 active users what is their price per user there because the waiting list is ion of people we don't see any problem achieving that number our funding needs is uh $2 million primarily to do certification process and clinical trials to get to the you and we can greatly benefit with OPP hey guys uh do productization especially performance enhancements on their mobile uh for form as for strategy well uh self driving cars and cashierless stores are already there so imagine our product our application on uh your devices helping elderly people somewhere in the Care Facility or imagine a self uh uh self trining class in a school for kids with disability uh and your devices have you imagine well we already have they have that like an English class or something that could be interesting we can do something together with Oppo in China Asia and worldwide we are the global team with global Ambitions supported by Leading mentors from Healthcare institutions they're all over the place and Europe and we will be a great feed for Oppo nice that was interesting thank you so much and now you have two minutes for Q&A judges please I'm curious how well that actually works right like how effective is an app when you're trying to learn the real time feedback I think is the biggest Advantage i' say syy with OP products yes we believe that uh our app can be installed on the devices of op whether it's a tabs or mobile phones and that that can be implemented uh as a consumer product at home but also in the hospital rehabilitation centers um so that we we believe that there is something Oppo can uh definitely benefit uh as well I don't really see the Deep integration with Oppo here unless they just like sponsor them and and and help them grow right because it's just an app you can download on like any device City I mean just now you mentioned China is one of your biggest target market have you done any trial in China yet uh not not in China unfortunately we have done Africa Asia and um Europe us but not in China you said Asia but like what country um if that say um you are expanding in China will you consider to get a more international team to create uh versions of your uh different languages uh oh that's a good point actually yeah they needed all the languages question the thing is with the oral motor we have two modules oral motor exercises which basically development of the tongue lips Jaws etc those uh are the same in every languages we've noticed whether it's Africa or us or Germany there's no we need to retrain the neural network to recognize uh Mandarin or languages in countries that's not an easy task okay uh version they have to retrain the whole model in another language I don't know if that's ideal had this Oppo uh competition in Bangkok we got a call from Bangkok uh they are interested as well in Thailand all right thank you so much Mila for AI Inc for your wonderful proposal that was interesting it's kind of all over the place for me easy spe and of like that is a huge huge issue I can remember like at elementary school kids going to like you know a little classroom to like work on their speech right not being able to pronounce so can you imagine being able to actually just do that from an app if that's actually effective and then if you need more then you go to a speech pathologist or whatever they said rather than paying for that up front when like a consultation could be like a few hundred I know in Canada like people spend thousands of dollars that so they I don't know if they said how much their app cost though I would like to see how much the price is if it's one time fee if it's a subscription what their pricing model is paper batteries this is solution safer more sustainable and cost efficient future when it comes to Battery tech but before I get into that I want to tell you why we need them this cuz have zero funding so far boing and that's only a 2% decrease in the past 20 years 2% that has been converted into green energy now when we think about green energy we often you know think about solar panels windmills and so on but what we often don't realize is the infrastructure that's required to enable that switch to Green energy and a huge part of that infrastructure is batteries but here's the catch the batteries that we currently use and the metals that we use in them are not only toxic but very scarse as well so if you run the numbers H is recycling initiatives while they're Noble are nothing but a shortterm BandAid solution so if you really want that 2% to become 20 or even 50% in the future given how material intensive our current battery Tech is we are never getting there so a dream of a Greener future demands Greener batteries and that's precisely where Flint's paper batteries come in now I want to he this sounds cool all batteries are rechargeable and they work pretty much the same same way as traditional batteries do but what we have done is to use different materials we have come up with what we call hydrogen reinforced cellulose paper and utilize zinc and manganese as the two sides of the battery and thanks to our proprietary Tech and knowledge we have unlocked three new features that you have never seen before in any other Battery tech all right this got me excited our batteries are fully compostable now okay let's give this a moment while this doesn't have paper batteries that's probably why it's not working that well that's funny it needs a flint battery and this is not clicking can I have some help with this okay there it goes so these are all batteries that are fully compostable which means at the end of its life cycle you could throw it away into the soil and within a month it would completely degrade and really that's not to say that we want everyone to start throwing our batteries around but it does make it a whole lot easier and cheaper to recycle them and that reduces the environmental impact significantly now paper that's something that you guys have in your hands right now you know how light and flexible it is and this gives our batteries its adaptive design and just to prove our point we have designed our batteries in the shape of the Singapore M emblem as well now our batteries can be bent while it's functional without affecting its performance or causing any kind safety hazard and when we talk about hazards like in terms of where you could actually put that moves around the battery we went one step further to show you how safe our batteries are by cutting them while it's an operation and it didn't overheat imagine doing with a real battery to work corrosive normal it's not real battery other type batter all we have to do because of this adaptive design is to build our batteries in the required shape and size and stack them up and you would practically have a plug and place solution to replace any type of lithium batteries that are out there right now so you just layer them because of how production friendly our batteries are in order to make them we don't have to reinvent the wheel we can use existing manufacturing processes and equipment to make this possible and the best part is given how abundant the raw materials that we use are the cost of making our batteries is 10 times cheaper than traditional batteries wow now that's a huge game changer because think about it if you going to put our battery on a 2X two Matrix against other Battery tech you'd realize that not only is ours one of the most sustainable but also one of the most cost efficient options that are out there and that makes us the most practical solution in the market I'm curious how many you actually need though to get the same power output's see if and using industry standard metric this is how our batteries perform today volumetric how expect it energy density and we start toize it and build this in scale now you have to that we're not just comparing here we're pioneering but given the current performance of our batteries we decided to come up with three specialized versions of paper batteries for a focused area of application so that we can either match or outperform lithium batteries in these areas so when it comes to cost and safety we're already much further ahead and when we want to increase the capacity within a limited volume we can use paper batteries in energy storage systems we're working together with Collinson power is one of Singapore's largest energy storage system providers to make this happen now when we want to reduce the weight and the volume you can start to see paper batteries in your everyday consumer products your your phones your wearables and remote senses working together with Technics company to replace the batteries in the remote sensors for explosives now those are tiny batteries when we try to increase the capacity but decrease the weight at the same time and you finally have the dream of having green batteries in your EVS so one day you could be driving an EV that's not only cheaper but safer and a whole lot more sustainable now the team that's build all the team that's building this has over 30 years of management experience and expertise in areas like Material Science mechanical design Advanced physics among others and we are being supported by individuals from some of the top universities governmental organizations and even companies like shell backing us up and all this is because at Flint we want to be powering the future not just any future but a Greener future and to make this possible we want to work together with you now over the next 3 years our conservative Revenue estimate lies at about 160 million and that's expected to grow 20 times by 2030 as we explore into new markets out there so we want to invite you to join us on this transformative Journey as we're looking for partnership opportunities and collaborative designes so if you're ready to build that Greener future we have Fint and we're eager to connect with you thank you thank you that was that was that's one of the better presentations I think that they gave it was very clear I understand exactly what he means but I don't I want to see the size of a battery relevant to uh compared to a normal quick the several key parameters of the batteries including capacity uh charging speed yeah sure so let's say for a 1 by 1 cm size of battery paper battery that we have the voltage is about 1.5 to 2 volts and we're pushing that to three as you speak and the capacity that it has is about 35 milliamp so scale it up to about the battery that you saw in the video earlier I'm not sure if you recall but the one that was powering the fan that is about 350 milliamp of capacity it's pretty one thin slice of paper battery I want to see like a side by side parameters do you have a road map of what kind of applications to go first and uh finally go to the EV right okay so the beach hit Market that we're targeting right now is 18650 battery Beach hit Market that we're targeting right now is 18650 batteries because based on the current performance of our batteries we feel that that's the best way to go forward and we're working together with Collins and powers to bring paper batteries into energy storage systems so backup generators for buildings that's the first Beach hit that makes s we don't have a huge size speak in 2024 when we move forward to the pilot production stage now that we're done with R&D what is going to happen is that we are opening up to a lot of companies like opo and all these other companies that I mentioned earlier we're opening up to them to see how we can bring paper batteries into these various products and if we see value and a lot of demand in that particular sector we would move forward there as well interesting thank you think it seems really I I just want to see the size of it because I don't know if it actually would fit in like a smartphone that's a very good question so lithium batteries over 2,000 life cycles so that's about like six years of using that battery right let's say in your phone or any other use case over 2,000 life cycles the efficiency drops down to about 70% our batteries over 1,000 life cycles because it takes a long time to test these out has dropped to only 80% so in terms of efficiency and life cycle we're slightly on the lower end but as we move to its commercialization these numbers are going to improve significantly so it's worse from that but not by a lot so much Flint for your wonderful proposal judges please score that was pretty good guys I like that one I think it was a good presentation but again I just they're so new they don't really have enough information to to say like how impactful the battery can actually be if you could put that in an EV that'd be huge right cuz I'm not sure if you guys have seen the impact of actually making like a battery that goes into the EV is it pretty much completely diminishes the whole point of having an EV actually make that type battery nonsurgical hearing aid nonsurgical hearing aid they they do have a real sample guys they have one in the uh the demo area but I don't know if they have time to do that on stage so I did see it but it's kind of hard right we have a little slight like it's not very visual to actually tell uh how good it is but that was a good presentation all right who are we on now good afternoon everyone so today we are here to share the music of song We Are R and lexman from start he's got to move the mic up to his mouth there there you go children close to me close so this is a problem we are going to solve so you were not able to hear us for few seconds and you became worried imagine the millions of children who cannot be able to hear all their life so meet Mr Sund he was born without the ability to hear medically known as congenital hearing loss we call them severe and profound hearing loss so there's a lots of hearing devices available in the market like BTC devices ITC devices or bone conduction devices so those devices doesn't help him the only solution for a Sunder and millions of children like him around the world is Cocker implants so Cocker implants are fixed by the means of open skull surgery oh my but it has a many problems mainly it require a highrisk open skull surgery and it's very very expensive it can cost up to $115,000 per implant and it's very risky per implant during a surgery it even caus a brain infection nerve damage and even a facial sound like a reasonable solution the hearing a implantation the patient have to lead a restrictive lives like they cannot take an MRI they cannot use a smartphone they cannot do adventure sports and surgery is also ruled out after the age of eight so it is not a small problem globally 1.7 million childrens are born with a congenital hearing loss every year so for them we at backat creators have inverted the world's first nonsurgical hearing device for congenital hearing loss patients our product is called impulse so no more parents need to drill their children's SK for hearing we are completely 1100 USD is still pretty expensive hearing Los signicant there is no risk while using our product they can still take a life saving dnos service such as M at last our device is highly affordable able we are reduced the cost from over $115,000 to $1,00 still a lot but that's nonallergic silicon composite it can be easily removable without any surgical intervention so the Simplicity of our Technologies our biggest strength we are using a patented method of applying a electromagnetic stimulation where we are providing electromagnetic stimulation directly to the co COA is the inner ear organ so by providing that we are stimulating the sensory neurons of the ccka by doing that we are making them here without having any internal implantation surgeries these guys raised 125k by the way us they're 2021 providing our a continuous speech therapy to recognize the sounds that they are hearing for a first time so we have MVP ready we have successfully clinically piloted with 50 plus patients and we have a two International pattern for our earing a technology so our research work is also backed by a doctor Milan K highly awarded ENT surgeon of India who done a 3,000 plus implant surgeries by the way guys all the demos and stuff I'm going to show you some of them I'm making a video that I'm going post on the channel in a few days and you'll see some of the stuff like the demo area I'll show you over 30 million childrens required a hearing aid implant to treat their hearing loss so they can readily op our device non surgical one so here is our business model so these four primary stakeholders are going to be our potential resellers or a distributor Partners yeah stay tuned guys if you I have a travel Vlog coming on a few video days I'm share this yeah look at that wow can you imagine being like here for the first time that' be crazy yeah look at his eyes so you may notice the children said book from the bir he doesn't hear a single sound and also he doesn't speak while using our device for a first time from the book we Are enabled them to hear through our device and also on providing a continuous speech therapy to them we are also enable them to speak so here is our team we are Raman and lakman working on the product development for last 3 years holding multiple patterns in the hering a technology it's very impressive advisory team who over 50 plus years of a combined experience in Audiology Acoustics and medical device development so we are going to sell our product at the cost of $900 to a B2 b2c model that's a better price competitive landscape what is the alternate solution which is available in the market which is a implant it requires a highrisk open skull surgery so what value we are going to deliver to a patient is nonsurgical which suit for all ages with zero restriction at a very affordable cost so here is our Milestone and timeline for Regulatory and certification Pathways Q7 so here's a phot giving demonstration to head of wh when he visit she visited our testing lab so we would like to Leverage The strength of Oppo in manufacturing and distribution footprint in our target market so we sees there are four areas we can have a Synergy between Oppo and impulse devices mainly a sound quality our device work well in the silent zone so we wish to enhance the sound quality and hearing by a big computational Power that Oppo smartphone have with the conjunction of our device and affordability as Oppo positioning as a most affordable smartphone it's a perfect partner for us to provide a lowcost and affordable solution to a developing countries in Asia including India and we are reducing the hardware eliminating the need of additional Hardwares like a transmitters and tele coils by having our core key technology of BL integration with the smartphone and we are also providing a value addition features like Wireless connectivity noise reduction battery level management and calibration of a hearing devices through the Oppo smartphone I would like to see the battery on that strongly believes that together with Oppo smartphone and impulse device we can make a beautiful world for the childrens with the hearing disability and we are also achieving a STG goal three directly with this good health and wellbeing and indirectly a goal 4 8 10 with the empowering the individuals with hearing disability so we have our functional prototype which even we can you can feel the sound how the the children can able to sh without any I didn't check that in the demo I'm going to look at that after cuz I actually want to see what that's like oh he has it here thank you so much while you now have 1 minute 25 seconds for Q&A judges please oh I guess they're going to miss the demo there that's too bad hello guys you mentioned the clinical trials yes obviously as soon as you put the impulse uh sensor on there will be level of hearing but have you been able to track the level of hearing and the development of those patients and how long does it take to take them through the process these guys have good questiona it's really a good question so hearing and learning are a both a different thing so what clinical study which we have done is completely medically framed one which is called C method so CP is a method to assess whether they can able to hear the sound in a multiple levels so it is done for for the 2 months long duration with the multiple patient category so all these childrens doesn't get benefited through the traditional devices so they only suits for Implant but they can use our device and they can provide it with the speech therapy for 2 months post that they can able to hear the sound through our device and also they can discriminate those sounds through our device also post hearing sir okay that makes sense they can actually tell the difference between the sounds not like they just hear some random vibration right is the TMS technology suitable for uh all kinds of people with heing L or just certain types sir actually we are focusing only for severe and profund Sir so for the other types like a mild and moderate there's lots of hearing devices which is already available as you seen b the year devices buts like devices OTC devices un bone conduction devices are already available in the market to help thems but the this congenital hearing loss they only get treated with the implant that's the only ideal solution available across the world so we like to replace that with the nonsurgical sir so that's why we are only focusing on replacing this congenital hearing loss but still it can help the other patient also by doing some internal customization in a hardw I think hopefully he answer your question there who in the chat here talking about your brother backyard creators judges please I think the science is a bit more complicated than I can for you a link in the Des you can read the full proposals if you want more information on how it works that one was cool again it's it's hard to see the value when like I can hear right I don't know what it's like to to be deaf or to know someone like that but very interesting if it actually would allow someone to hear like a full sentence I get that you can hear noises pleas welcome but I'm curious if you can make out words if You' actually have legit communication they can move towards that this is massive especially in Asia where you can't like a $15,000 implant that's massive you sell something for like 600 $900 yeah Irving uh from the chat have a look at the the link in the description there there's some more information I think you could also probably just look up their their project we'll see but that's quite cool okay what are we on now what was the most Mo the disruptive electronic technology there you go that you guys witnessed in the last few years any guesses so by end of this presentation I'll convince you our technology wire fits the bill for such a let's look at the funding on these guys this one's kind of crazy 10 million usies to send High speeed data through human skin hi I'm perer I'm head of partnership for aana and let's talk about the magic of wi it's like a new WiFi protocol guys or I guess implementation I'm not sure if you uh sorry so if you think about um a technology that can increase the battery life of devices let's say headphone from 4 hours to 20 hours what will be the impact on the EWaste that batteries generate so our technology because it's 100 times more efficient than Bluetooth and WiFi can essentially achieve their target really how much usage does WiFi have our technology because it's more efficient can allow smaller form factor for the devices which actually reduces uh plastic waste also the technology because it's more efficient we can have devices that can be virtually charging free or in some cases they need smaller battery and that helps the environment and that is good for mother Earth now uh what is wire so you can think of it as um electronic analog of a nerve how we actually send the data from our brain to our different senses now if you think about a human body we have one processor and we have uh several senses but if you think about uh all the devices all around our uh physical system like Smartwatch you have a phone you have XR VR devices they all each have a processor there now they have multiple brains so why do we need that because the speed between the devices is currently slow and also it's not very power eff efficient however with our technology which is 100 times more efficient than Bluetooth and WiFi we can change that Paradigm and bring about distributed computing architecture that will make the size of those uh devices much much smaller wow now so what communicate with is a new communication technology that allows us to send data along any surface for example human skin really now imagine I have a headphone and and my friend who has a headphone also uh is listening to music through a streaming through let's say a smartphone if I I touch that person or I come near that now I can listen to the same music that is a science fiction and but this is there's no way that's anymore through our wire technology okay I need to try that I need reality hope I hope they have that in Demon this okay I'm going to check that out after guys I'm going to I'll post an Instagram story or something that's crazy if that actually works now if you think about how uh let's say I just like touch someone's hand you can hear the song they're listening to way head through Bluetooth I guess you have and so only very small amount of energy is actually being converted to send the data however our technology through yr chip we actually conf find the data around a bubble around our body which means we need very less amount of energy so intuitively you can think of why we are more efficient compared to WiFi and Bluetooth now this is not a chart this is an actual data test on our production chip our chip is already uh commercialized that gives 100 times more energy now think about it think about any field when was the last time you heard about 100 times Improvement in efficiency G almost never happens especially in technology so we launched our chip just nine months ago at CES in 2023 we received best NCS award wow right at that event couple million contract from some customers and till this date we have closed $7.5 Million worth of contracts in just last N9 months have a ton of sales for that smartphone companies device manufacturers in us and all around the world are either evaluating our technology or in the process of uh integrating into next generation of devices and we are fairly confident you'll see a device powered by our technology in 2024 I'm curious if that means you have to change a bunch of stuff from the develop perspective building a smart class hopefully not see that will increase the Barry Life For That device from 2 hours to 12 hours so that's a huge huge uh uh Barry uh bar love so uh this company has uh investment from Samsung uh Ro who actually brought the Bluetooth the market Market is also part of the investment team uh Tony Chi who invented Google Glass is also an investor holens team if which understand the problem with the weight and the heat associated with those XR and VR devices we can actually address those problems wow this one's cool guys it's probably one of my favorite ones so far this is a little what that demonstrates what is this communicate with touch let's see this guys if that actually works like that's crazy okay let me I need to try that after how that's so okay that's really cool that was a good marketing video they have there yeah thank you and if you have any questions please talk to us I have the demo there if you want to partner with us I would love to have a conversation with you guys thank you team you have can I touch you and you subscribe to my channel Jud uh yeah uh actually I have met you uh during the mwc oh okay yeah and uh my question is that how about the cost compared with the Bluetooth and WiFi this is a premium product it's more expensive giving 100 times performance schem so that's about to be expected thank you he didn't say the cost though but it's a lot more expensive interest um are these mostly from wearables from reducing borri perspective on how do you what are the sort of most use cases you're getting bount interest for at this point yeah I'll give you an example there's a medical company which is like they have this device for continuous glucose monitoring so they have to charge it for every three uh 3 days or 7 days something like that because our par consumption is so low we don't need charging for it anymore we can just stick in a small cell battery that'll just power it for a year so that just changes the game tremendously yeah no charging for gluc if you look at all the devices uh XR VR and those devices because we are doing the compute on those devices but if you can offload that compute to a smartphone which everybody carries the weight of the devices will go down the only reason it can be done is there's a highspeed connectivity in those devices and a smartphone so basically it's a distributed computing architecture that actually changes the game now for examp both the smartphone and the device need smart helmet uh they had a camera in the helmet and this was for industrial use case and they were wanting to run AI on the uh the on the vision the computer data that they were gathering through the uh camera but the weight of the helmet became twice the workers said we can't wear it because it's a giant battery you're carrying on a house when they used our technology we just only the weight increase by few grams so and also they don't have to have a uh very uh complex Electronics because it has just a camera and our board and rest of the processing is happening on a standard Android op phone for example so it just changes the game tremendously so that's why this is we feel it is one of the most disruptive technology and we believe that it's going to end up in your smartphones for next uh even if it is expensive that's still like if one smartphone has thank you for your fantastic presentation I am curious to see how much more expensive actually is lower energy y connect lower but how much more expensive and media friends please vote via the media Choice link thank you guys that's that's a cool one I really want to try that I want to see the like the music things I mean that's kind of more of a novelty right like you really need to do that no but um that's really really interesting I'll try to post something uh and at least I'm going to have a travel Vlog coming out soon I'll I'll put in that something about this presentation or some of the other ones some of other demos cuz there's quite a few really cool ones there I think we're going to break shortly um let's see what are we what are we on right now eight I have a whole schedule here so much teams and that was an invigorating morning of we have aak thanks to all our first eight teams so now it is time for a well earned break for everyone so we have te break for all of you outside please do enjoy them and return at 345 p.m. 345 p.m. sharp thank you so much and I'll see all of you later thank you okay guys so let's go to the chat now um let's talk about some of the presentations also I want to hear your comments if you guys have anything to say put it in the chat I'm going to be focusing on just reading chat and responding to that let me turn down the music actually it's not too loud I think that's fine if it's too loud guys let me know but yeah this is in Singapore guys I'm here right now uh like this is right outside I have a bunch of footage of it um I can't show you where I am cuz the camera is set up but it's right outside okay chat what are you guys saying uh I had a glucose monitor changeed my life is type one it'd be nice to have it just part of a smoke phone yeah I don't know if it'd be just part of a smartphone but I think the idea is that it'd be a lot lighter and you don't need to charge it anymore you imagine like you don't need to charge the monitor like it just works forever or for a year or two years and you just swap it the battery I think that's the big thing even the example he was talking about with the helmet there where like you don't need to have a 10 lb battery in your helmet you make it a few grams uh hi everyone just got home from work hi Tim hey guys thanks for tuning into the stream have any questions let me know um obviously this will be available on YouTube after for you guys to watch what do you think about the invention in Android phone industry in The Last 5 Years uh inventions it's crazy I mean Android is yeah I like dude just technology in general 5 years it it's been crazy the kind of stuff that we've seen think about it the internet wasn't even really around what 20 25 years ago and look what we have now hey Tim I want some project ideas for my college I wants to make something unique Innovative product development related to software Ai and ml we keep watching this then because you've already seen all the Innovative stuff they have obviously you're not going to be able to do something to this level I mean these are startups with expert level teams PhD doctorates you know sometimes in one case $300 million in funding um yeah I don't know what you would want to do for AI and ml there's a lot of cool computer vision stuff I really like doing the visual type of applications even hence you've seen some of these presentations like the visually captivating ones are always interesting do I work for Oppo no I've just partnered with them they actually brought me here to Singapore I've been working with the team uh to live stream this event I'm going to be here tomorrow as well they're releasing a new smartphone I don't know how much I can share about that but I'm going to have a video out soon that's going to share my whole kind of travel journey to Singapore it's my first time in Asia here and um yeah you guys are going to see the real Tim traveling around not just sitting at an office this has been such a cool opportunity though and then obviously this event is sweet get to meet all these people here and I'm like the little celebrity in in the live stream room which is funny uh what else you guys say here well many monitors I use after week I'm not sure the difference I guess I missed most of that presentation yeah so these monitors uh in terms of the battery life it's saying I don't know I think it's like the plugin thing just the actual monitoring I don't know chip you don't need to charge anymore is what they're saying I'm just hearing of Oppo Oppo is a massive smartphone brand in Asia guys it's not really big in US and Canada I think they have some subsidiary companies that they own but it's not uh it's not so big over there but in Asia this is massive I mean like what they gave me like a little Oppo like tablet type thing here that I've been using to read some of the live chat and it's a pretty affordable brand from what I've been able to tell and uh they have this cool like kind of fold phone and again I don't know how much I can talk with that so be careful but yeah uh the gaming industry is booming all the world I have gears for racing use Python s cheaper okay I'm not sure what you're saying there what else have you guys asked hey guys let me know what you think of this so far kind of you know a new thing for the channel but this has been really fun just to sit back and just comment on these how to Vision a plan for college project research so I won't waste time I think you have to validate an idea right I think a lot of these companies what they've done well is that they actually have a bunch of users people that are actually interested in their product and they very quickly validate what do they want what do they not want rather than building something or working on something that no one wants you got to figure out very quickly does someone actually want this this has been really interesting yeah I think so as well again a new thing on the channel but I hope you guys are enjoying it we've got another seven seven presentations seven or eight presentations after the break some more really interesting ones um that are coming up so far I'll say like the coolest one for me is still that haptic one guys the demo is just honestly it was really impressive cuz I thought it was going to be a new type of sensor like a proprietary controller but it's not like it's the same Tech that you guys have right now in your pocket but it feels immersive like it's almost like they just threw in like a subwoofer in a surround sound system and I feel like I can experience the audio uh they gave me a VR headset and they gave me like a controller and on a screen it was like this what do you call it like a bunch of cars for example and you can feel the gear change you can feel um all the revs really cool someone's from crotia here nice man uh how can I solo project to all over the world I don't know what you mean there when will we have a generative AI for 3D modeling so there's actually a 3D project coming up a really cool camera kind of 3D project let me see I have a little notes thing here I'll read through some of them 3D interactive platform haptic Solutions we already saw that one biobased solutions for flexible Electronics contactless Health monitoring ecofriendly packaging for Oppo smartphones the online therapy easy speech Flint paper battery was another big one too they're super early but the that was interesting impulse nonsurgical hearing aid actually we've seen a lot of these how many more do we have I think we've already seen maybe 10 of them project eight yeah we've already seen eight oh no we've seen eight okay um mind mind lacks Health technology orbit Precision psychiatrics Psychiatry sorry at scale Sky light Define the Next Generation displays woa we got a bunch of cool ones coming up guys let's see what you're saying here uh what is your suggestion for a somewhat beginner student who also wants to do what they're doing like what language do I start learning in Concepts like from a development perspective it depends what you want to build I always say figure out what it is you actually want to make first and then pick the Technology based on that but as a beginner you might want to start out with something simple right Python and JavaScript is usually what I recommend I find nowadays there's more applications of Ja script python is still fantastic don't get me wrong but you might not be able to build as many visually captivating applications or full applications as you can with JavaScript so I usually recommend JavaScript uh what do you think about information Integrity how can we prevent fake news images by AI that's interesting I I've they don't have anything like that in this um presentation but it's tough right like how do you monitor AI generated content I don't know unfortunately I don't know I don't really have a strong opinion opinion on that I don't want to speak out of my expertise here have you ever done any data engineering data science projects a few I mean I I messed around with some like Co tracking projects and whatnot during uh you know during all that guys I like just like building stuff I like building games things you can interact with data modeling is is interesting to interact with but not necessarily to build it's a whole different skill set too right with all the data sence stuff just learn to research and read yourself yeah of course like you have to be you have to always critically think right don't believe what you see which is unfortunate but that's how it is do you know anything to uh to help LM be more reliable and truthful I actually post a video or I'm going to post one soon about something called rag retrieval augmented generation really interesting Tech that can essentially Define the source of where information is coming from so if you get an answer it can actually tell you this is why I came up with the answer this is where I got it from and then you can go back and validate that it's called rag uh stay tuned I'm going to post a video on that there next few weeks so llms that's a huge application essentially it allows you to inject realtime data or to provide the data source that a rag will or rag an llm will reason on website for rag just look it up it's being uh heavily invested in by like Amazon and like other big companies yeah retrieval augmented generation it's kind of a protocol more so than like a library but you can do it with something like Lang chain for example if you guys know what that is python Library JavaScript as well let's see well how much longer we have on the break here we got a few minutes left yeah looks like we got seven more coming up here 540 we should be back here in the next few minutes do you think Russ can replace C++ I don't know about replace maybe I think it will replace in some applications but not all right so much stuff is built in C++ like are you going to rewrite all of it and run rust probably not so you're still going to need C++ but for new applications embedded systems lowle Hardware I think rust is huge I do want to eventually continue that series guys but I don't know It's just tough to find time to film all those now that I'm doing a bunch of other stuff than YouTube what what has your guys' favorite presentation been let me know in the chat which one is most interesting to you I think everyone has a different perspective right which you think even is the most impactful guys hang around we're going to be on the other presentation soon just let me know in the chat what you guys are thinking what you're up to okay looks like we're head back here oh no everyone's drinking their tea no tea for Tim let me know in the chat guys what do you think which one's been the coolest which one would you want to see a demo of there's so many I can't fit them all in the video I'm going to post but I I'll show you some of the cooler ones ladies and gentlemen the final challenge of 2023 Oppo inspiration challenge will resume in 5 minutes time please prepare to take your seats and remember to put your phone on silent mode thank you for your cooperation I guess what we're here have any of you guys been to Singapore either let me know kind of a crazy country for can for Canadian like me the heat has been pretty wild but it's quite cool the the touching was crazy right yeah like touching and then you it transmits the signal so I guess it's like if I have a set of headphones or like they have a speaker and it just goes in between the device I don't know how that works though because how does the device just pick that up and connect to that they might have like a pretty specialized demo but if that just works like out to the Box be unbelievable Desa talking about course careers yeah you guys know I have a new software Dev course I won't talk about that too much in this live stream but you guys can check that out um tech.net deev you guys can see that course desan are you from course careers anyways the touching one which which one was uh which one was that that was the wire r one right yeah wire R 10 million USD 11 to 50 employees 2020 out of the United States got a bunch of phds on their team and they're selling mostly to manufacturers B2B uh AR headset 100 times lower energy they need to increase their production capacity yeah wi R yeah that's the big one was actually going through a module and someone told me to check out YouTube and I saw that you were live so I tapped here oh nice desan yeah sweet nice to see you here bring all your friends get everyone in the chat let me know what time it is for you guys too I know for me right now it's 344 p.m. in Singapore time obviously probably pretty early in the morning for most of you especially if you're from the West do you think Wireless power transer W3 can reach the Market within 10 years I don't know much about Wireless power trans I guess that is that what you're referring to 244 p.m. Dallas wait 244 p.m. do you mean am yeah am right okay yeah you guys are up early well thanks for tuning into the stream being with me here 945 a.m. Poland okay so first thing you do wake up watch Tech with Tim 245 p.m. Vietnam I'm going to Vietnam in a few days hoi men City let me know any recommendations you got why is there no Universal programming language to build everything if there is you can build it in assembly very low level but no one wants to do that and the straw the straw one guys let me find the exact name of that but that was the uh that was the $300 million one that what is that called I guess a biobased solution for flexible Electronics let me find the actual name of that no it's not in this one let me see here that one was yeah that smart resin I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right that's what they're calling it no wait no what I think I'm messing it up guys anyways you got the idea you can look at the proposals in the description I have them in the order spring rolls I'm going to try those thank you very much in fact let me take a photo of that so I remember to try those sweet thank you do you think back and in front engineering is dying out I feel like low code is already replacing it I wouldn't say so low code is like augmenting it helping it but I can tell you like sometimes it's faster just to build it without low code low code is a tool but you still need to know front and a back end to utilize it like the best people to use low code no front and a back end right just like the best people to use Chach BT no development already 846 a Nigeria welcome from Nigeria we actually have someone uh one of the Oppo community members from Nigeria his first time leaving Nigeria and he's here really cool Croatia 945 115 p.m. India okay so it's reasonable time for you guys makes sense a lot of you are not from the US anyone else I see a bunch of you guys in here make sure you like the stream by the way if you haven't done that already please give it a like we got 77 people here pretty early in the morning thank you guys for sticking around got the rest of the presentations I'm still curious which ones do you guys think are the most interesting Flint paper battery I think has some good potential too let's see what else did we look here easy speech like a lot of the app ones are really cool but it's hard to see the value when you don't struggle from the problem right the hearing one was really interesting too that was what impulse yeah nonsurgical hearing aids 347 p.m. Malaysia nice you're close to me man Malaysia that's the same time zone Singapore right on the edge of Malaysia there yeah crazy to be in Asia guys the flight was like 30 hours to get here oh my God definitely worth it though going to hang around uh for a bit longer ladies and gentlemen the final challenge of 20123 Oppo inspiration challenge will resume in 1 minute please your seats right now and remember to put your phone on silent mode thank you for your cooperation any last minute questions anything you guys want to say punch it in now I think we might have another small break I'm not sure Cameroon you guys are all over the place Cameroon that's in Africa wow Kazakhstan 1248 p.m. that's near usbekistan there was someone from usbekistan here are you going to move to Asia for a while you're just visiting I'm going be in Asia for about about 3 4 weeks in total unfortunately I do have a lot of work to do so I can't stay here too long but I would love to live in Asia it just seems like it's warmer it's nicer people are friendly from where I've been everyone speaks English here in Singapore at least it's cheaper maybe not in Singapore but in other places 349 Philippines where are you in Philippines my friend Kenya 1050 a.m. please come to India I just met someone from India who's here as well uh where are you in India India is such a huge country i' be intimidated to go to India love from Cameroon thank you very much tap Bill Germany 949 South Africa man we got people in like every country here hardly seen anyone in the same country this is crazy looks like we're about to dive back in here guys again last minute questions anything you want to say punch in the chat obviously I'll look at it as we go through but I want to focus on these last presentations welcome back ladies and gent I hope all of you are feeling a little bit more refresh right now and ready for the second half of our challenge well ladies and Gentlemen please help me to welcome our ninth team today myx Health technology from China from China all right let's see let's go look at their funding here I do have a Discord guys um discord.gg slwt check that out but I want to pay attention to these proposals here okay mind lacks Health afterno ladies and gentlemen I'm Kate from mlex we are a company using tactile neuro Technologies to improve emotions and the sleep as we all know with the increasing pressure of Life the emotion disorders has been a huge social issue espe people worldwide leave with a mental disorder 10% of them experience insomnia or just think about ourselves have you ever felt you are so tired but you don't know how to rest and relax then introducing our product mlac sleeping mat it is efficient mind relaxation and sleep a too compared with other Solutions it is drug free uh seamless user experience and it is uh very portable here's our demo introducing mind LAX sleeping man a revolutionary solution designed by a team of Sleep Experts and engineers made from a silky smooth material to wrap you in comfort and a powerful app with guided lessons and soothing music to help you build healthy sleep habets mind La sleeping m is the most effective way to sleep better and refreshed every day this secret restful sleep lies in mind lax's own neuroim technology that gives every note of Music a pleasant vibration allowing your body to become a part of the musical resonance this vibro acoustic effect is sensed through your spine and engages your brain that's why the sound you feel is so immersive the effect regulates your autonomic nervous system allowing you to immediately enter a state of deep relaxation and comfort I want one our product has been validated for the product Market Feit already early this year we launched our Kickstarter campaign and Reed more than 1,000 backers with the commitment of 21 days riskfree refund our return rate is just as low low as 1.3% pretty good for % of of our users report it is so effective for them and the similar results showed us in our clinical trials but just put aside these numbers we also receive many valuable comments and feedbacks from our users I remember one of our user called Nal he experienced more than 30 years of insomnia usually he took one two three hours to fall asleep but with us the second day using our product it takes him just 10 minutes it's impressive very grateful to meet us and we are very happy to help them like like natural so this year we will continuously promoting manx as a global brand through our direct to customer sales channels like Amazon online our available our product is already available on the Amazon and you can search Google go for that and we expect we can receive $1.5 million US dollar revenues at the end projected Revenue okay I want only that right now and another memorable feedback from our user is from try and she said your product is just like a electronic Voodoo for me suggesting that our product is so magical is it true to some exent because with no speakers or Webers inside we use our self develop tactile conduction material to generate sound and vibrations wonder if you actually feel that material we have our encoding algorithm to generate the frequencies and then transmit the signals to the brain to have the nerve regulation and on this technology we obtained seven global patterns and 52 software copyrights and we are proud to say in this field of Technology we found no computer competitors in the world for now really we are here today because we do want to collaborate with opal to promote manlike Tech with greater good uh there are two possible synergies the first one is with opal Health uh we could collaborate with them with the monitoring variables and to provide the personal health intervention with our manlike sleeping mat thus to have a close Loop for uh the opal sleep users another cooperation could be in the all smart devices in opal because the core technology of us is the immersive tactile auditory B feedback modules and it can be applied in many scenarios like currently we have the application in smart cars currently we have the proof of concept contract with Ali and Le Auto already in China hence this it's on Kickstarter guys I think I don't know if it's available yet the magic of this experience could be you can not only experience the sense of touch but you can feel the emotions imagine when you watch you are watching a horror movie and you can feel more afraid and excited I don't know if I want that modules inside feel a little bit interesting and just try the so this product and technology is solely created by our interdisciplinary team and Industry experts naming from Neuroscience sleep medicine materials B sensors psychology and public health and we all determined to make better products for all our users so the last but not the least our mlik value we firmly believe selfcare it's not just Health Care not just healing but preventive medicine so we will continuously using our us Centric humanized experience to promote sty for all of our users so last and we wish every of you could sleep smarter and rest in powered thank you so much thank you team good uh I want to go try that one out I guess you just lie I wonder how much you actually feel like is it vibrating you or is it just like doing something in the muscles that helps you relax someone falling as sleep in 10 minutes after like 2 hours pretty impressive your product help a person that uh easily get to sleep in one hour so what's the next step how how to improve your product maybe um lesser time for sleep or any other way yeah uh thank you for your question so we our product usually uh help our uh uh uh users to get to sleep in 10 minutes we actually uh did a lot of uh seat users and testing um before and 90% of them reported the same uh similar effect and also we have done our clinical Trails uh in uh uh Jang University in China and uh we with the clinical tral shows that we de uh the decrease the uh time to fall asleep by 15% of all the trial members and increase uh the time uh the time to maintain deep sleep by 20% of all the of the pallet uh users so that's 15 20% would you guys pay that much for that let me know what you think we also plan to obtain the FDA approval uh uh the would you guys pay that much money for for 15 20% like time to fall as honest our product to sellon we don't really need this uh uh uh medical certificate yeah Fair than never you wouldn't pay that I feel like if you have that forever sleep is pretty important right stimulation for Sleep Disorders um bring the table is also a a haptic solution um your haptic solution I guess Targets this displacement and frequency for the stimulation would you say that that's a core part of your strategic advantage or are there other strategic advantages within your product guys I think Tim is running the judge panel here like you said like the core technology is a heptic we also said it's a tactile uh nerve system because that's a fundamental and the most uh uh uh uh uh the most uh uh uh sensory that transmit most of the information to our brand so we use the tacal but in the meantime we also have the sound um like the auditory sensory uh to uh cooperate with a a tactile sensory to transmit to the signal to the uh uh to the brain and to have the nerve regulation and in the future we will also have other sensories uh because we will have the uh different uh models and like we will have uh like the sense and other sense sensories to increase our Effectiveness thank you thank you be curious what they can get to because propal 15 to 20 or even 25% that's important I guess but that go like an hour to 45 minutes is that a notable difference if it was an hour to 10 minutes which it did for some people that's a big big a bigger difference story but if the average person is getting a small benefit I don't know how impactful that actually is but I mean if you if you think of it right you're sleeping every single night to get an extra 30 minutes of sleep every night or even 1550 minutes of sleep every night that's probably a pretty decent return on investment in terms of your health I guess it does depend on your lifestyle also like if you're travel you going to bring this with you or you going to leave this just your in from us with their they should make like a mattress that'd be sick if they had that that that had the tech right in the mattress music so it has sound as well but what if people use it and never fall asleep without it that's actually a really good point if you become reliant on that and then you need that you don't is the Pioneer of a 3D tracking technology this is so cool I this demo we don't often realize it but from the moment we wake up we're instinctively measuring tracking and adjusting to the 3D environments around us even a simple Act of grabing handle is in truth a highly sophisticated 3D interactions now as we try to make machines and robots work in a similar way the need and the requirements for 3D tracking has evolved as well the problem is the Legacy Solutions cannot keep up they're Limited in customization are complicated to use and are very expensive to dive a little deeper there has been duly in 3D tracking first came Optical using cameras and lasers it's very intuitive but what it cannot see it cannot track so you must have line of sight to overcome this em system was introduced in 1960s no line of sight is needed because magnetic magnetic field can pass through materials but metals can cause Distortion and loss in Precision so for decades this has caused as a time money and even lives in some cases so we decided to create a completely new approach a streamlined system made of just two main components the base station and sensors that is ultra precise that is hasslefree to use our magic is a permanent magnet which allows us to overcome the old limitations with the unique advantages of our own that you won't find anywhere else all combined we're cheaper simpler yet have better performance than anything in the market wow and you don't have to just take my word for it our core patent was granted in just 6 months when a typical us pen takes over two years which shows streng of approach and with the years of know house our technical mode has only grown our primary Market is surgical navigation valued at 8 billion and growing about 14% annually where we partner with the medical device companies across surgical segments let's see one of the examples you can see the base station next to the patient's head creating a tracking Zone and we've attach the sensor one of them to the dro and one to the patient and with just two sensors you have a fully digitized dental implant procedure that's fast reliable and accessible that it's like a simple game that anybody can do and why stop there replace the hand with the robot and you can take full advantage of up to 0.1 mm Precision that we can provide and even automate the process our business model is B2B razor and blade base station is the main Hardware while millions of sensors are sold as peripherals and disposables from simple catheters to surgical robots from neural to dental to Orthopedics the applications are incredibly diverse but medical is difficult so we form strategic partnership first in surgical navigation second in dental implants we launched the pilot program in 2021 and so far accumulated over 1,300 orders worth more than $10 million oh we also had a revelation that's a lot we are a lot of our customers coming up from lowincome Emerging Markets with a rapidly aging populations we're talking billions with no access to timely surgical care millions of preventable deaths and three times the higher mortality rate post surgery compared to high incum naations they desperately need safe affordable And Timely surgical care and that's where we come in our Best in Class 3D tracking enables more targeted therefore safer operations and we do it while saving up to 90% in cost and hours of critical medical time which can save countless lives guys what this does is track really tiny sensors the base station is the product path to grow reach your full potential and thankfully in our current partner Network we can count about 10,000 Hospital hits with up to $150 million of annual recurring Revenue potential wow they give them a huge valuation because we are not providing the end user user Medical Products ourselves we can enter the market even faster they've raised 8.25 million USD exciting is the growing and interconnected I'll show you a a video at some point if possible did the demo it's crazy how accurate is guide the robots and automations make training and simulation and immersive and make everything digital for everyone 3D tracking has a role to play in nearly all Industries and omo is at the center of it this is just like enhanced 3D track just better interesting would be our vision to make digital interactions more human and effortless the precise Dynamic and unambiguous data that we generate are the building blocks of a data driven digital interaction platform for Enterprise workflows and even consumer entertainment oh that would be single device yeah I want that in my uh my years ago when two immigrants met in San Francisco and since then we have created a fullstack team that is uniquely capable of perfecting this technology with the years or Decades of experience in their respective fields from Material Science can you guys imagine inventing this and building this like the Geniuses that do that that's wild thanks to all the progresses that we made we recently raised a pre AR round LED by the two strategic Partners who are obviously 3D tracking our goal is to fulfill existing demand achieve mass production Readiness and expand to other verticals I mentioned at the beginning the simple Act of grabbing a handle with you and opa's help we can open the door of the digital transformation at a global scale for everyone everywhere and truly be an inspiration for people thank you good presentation well you guys said you don't quite understand it for QA I think it's cuz I've seen the demo I understand it better they I wish they would just do the demo on stage it'd be a lot more impactful than the whole slide deck but I guess they need to do the whole keynote thing let's see what they ask them here where's Tim with the questional angle with OP product uh so I showed three different slides I think it ended with a single device you know mobile device that you can use to interact in digital environment if you will I think that's the end goal if you will um but as you've seen from the chart that expanded outwards there are multiple intermediate steps that we can take to get there robotics automation manufacturing training simulation all these are areas where having a really precise tracking in in 3D can really benefit in ways that you might you might not even know right now so I would like to explore those potential but ultimately I want to get to the end goal yeah let's see Tim with question what is the cost ofation versus EMF that's the incumbent industry you EMF yeah yeah uh so the market Standard right now is a company called ndi from Canada and their unit purchased in between 20 to $30,000 wow anywhere in the world basically uh but it's very it takes a very long time to actually receive it because their capacity is pretty limited our device we originally started the company wanting to enter into consumer VR we didn't see the potential uh so it's cheap let's see how much it cost Medical in between um so we originally wanted theice to be extremely affordable which means like ,00 oh right now we can actually manufacture at 300 or less so sell 700 many times more than that we still have a lot of room to play with I say wow so guys this is like a little pod thing like you could buy this cuz they said they want to use for VR some of the big concerns in manufacturing are repeatability reproducibility and in the product you have concerns like Edge case failures um these can have big impacts on lives are these areas that you think you can stand out uh from your competitors are these areas where you've had enough production that you can kind of understand uh how you're going to match up to some of the requirements actually that's one of the areas that we love getting questions from so one of the is question we had a lot but one of them is that we never need calibration on site wow so once we calibrate our uh device during the production the users never have to calibrate the device because compability is basically always going to be there so absolute positioning in relations to the base station plus the center uh you don't have to worry about theability yeah damn and yeah Tech with Toby yeah I I was asked to host live stream uh so uh in relative to the total cost of uh Medical instru uh what kind of uh uh percentage or Revenue po potential you looking at uh for this uh Market yeah so the device itself I mentioned that we had a lot of room to play with uh the consumables disposable actually the margins are pretty thin so it's more about the numbers game if you will uh so I think in terms of the margin I can't reveal the exact numbers but you can expect anywhere between 20 to even 50% um but there do does exist highend disposable is even so these are maybe you can use it 10 times and then throw it away um those are more expensive and it have a higher margin built in um the interesting thing always with the medical is that there are so many different use cases and variations that you can pursue uh that you basically won't run out of ideas wow yeah just saying you can do really really high Precision 3D tracking of like many types of sensors you can their demo was so cool they had like a little like uh and you just stick it around this like head they kind of showed it there but they had like a real world demo and in real time it was like I mean it's as precise as you could possibly imagine moving in and out and showing you like inside objects cool Unfortunately they are unable to join us today due to an emergency so up next yeah we're skipping one of the presentations our 12 team Sky light from China with their proposal Define the Next Generation displays with perov skite microad nextg displays okay I haven't I haven't seen too much about this they ra three male started in 2023 they're from China right good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I Jing I'm a material scientist from University of Cambridge I'm also the funer and CEO of Skylight today I'm presenting to you guys the Next Generation display using provos Sky micro ever since 30 years ago when liquid Crystal LCD was first adopted uh until 20 years ago old that OED was launched we have never stopped pursuing a brighter a clearer and more color Vivid sort of display and immersive experience but what comes with it is extremely high and increasingly high power consumption that POS a really really high and negative impact on the battery life for the customer but also to our planet so our solution is provos Skai micro solution which is T times more energy efficient than the current LCD and twice as much energy efficient as a olad the key enabler is this material called provos much much Superior performance than the current Quantum doc technology which some of you might recognize has just won the 2023 chemistry Nobel priz the key limitation factor of this material I mean the performance is fantastic but the the problem with this material is extremely unstable it quickly degradates under ambient condition when exposed to water and moist uh moisture and oxygen so we are the research team based in Cambridge cin dig laboratory we spend years of research to come up with a micop porus optical glass to stabilize this material and I'm really really proud to announce at this uh opal inspiration challenge that we are able to stabilize this magic material for more than 10,000 hours under ambient conditions what that means is how long is 10,000 hour material in your mobile devices your arvr headsets imposing a very very we call it water oxyer sort of uh anti 46 days layers of continuous us this really opens up this um opportunity for this material to be used in especially in in display uh industry by adopting very similar principle of the in printer or the printer we use in everyone's household we're able to make production of this material extremely scalable we making the Precision of sub pixel down to 0.8 Micron so to to give you a perspective active um the late you know uh it is 50 times more pixel dense than the written of display we're using our opal phone or other other pads really so we're targeting essentially uh the very big um we call call Commercial display market and also TV market for its Energy Efficiency and we're targeting the micro display for AR and vrs because it's very very bright color yeah it needs to be super precise so small not only are we able to produce a very very strong performance in terms terms of red light blue light and green light combining with in printing technology we're able to make this uh production of this uh display manufacturing really scalable comparing directly with our close competitor we're able to generate more than six times much bright uh brighter this uh red light than our close competitor will have a much much reduced uh prod uh production cost because in printing machine is much cheaper than lithography and also the consumable compos theography so our team combines the experience not um not only combines experience of top talents from un a ghost person with um industry expert we have our CTO fulltime CTO coming from Apple who has been studying and also researching on their latest Pro and we have uh a great combination of material research stup operation and also product designs and also by combining with uh the very vibrant camper ecosystem which is a global headquarter for arm we have the cofounder and Co of arm joining as a strategic advisor but also um a collections of essentially semiconductor manufact fabulous manufacturing Manufacturing Company funders joining us as visors you got a pretty good team there so essentially we have been tested our material and we successfully proved the the the the performance on the commercial display and also the TV display and we have brought our demo with us uh for the micro micro I got to go check that out I didn't look at VR please come and join us uh the T breaks later so as eight months old company we're quickly transitioning um from Pilot stage to the uh from the demo stage to the pilot St by working with indust uh industry leaders in manufacturing and Productions so we're codeveloping the technology with kativa the global leader in in printing um um uh in INR printing equipment for OED manufacturing and we have just won the global championship for new display technology challenge organized by Boe the largest display panel manufacturer in China and this pretty legit for 8 months it's impressive um not only are we do we want to work with ra million we also working with Magna for much more efficient lighting solution for automobile but also working with Intel to develop a low power consumption chip for uh display solutions by Skylight so we're redefining the uh display technology for mobile phones arvr headsets and also flat panel and also outdoor um display Solutions so like the thing behind him in reshaping the future of visual and action and Computing thank you thank you so much you now have three minutes and 35 seconds for Q&A and he's on time too unlike everyone else let's see Tim before presentation a quick question regarding the uh production so uh how are you at what stage is your technology in terms of the mass production and how do you solve the mass transfer problem for the larger screen uh great question I'll break break that into two folds uh we have just uh established our Global headquarters in sujo industrial park and has we are planning to build our manufacturing capacity from now to 20 times more in the next 6 months so we have essentially look up the equipment and also manufacturing facilities in suo industrial park um for Mass transfer techniques so essentially our business model in big TVs and also commercial display is Will Will license all material and also essentially manufacturers and theys have the mass transfer techniques for big display but for small and micro display you don't need the mass transfer techniques so we can make the chips at and modules ourself okay thank you yeah thank you no questions would you say your uh biggest Advantage is the uh material that stabilizes the property of uh uh peros guide yes so we first and we're the first research group in the world to come up with Optical glass and we are also the first group to essentially synthesize and upscale the Productions of this Optical glass so special we first essentially observed this phenomena this fantastic phenomena and because of my background and my cofounders background chemical engineer we we immediately started essentially using a much more chemical engineering processing techniques to essentially upscale the production of this uh material and we the exact reason we're choosing inter printing rather than lithography or other very expensive processing techniques is we have identify because in printer and also in printing technique has been widely commercially available so we're using essentially we D risk our adoption our material um uh in industrialization by adopting more mature technology this guy's killing it this is a great presentation he knows all the answers I don't even have anything to say just listen to this guy talk problems right now that are seeking this solution um in terms of the brightness or other aspects where uh bringing in such a new technology that's still evolving is really worth the risk in order to solve those needs Tim killing it with questions as always so one of the key advantage of this Prova microad is it can generate more than 1 million nits in brightness so that's about 1,000 times LCD on ol I was going to sayal through AR microed is a must have solution to combine with um Essen wave um but for a commercial display 1,000 times brightness cost is the very crucial factors um we can actually essentially because it's is much more energy efficient we can reduce his brightness by use much less power so essentially the um at the top manufacturer especially in China uh is working with us in developing the this material technology uh in their commercial display wow I think this guy's a contender here for thank you so much Sky life the because very very good presentation please score their proposal times Light My Town yeah probably you might need like special sunglasses to look at it I think it's just a demonstration of the capability for media choice I think we have two left guys I really liked that one that's one of my favorite ones so far uh that's come up I just thought it was a very clear presentation as well which I can't say for all of them some of them were a little bit all over the place all right coming right up like a Clear Vision too on what they want to do from Estonia Estonia interesting okay any possibility for caption unfortunately guys it can't live caption afterwards YouTube should autoc caption this for you um but I I don't think you can do like live stream captions my name is hanisa and I'm the CEO at Wula so our journey at Wula started in 2020 when I used to have my own online store and that's where I saw the plastic packaging problem so 159 billion Parcels were shipped last year and 40% of them in plastic bubble wrap so after seeing this problem I started looking for new materials myself that could replace plastic bubble wrap cuz at the time I needed them in my own online store and it was a very difficult task there were basically no materials out there that would be sustainable and also look good until we found out about sheep wool so we found out that 200,000 tons of sheep wool goes to waste in Europe every year and this is because the quality of of it is very low so you can't textile production you can't do anything from it so farmers were like literally burning or burying the wool and I thought that that's such a shame cuz it's like a natural Miracle material it's elastic it regulates temperatures and humidity and I mean the sheer amount of it 200,000 tons that goes to waste this could actually replace all plastic bubble wrap globally and that's exactly what we started doing at wam so we are replacing plastic bubble wrap with wool packaging and this is the first product that we launched it's the wool envelope so it has a recycled paper layer on the outside for printing the message on it and for attaching a label and then it has a wool layer on the inside so the wool layer uh protects Parcels in Transportation uh and the packaging also stands out so these two things combined really helps to keep plastic out of the picture for good our clients are online stores who are shipping fragile Goods so companies who are making Electronics Beauty and skincare products jewelry Watches luxury products perfume supplements Etc and our main markets right now are France and Scandinavia so here's a quick overview of some of our clients wonder if it's laun um the product into the market in 2020 so the same year that we uh got the idea so we're already quite active in the market um we have early traction so a monthly revenue of 35,000 is what we do right now it's not bad considering examples of how2 Millies are currently being used so here's an example of an online store who is uh using vula to ship out their Electronics so phones um headphones watch must like that and here's the newest prototype that we have so this is a watch box we made specifically for Oppo you can also see this in the demo area so oppon needed a um wool component in their watch packaging to protected during Transportation so we made this early prototype this is super soft by the way guys this material feels really cool and uh in terms of the other industry so this is a very cool example of the Dutch perfumery that's called Sal PR who is using Wula to ship um their perfumes and they actually also use it as retail packaging and here's a French company called mmas boo who is shipping cosmetics in woa as a standard packaging see that makes more sense to me elect example from a comp usinga to ship out like supplements and vitamins and we are also working with the luxury sector so we are working with the lbmh group uh that houses Brands like Louis vuon and Dior and many others and we are the winner of The lbmh Innovation award in sustainability which we just got uh this year in June in terms of uh our production so we are based in Estonia and so is our production so we have our own everything we produce is in house and the factory is also based in Estonia and in terms of like uh energy we have our own uh autonomous renewable energy grids that we partially use for powering the factory and in terms of certificates so we are very proud to be a certified BC Corp as of this year and our products are also uh FSC certified and we're in the final stages of getting the TV certification I don't know what a b cor is we are an externally fun company so we are backed by Future Ventures which is a Silicon Valley based VC fund that has invested €3 million EUR in tuula 3 million EUR okay very importantly the people behind all of this so our team we're quite a small team of 15 uh people um but we have uh a 50% uh ratio uh of all managerial roles being filled by women at wola and when we were looking for a location for our Factory we chose um a region that is very rural and it has a high rate of chronical chronically underemployed people so 30% of our population comes from that segment and impr all of our employes have stock options at Wula because this is the only way that we think it makes sense to work towards this very big mission I don't know if that's good from an investor perspective the last thing I want to talk about is what to do with Wula packaging after the end user receives it so there's three options uh reuse it return it or compost it and the ReUse part probably needs the most explanation uh and it's also the most fun thing to explain uh in my opinion so these are all ideas what you can do with woa packaging after you receive it C I totally do that actually got most of these ideas from our end users they just started posting about it on social media and tag us this is so for example you can use the wool packaging as a dish mop that you can see in the first photo um for some reason cats and dogs really like sleeping uh on the W parts so people use it as a pet bed you can use it for DIY projects you can um make shoe insoles from it because this is really sick like legitimately reusable humity so for Nordic climates it works very well you can also use it as a plant fertilizer and there are a lot of um opportunities a pencil case that's interesting so I briefly already mentioned the um packaging prototype that we made for Oppo so this was a good test for us to see if we can help opo replace plastic and I think the Prototype showed that we can so we're very excited to see if there are more opportunities for us to work together thank you very much another good presentation clear have 2 minutes and 35 seconds for Q&A Judes right on time too wow well done uh I have a question regarding how you plan to uh scale up the business you mentioned there 200,000 uh tons of uh wasted War annually in Europe alone so uh with your factory in Estonia and uh uh what's your plan on utilizing all these ws and uh shipping the uh packaging product to all over the world yeah I feel like is not the best location for that factory has quite a high production capacity we can make up to 800,000 packages a month so in terms of Revenue we're talking about like roughly 400,000 so the production capacity is quite High to you know Serv as a big portion of Europe but we are um very much looking into expanding to Asia as well and if we do that then we are going to um duplicate our production line and the let's say good thing about it is that we are uh let's say a very um like our production technology is very affordable to duplicate and in terms of timeline it can be done within 6 months so that's one of like our core advantages that has basically brought us here well I feel like the scalability is a bit of an issue for me to see here follow up on that question in terms of your wasteful sourcing um are there any concerns about the stability of your sources in terms of competitors uh maybe not even competing in this area but competitors wanting to access that waste wol or any limitations and scaling from the amount of total Global waste wol yeah so the amount of waste wo is so big that it's quite hard to grasp you know what this 200 ,000 tons mean but I mentioned before that our U Max production capacity right now is 800,000 packages and if we were to work at Max Capacity right now the amount of wool that we would need yearly is around 1% of the 200,000 tons so this is how much waste wool there actually is so yeah running out of material basically is not like a risk we we're seeing right now I have I think she's not really thinking of like a huge huge perspective envelope yeah so our replacement product is mainly the plastic bubble wrap envelope because we're focused on like the protective aspect of it and we are more expensive of course but we are quite competitive so we have different sizes and the products product Prices range between 60 cents to1 Euro and we mainly work on quantity so we're focused on you know larger larger deals and we also offer like quantity discounts but those are the retail prices okay thank you so much woa for your wonderful that was a really good presentation as well guys I I fear that she's like thinking on a smaller level cuz I'm hearing numbers like 35k 400k like these kind of guys that are judging here I think have a billion dollar potential right can this company grow to a billion doll company maybe it's cool but out of Estonia probably not right 400k per month Max Revenue out of one facility it sounds like a lot but it's not really that much so that's still it's a good price range but I'm just C curious like can they actually expand and scale to that point last two proposals Unfortunately they cannot join us in person in Singapore but they will join us online let welcome our next team I like from Israel and the proposal 3D interactive platform okay this is the one I mixed up earlier this is going to be on Zoom guys everyone we are grateful to the organizer for allowing us to participate remotely thank you very much for your understanding and now I will ask you to close your eyes for a few seconds and listen you can open your eyes now if I will ask you what it was all about you would probably tells me that it was taken from a movie scene but guys it's actually 15 seconds that we recorded in a random street in t Aviv can you imagine yourself navigating this situation without see anything we are already in 2023 and the technological advancements are on its way and yet these are the most common solution for partially sided and blind people with today achievements we are able and committed to give them much more based on this fact iight was founded so highlight is developing a smartphone size surface that can model complex object create Real Time 3D maps and even replicate facial features with this tech technology user can actually touch feel and understand their environment everywhere they are in the initial phase the surface interface with smartphone s case on its back but in the future it will be embedded inside the motivation behind the product is the familiar Gadget the pinard surface highlight has invented a novel moded for metrix control of high resolution surface we know how to simultaneously operate thousands of linear pixels using only one engine in real time and with minimal power consumption whoa okay here you can see our demo using computer vision and AI algorithms we have six steps of analyzing we started with real time streaming that is captured by a stereo camera after that we convert the input to a depth map then to point Cloud rotating the point of view to top view and eventually demonstrated the whole of this process into a live pin art simulator this simulator represent the topographic map of the room and the person that navigates inside so they can feel on their hands of 16 pixel just to prove our concept and technology in the video on the left the physical Matrix gets the input using a 3D camera that identifies the location of the cube and demonstrates it's on the smart surface in the video in the middle the physical metrix get wireless input from a remote application the user changes the location and the height of the green Cube and as you can see the SM the SM surface changes accordingly in the video on the right we have connected the previous live streaming from the room but this time to a real hour surface it illustrates the great refresh rate that can be reached using our technology and the potential of our backr product today we are in the initial production phase of the first product that already contains thousands of pixels mean she is one of the participants in our experiments that highlight conducts periodically with potential end users she's totally blind from birth here she's navate using our product so she's holding a pin map room to reach the white chair located on the right side of the room this room she has never navigated before as you can see the amazing results even surprised us so guys she's holding essentially 3D mapping of the room that's using a pin out map million people are estimated to be partially on blinds and this number is growing exponentially every 5 Seconds someone in the words goes blind our business model is based on product sale alongside a Subs model premium services and special features in a highly competitive market highlight stands out with very clear advantages including a user user friendly interface the ability to operate at any moment moment and environment and of course personal customization so we started our journey about three years ago received a nondilutive governmental Grant secured preed by Israel Innovation Authority and incubate Ventures now we are transitioning from development to production and one year from now we aim to launch our first product in the market as an ambitious team which has reached technological skills and of course clear message we want to good question the chat guys see if they ask that or not Imp in the world our technology has longterm potential in various aspects just think how much the digital world today lacks the sense of touch the experience doesn't feel authentic and the existing human machine interfaces lack sensibilities just to give you a teaser imagine our product assisting to a doctor or surgeon in real time to obtain tangible information that aids in their decision Mak process the wild can help as a remote control and remote steering platform our system will be able to both model in 3D and identify user input in real time and how the gaming experience looks when the user can feel what they see totally mindblowing currently we are in the seed funding ground and we are welcome any connection to VCS and private investors additionally we are seeking for Business Partnership and Joint PC's thank you very much thank you you now have two minutes and 52 seconds for Q&A I wonder if they're live on Zoom resp good question though I don't know how detailed this is and if they can do small objects and moving objects seems like it's designed for stationary terrain if you test it your product in an outdoor evolving environment yeah there you go hi everyone and fortunately we cannot be in in person in Singapore but this is a good good question currently all the testing were in indoor environment because of the transformation but accordingly to the R&D plan we are talk talking about doing the outdoor testing in the near future okay that would have been I wish they had done that CU I would have said a lot probably about the product good questions in the chat you um that you were using a cane and the device at the same time so the idea of the device is not to replace a cane for the smaller motor functions to prevent tripping but rather to provide kind of a larger infrastructure for navigation exactly this is what highlights does honestly we are a compliment complimentary product the the aim is not to replace an assist another assistive guide but also to give another demonstration of the environment in order them more a 3D map you can tou um ability to understand what is going on in the surrounding in the first phase we are aimed to to be as a complimentary product but in the long run it's supposed to cover the the dog and the dog training or the assistive a I'm not really sure what she just said there so a person with uh blind disability does he or she uh require special training in order to understand what the device is uh sending out as uh information uh as a followup question uh so with this uh how do you compare it uh with uh for example audio edit uh navigation so this question at the first point um iight is looking um not only to to be separated product but also to be as a platform that the camera as you can see in this in the video and a complimentary um audio feedback about what is going on the surrounding and the collaboration between the S the sound and the S the touch supposed to cover the visual Gap um so this is our how the platform does and about your um second thought the second uh question about competitors what is the added value of highight is the the volume if we are looking the competitors most of them are doing manipul manipulation in order to um stimulate and gesture but the learning process of highlight is very very simple and clear just imagine that as cided person unid P blind needs to touch thing in in the physical places in order to you identify what the objects are it's the same but in a small size so the the learning process as we did in the PC um experience just clear the the the message that the product is very intuitive for the user and also um very short learned H learning process thank you so much are pretty early to be honest with you 3D interactive platform Med friends please vote VI media Choice link thank we have one more I think we have one more I'm not sure that was I think they said that was the second last one I think there's one more take a moment to consolidate the current scores before the final team takes the stage I wonder who do you guys think is going to win at this point this is yeah this is interesting I really don't know there's so many present they're so different ladies and gentlemen welcome our final LED guy smart res from is and their proposal biased solution for flexible Electronics oh I messed that up there was I don't know what the other one was that was like that really cool like orb thing that was uh the reusable materials well they have a lot of reusable ones I don't know let's see smart resin okay my name is Leon and I'm the CEO of smart residing I would like to thank you for the opportunity to present smart resident raliz solution for flexible Electronics flexible display are the future of technology and it's going to change the entire way we use our devices and the entire user experience the most common material in news today is poly meat there are other polymers mostly fossil derived that continue to contribute to the growth in ew they are also lack of performance and expensive to produce therefore we must find a biobased solution cellulose is a great fit due to to its chemical structure is of handling and biodegradability cellulose is the most abandoned biopolymer on Earth it's basically a sugar that can generate transparent film as you can see on the upper side of the slide however the resulted film is brittle smart resident combines the most elastic material in nature resident protein with cellulose to give flexible yet strong film as you can see on the down side of the slide so what is resing imagine you could jump to the top of Statue of Liberty in a single jump it turns out that fleas has the equivalent ability they can jump about 100 times their height in order to get to the top of a dog or a cat and they can do it due to this amazing protein named residing so we decided to bring residing as a biobased natural solution to pollutant and harmful materials we can then provide alternative super performing materials for sustainable application oh how do we do it we don't kill insect to take out residing rather we use genetic engineering technique to take the DNA that code for residing we can tailor fitted to bind to cellulose or any other biopolymer in the future we then introduce it into bacterial cells that can produce a lot of this protein in a fermentation process we are a spinoff of the Hebrew University and have an exclusive licensing agreement with them in order to bring residing as an available solution to the industry we have established a joint venture with a 17 years of experience biotechnological company asss bio we already established the first Milestone the fermentation yield and are now working on the second target which is the production cost in order to achieve that we have set up a few Milestones by 2024 the first one was already established the optimal media which is basically the food that we give to the bacteria in order for them to grow we need to scale up from a few hundred liters to 10,000 liter inhouse and hundred of thousands in the future we continue to develop analytical and downstream processing we put emphasis on eoe efficiency and optimal use of resources that will eventually enable us to optimize for large scale production this is actually the 10,000 lit tank fermentation that is in use in asss facilities today resident can then be mixed with nanocellular to generate a film that is flexible transparent and strong we can control the thickness the there are Green Solution using biodegradable materials they are lightweighted scratch resistant have good performance in blocking UV and they expected to be lower at cost in comparison to poly in large scale so there you go guys this is what is replacing qualities mechanical Optical thermal and electrical are a great Feit for this industry just imagine a dragon fly that fla the wing millions of times with no fatigue due to the resling it integrated into your smartphone that you can fold again and again oh H we currently produce our film in lab scale using a roller coaster a roller coaster as you can see in this video and then let it dry but in large scale we have available roll to roll facilities that is a wellknown continuous fabrication process for flexible substrate for example Cod of film is produced just like that residing has other use cases that for example residing film that is just residing they are very elastic films and can be used for example for cosmetic Solutions another example is resing hydrogel that are crosslink resling that can be integrated into sports goods we can use it as a 3D ink since resing is a photopolymerized biopolymer and as a composite with nanocellulose as a first solution for flexible electron they want flexible electronics that makes biology and material science my background is biotechnology I did my PhD at Professor o lab who is by himself an entrepreneur who started more than this a bit complicated to follow but I think I'm kind of getting and Daniel brings best expertise in Material Science biotechnology and Business Development our board of directors bring vast expertise in financials and Business Development Al together we bring this to life yeah that makes more sense impact we are looking to reduce the use of toxic chemicals save energy in the production process replace synthetic nonbiodegradable materials and lower the overall CO2 emission to summarize we expect high sell potential within two years companies in the biofabrication field are already evaluated as unicorns we could just be the next one it's a rapidly growing field we established a joint venture to be the first to commercialize rling we collaborate with leading Global Brands and already generated over half a million in incomes we enter the ESG impact with our ecological process and products we have a solid technology and a strong team to do all of that I would like to thank you and call you to join us in bringing residing to the mass market so guys this is the last presentation sorry to speak overas material we're going to do the Q&A and then unfortunately I'm not actually allowed to Le to you who win this you have to go to check QA Jud gonna do a Q&A here let me know in the chat right now who you guys think is going to win I think LED the LED presentation is is one of the top ones for sure I think the big 300 million us one has potential as well even though they don't really need like the exposure that they have here I really like the haptic one I don't think that's going to win though the 3D modeling one looks good if we look at something like P it's primarily for the price manufacturing but when we look at something like polyamid uh it's not so much about the price but the durability and harsh environments including space um so I guess uh to start with you're really targeting the flexible Electronics specifically um could you mention maybe what specific uh advantages you have besides the source of the material in that space Also performance wise uh I mean for example polyamid is very easily creased whereas our solution is not that easily creased we have better results for example using um a pensile test so to see how it g uh it's it's stronger when we tested T side stress guys let me know who you think wise we are better uh however we do have disadvantage in terms of stability for temperature but still uh our qualities are good for this Market we are stable up to 280 degrees which is very good for uh you know for biobased materials and it's good enough for this market so even though poly is stable up to 300 and more we are still good for this application guys again we're going to end right after this Q&A so if it's abrupt I apologize about that uh sorry I'll jump in again yeah in terms of the total available U fermentation facilities globally um do you think that you can meet the scaling that would be needed to really jump into a consumer device product definitely ACS bio already have a partner in in China that have the capacity of 250,000 liters and there are available up to half a million in Europe in the US so and and they're just standing available for any manufacturing that wants to come so once we establish a large scale fermentation process that is durable we can do it anywhere in the world which is also uh contribute to the you know to the sustainability because we can produce anywhere uh lowering the transportation issues thank you nice all right guys that was was the last
