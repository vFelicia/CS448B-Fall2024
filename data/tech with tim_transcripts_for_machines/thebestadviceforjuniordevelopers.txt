here's the one thing I wish I was told as a junior developer now oftentimes as a junior Dev we get our first gig we're super excited we feel all confident and like we're the best programmer in the world and we want to show that off and constantly share our opinion now that's great you can have some confidence no one's telling you to be quiet but the reality is that there is programmers that are so much better than you that have been coding for 20 30 40 years that have so much experience you can't even fathom it until you see them on the job I wish that as I entered my first Junior developer position I would have sat back a little bit more closed my mouth listened and really extracted as much value as I possibly could from the few mentors I had on my team luckily I still did this I learned a ton from them but I think I could have got some more value if I put my ego to the side and just constantly took all of their feedback to heart and really tried to improve and extract again as much value from them as I could
