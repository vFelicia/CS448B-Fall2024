so recently i've been spending quite a bit of time writing code and much less time filming videos and i've noticed that the amount of hours i spend coding really changes the amount of productivity or efficiency i'm getting in those hours what i mean by that is if i spend say 10 11 12 hours coding i'm not necessarily getting as much done per hour as i would if i was only spending three or four now i know that seems obvious but i think there's a really good sweet spot that i've discovered over the past few weeks i'm going to share that with you in this video in fact what specifically i'm going to do here is try to answer the following questions what's the minimum amount of time you should spend coding what's the maximum amount of time you should spend coding and what is that sweet spot what is kind of the ideal amount of time to spend per day working on some coding project now of course this won't be one size fits all this is really just from my experience and what i've noticed and i'd love to hear your thoughts on this in the comments down below now one other thing i've recently realized is that i always have about a one minute intro and at this point in time i share with you the

now let's get into it alright so the first question i told you i would answer is what is the minimum amount of time you should spend coding in a day now i just want to say that this doesn't really apply to people that only have maybe 20 or 30 minutes to code and they're kind of fitting coding into whatever else they're doing i'm really talking about people where their fulltime job or their fulltime thing is writing code and they're trying to determine if it's worth it to even begin coding based on the amount of time that they're going to have now this really applies to me because i have a bunch of other stuff that i need to do usually when i'm writing code and so i need to decide if you know i only have an hour or an hour and a half if it's actually worth my time to get in and start coding as opposed to doing some other tasks so with that said really for me i think that a decent minimum amount of time to code is about an hour or an hour and a half now i know that might seem like a lot but really for me i find that i can't start being productive in a code base or in a coding session until i spend about an hour kind of getting into it getting my mind into that flow state you know getting more familiar with the code reminding myself of some of the logic and stuff that i may have maybe forgotten from the past day or that i need to conceptualize before i can start actually writing something and for me really between 60 and 90 minutes is usually how long it takes before i start really getting productive you know being more fluent on the keyboard i kind of know what i'm doing and i'm actually writing a good amount of code in the time past that so that's what i'm gonna say for a minimum amount of time at least for me for some of you it may only take five or ten minutes for some of you it may take two hours you do need to figure that out but usually i won't actually start doing any coding unless i know i'm going to have a minimum of an hour maybe even 90 minutes to be able to get something done because again until i get to that hour mark i'm usually not being very productive and i'm just not yet in that flow state which as we all know is super important when it comes to coding because you have to be very focused to really be productive and get a lot of nonbuggy and accurate code out so let me know in the comments if you guys agree with this do you think that's a decent minimum how long does it take you to get into your flow state and when do you start to really feel productive when you're writing code alright so now we'll move on to question number two which is what is the maximum amount of time that you should start coding so as i stated before usually i start to get productive and actually kind of do a lot of work as soon as we get to that 60 to 90 minute mark now once i get to that point i'm usually quite productive for two to three hours before i start to see any kind of drop off in the productivity so you really have at least i really have you know a solid three or four hours per day where i'm getting a ton of code out this is good code it's high quality i'm not tired yet and i'm confident in what i'm right now as soon as i start to get past three or four hours so i'm at let's say the four hour mark from what i've started to code usually i'm okay i can still write some decent code my productivity doesn't fall a ton but i do start to see a drop off and every kind of hour past that four hour mark if i was trying to quantify this i'd say i'd be maybe 10 or 15 percent less productive so by the time i'm getting to maybe seven or eight hours of coding i'm now at a point where i'm maybe at half the productivity i was a few hours ago and at that point i don't really find it worth it to continue coding unless i really need to get something done because again i'm not being very productive and my time is probably better spent in a more low effort type of task that doesn't require the amount of focus that coding and working in kind of a large complicated code base does so for me i really think that a decent maximum for writing code in a day especially if you're not taking a major break in between coding sessions is between six to seven hours now that might even be a lot i'm sure many of you by the time you get to even three hours or four hours are probably burning out already you've probably exerted a ton of focus a ton of you know muscle brain power uh and you're getting tired at that point and that's totally reasonable for me i'll usually still kind of push forward even if i'm being a little less productive just so i can get some more code out and that's why i usually try to cut my sessions at again kind of that six seven maybe eight hour mark depending on the day and depending on how much i need to get done now all of this does change a little bit if you are taking breaks throughout when you're coding and depending on the length of that break right for example probably the best days i have coding or when i wake up nice and early maybe 7 a.m start coding by 7 30 i'm kind of into it by 8 30 and i have a nice three hours of productivity that brings me until about noon and then i take like a one or two hour break i'll have lunch maybe watch a few videos maybe do something really low effort that doesn't require a ton of thinking and then jump back into coding at 2 2 30 and code until maybe 6 or 7 pm which at that point i would then stop for the day and do whatever i'm gonna do those are when i'm the most productive i have a really solid break enough to kind of refresh the brain and to maybe even have a nap or something so i'm no longer kind of exhausted or burnt out from the coding session so that is what i feel like for the maximum let's go with you know seven hours just to kind of give a definitive answer here again i know many of you are probably going to be before that number but if we're picking an absolute maximum for me i think that's a really solid place to kind of stop especially if i've only been taking a short you know five or ten minute breaks uh and not had kind of this large lunch break or this large time to kind of regroup regenerate and get back into the coding all right so now that i've answered those two questions i will answer the final question which is what is the ideal amount of time to spend coding in a day now my answer for this is going to be between five and six hours now for a lot of people i have a feeling they're gonna say something between three or four or between four and five for me personally i find that five to six is really good and i'm getting quite a bit of work done while still staying productive and not really burning myself out or being too fatigued so let me just walk through kind of why i came up with that number so as i said before a really kind of definitive minimum for me is about an hour i'm not going to write any code unless i have at least an hour to get some stuff done and once i get to that hour mark i'm usually fully in the code base i'm very focused i'm at my maximum productivity i'm usually able to maintain that productivity level so let's say a hundred percent for between three to four hours so by the time i'm getting to four four and a half hours there is some dropoff in productivity for me that i notice i start to get a bit tired i'm less focused it requires maybe more energy or more thinking to solve some complicated problems however i'm still probably at eighty percent 75 70 productivity and to me it's still worth it to keep working at that point it's not until i get to that six hour mark where i start to see a more significant drop off and by the time i'm at seven eight etc i'm now at maybe 60 50 productivity and at that point my time is probably better spent doing something else that's not as intense maybe as coding not as uh you know focus intensive and uh i would then go and do that now as i said before this really all changes based on the way that you're taking breaks for me personally when i'm in my flow state when i'm really coding and nice and focused i don't like to take breaks i like to just power through sometimes i won't even eat lunch i'll just go because i really want to get everything done and i know that if even i take a five or ten minute break especially if i don't have a bug or something in my pro program i could lose complete focus and it might take me another few minutes to get back into the code base now i know some other people are completely the opposite they're really good at taking you know five minute breaks every half an hour or something like that that helps them focus that helps them you know stay motivated in the coding and that's what works for them for me i like to just power through and kind of go as long as i can until my efficiency starts to really drop off maybe i take one or two small breaks in that time but generally i'm coding the entire time until i'm just too fatigued or my productivity is too low to kind of warrant or justify going forward so there you go that is my answer the ideal amount of time again is going to be about six hours at least for me i think for many of you it's probably gonna be closer to four to five and i just want to give you kind of something you can look at if you want to see some real evidence of this or antidotal evidence of this so i've done a lot of coding live streams on this channel i've done some that are four hours long i've done some that are eight hours long i've done 10 i've done 12 i've done 18 hours and in those streams it's a very interesting kind of psychological experiment to watch me in the first let's say half an hour to watch me at the three hour mark and then to watch me at like the 10 or 11 hour mark you can just see by the time i'm past eight hours i'm completely exhausted i'm not as motivated as i was before i'm getting really very little work done i'm having all kinds of bugs in trouble i'm getting very frustrated it's very difficult for me to communicate especially when i'm trying to talk to like a live chat while i'm coding whereas you go to like the two or three hour mark and it looks like i'm like super energized you know i'm talking all the time i'm going very fast i'm coding like you know very quickly compared to later in the uh the live stream and it's always funny for me to go back and kind of reference those different points and it reminds me that hey once you get to this point it's really not worth it to continue and of course i'm still going to do these live streams they're fun you guys enjoy them and it's an interesting kind of coding challenge but i would never recommend to anyone coding for longer than eight hours at a time unless they had some massive deadline that they really needed to get done so with that said i do think i'm gonna wrap up the video here i am very curious to hear what you guys think about this i have a feeling a lot of you are probably gonna disagree with me on the ideal amount of time to code that's why i tried to preface many times in this video that everything i'm saying is really just from my experience and kind of the way that i feel about it so please do leave a comment down below let me know what your ideal amount of time to code is when you feel most productive and i hope you enjoyed this video if you did make sure to leave a
