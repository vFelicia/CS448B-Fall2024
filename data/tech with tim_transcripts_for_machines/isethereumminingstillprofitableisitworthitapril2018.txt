hey guys and welcome back to another youtube video so in today's video i am going to be talking about ethereum mining now uh ethereum mining about a year ago when i started doing it about then uh was really popular and it was fairly profitable you could make back your initial investment in only a few months as time has gone on that has increased so if you bought a mining rig recently you'll know that it's going to take a long time to make back that initial investment and that ethereum mining is not as profitable anymore so i'm gonna be talking about in this video is it still profitable and should you still be mining now this obviously this answer varies depending on your situation uh for example for me i already have a mining rig i already have the graphics cards so i might as well just mine uh to make that profit whereas someone who's just coming in maybe they only have one graphics card they're thinking about making an ethereum mining rig it's probably not going to be very profitable to do that i'm going to talk about why in this video so there's a bunch of factors we need to consider when we're talking about the profitability of ethereum mining now you can just go ahead uh and this is a simple way to do it and go to cryptocompare.com and go to this ethereum mining profitability calculator and you could punch in your hash power your cost per uh i always just put zero as my power consumption because i don't pay power because i still live with my parents and then you can do like your pool fee all this stuff and figure out how much money you're approximately gonna make in us dollars per month per week per year etc now looking at this obviously this is very low for 20 mega hash per second if i punch this in a few months ago this number would have been about three or four times higher and that's because of the price of ethereum so if you're just going off this then obviously these numbers don't look very promising 200 that's not even gonna cover the cost of um what do you call it i don't know my power supply and my ram for a mining rig so what's the point of mining with that if i go to 100 megahash per second you can see we're making about a thousand dollars but still if you have 100 megahash per second that means you have four or five pretty powerful graphics cards that's definitely not even covering the price of maybe two or three of them so right now if you're looking to buy a rig it's definitely not a time that you'd be uh that you should be going into ethereum mining now the reason why if you already have hardware it's somewhat worth still mining is because if we're looking at the price here we're comparing we're assuming that ethereum is going to stay at a price of 375 dollars now if i go to the ethereum charts here uh you can see that the price obviously has been plummeting recently but if we expect or if you think that ethereum is going to pull back up to maybe even just like the 700 range the 900 range then mining now and holding on to your ethereum may not be a bad idea it's also worth it because you can get your ethereum and then you're able to buy other cryptocurrency with that uh while you're mining it so that's personally why i'm still mining um i just leave my computer running for i think like when i go to beds like 12 hours a day just to pick up a bit of ethereum so i can be buying uh other cryptocurrency now don't get me wrong it's not extremely profitable right now but if and if i hold on to my ethereum for long enough and we see it go back up higher then it will be worth it for right now now the reason why uh the profitability has been going down is because of this chart here that i'm showing you now this is the block difficulty growth chart and you can see that back in even just january of last year um we were having an average difficulty of about 90 okay so you don't really have to know what this number means but just you can look at the magnitude of it so at 90 this is when not very many people were mining the ethereum network was just kind of starting out uh getting a bit more popular as we moved again into april we're moving up we're moving up and when i started mining was about the 650 range 600 range and i was making a good amount of money i made back uh the money on my mining rig in i don't know i think five or six months so it was definitely worth mining at the time but then you can see that we're just climbing climbing climbing climbing and from that 60 at the beginning of the year we're now at 3 000. so you can see it's becoming much more difficult to mine ethereum and what that means is that it takes longer to mine one full block which means you're making less money you're getting less rewards for the work that you're doing and pretty much you can see now we're at 3 200 about i mean right now we're at 31.76 it's fluctuating just a bit um but that's not very profitable at all especially at the price of ethereum to try to be mining at this difficulty with just basic graphics cards and not asic hardware um you're not going to be making too much money so that's what kind of why the you're not going to be making as much money it's not going to be as profitable because as a network continues and grows uh the difficulty gets well more difficult we can look again at the bitcoin charts here so i'll try to try to find a chart bitcoin difficulty mining see if something comes up for this difficulty and hash rate trick and yeah again you can see here just climbing and climbing and climbing uh and the similar thing happens uh is happening to ethereum now because if you were to try to mine bitcoin from well your uh pc then uh that's not gonna be making you very much money and that's what's happening with ethereum now i'm trying to find a better chart here to show you guys uh this is a better looking one okay so i don't know okay this ranges from let's start at about 2015 and you can see the exponential growth of the network and a similar thing is happening again with ethereum and the difficulty here you can see that if we're looking from january 17th this definitely is an exponential curve and it's just going to continue to get more difficult from here on so overall um kind of the consensus here or the final statement is if you're looking to get into mining now and you don't already have the hardware it's definitely not a time to be buying any of that hardware if you really want to think about ethereum mining or mining i'd think about a different currency maybe mining something like litecoin or zed cash i'm not sure how profitable those are but they can't be much worse than ethereum right now at this current price it's worth just holding on to your ethereum if you are mining um and waiting for it to hopefully go back up or maybe buying other cryptocurrency with it but it's definitely not a time to be getting heavily invested in any mining whatsoever or to be looking to buying buy any mining hardware if anything cloud mining may be a better option for for yourself but yeah really mining theorem right now it's not very profitable and i wouldn't recommend it unless you already have the hardware and it's just sitting around there especially if you're not paying electricity so that's been it for this video guys if you enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe if you have any comments
