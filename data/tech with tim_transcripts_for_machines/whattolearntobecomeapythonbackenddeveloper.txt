foreign I'll share with you the skills that you need to have to become a backend python developer I'm taking these skills from my knowledge as well as doing some research and looking at some recent job postings relating to python positions so that said let's get into the video after a quick word from our sponsor before we get started I need to thank lenode for sponsoring this video I've been using and working with lenode for nearly three years now and they've consistently been my goto choice for hosting my applications and servers in fact right now I'm using the node to host the official Tech with Tim Discord bot a website multiple of my domains and a kubernetes cluster now lenode was just recently acquired by Akamai and as a part of this acquisition they're going to be adding more than a dozen new data centers around the world in the next year lenode makes it super easy to spin up servers with their oneclick app Marketplace and have tons of written guides and YouTube videos on their channel to help you get started now if you're having any issues you can reach out to the 24 7 support team and actually talk with a real human being now the node's pricing is simple with no hidden fees and full transparency and you can test out the node services for free by using the link in the description and claiming in a hundred dollar sixty day credit for any new accounts it's been an absolute pleasure to work with lenode over the past few years and one last thank you to them for sponsoring this video alright so let's go ahead and dive in now I quickly want to mention if you haven't already heard I just released a brand new course it's called blockchain expert if you're looking to get into web 3 learn about blockchain Technology's solidity web3 fundamentals Etc then check it out from the link in the description I know you guys will find some value but that said though let's get into the skills now obviously you can land a python developer position without having everything on this list but I think if you want it to be considered for kind of a like let's say midlevel or maybe even a higher level position you would need to have everything here that said I'm sure you could join as kind of a junior python developer or a junior backend developer and work your way up and learn some of the missing skills if you didn't have all of so the first thing you're going to have to have here pretty obvious is python skills you need to understand python fundamentals I don't think you need to be an expert in Python you don't have to know everything about like generators uh iterators uh meta classes all of that kind of advanced syntax but I would know for Loops functions classes objects and a lot of the common and core syntax and functionality that you'd use on an everyday basis okay so moving on to the second skill you would need to have to become a backend python developer this may seem a little counterintuitive but this is some basic frontend skills now whenever you're working on the back end you're still going to be touching aspects of the front end even if you're not writing front end code you might have to understand it digest it kind of look at it and read it and for that reason you should understand some basic HTML basic CSS you should understand maybe a little bit of JavaScript again you don't need to be an expert or a master in this but you need to have some fluency and the ability to at least read some of that code so I would spend a bit of time maybe a week or two kind of looking into some of those skills learning how to build some basic front ends maybe you want to dabble in something like react view angular some other popular Frameworks that's up to you but I would know some basic frontend skills now beyond that knowledge the next thing that you would need to know to become a backend python developer is some basic networking skills now I think you could probably get away without having this but I would highly recommend spending a few days learning about basic networking so learning about HTTP what is that protocol how does that work how do you serve data over the web learning about IP addresses learning about say firewalls learning about vpns and just again kind of fundamental things related to networking maybe you want to learn why localhost works the way it does about different ports about you know kind of standard ports you'd have for a website versus ports for other services again just some fundamental knowledge in this area I think will go a long way so I would learn about basic Networks now moving beyond networking the next thing I would learn is related to Linux and also I'll clarify here I wouldn't learn these necessarily in any particular order I think the order I have is actually decent but just throwing it out there you can kind of learn this in any order so let me take that back the next thing just something I would learn would be Linux now you want to learn about how to operate in a Linux environment so what different Linux users are Linux permissions Linux commands how do you copy paste move files around you want to be comfortable working on just strictly the command line and not relying on a graphical user interface now I actually have an entire Linux tutorial series that's designed specifically for programmers looking to kind of learn this basic knowledge so I'll link that in the description in case you're curious it is completely free right so next after learning Linux I would start learning Django and flask which are web Frameworks that utilize now these are great to learn regardless if you want to be a python backend developer but I think if you want to be a backend developer you're going to have to be competent with these Frameworks and learn more than just the basics you want to learn kind of the intermediate and advanced topics within this and be very comfortable writing code in Django and flask now flask is the more basic of these two Frameworks so I would start by learning that understand how to create a website with it how to create an API with it how to do security authentication logging in logging out you may even want to look at websockets using flask that could be a cool project next though you want to get into Django now Django is a lot more complicated it has many more tools and features but it's used by large companies like Instagram Spotify Mozilla National Geographic and a bunch of other ones as well so just learning Django will open you up to a lot of job opportunities but again you want to be learning about authentication page routing how to do apis more Advanced features Django extensions databases specifically databases and learning the kind of database model within Django that's a bit complicated but something you definitely need to learn if you want to be a backend python developer now Beyond Django the next thing that I would start looking into is API design and just apis in general learning about kind of how those work the different routes you can set up crud apis more complex apis and specifically related to kind of permissions and authentications around that personally I always find that the most complicated stuff is doing authentication specifically token authentication or other aspects of authentication where you have a refresh token an expiry date you have maybe username password authentication there's a lot of different ways to do this and it's going to change depending on the framework that you're using so I would be really really comfortable creating apis designing apis working with Frameworks like Django and flask maybe even fast API and just be comfortable doing this almost know how to do it kind of off the top of your head to spin up a quick API add some authorization or authentication understand what JWT tokens are and all the other stuff that you're going to be using frequently if you're a backend developer now beyond that I would also look at stuff like rate limiting how you host your apis how you make make sure your apis are secure and not being hit by too many people there's all kinds of stuff to look at in this and I'm no expert in this field but those are some of the things I would start really kind of researching if I was thinking about becoming a more fulltime python backend development so next we move on to probably my least favorite topic but this is databases now the reality is if you want to be a backend developer of any kind you have to understand databases this is a very very important part of your job and you need to know how to create databases delete them migrate them do maintenance on them add new tables add relationships do database design how to host databases how to protect and secure your databases there is so much stuff relating to data how to back up your databases how to part put part of your database in another database and access it from somewhere else there is so much stuff related to this and that's going to come with learning SQL now there's a lot of companies now that are using nosql databases for example my startup velocity uses a nosql database which is Firebase however um you know it's probably a good idea to understand SQL and I myself took I think two SQL courses in University sorry for the cut there you can see my cap behind me was about to be stopping my recording so I had to step in there and fix that but as I was saying you need to learn SQL you need to understand how to structure databases create them query them run SQL commands and I would also be familiar with nosql databases and understand a little bit about how to structure your data in a nosql database because that's different than working with a SQL database with a nosql database you're fairly Limited in terms of query operations due to the limited structure that's imposed so the way you structure your data is much different and you end up having a lot of redundant data that's actually kind of part of the design process of working with a nosql database anyways look into that you're going to have to understand SQL I would kind of focus there and then maybe just learn a bit about nosql to kind of have some experience with that in case a job required so last thing on my list here is something that really should be its own job and with a lot of companies it is however if you're working maybe for a smaller company or I don't know some companies just require this you have to have devops skills now this really means your experience working with the cloud you understand how to deploy how to host specific things how to go in there and maybe change something do some maintenance uh you should have experience working in a cloud environment like AWS Azure Google Cloud whatever it is this company uses usually they require some experience in that specific environment now again I really feel like this is its own job there is so much stuff to learn related to devops and I mean this could be a whole video on its own how to be a devops engineer which I'm not even really qualified to talk about the reality is that a lot of companies are requiring this right so I think having a little bit of experience with this being able to not look like you don't have any experience is probably what you're going for in this category so yeah learn a little bit of devops now I will lastly mention you also of course want to learn Git Version Control GitHub I think that goes without saying so I didn't really mention it too explicitly but I would definitely learn that and that's pretty much a requirement for any programming job so that's it guys I'm going to start wrapping it up here make sure to check out blockchain expert from the link in the description if you're interested in web3 or blockchain Technologies and you want to become a blockchain engineer with that said I will see you in another YouTube video thank you
