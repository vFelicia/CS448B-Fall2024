hey guys and welcome back to another machine learning tutorial so in today's video we are moving out of KNN we're done with that now and we're gonna be going into something called SVM I just realize I put s MV in my working file anyways SVM which stands for support vector machine and I'm not really going to talk about exactly what it is in this video but I we are just gonna be importing our data again getting everything in we're gonna use SK learn some builtin data sets because that's the easiest way to do it and essentially the reason I haven't used these data sets which you'll see you're like really easy to use in earlier videos is because I want you guys to learn how to properly bring in your own data because realistically if you're doing this for any applications outside of just kind of playing around with it you're probably gonna use data that is not like formatted properly or is missing things or needs like titles or needs to be transformed into numeric data so I want to show you guys that in the earlier videos I also quickly just want to say thank you to everyone for all the amazing feedback I've been getting I'm trying to make this tutorial good enough that kind of everyone can follow along depending on your skill level and Python like if you're a beginner or not but I will say now this is where things are gonna start getting a bit more difficult in terms of understanding the mathematics are getting a bit more complex and as we move into neural networks that is gonna be getting even more complex so I'm gonna continue to try to explain it as best as I can but just a warning that I will be using or I will be assuming that you have some kind of math background probably like finishing high school math just because I can't really explain like super fundamental math concepts in these videos anyways before I keep going cuz this will be a shorter video in terms of importing the data I want to show you or just tell you guys what the series is gonna look like in the future cuz I know some of you been asking like what's next so essentially what I'm planning to do is SVM that'll be probably another two or three videos depending on how long it takes me to explain it and then after that we're gonna be getting into neural networks now I know how all you guys are really excited about neural networks and essentially what I'm gonna do is probably do like two or three projects with neural networks so the first one I'm gonna do with neural networks is gonna be if you saw my tutorial video or not really tutorial is it kind of like a showcase of how I had those handwritten digits and we were classifying them based on what I would bring in I'll leave a card to that in the corner if you want have a look at that but essentially I'm going to be teaching how we can do that and then we'll move into some more advanced things with no networks and hopefully at the end of this series I'm gonna make a new series and train like like a neural network to play a game or do something like that so let me know if you guys are excited about that last notes sorry I nose has been a very long kind of introduction but this is important if you guys want to join my discord server there's link below my Twitter is there as well that's a really good great place for you guys to connecting the ask some questions and just join a community we already have a ton of people on there and it's been awesome to kind of see the chats going on in the discord server so I welcome you guys to join so anyways let's get into the actual tutorial we're just gonna load in data this ship won't take us long so we're just gonna import SK learn from SK learn this is no we're gonna import datasets now essentially datasets is just holds like a ton of different datasets that are really easy to load in you'll see in a second we're also just going to from SK learn we're going to import SVM and SPM is going to be our classifier so that's what we're gonna be using okay so now that we've done that what we need to do is load in our data set so the table set i'm gonna be using is a cancer data set and that is a breast cancer when i believe and essentially there's just a bunch of different features and those point to a tumor that is either cancerous or noncancerous correct me if I'm saying this incorrectly but a malignant or benign I believe is how you say that so to load in our data really easy all we have to do is just do cancer equals data sets dot load breast cancer now just look here at this all these autocorrects all you have to do to change the data set we're using is pick one of these other ones so irish is a popular one for svm breast cancers a popular one as well there's some other ones as well you can pick from but i don't guarantee they're gonna work because it has to be a classification data set because that's what SVM is used for classifying what do you call it just like points right classifying data to be a certain class so now that we do that we're gonna actually just print out our features and our labels just we know the names of them so essentially to do this all we do is we just print cancer dot label underscore names believe that's right we'll see and then we're gonna do cancer dot target underscore names I don't even know if these brackets need to be here but I guess we will see ya label names is apparently not a thing so one second sorry let me just have a look at my other file label names beetroot names my bad and I don't think we actually yeah we don't need these brackets here as well I don't think they'll make a difference but let's do this okay so you can see here we have all our features now mean radius mean texture it mean perimeter and then malignant and benign again don't really know you say that properly but anyways and so this is same thing whenever you load in like another data set and you call it something else to see all the different features you do not to see all the different labels or targets you do this okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to set up my X and wireless here for a data so X is gonna be very simple it's just cancer data and Y is gonna be cancer dot target so pretty straightforward there and then to split up our data we're gonna use that split test train or train test split or whatever it is I'm gonna copy it in because I really don't a mess up typing and then have to correct myself but it something like this right so we have our extra X test Y train Y test and we're using SK learned model selection train test split I know what a mouthful and then we will put instead of cancer data and cancer on target which will work we'll just put x and y here and notice I just increased this size to 20% for our test size doesn't really matter I just wanted some more data to test with but again you guys can play around with this number I wouldn't really go any higher than 30% though okay so now we've got our data let's have a look at it make sure everything looks fine so let's just print X underscore train and let's just do one underscore train as well just to see what these look like okay so we've printed them out now and we can see we've got a bunch of like crazy decimal numbers right and then our woody call it here are labels or our targets are all gonna be one or zero where's your representative benign and one represents or what am I saying zero represents malignant one represents benign so what I'm actually gonna do is I'm going to copy this list here cuz I'm gonna use this later and what I'm gonna just do is do classes like this is equal to and I'm just gonna copy this in here so that when we get those zeros and ones later and we want to print to print out the actual answer we can just index them in this list so I know this video has been short and it's been a lot more just kind of about the series than actually loading in data but this is all I'm doing for right now the next video will be going over how SVM's work that's gonna be a pretty detailed explanation and then we're gonna get into obviously implementing the algorithm doing some stuff with that and then moving into neural networks if you guys are excited for the rest of the videos please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the other ones
