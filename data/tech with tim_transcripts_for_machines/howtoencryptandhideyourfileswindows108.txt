hey guys welcome back to another video in today's video I'm gonna be talking about how you can encrypt a folder and how you can hide it so that if other people are using your computer or you just want to be extra secure about some files you have you can keep them safe and out of the average users eye so just to clarify here this is not an advanced technique it's extremely simple anybody is able to do it and because of that it's also not extremely secure but if you just want a little bit of extra protection on some of your files maybe you're storing a password or something this is a great way that you can do it and it's very easy you don't have to download any other programs so let's go ahead and let's get started so obviously we need a folder or a file that we want to secure so in this case I'm just gonna do a folder I'm just gonna name it secure like that you can name it whatever you want you can place it wherever you want I'm just putting mine on the desktop so that we can see it right there and just note that you can't actually see the folder you can open it up and it's on the desktop right there where my cursor is okay so the first thing we're gonna do here is we're actually just going to populate this folder so I'm just gonna put in a text file name it password and then inside here it doesn't really matter you don't have to put anything that I'm just gonna put one two three like that so that might be our password for something and we want to protect that so now in order to encrypt this folder which is the first step we have to rightclick on it scroll all the way down to where it says options or sorry properties so it says properties and then you're gonna click on this Advanced tab under the general setting here okay now here you can see there's a few options what we want to click is encrypt contents to secure data so you're gonna click that checkmark and then you're gonna go ahead and click OK and there you go you've now encrypted it so now we want to do is just click apply and here we go so now it says you have chosen to make the following attribute changes to encrypt so you want to make sure the second one here is checked so apply changes to folder subfolders and files that means anything inside of the folder will also be encrypted go ahead and click OK and there you go you're done so now you've encrypted this file inside of the folder and you can see I can't really zoom in here but if you can see there's a little law on the actual file so it's different if I make a new text file it might we'll see if it puts that lock there yeah so everything inside that folder will be encrypted and you can see that there okay so now the next step so we have it encrypted but if you actually see here we can open it up and it does like it doesn't ask for a password or anything so say someone else is using the same user as you and you wanted to make this more secure what you can actually do is you can hide this folder so you see here on our desktop it shows the folder you can see it the name and the little lock now if we want to actually hide this we can just right click on the folder again you may have seen this option before if we go to properties you can actually checkmark hidden right there and then if you go ahead and apply that so again you're just going to apply to the folder and the subfolders you click OK ok like that you can see the folder actually disappears and if I try to click where it was nothing's popping up and we can't seem to grab it so now the question might be well how do we actually find that folder so if we want to see that folder what we need to do is we need to go to the View tab and our windows explorer and we just need to check mark this box here that says hidden items now when we check that you see two folders come up so the folder that I made before called test doesn't everything in it and then this secure folder right here so again then we can see our password text in there and if we want to hide it all we have to do is go to view and then uncheck hidden items like that now again is an extremely simple task nothing advanced it all about it but just say you want a little extra security on your files that's a really easy way that you can encrypt it and hide it and make sure that the average user won't be able to find it again if you want more security on it then you would have to encrypt it more maybe put a password protection on it but this is just a little bit extra security all right so that's it for this video if you liked please like and subscribe and I will see you again in another video
