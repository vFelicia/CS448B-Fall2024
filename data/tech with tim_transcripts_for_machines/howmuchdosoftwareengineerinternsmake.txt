hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to be talking to you about how much software engineering interns make now i'm not just going to be looking at websites and taking all the information that you guys can look up yourself i'm actually going to walk you through some of the job offers that i've been given for a software engineering intern position and talk about the difference in compensation between u.s tech companies and canadian tech companies now not to spoil anything but as you guys know if you work in the us you get paid a lot more than if you work in pretty much any other country for software engineering and i was pretty surprised at how much less i actually was offered for an internship position in canada than i was in the us even for the exact same company so in this video i'm actually going to share with you some real figures i'm going to tell you exactly what i was paid when i worked at microsoft what i was offered from shopify and what i was offered for my second internship for microsoft which i actually declined and then i'll talk to you about things like signing bonus relocation and then just some other kind of salary figures that i know for people that work in the space and that have worked as software engineering interns at other large companies like say tesla google facebook amazon so on and so forth but

description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform so i'm just going to start by stating that i totally know that these numbers are extremely inflated and very high that i'm about to show to you the reason for that is i'm kind of taking this information from very large big tech companies of course if you're working for smaller tech companies maybe not as say name brand tech company startup stuff like that your compensation is going to be drastically less than what i'm putting here that doesn't mean that's a bad job doesn't mean you shouldn't take it and of course these jobs that i'm talking about are very difficult to get and there's hundreds of thousands of students and just other people that want to work in these internship positions so it is somewhat justified that you get paid that much uh but anyways i just want to say i'm totally aware this is not the average salary for a software engineering intern this is more referencing big tech companies kind of the facebook's amazon's microsoft's of the world so anyways let me just share with you some base salaries for different tech positions at least ones that i was offered and that i worked in so i'll start with the internship that i actually did this was at microsoft i started in may of 2020 finished in i guess august of 2020 and i worked there for 12 weeks so i had three months working at microsoft and the base salary that they offered me in u.s dollars was 7 850 us dollars per month so for me in canada that is a ton of money i mean even in u.s dollars that's a ton of money anyways but that was about 10 900 canadian dollars at the time due to the exchange rate being something like 1.27 from us dollar to canadian dollar now the reason why i was paid in us dollars was because my job position was actually in redmond washington at microsoft home base so that's like where the offer was for and i had actually flown to redmond washington done the onsite interviews in kind of early january of 2020 then obviously the pandemic happened and then we moved to work from home however since i had signed a u.s job offer they had to pay me the same compensation that i had signed and so i was paid out in canadian dollars from the microsoft canada office but what the us compensation was that they offered me so hopefully that makes sense but that's kind of the reason why i was getting a u.s rate even though i was working and living in canada it was because before the pandemic happened i had signed the job offer to work in the u.s and then they couldn't allow me to actually go to the us because of the pandemic and so they kept the same compensation everything but just switched the currency to canadian dollars and did the appropriate conversion now some other base salaries that i've been offered so first of all i got a return offer from microsoft that i actually declined i'm not going to be working at microsoft this year for an internship again the reason why they gave me another internship is because i was too young to have a fulltime position right now i'm technically in my third year of university just finishing that um and so they had to give me another internship anyways the salary for that internship was the exact same 7850 us dollars per month and then they actually offered me a 5 000 us dollar signing bonus for returning as an intern one more time now when they sent me that offer so the second kind of return offer the assumption was i would actually be working in seattle washington or i'd be working in redmond washington i always mix up seattle and redmond they're kind of right beside each other in washington state anyways uh that's what they offered me so they offered me 7850 plus 5 000 signing bonus and then what happened is they realized that i wasn't actually going to be able to go to redmond again because of the pandemic and so what they did is they retracted that offer from me and then they gave me another offer based on the location i was going to be working in which was kind of the toronto area in canada now this second offer that they gave to me was drastically different than the first actually have it in front of me right now i'm looking at it to make sure i don't get this wrong and the compensation then that they offered me for the kind of canadian position was only 5 300 canadian per month so i'm not saying only as if that's not a lot of money but relative to what they had offered me before that's about half so previously it was like 10 900 canadian now it's 5300 canadian dollars and the reason why that compensation is so much lower is because cost of living and whatever other reasons they want to state but essentially because i was working in canada they pretty much sliced my uh compensation in half and then they even reduced the signing bonus to 3 500 canadian dollars so that kind of gives you the idea of the difference between working in canada versus working in the us even just at an intern level and of course there's a lot more stuff that happens when you're going to be a fulltime employee but that is kind of the base salary and then i guess signing bonuses that i was offered now the last internship position that i was offered was at shopify in canada so this was actually in the ottawa office for shopify and i was offered 33 an hour as a backend developer intern now i'd be working 40 hours a week so let me just pop up the calculator on my phone here and do the math so 40 times what i say 33 so that's 1320 dollars per week times four weeks so that's about 5280 a month so that's about on track with what uh the microsoft canada offer letter was so that's kind of my experience with salaries and signing bonuses from tech companies at an intern level position but i'll tell you about a few of my friends i won't obviously name them they told me the salaries they were making so one of my friends worked at tesla and first of all he said that working at tesla was great it was a really good time but all interns were pretty much expected to be working 60plus hours a week so take that into consideration when i tell you this number he said that during his first year working at tesla he was getting paid 13 000 canadian dollars per month to work there as an intern he was working on the back end and doing something with like autonomous vehicles i mean you know that sounds very generic because that's what tesla does but he was actually working on like the ai side of that and some server component or something along those lines i then had a few people that worked at google that i knew and they were making about 11 500 canadian per month uh and that's pretty much all that i can remember um there's a few other people that i knew that worked on at amazon and all of that but i don't think they ever shared their salaries with me so anyways that is kind of the range for working for large big tech companies now of course that is in the u.s like you have to work in the us to make that kind of money but obviously even coming to canada 5300 a month for no experience and learning a ton and having this on your resume is obviously not a bad gig whatsoever all right so now i'm going to move on to the other aspects of compensation because that's not the only thing that they give you when you work at these large tech companies a lot of the times there's relocation lump sum payments um there is like vacation paid tax gross up all kinds of other things that actually are definitely worth considering kind of as a part of your total compensation for these companies so for microsoft specifically what they offered me in terms of kind of extra compensation was relocation payment or relocation lump sum so it was kind of two options when it was assumed i was actually going to be flying out to redmond and working in uh in redmond washington option one was microsoft will arrange and pay for all of your housing so you'll live in whatever their corporate housing is you don't really have a choice on where you're going to be or if you have roommates or any of that kind of stuff but they'll arrange it for you they'll pay for it for you so that was the first option the second option was microsoft will pay you a lump sum seven thousand us dollars and you arrange your own housing um when you're actually working for microsoft now there was another aspect of that there was also i'm calling that relocation uh but there was another like travel kind of incentive or travel bonus whatever you want to call it where they would pay for your plane ticket there and back or they would cover all of your expenses related to driving to your internship and driving back including a onenight hotel stay or something like that and then they also will reimburse you for all expenses related to travel so like if you ate meals at the airport or stuff like that then they would pay you back for that finally they also had a rental car option this is what i was actually going to do when i was going to be working at microsoft and i thought i was going to be flying out there they have partnerships with a bunch of bunch of rental car companies and so i think they had a rate of like 300 per month that they offered to interns to rent out some some vehicle now that's a lot cheaper than if you were to rent it just straight from the rental car company so something to consider finally as a part of the kind of remote um offer letter whatever you want to call it they also included equipment so they provided you i'm looking right here um actually it doesn't say exactly how much money but they provided you with the laptop monitor keyboard mouse docking station headset and something else and actually at the end of my first internship i did at microsoft since it was remote all of that stuff that they offered to me i got to keep except for the laptop so i got to keep the docking station the monitor keyboard mouse headset and then i had to send back the actual laptop and the laptop they sent you is like pretty souped up like you know a good nice computer so i can understand why they wanted it back other than that there's a ton of other just kind of like random miscellaneous things that they'll give you for example there's like a free gym membership there's a tax gross up a tax gross up means that since all of these kind of relocations things are considered taxable income so like if you get paid you know five thousand dollars from microsoft to relocate to redmond washington for example you have to pay tax on that amount microsoft will actually pay a portion of that tax for you to the government so that it offsets your kind of tax burden they call that a tax gross up other than that i'm looking through the kind of offer right now there's a four percent vacation pay um obviously you get all of your stat holidays and i think that's pretty much it related to compensation at these companies now i will say uh the shopify offer had a few things related to this as well obviously there wasn't any relocation bonuses because i was actually close enough that i could have walked to work when i was living in ottawa and would have been working at the shopify ottawa office but they did provide you with twelve hundred dollars towards like a fitness and and gym kind of budget type of thing so if you wanted to buy a bike or you wanted to get a gym membership or anything like that then you could use the 1200 they provided you to do that they also provided um what is it money for remote work so one of my friends who worked at shopify was given i think 1200 or 1500 dollars like build her own home office buy a monitor whatever she wants and then they provided a laptop as well so anyways i think that's all i really need to talk about related to compensation as an intern at these tech companies it's relatively sim similar to a fulltime position except you're not getting stock at least i don't know any interns that have gotten stock at these different companies but yeah these salaries are just crazy high it kind of blew my mind when i was actually offered that salary the first time and then even comparing it to canadian salaries right it just goes to show you that if you want to make the real money working in the us is really the place to be or at least working remotely with a us job offer so anyways i hope this gave you guys some insight i apologize if it was kind of all over the place just trying to give you all of the information that i have if you enjoyed the video make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another youtube video
