in this video I'll be showing you how to use f strings a faster way to construct strings in Python that does not involve the use of something like format % or simply adding strings together using the plus sign now without our previous knowledge of f strings if we wanted to create a string that said my name is the variable name and I am the variable age years old these are the three ways we would probably go about doing that the first way is definitely the most tedious having to add strings together and then converting our integers into strengths that we can add them in here and the second way is annoying as well we have to format with 0 1 keep track of those indexes and then add adult format at the end of the string and then lastly we have this method with the percent signs where we can do % s % I name age now a much faster way to do this is using F strings so what is an F string what F string is simply a string that starts with a lowercase or capital F now if the string could obviously be single or double quotation marks and again it doesn't matter if it's capital or lowercase and what we can do is simply type my name is and put any variables or expressions that aren't a string inside of curly braces and this will evaluate it as a string so my name is Tim and I am in this case age years bold now we can do things like add values in here so H plus 4 H + 5 the values of course don't have to be strings as age is a number and this will work fine so let me prove it to you by printing ex4 like that we'll have a look at it now and you can see my name is Tim and I am 19 years old and that does indeed work so that is how f strings work they're very useful you can put them directly inside print statements as well inside function calls inside whatever you want and they just save you a lot of time and avoid kind of this massive doing the percents and the formats and all of that
