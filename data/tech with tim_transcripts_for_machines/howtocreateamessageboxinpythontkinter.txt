hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so I just want to start off by apologizing I haven't been posting for about the past five days have been extremely busy and I haven't found the time to record any videos so I'm trying to get this one out for you guys today and I am working on doing a whole series on what I'm gonna be showing you which is tkinter so hopefully I'm gonna have a tutorial series for that out in about a week or so but for now it's a little sneak peek on some of the things you can do using a tkinter molecule and Pegeen now this video is gonna go over how to create a message box in tkinter in Python sorry not pi game Python all those can be used in PI game as well and it's extremely useful as a lot of times you want to display information to the user you want to ask them a question but you don't want to create your own form for that you just want to have a simple line that you can type in that's gonna allow you to do that so I'm gonna show you an example here quickly what I mean so for example we have this message box that pops up it says question and that do you have brown hair and they obviously you would say yes or no for this this is just an example of where it has the option to click OK so that would just be something where you're showing information to the user so let's get started right away with the tutorial on how to do this I'm gonna be showing you all different kinds of message boxes and the if you want to skip about a minute or two in that's where I'm gonna be talking about the question message box is where it says yes/no for example okay so we want to start here by just importing these two these two things up here so we have from tkinter import starters means to import everything and then from tkinter import message box so this just means that we don't have to type tkinter dot message box every single time so it makes you have those two lines and then we're gonna set up our main window now this window is actually gonna be invisible but pretty much whenever you should want to do anything in tkinter you have to have a window set up so we just set up the window to start so that we can make it disappear so that it's you'll see what I mean in just a second I'll show you so we say window equals TK windowed eval all this is gonna do here this line if you want to copy it out is simply gonna put our window in the middle of the screen on the top level of everything so that means that once we open up the window once we have the program it's not going to be hidden behind another window it's gonna make sure it's as for as far in front as possible a lot of times what if you don't put this is it's gonna end up behind something and you're not gonna be able to see it so it's a really useful line to put and then we're just gonna withdraw our window and what this does is it's gonna make our window invisible so still going to be on the top level we're just not going to be able to see it so that the all we're gonna see is the message box when it pops up so if I get rid of this line here I'll show you what I mean in case anybody's confused pretty much you see we have this ugly little window behind so we want to make that disappear so that's why we do with drill ok the next line here is the line it's actually gonna show our message box so to do any message box starts off with message box dot and then show you can also do show error show warning these are the different kind of icons that you can use and it's gonna say this is gonna be our title here on the first set of quotations on a comma and then the context or the text that's gonna be on it so you saw mine if I ran the program here we have this the title and then thing here and it's the little info icon now if you wanted to show an error you would type show air and all that this does is it changes a little icon to an X showing an error the other one that they have is show warning like that there you go the warning sign those are the three different icons for the text boxes these last lines here these just make sure that we're quitting our window once we are finished so that it's no longer shown on the screen so make sure you've got put this in at the bottom usually all I do is window dot quit but these two just ensure that everything's gone ok after that now I'm gonna show you guys how we can ask the question so ask yes or no so for example this question here do you have brown hair really it should it shouldn't just say ok we should be able to answer yes or no so to be able to do that we're gonna say message box dot then ask and we're just gonna say yes no so this is gonna ask a yes/no question is just gonna allow us to have the buttons yes/no on our thing you can see here do you have brown hair and now we're able to answer with either a yes or a No now the thing is though we can answer the question but how do we actually check the answer because right now nothing's happening it's just we're simply clicking the button and then the way disappears so to do so all you have to do is before your message box you do if so now we're just going to be checking if the result of this message box is equal to true meaning it's equal to yes then we'll simply print we'll say yes otherwise we will print no and then that way we're able to get the answer to our question so if we click run the program do you have brown hair click no it says no there again if we do this one more time do you have brown hair I click yes yes there you so that's a pretty useful there now say you wanted this to be a different icon so you saw we have a little info icon there if you click if you do a little column at the end and you say icon you can set it equal to what you like so info warning or air like so and then that way it'll change the icon for you so now you see that we have the little error icon here now these are really useful just in a bunch of programs to be able to use and that you'll find them really helpful if you just want to ask a simple question for the user you don't want to create a new form the other types of message box that we can do is we can say ask ok cancel so this is gonna be a similar thing if you click OK gives you the yes because that's the true I don't know that's how it works and same thing if you click cancel then it gives you no we can also ask one other type for these little questions which is retry or cancel so there you have we have the buttons change down to retry or cancel again if you click retry that get that returns true from the message box so yeah that's pretty much been my tutorial on how to create a message box in Python using tkinter if you guys have any questions feel free to leave them down below I'll be sure to try to respond to those and
