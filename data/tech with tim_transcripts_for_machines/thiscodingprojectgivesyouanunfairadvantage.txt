I'm here to tell you that most your programming projects suck the reason for that is they don't demonstrate the skills employers need to see to actually give you a jum the best project you can work on is one that demonstrates you not only know how to code but to architect a solution and a project employers need to see that you have the ability to build something from scratch to plan on your own and to make design decisions even if they're relatively minor this is why I typically recommend building a full stack application you want to build a nice front end a backend connect those with an API have some kind of database and go into the interview ready to explain the different decisions you made why you chose those decisions and how you came up with the basic architecture and data flow of the application if you can do that you're immediately going to stand out and you'll notice in a lot of interviews that's what they're looking for not your coding ability your ability to design and plan now if you want to learn more about exactly how to land a software development position I have a free introduction course that you can sign up for from the link in the pinned comment
