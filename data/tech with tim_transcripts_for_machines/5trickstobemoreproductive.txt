hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to share with you five tips tricks to become more productive now these are not magic things that you can just go do and all of a sudden be the most productive human being these are just five kind of ideas philosophies that i've come up with over the past few years that have really worked well for me and allowed me to get a lot done in the time that i spend working this video is not at all going to be trying to tell you to work super hard go do you know 14 16 hours days that's not the point of this whatsoever it's how can you maximize what you get done in the time that you're working you guys know yourself you know your own lives you can pick how much time you want to work in a day and hopefully these kind of philosophies ideas tips whatever you want to call them will help you kind of realize what it is you need to do to actually get more done in a day now the reason i'm making this video is because a lot of you guys ask me all of the time tim i see you're a pretty young guy i know you are in school now you're doing youtube you're working for algo expert and other companies how do you get all this stuff done how do you find the motivation how do you actually just you know get all of this work done in one day it seems like a lot and well i'll try to answer that question in this video but the first thing i want to say here is that everyone is different right this stuff is not going to work for everybody this is just what worked for me i probably work a lot longer than most of you guys and there's pros and cons to doing that and so you can't really judge your productivity based on someone else you have to judge it on yourself are you more productive than you were yesterday that's really the only metric you should go be going based off of you can't look at some random person on the internet and be like oh i'm not as productive as them when in reality you have no idea what they do in a day what their schedule or time looks like and what they might be sacrificing to kind of get that productivity anyways sorry for the long intro let's get into the video after a quick word from our

get started using algo expert today by clicking the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform alright so let's go ahead and dive in the first tip slash trick i have for you is to have a goal and actually to have multiple goals now this is extremely important and one of the reasons for this is it's very hard to work hard and be productive if you don't know why you're doing that right that's like pretty much anything if someone tells you to do something and it doesn't make sense to you you're much less likely to do it i remember as a kid all the time i would just not do what teachers told me because it wouldn't make sense what they were asking me to do and until someone explained to me why it was i needed to get something done or why i needed to do this then i would actually go ahead and do it now the same thing happens here in just general life when it comes to productivity let's say you're in a computer science major trying to pick something that's probably relatable for some of you and you guys are just lazy unproductive you're like oh i don't like this i don't want to do this one of the main reasons you're probably like that is because you don't actually know why it is you're doing this computer science major you haven't created those goals in your head and when i'm talking about goals i'm saying something like where do you want to be in 30 years where do you want to be in 25 years what's the point of getting a degree what's the point of this education do you know that do you have that reason kind of stored up in your brain are you thinking about that as you go and work towards this goal for a lot of people the answer is no and so you have to have goals to be able to become productive again you can't work on something very hard and be productive you don't know why it is that you're doing that so you either have to come up with the reasons even if they don't make you know the total complete sense but you have to convince yourself that what you're doing is worth it and once you do that then your brain kind of says okay it is worth it for me to stay up an extra hour and work on this it is a good use of my time to you know grind this and study this and get an a and well you have to have goals now i'm just picking a very kind of naive example which is school but let's put this to my youtube channel here the only reason why i've been able to grow this youtube channel is because the goal of mine has been okay i want to achieve financial freedom i want to be the best tech educator on the internet i have these very large goals and every day i analyze what i'm doing and i say am i working towards these goals and you know when i'm super tired and exhausted i wake up in the morning ready to film a video i say why am i filming this video it's because it's helping me achieve this goal if i didn't have these goals you're kind of just meaninglessly doing activities and it's very hard to justify especially when you're tired or demotivated why you should go and continue to do that and of course that's going to lead to a lack of productivity so it's hard to really articulate this but you can even think of this in a very large picture when it comes to organizations most organizations fail because they don't have a clear vision or kind of road map from the top of the organization have you ever been at a company where you're doing something but you don't know why you're doing it it's not leading towards the vision or the mission of the company those companies are usually not great places to work out yeah maybe you'll go in and kind of do your eight hours just to get paid but you're not motivated you're not excited you don't know why it is you're doing a task and you guys could probably relate to this in almost every area of life when someone asks you to do something but doesn't explain to you why and it doesn't make sense to you you're a lot less likely to want to go and do that thing because you don't know why it is that you're doing that and same thing when it comes to getting a degree same thing when it comes to you know staying up an extra hour at night to read whatever it is you have to have a goal and usually a large goal in mind so you can justify those activities so i could talk about this in an entire video just goal setting maybe i'll do that let me know if you guys want to see that i think that might be an interesting video but let's move on to the next point now hopefully you guys got the idea from that all right so the second point i have for you is much more of a mindset thing but this is to help your future self now you're going to notice that all these points and tips whatever are very related to each other and when i say help your future self what i'm talking about is to think of what you're doing as something that you're doing to help yourself in the future now to give you a really simple example let's say you get an assignment okay and this week maybe you're not super busy you have this maybe programming assignment let's say it's going to take you four or five hours to finish you could leave it till the very last minute you could do it the next day whatever but if you adopt the mindset of hey in the future i might not want to do this i might be tired i might want to go hang out with my friends right now i have a few hours why don't i just knock it out so that in the future i'm going to say oh thank god tim already did that assignment now i'm speaking in the third person but you know what i mean and this is a very rewarding thing because what ends up happening when you adopt this mayans and you say you know what i'm going to do this now so i don't have to do in the future so when i'm tired i can just sleep in that extra hour in the morning so i can go hang out with my friends life becomes just a lot more enjoyable you don't have any stress you don't have any deadlines you need to complete because you've helped yourself in the future you've said all right i know i have time now i'm in a state where i can finish this now let's get it done and then in the future i'm going to thank myself when i want to go to that party or i want to go and play video games or whatever because i don't have this kind of looming deadline and the stuff that i need to finish and this relieves stress a lot especially if you apply this to kind of a school scenario if you do all of your assignments immediately when you get them you just get stuff done when you're capable of getting it done and you don't waste time it's just a much better way to kind of go through school and go through life because you're not constantly stressed am i going to finish this am i going to have enough time am i going to have to do a 14 hour night you don't have to deal with that anymore and that's a huge mental load kind of relieved and that's the way that i really navigated school and was able to get all of the stuff that i did done was because i did it very early and i was never like grinding last minute to finish something because i just did it earlier in the week and i never had a deadline that i felt like i needed to hit so this is a very specific example with school but apply this to every single scenario even something like a degree okay it might suck for four years to go through school and you might be miserable and you might be broke but in four years are you going to thank yourself for getting this degree done maybe right you have to answer that question and so that's the way i always think about things i'm putting in a sacrifice now to help myself in the future and in the future i'm going to thank myself for putting in those long hours or working hard or being productive or whatever it may be so really just a mindset thing obviously much easier said than done but that's the way that i look at things and that's one of the ways i'm able to justify getting a lot done kind of in the present moment all right so the next point i have for you is another very important one if you get only one point from this list this is the one that i would recommend really kind of focusing on and this is to measure your productivity with outcome not time now this is so extremely important because time does not state how productive you were in a day what i mean by this is a lot of people think hey i went to class for four hours today or hey i went to my job for eight hours or i worked on this project for six hours and they measure their productivity in terms of hours spent that is not a good way to measure productivity because you can spend and waste hours in pretty much any way right what you should really be doing is looking at okay i spent this much time doing this today what was the outcome of that time what did i actually get done for example i can say i spent five hours working on this youtube video but if i only got done one youtube video in five hours was that productive right that was the outcome of my five hours spent if i had maybe two hours but i finished two videos when was i more productive when i finished two videos right so that's what you need to look at it's not how much time did you spend working in a day it's what did you get done in a day and are you happy with that outcome that's the way you have to look at things because if you look at it in terms of time inevitably you're not going to be the most productive in that time you're going to try to spend extra time doing things like going to uh you know maybe an extra class or like watching videos online or whatever that aren't actually a good use of your time and that are not leading you to be productive now the best real example of this i'd like to give is going to class in school now i'm not here to try to encourage anyone to just skip classes but for me what worked really well in school was going to about 20 of my classes that was actually the amount of class that i went to i probably skipped almost all of second year almost all of third year and only went to like absolutely mandatory classes and the reason for that was not because i just hated the professors and was just a lazy student it was because i knew that my time was better spent and i was more productive on my own on my computer reading the notes reading the textbook and self studying that's the way i learned that's what works best for me and so if i measured my time in terms of how much time i spent on school in a day i wouldn't have realized that because i would have thought spending four hours in lectures was me being productive when in reality i could achieve the same learning outcome in like an hour and a half on my own and so i would say i'm much more productive by staying home right or not going to class reading it myself than i am on going to class even though it's kind of this false sense of oh i spent three or four hours must have meant i had a good productive day right same thing when you go to the gym you can go to the gym for an hour and a half and do the same number of exercises that i do in half an hour who was really more productive if you say well i went to the gym for an hour and a half that means i'm productive that's the wrong way to look at it you have to say how much did i get done in that time that i was there so time is not not important you do have to measure time spent but it's really more focused on the outcome and that's why you see you know all kinds of entrepreneurs and random people saying you know i only work eight hours a week only work seven hours a week well if they can get done in eight hours what you get done in 40 who is being more productive right that's what you really have to think about so anyways that's that point right there now let's move on to the next one all right so point number four something's a little bit more mainstream and obvious but this is to plan far in advance when i say far in advance i'm not talking about years i'm talking about months right understand what weeks in the month or what days of the month you're going to have that are much busier than others because this allows you to balance your time now for me what allows me to be productive is working relatively the same amount of time every single day i do not want to work 12 hours in one day and zero in the next i would much rather work six in each day and have time each day for fun enjoyment whatever right i would much rather do that maybe that's just me but personally i find that a much better way to be productive it i find you're much more productive working you know five six hours a day than trying to do 12 even though yes you could probably do 12. and so if you plan far in advance you're able to actually kind of manage your time and what you get done and your productivity based on when you know stuff is going to be really busy and when you're not going to have as much time for example next week i'm going away i'm doing you know a weeklong vacation i'm going fishing fun fact so what i've had to do this week is i've had to work a little bit harder but the thing is if i only knew about that this week i would have to grind really really hard to prepare a bunch of videos from when i'm gone but i've known that i'm going to be going away for three months and so over the past three months i've been slowly trying to do you know a little bit extra just to make sure that i didn't have a super heavy week the week before i went away and i could kind of balance my time and i didn't have to do a huge 12hour grind i didn't have to be miserable and that allowed me to stay productive throughout this entire time so that's like a small example but when it comes to school one thing i always do is at the beginning of the semester i spend you know an hour or two looking through all the syllabuses all the course content and i go and i write every single deadline every single assignment in my calendar so i know when i look at this high level overview oh next week's going to be super busy i better do a little bit of extra work right now to make sure i'm not going to have to grind that week and that just helps me become more productive allows me to not be miserable and you know tapping out of exhaustion at the 14 hour mark studying for a midterm and that's just really a great way to kind of you know balance your time and make sure you're not overworking yourself while staying productive so there's not much more that i can really go through here the whole point at least for me and planning far in advance is that you're prepared for what's coming up and you can do extra work now to make sure you're not going to have a huge workload in the future that you're not going to be able to sustain anyways let's move on to the next point all right so the last point i have for you this one is very important and this is to make sure you are allocating time for fun and protecting that time so in your calendar in your daily schedule in whatever way you want to do it i can't tell you how to do this you need to make sure that you have a set time either every day every week every month whatever it may be to do things that you enjoy to make you happy to increase your mental health and to make sure you're not burning yourself out right one of the big problems with productivity and even videos like this is that it kind of tells people that you have to be miserable and you have to go and grind and work super hard and know you don't have time for this and you can't go and hang out with your friends that's absolutely false through the entire time that i've been doing all of this stuff i've made sure that i can go and spend a weekend hanging out with my friends or i can take a week off at any point in time or i can spend three or four hours at night playing video games because those are things that i enjoy doing and i'm not willing to give those up just to call myself more productive there's actually a ton of research and evidence and books and stuff related to how happiness and fun actually affect the success of someone in their career and you can probably guess what i'm going to say but the happier people are often more successful and so if you're thinking about this in a sheer productivity lens then you have to say okay it actually might be very productive for me to spend two hours tonight just doing nothing just hanging out relaxing you know recharging for the next day and that's the way that i think about it and i have a lot of kind of routines i do daily to make sure i'm getting my fun in for example i don't book any meetings usually unless i really have to before 10 am because in the mornings what i like to do is get up have a coffee watch some youtube videos maybe play some video games i've been playing chess recently that's something i really like doing and i'm not willing to give that up and if i don't do that i find myself craving that activity and that really does actually affect my productivity so even though you might think oh i'm spending an hour two hours having fun and enjoying myself that may actually be leading you to have more productivity and success in whatever you're doing so you have to really have the balance i can't tell you how to do this i just wanted to make sure i included this here because everything else i've said is kind of very you know robust go do this go be productive go work help yourself very disciplined right whereas this is kind of the opposite of that and it's saying you know what sometimes you can step back and sometimes it's fine to sleep the entire day maybe that is actually going to make you more productive and so for myself if i find myself burning out or i find myself not enjoying myself not being happy then what i'll often do is okay you know maybe it's actually worth my time to take a day off here and to just relax maybe i'm going to go hang out with my friends maybe i'm going to go out fishing whatever do something that i enjoy so that the next day i'm kind of in a better mindset and ready to actually work and get stuff done all right so with that said i think i'm going to end the video here hopefully you guys found these helpful i'd love to hear your thoughts on them in the comments down below does this stuff work for you do you guys have tips and tricks you want to share with people please do leave them down there regardless i hope you guys enjoyed if you did make sure that like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in the next one
