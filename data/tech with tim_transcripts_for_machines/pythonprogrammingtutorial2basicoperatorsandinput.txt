hey guys so welcome to the second video in the series um if you remember in the last video we talked about data types and variables we want briefly into some of the things that Python can do today I'm going to be talking about operators and we're going to be doing some print statements some input a little a few small console applications I'm just applying some of the knowledge that we've learned so pretty much the first thing I want to do is I want to go back and I want to view what we did in the last lesson very quickly so we talked about variables and data types so for example will be X variable we could set it to something equal to two like that a name we made equal to our name right so I make that equal to Tim so there we go we have the name right there equal to 10 we'll start with that okay now if you remember the last one I didn't talk about this but I used something called print now the print statement pretty much takes an argument so inside these brackets the thing that is inside that brackets is called the argument so it takes a string argument usually so I will give it the name so now you'll see again we did this in a lasso I just want a review i'm clicking f5 simply to run the program when i go to the console it simply puts tim onto the console just like that right okay um very basic we already doing that so now let's say well we want to do something else so let's let's print here and we're just going to put a string and we're just going to type this in ourselves let's say hello comma what is your name that's going to print to the console now we want to get what the user's name is now there's a way to do this in Python it's very simple we're going to make a variable name it makes sense to put the variable name here do an equal sign because it's a variable right we're going to type the word input just like this now what's going to happen if I run the program here I'll show you is going to say hello what is your name and it can actually allow me now to type into the console which I couldn't do before now nothing happens after when I click enter because we don't have anything else after that but it's allowing me to type okay so now well we want to print out what the name is that was said so let's just simply type print and then name alright and we have hello what is your name I say oh well my name is Tim it says Tim all right now well we just printed out the name but maybe we want to go a little more advanced than that we want to say well hello Tim how are you doing Tim something like that right so I'm going to just put a comma here I'm going to separate these two things and I'm going to put in a string I'm just going to type it like the types let me say hello with a comma and then you see that I have this other comma here that is outside of the quotations meaning it's not a string it's actually just separating the two arguments in here and you'll notice what happens now when I print is it goes hello is your name's I say oh my name is Jim it says hello Tim right so let's pretty straightforward I hope that's easy to understand we're just using the input to get an input and then we're printing it back out to the screen okay so let's do let's go into the next part of this now we'll use that again later but let's talk about operators so operator that term may sound familiar to you in math we use things called operators so these four offers hopefully should look familiar to you this is a plus sign this is the addition operator we have the minus sign which is the subtraction operator the division sign which is the well division operator and then the multiplication sign which is again the multiplication operator so there's a few more operators I will talk about but these are the four basic ones in Python now you remember how I talked to you about data types this is where this comes in when we use these operators it's important that we use them on certain data types so for example in math I could do something like 3 plus 4 right so what is 3 plus 4 equal well that is equal to 7 so the computer can actually do that math operation by using that operator to return this value so let's let's give an example here quickly so I have let's do num1 we're going to use variables here remember I can use a number in the variable as long as it's not at the beginning and I'm going to give it a value of 45 and then we'll do num2 and we're going to a value of three now if I want to print to the console let's say num1 plus num2 well you can guess what that's going to give us it's going to give us 45 plus 3d I hope this is not air yeah so that gave us 48 right so oops didn't mean to make that fullscreen num1 plus num2 is 48 all right so now what about let's try this 42 basic we can do multiplication here with the multiplication sign there you go 135 and then we'll try again with the division sign just to show you all of them we get 15 point Oh like that okay so that's pretty straightforward on those four basic operators now in Python there's a few more operators that we want to talk about now for example in math we have something called exponents right so how do we do exponents in Python well it's actually 2 stars is how you do an exponent all right and now maybe there's something called integer division which I'll get into later but I'll just show you the operated for it right now it's two slashes that means I'll give you an example of math example here 64 divided by let's do 10 would give us usually in math a value of 6.4 right that's if you use one division sign sorry what am i doing times I mean divided by will give us 64 I've 6.4 but now if we do two division signs here like this it actually gives us a value of 6 that's because it just it doesn't worry about the remainder at all it just tells us how many times 10 can go into 64 and that's all it can go in 6 times evenly so it gives us a whole number as our answer that's called integer division this double double slash like this okay and then we have another operator which is actually the modulus operator so this is the percentage sign and this gives us B remainder so here if I do five modulus two then the remainder of that is actually 1 because 5 divided by 2 is 4 then with a remainder of 1 right so it's not going to give us the decimal point it's again just going to give us the remainder if I did 5 divided by 4 again the remainder is 1 5 divided by 3 the remainder would be 2 like that ok so that's what the modulus sign gives us so both modules here and then there's probably a few others that I'm forgetting about but we can go into those later so now same thing let's keep using our number of variables here and now let's introduce a third variable called num 3 now I want to show you how we can use the variables so num 1 and let's see if you remember what this operator is so that's the exponent operator so that means num 1 which is going to be our base which is 45 raised to the power of 4 because we're gonna use num2 and we can print num 3 press ok and you can see we get a pretty large number that's because of how exponents work and then same thing here if we want to do maybe integer division see what we're gonna get we had 11 write a whole number and then say we won't do modulus we get 1 okay so now let's tie all these things together with the operators that we've used the variables the prints and the inputs so um let's start by just get doing with print statement saying pick a number okay pretty basic we're gonna pick a number and then we're going to take the inputs we're going to say number 1 again is equal to the input of that okay so we got the input a number 1 now let's say print pick another number all right so now we're going to pick another number so we're going to do num2 is equal to input like that and now what we're going to do is we're gonna introduce our third variable so we'll call it sum because we're going to add these equal to num 1 plus not me and now actually you can't use some because it's a reserved word so let's just do in all capital sum because remember how we talked to a variables capitals and lowercase they're different and then we're going to print to the console the sum like that okay so we run the program sets pick a number let's figure number let's say 4 and let's do 32 now what do you think it's going to be oh oops okay so yeah someone because num1 plus num2 okay so this is why i talked about datatypes so I'm actually happy this happened it's because what actually happens when we get the input of something is it gives us the type of a string which in this case is not what we wanted to do so you saw there I'll run it again it's a good mistake this happened actually we have four and we have a three and it gave us 43 that's just because we added the string four to the string three so that simply gave us 43 but now we know an actual math that 4 plus 3 equals 7 so if we want to do the integers we have to actually convert these variables into integers so in order to do that remember I showed you the keyword int like this before we're just going to put brackets around our two variables here like this experience and now hopefully we should get the correct answer when we do 4 and we do 3 and you can see we've got 7 so I didn't mean for that to happen originally but I'm happy it did because it shows us why data types are important so when we take the input of something we're typing it from the keyboard and that is actually a string so here we can print again don't worry about what I'm doing right now but I just want to show you the type which is going to give us if it's a string if it's an integer of num2 just to show you what the type actually is so we pick a number we pick 2 and we pick 3 it tells us that three is actually a string so that's why when we added originally three and two or two and three or whatever it was it gave us just them added together sub two and three rather than what it should be which is five okay now same thing here if we had a number and we wanted to convert it into a string all we would do is we'd type STR around the numbers so for example three and then that would give us three just like that so string so now we've kind of gone over conversion of variables conversion of numbers datatypes how to get input from the console using the input like this and some basic operators of Python so view this I hope you followed along and then in the next lesson move into some more advanced operators and we'll maybe start with conditions okay I hope you enjoyed please
