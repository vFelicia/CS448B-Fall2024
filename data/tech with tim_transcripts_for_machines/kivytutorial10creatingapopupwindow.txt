hey guns and welcome back to another Kibby tutorial so in today's video I'm gonna be showing you how to create popup windows which is actually very useful and it's super simple to do this as well so I'm just gonna start and kind of build a very basic interface I like GUI and then we're gonna get to actually using those popups putting them on the screen some of the different options how you can add different widgets to it and all that so essentially I have all these things imported we've talked about them before a widget object property label import float layout so I also need to just import popup so I'm going to do is Kavita uix top pop up and we'll import pop up like that now what I'll actually start by doing it just show you guys right away how to make the pop and then I'll work into how we can actually display it onto the screen and like trigger that event and whatnot so I'm gonna create a function I'm just gonna call this show underscore popup like this okay it doesn't need any parameters and all we're gonna do in here is we're gonna create a popup window and show it and that way whenever we want to create a popup all we have to do is just simply call this function and it'll do that for us so you could put this as a method Sapor inside your widget class or inside your my app I'm just gonna leave it as a function obviously feel free to do whatever you want so to create a popup what we need to do is need to have some content for that popup so actually that leads me do we need to create another class so I'm gonna create a class I'm just gonna call this P standing for popup and all I'm gonna do is pass in here and I'm just gonna come to my my dog f K V final sorry that's already empty and what I'm gonna do in here is I'm just going to define a few widgets that I want to go inside of my what do you call it my popup or whatnot so what I'm actually gonna do sir is go back here I'm getting sidetracked and I'm just gonna make this inherit from float layout because what I want my popup window to be is a float layout that contains a few different widgets so this is this to be nice you as I'll see how this works essentially we have a class P inherits from float layout and now we have P and what we're gonna do here is on a few widgets and since this inherits from float layout we can use the size pause and or what am I saying size pause size hint and pause hints that we've used before so let's just start off with a label I will just say the label has a text and the text will just say like you you pressed the button hello that okay and then we'll do size underscore hint and for size underscore hint it can be honestly whatever you want it does really matter I'm just gonna do 0.6 0.2 and 4 pause underscore hints this one will be a bit different I want this to be at the top of the screen so we'll do X and we'll do 0.2 just so we get that centered and then we'll do why I should not why let's do top of one so we go right up to the top now I'll copy this I'm just going to do the same or a similar thing with a button so we'll just change this to B button and you guys can see how this works so the button instead of going for 0.6 let's go 0.8 let's go X 0.1 and we'll change this to Y and 0.1 so now if we actually use P it should have like a label up top and then a button slightly below it and that's all we need and obviously you guys know how to add things into like your classes and float layouts and whatnot okay so we have our float layout here we have widgets we'll do something that in a second but let's get into popup down so essentially the content for our popup is going to be P right so what we need to do is I'm just going to say show is equal to and we'll create a new instance of P and that's just so that we can use this in what we're gonna do in a second so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to say pop should we say let's just say popup window I don't want to name it the same thing as the class that's why I'm okay so popup window equals popup and then in here we have a few things we can use we can use first of all title now obviously the title is gonna be what's at the top of your box in this case I'm just gonna say popup window okay we have content now the content remember is gonna be equal to P because that's what we set here so say content is or not P it's show because that's where we're storing P and then what else do we have well we have a we can there's a bunch of other parameters that we can use as well but we're gonna use a size hint and pause hint as well so I believe actually it might just be size I gotta check no its size is size handicapped so size hint and the here I'm just gonna type none none because I don't want this to dynamically resize I want to just be equal to these same size no matter what so size hint equals sorry none none and then we're gonna do sighs for a static size is going to be equal to 400 400 now you can change the position as well but by default it's gonna come in the middle of the screen which is probably what you want so if you want to read the dog since you don't do that feel free but essentially this is what you usually will want to do now to actually show this window you don't have to add it to a widget or anything like that all you have to do is literally just do popup window dot show I want to say or is it dot huh let's see open that's what this sir I have it open on my other screen sighs forget ok so dot open so once you've created this popup window you have the content you've set the sizes here the reason we do this is just so that we override it with this like absolute size so it doesn't try to dynamically resize and then we just opening it up and it'll just go on top of whatever window we already have created which is really nice and saves us a lot of time now we have this popup window now but how do we actually trigger this and get it to run what what we need to do is create a widget inside of our widgets class ideally a button and when we press that button we're gonna trigger this function so first of all I'm just gonna say well we're already here in this widgets class I'm just gonna say define BTN okay and BTN will do this is just simply gonna call popup window so we'll just do this popup window don't know why that's not showing for me anyways this should work popup window Oh show underscore popup is what I called it my bad show underscore popup okay so now we're just going to call this function whenever this method is called so to call this method well first of all we need to create something for widgets so like we've done before we'll just do widgets and then in here we can just simply create a button and I'm not gonna worry about really sizing this or anything I'm just gonna simply make a button it'll say text and the text will just be equal to press me okay and then we'll say on underscore release all we're gonna do is gonna do route BTN and remember root is gonna call this widget class which just means it's gonna call this method okay awesome so let's run this and see if everything's working okay so you see a button we say press me and when we press press me it pops up a window that says popup when you press the button and then there is obviously another button in here that says you press the button now if you want to add more things to this you could go ahead and do that you know how to now that we've created this little class for it now to get out in this popup you just click anywhere else on the screen you can see it disappears and this is really nice and I don't know I think this popup looks pretty clean and you can really you can dynamically change the size and do a lot of things with it I think it's very useful um so anyway so that's gonna be it for this video if you guys enjoy please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in another one
