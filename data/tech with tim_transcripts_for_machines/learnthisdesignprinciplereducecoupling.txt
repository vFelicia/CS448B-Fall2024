third design principle I have for you is known as reducing coupling now coupling occurs when you have packages modules classes files that are very interdependent on each other so what this means is that you have some package and it relies on this other package and if this other package has some major change to it that's going to affect the package that is depending on it and so having a system that is highly coupled although it may make it easier to implement is going to make it much harder to debug and much harder to fix if anything goes wrong in some of the coupled components if you can make your components in your system as independent as possible that's generally best makes it easier to debug and really it's just a better design in general you don't want to have things that are highly dependent on each other
