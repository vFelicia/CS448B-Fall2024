hey guys and welcome back to another video in today's video I'm gonna be telling you about my favorite IDE for Python development and coding and I'm going over why this is my favorite and kind of showing you a quick glimpse of what this can do so pretty much an IDE is an integrated development environment and it's a little bit more advanced than a basic text editor as it has a lot of tools that can help you when coding and it saves you a lot of time it makes things a lot easier to organize and just to look at in general so a lot of you might notice that I typically code in the standard IDL e it looks something like this we have like a blank file there's nothing special there's no real tools like we have this format tool that's about it this IDE is way better it's called pycharm and I'm gonna be telling you why so the reason I haven't since now been using pycharm for a lot of my videos is because I wanted to test it out and make sure that it really was my favorite and it was good before I introduced it to you guys so I can say now after using it for a few months that I'm pretty comfortable with it and it's much much better than ideally the basic Python text editor so this is what's gonna look what its gonna look like when you download and open up high term for the first time so you can go to this download page which I'm gonna leave in the description down below and just download this community version it's completely free and it has all the features you're gonna need there's not much you need there's not much in the professional version that will really make it that much better experience this is more if you're working with a large team community works better for I don't know individuals so it's gonna look something like this you can either open a project or create a new project in this case I'm gonna open a project just a typical Python project um so pretty much I'm gonna just gonna go to desktop and just find one on here Python let's just open up machine learning for example okay so open up this one and you can see it starts loading us up into a project and already it's giving us tips on cool key bindings and things that we can use in pycharm so that's the name of this IDE and the way this works is it's project based so a project is just pretty much any folder and then if it has any Python files within it all of those are going to be to the same project so you can have multiple within a project and you can create your own projects you can open existing projects and they all have their own settings that you can save within them which makes it really useful so let's just go through kind of the ID Heat IDE here the basic stuff so there's a project tab this is what's gonna show you all of your basic basic files all the things that's in the working directory you have all your files up here so whenever I want to open a new file so and open what's one I don't have open neural networks I just double click on that I'll just open up in this tabbed view and then I can flip between all these files which already makes it really useful if you're working on multiple files or you want to copy and paste things you have to be moving them around your screen you can also split things horizontally and vertically so if I left click on this or right click on it and click split vertically you can see it shows up on the right here I can do the same thing with horizontally so it goes down or it's like that and yeah they also have this really cool structure tab which I just recently found out about actually I know I've been using it for a while but if you click structure it's actually gonna show you the entire structure of your code so I'll make this bigger and you can see that it goes through my class of this pixel class which I have open here and it shows me all of the methods that I have all of the variables the attributes and all of those cool things which is really useful so if you have a long or big files and you want to quickly find something for example I want to find my grade class I can just click on the grade class here on structure it'll bring me right to it and then it lists off again all the methods that I've made and some of the properties that this has so like Len pixels whatever you can go through that it also has variables and functions so guess like this is a function main is a function brings me to that and then these are just my global variables that I have defined and when I click it it brings me right to it so speaking of global variables there's a really cool thing that pycharm dozen it's called refactoring or refract during something like that excuse the thing but anyways if I could click on a variable so highlight it and I right click and I click refactor that's what it is refactor and then I click rename I can change this to for example with like that click refactor and now it actually changes all of the other variables so you saw how to W here it changes that to width changes this one to width same thing I can show you if ID with high tango refactor rename so changing h2 height like that it will change all of the variables within my file here that are named that same thing so this makes it a lot easier if you need to change a variable name which you will have to do a lot in Python to be able to do that okay so next thing I guess to show is just running the file so a lot of people when you download pie chart can confuse on how running files works so the way it works in PyCharm is your what do you call it your project has configurations and they're up here where this says draw number here yours would just say edit configurations or add new configuration to run your files this is a bit complicated but it's really useful once you learn how to do it you just click Edit configurations or add new and then up here in this top left hand corner you can click + select Python as your what your interpreter and then your gonna give a name to your configuration and this is what you're gonna select what is it when you want to run a certain file so you want to name it appropriately to the file you're gonna run for example in this project I have multiple Python files that I could run so if I want to around neural networks I would want to name this one neural oops networks like this so that I know which one I'm clicking to run so then you're gonna go do script path click this little folder icon here and you can simply just find that Python file and it you can run files from this configuration that aren't within the project which is really nice too so I'm gonna click neural networks and then I can also select my Python interpreter a lot of you are probably just gonna have a default like Python 3.7 but you can see that I actually have many different interpreters these because I have Conda interpreter as well so I'm just going to select Python 37 as my main one and then click apply and ok so now if I want to run neural networks I could simply click this run icon here and I'm actually just going to run main so I'll run main and you can see that it pops up a thing here just wait a second it's gonna open up a PI game window in one minute I believe and yeah so it's going through all this whatever and then I can click stop to stop the program at any time that I want so there's also a few things down here so we have run this is obviously what happens when I running your program and you can run multiple instances of programs at once so you can see if I ran a different file so if I run like draw number then another one will come up here and you can close out of them and delete them as you like there's a terminal and this is pretty much like your CMD so if you want to install packages or do stuff like that you can do that right from pycharm and there's a standard Python console so if I run this and I typed like I don't know x equals four and I'd type X it just works like a basic Python console which is really useful you don't have to leave this if you just want to test out what a certain command in Python is gonna do without actually running the whole program and going through all of that now this has really just been some of the basics of pycharm if you'd like me to do a full tutorial going through a lot of the different things that hightime can do then i'm more than happy to do that but i need you guys to let me know that in the comments down below anyways i highly recommend you guys download install pycharm the only downfall to it is it uses a bit more memory than ideally that being said it still doesn't use that much I think for me it uses maybe like seven hundred eight hundred megabytes of RAM which is not that much but it's a lot more than ideal he does anyways that has been it for this video go download PyCharm in the link below this will definitely save you a lot of time when programming and if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in another one
