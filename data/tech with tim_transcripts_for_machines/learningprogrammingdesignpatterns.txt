the next step to really make yourself just a good programmer is to learn about design patterns and architecture a lot of times when you start writing code you write very small programs right maybe something that's 50 lines 100 lines of code but as soon as you get into a very large code base you know you're talking tens of thousands of lines of code you really need to understand the way in which these different pieces of code are going to work together and the way that you're going to structure your program such that you're not going to have to go back and rewrite 10 000 lines of code you need to learn these things so that you can actually work on large systems and get out of the very hobby projects and realize how to work on large systems and real code that you're actually going to see in a production environment
