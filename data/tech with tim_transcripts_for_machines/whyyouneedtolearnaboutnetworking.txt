the next thing that you would need to know to become a backend python developer is some basic networking skills now I think you could probably get away without having this but I would highly recommend spending a few days learning about basic networking so learning about HTTP what is that protocol how does that work how do you serve data over the web learning about IP addresses learning about say firewalls learning about vpns and just again kind of fundamental things related to networking maybe you want to learn why localhost works the way it does about different ports about you know kind of standard ports you'd have for a website versus ports for other services
