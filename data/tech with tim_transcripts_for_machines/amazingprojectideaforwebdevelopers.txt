all right so now in terms of a bunch of different ideas for uh web applications obviously you can just punch in chat GPT give me ideas for web apps but I think some popular ones to do are like social media clones right now this is something that is done by a lot of people but it's pretty complicated not many people can actually make like a decent functioning social media clone so if you can do that that's going to show pretty deep knowledge and I'd say that's a worthy project to have on a resume like a Twitter clone an Instagram clone maybe even something like Snapchat maybe you could pick like a more Niche social media and that'd be a more unique project and just to clarify here you don't have to literally build Instagram or Twitter you build a small subset of those features to show that you understand how to interact with databases how to serve maybe live data maybe you're notifying users this would be a big project but again a good one for a resume
