hello and welcome back so in this video we are going to be talking about while loops now while loops are very similar to for loops anything you do with the for loop you can indeed do with the while loop that being said they do have different use cases in terms of where they're most useful but just remember anything you do with the for loop you can do with the while loop anything you do with the while loop you can do with the for loop they're completely interchangeable and if you only had one of them in programming you'd still be able to do everything it just might be not as I don't know nice to code that's the right word for it or elegant it's probably the better word so a while loop is gonna work when you typically don't know how many times you want to loop through something so it's kind of like a question like you know it's gonna be based on this condition but you're not really sure like if a for loop is more like you know you're gonna do it a set amount of times a while loop is it could change based on the program based on user input okay something like that so what we're gonna do here with this while loop is I'm just gonna set one up and then we'll just talk about exactly what it does so in this case what I want my while loop to do is I want it to just continually keep asking the user for input until they give me like a certain word or like one or of two words okay so in this case what I mean I'm just gonna say let's see maybe just get answers me faster say int x equals SC dot next int like this okay and what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna keep looping through until they type the number ten okay so I can do this is you just type the keyword while in here and then in these brackets is gonna be your condition now this is why I focus so much about conditions in the first two videos because they go a lot with if loops while loops for loops so whenever while this condition is true then we're gonna run the loop so in this case I'm gonna say Wow X does not equal 10 okay yeah exactly that's true so in if they type in ten then it will not continue to do this otherwise we will continue to do this so that means I'm also gonna have to get the int in here because every time that we run this loop we want to continue getting X so and this case we ready have X define we just do X and what I'm gonna do is if they don't type in ten I'm simply gonna tell them like type in ten so we'll just say dot print L and in this case I will just say type ten dot dot dot and you know what we're also just gonna print out because I like to do this we'll just do system.out.println and this case will say type a number these are knows what we're looking for okay and that means we're also gonna have to print this here and it should just be prints not print on println my apologies okay so again the way this is gonna work is we're just gonna continually keep looping through this until eventually the user types in ten in that case we will break it okay and we will not do this anymore so let's run this type in number let's type four so as type 10 down to dot type number type five doesn't work type 10 there we go and we broke out of the loop and I no longer asked us for that number now these are actually really simple um it just Wow this condition is true do you everything that's in here and that's all you really have to know about while loops now again like we can what I was saying we can do everything that with for loops with while loops because we can also count in while ups as well so just like I did before I can do something like int count equals zero and then every time we run this loop you get to say count plus plus and then maybe at the end of our loop we wanted to do like tell them how many times they messed up okay what am I saying print system dot out dot println and in this case we'll just say you tried tired you tried and then plus count plus time this can make sure we add a little space here all right so now if we run this and we'll say like one two three and ten you tried three times until like eventually you got it okay so that's like a really simple way to do stuff with while loops now you guys might notice that this code here like this these lines are repeated up here so I have this index and this type of number so how can I do this without repeating those lines because I don't want it have to type like what if I wanted to ask a a ton of different questions and then dude while loop I don't want to have the same section of code appearing multiple times so there's actually something called a dowhile loop so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna erase all this and I'm going to set up this a dowhile loop and it's pretty much what it says we're gonna do everything while this is true and you'll see how it works in just a second so I'm gonna type the keyword do you brackets and now everything in this brackets is what is gonna happen while the condition that I put down here is true so the condition here is gonna be the same well X does not equal 10 we're gonna do everything in here so now you can see this is working fine there's no issues and what I'm going to simply do is I'm going to take this these two lines here I don't need that scanner because we're not gonna redefine that every time and I'm going to paste them in here and what this is gonna allow us to do now is X does not equal 0 create local gosh okay uh let's just do this int X and then okay perfect they reel so sorry that was just a quick issue but what this is going to allow us to do is we're gonna do this once no matter what this is gonna happen once because we're gonna do this and at this point X is not equal to 10 so we're automatically gonna do this once which means we don't have to have an up top and then down below so we do that and then we check the condition if it's true we'll do it again yeah and if it's not then we will break so we can do this we'll say type a number let's do 4 let's do 5 let's do negative 0 is that number yeah okay and 10 and there we go we break out of the loop and everything is working fine and that is pretty much it for while loops again if you want to set one up to look like a for loop then you'd literally just have to create a variable in this case to say like index equals 0 you can set up a while loop so you say wow and you say X is less than or equal to 10 and then in here you just say X plus equals 1 or plus equals 2 or whatever value you want to add to it and then you can just do what you would do in the for loop underneath your increment or you could put the increment typically you put it at the end so at the end of the loop you're adding 1 check okay but that's pretty much been it for a while loops that are very simple in the next video what are we gonna go over let me check my sheet here we're gonna go over sets and collections like we're gonna talk about like hash tables and stuff getting a bit more advanced and moving away from some like the basic stuff in Java that being said if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
