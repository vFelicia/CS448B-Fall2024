the last design principle on my list is to design defensively now what this means is to idiot proof your code that's really the best way that I can explain this you have to imagine that anyone using your code using your framework is an absolute idiot what that means is you have to make sure you have good error messages or you're handling anything that could go wrong from the user calling or using your code or your function design it in a way such that it doesn't matter who uses this code it will not break it is robust it is defensive and it is giving the user valid error messages and trying to help them be able to use this framework
