in this video i'll share with you some cool and interesting web scraping and data collection project ideas now this video is meant to act as inspiration you may not build out all of the projects that i mentioned here but hopefully it gives you an idea for something that you could make or at minimum motivates you to go out there and work on some coding project now all the ideas that i have here are related to getting data in some format mostly scraping it from a website say like airbnb or a realtor website or something along those lines and in this video i'll actually show you a few simple demos of projects that i've built out that kind of fit the theme or the idea that i'm sharing with you so the last thing i'll mention here before we get into the ideas is that these ideas are language agnostic so you can really create these projects in any language technology framework that you like and specifically here i've done so in javascript using react and then i've just written some basic python scripts that actually output a graph or give us some data kind of in the console now all of the data that i'm getting for these projects is coming from a service called bright data so what i've done is i've set up some data collectors and these are things that will run directly on the bright data platform and then i'm able to access the data from these collectors from an api read them into my program and then use the data however i please now bright data has actually been kind enough to sponsor this video and we'll talk more about that later alright so let's go ahead and get started with project idea number one now this project has to do with travel and specifically accommodations so finding where you're gonna stay when you travel to some city or some destination for a certain period of time so i'll show you a demo in a second but the general idea here would be to make some type of application that allows you to put in some filters or criteria it's like a maximum price a number of nights that you're staying when you're checking in number of guests you're going to have with you the location obviously you're going to be traveling to and then have this site go and search or not this site have this application go and search multiple travel websites like booking.com airbnb expedia wherever else you'd look for hotels or accommodations find all of the results on those sites that match your criteria and then aggregate all of those in one place where you can look at them and sort them by price reviews go and click the link etc so let me show you a quick demo here of what i mean and what i've built out now this is a very simple slim bare bone version of what i described this only searches one website because i didn't want to spend a ton of time building this out i built a few of these projects for this video uh but what this does is look on airbnb for any listings that match the criteria of number of guests checkin checkout and the location and then aggregates them puts them all on one page with their title a little description the price for the total uh amount of the stay and then gives you a button here where you can actually view the listing and go in and see if it's right for you so again very simple you could obviously make this a lot more complicated but this is a quick demo right i can view the different listings on airbnb and it's showing them to me all on one page of course i can add booking.com i can add expedia and i can search anywhere else i want from now i'm just doing airbnb sorry so here i'm looking in toronto but if we want we can change this to say seattle let's say we want to check in maybe april 20th and we want to check out let's go april 27 so for a full week let's search this is going to take a second once it's done i'll be right back and then i'll describe to you how i actually collected this data all right so there we go we can see the data has loaded now the prices are a bit off just because i think i've kind of sliced these incorrectly uh this is really 1270 dollars obviously not 1.27 cents the the dot is kind of like a comma right but if i click in to this one here you can see we have our entire unit entire condo hosted by david it is one thousand two hundred and seventy dollars in total right as i was saying so there you go we can scroll down see all the other results that we have and if we had multiple websites of course we could say you know what website they were from so on and so forth anyways i want to show you how i'm actually getting this data because it is interesting how i'm grabbing this you can do this in many different ways but as i said i am using bright data and i'm using something called a data collector from bright data so these data collectors are really just tools that are hosted by bright data and they allow you to send them inputs so you can specify the inputs yourself or if it's a prebuilt collector they'll just have some inputs you can use it will then go actually do the web scraping based on your inputs grab all of the data from the website or websites if you're doing multiple uh it will then send that data to you in whatever format you want so we can send it to an api endpoint you have using a web hook you can download a json file csv file really whatever you want however if you want to use these data collectors you do need to sign up for an account with bright data you can do that for free by clicking the link in the description and if you want some credit on your account just book a really quick demo it's like a few minute meeting with someone where you go through some compliance and kind of learn about the platform and then they'll give you 25 dollars in free credit uh towards your bright data account which is more than enough to mess around with the collectors lastly if you don't want to use this in more of a business setting you're going to be downloading all kinds of data doing a bunch of web scraping you may want to actually make a deposit if you do that so you put your own money into this platform bright data will match that up to 250 so totally up to you guys obviously it is cool i haven't paid any money for this i've been using it and now let me just give you a quick view at what the collector looks like so you can see if this is of interest to you or not so here i'm on bright data i just i'm going to go to data collecting platform you have data sets collectors i'm going to click on collectors uh i can close this and i have a few different collectors i've been working with here so one for youtube one for real estate data and then my airbnb one ignore the names this isn't really what i probably should name them but here if i click on this you can see my success rate average duration all of this kind of stuff and if i go in here and go to advanced actions i can actually edit the code so this is a custom web scraper that i wrote that goes to airbnb.com and it grabs me the descriptions the images the total prices and the titles from that website so i can preview that by clicking this link and then it will go and grab the data takes a second so we don't necessarily have to look through all of this but what's interesting is if i go back here i can actually click here and i can start this by an api call or i can start it manually so i can run this in multiple ways like i can just run it from the website and see the results or i can go to initiate by api and then i have an api call that i can do where i send an api token obviously i'm not going to leak that to you guys and then it will return my data in whatever way i set up so if i go back here to collectors i go to airbnb and i go to my delivery preferences you can see that i want my data in json format and i want it from a web hook so i put in where i want this to be sent and then once the data is collected it sends that to the web hook so to quickly summarize how this works here i set up a data collector on bright data set up my inputs i then trigger this collector to start running by an api call so i do that from my back end then once the data is finished being collected it sends that data to this url which is just the back end of my application in a json format i then take that data and display it on the front so that's what's going on i'll lastly just show you here if we go to collectors and i try to make a new collector there's a bunch of prebuilt ones you don't have to make one like i did but you can if you want to for like youtube walmart twitter tick tock instagram so on and so forth so obviously this is great there's a bunch of prebuilt options here you can customize these prebuilt options or alternatively if you want to make one from scratch you can code it from scratch or you can use the bright data chrome extension so if i go to a site say like walmart so just go to walmart here and go to the site okay hopefully it's going to load properly you can see my bright data extension opens up just because i have it loaded i can close it over here just a chrome extension and from here what i can do is select stuff that i want to be scraped from this website so if i want to scrape like all these images for example i select them i can go to multi and hit collect and then say okay i want to grab all these different images and then it will create a field over here with all of the images that i have and i can view the json which would give me the urls to all of these images so really easy to pick the different data that you want and obviously you can choose it in a dynamic way sorry so if you were looking at like a search page or results then you'd grab like the top 10 results or all of the titles or all of the prices really whatever data it is that you want anyways that's all i have for you for bright data i just wanted to demo how i'm getting the data here because that's not really obvious in a lot of the projects obviously you don't have to use this there's all kinds of other ways to do this however if you are going to be scraping large amounts of data this is one of the more efficient ways to go about it and these tools are just really easy to use so if you want to check them out link in the description that said though let's go to idea number two so moving on the next project idea i have has to do with real estate now there's all kinds of things you can do with real estate data obviously real estate is very hot right now at least where i live in canada the market is absolutely absurd and people are just buying properties uh like there's no tomorrow even though the price is drastically increasing anyways in terms of some specific ideas here within real estate of course you're going to be grabbing a bunch of data you could grab data about a specific property you could grab data about a specific area or kind of general geographic region maybe you do something like set up a profile or kind of a filtering criteria for your ideal property and then scrape a bunch of different websites and return to yourself results that match that criteria maybe your investor you're looking for something that's a certain size certain area certain price again you could kind of plug all that stuff in and then find a property that matches that again i know this stuff exists you can find websites that do this for you but you guys are programmers you're looking for programming ideas related to web scraping and that's what i have for you now of course if you were a business it would definitely be useful to have a ton of real estate data that you could look through train machine learning models on all of that kind of stuff and well you can scrape that grab that data and use it now what i've done here for this demo is quite simple all i've done is looked at the information about a single property so the web scraper or kind of collector that i'm using for bright data allows me to send an unlimited number of addresses and then goes looks at all of those addresses and grabs all of the data about those properties and returns that to me now what i'm doing specifically here is i'm looking at the estimated value of a single property over five years and then graphing that so we can have a look at so kind of just a random idea i guess i came up with related to real estate but if i run the demo that i have here you can see that it gives me the chart of the estimated value or price of a property over the last five years now first of all this is kind of just shocking right when you look at a fiveyear chart of real estate almost everything at least where i live canada even in kind of u.s is up by at least a hundred percent uh kind of wild that in 2017 something to be worth 140 grand and now it's close to 300 thousand dollars anyways just a basic matplotlib program i set up here to make this graph if there was multiple properties that i was searching for then it would graph all of those but i just have one right now because that's the simplest and if i go to my data.json file which is all of the data about this property you can see that i'm getting all this stuff uh like we get rent estimation the estimate uh five year history of the value of the property which is what i'm graphing the size and square footage number of bedrooms bathrooms address a current value symbol right like all this data and of course you guys can find something meaningful to do with that so that was kind of project idea number two something related to real estate grab some housing prices grab the average prices do some type of graph have some user interface for it or really just send yourself links maybe an email with properties that are going to be appealing to you and again you can run this scraper every four hours every one day every week however you'd like to do it and yeah there you go that is my project idea number two all right so now we're moving on to project idea number three now this one has to do with youtube channels but let me get a bit more specific here and give you some context so i have a programming course called programmingexpert.io check it out from the link in the description anyways for that course we do paid uh marketing advertising we target specific youtube channels specific uh keywords on google whatever you do for like a traditional marketing campaign we do that for programming expert as well now we have channels that we know that we would target right like my channel there's probably ads on it for programming expert however there's other channels on youtube that would meet kind of a general criteria that we just don't know about so i thought it would be a cool idea to kind of come up with a program that would search youtube for channels that met a specific criteria i'll tell you what the criteria is i guess in a second or how we kind of specify that and then give us a list of all of those channels as well as information about the channel like when it was started number of views number of videos a number of subscribers all of that kind of stuff so to give you a general sense of what i'm talking about here uh the program essentially what it does is it goes to youtube now let me just open up a tab here that has youtube so it goes to youtube it searches in some terms so something like let's say a learn to code you pick the the query you wanted to type in in this case maybe something like learn to code and then goes through every single channel here that has posted a video so we go to like cs dojo for example click on the about page it then reads the description of this gets the stats of the channel and then returns that now if the description contains some certain keywords so i think i did something like programming coding software engineering code um like i just specified some random keywords essentially then it returns to me that channel as well as information about that channel and that then is kind of a potential candidate that we would do like a paid advertisement on hopefully that makes a bit of sense but i wanted to come up with like a legitimate use case and this is one right finding youtube channels that we could target with ads that meet a certain criteria so i've done it in the coding space but of course you could do this in in any other space as well anyways if i go here and i run kind of the demo you can see that it gives me all of the channels that meet the criteria sorted by subscribers so i have code with harry uh programming with mosh csdojo programming knowledge so on and so forth you guys probably know most of the channels that are on this list we have of course this great one tech with tim almost had a million subscribers help me out hit that subscribe button anyways you get the point right it's giving me this list now this is just displaying the data that i already had because i don't want to run the scraper from scratch but if we go to data you can see there's a bunch of information about every channel right i'm just displaying a subset but we have you know all of the different tags for the channel we have the urls for the channel we have um what else would be here uh like number of views channel name url yeah contact email stuff like that so actually contact email could be useful as well if they have one then you could reach out to the contact email or send a you know email list or send an email blast all the channels whatever i'm just trying to come up with some examples of stuff you could do with something like this so hopefully that is helpful and i don't know somewhat maybe inspiring it gives you an idea of something to do but just to run this one more time with some fresh data if i go here and i click on run you can see that i can enter a query so maybe i enter a query some of like robotics and then the keywords that i put in here determine if the channel is going to be relevant or not and the keywords again we're searching for in the channel description so i could search for something in robotics i don't know like tech um i don't know let's go with programming we could go with robot whatever pick whatever terms you want and then what happens here is it constantly pulls the um what do you call it the data collector endpoint to see if the data is ready to be retrieved once it is it that displays all the data and downloads it now this does take a minute because you have to go through and search every single channel go to the about page so i'm not going to wait for this to finish but you get the point that was project number three alright so moving on now to my fourth and final web scraping project idea and this one has to do with ecommerce now i did not make a demo for this because i already did three demos before and i was pretty tired from writing all of those so i'm just going to give you a few kind of general ideas here so in the ecommerce i guess section you could be a consumer or you could be a business right if you were a consumer and you're working on a project here maybe you'll do something like compare the price of toothpaste or any general item at maybe a walmart a target a shopper's drug mart a convenience store any other places that you may shop at maybe you'll look at the history of prices of a specific item over time like you'll track that maybe you do something like see if an item is in stock at a certain store if it's something that is frequently out of stock like a graphics card or a computer component maybe even something like a new car i think there's a lot of issues with new cars recently at least that's kind of what i've heard and been seeing but you get the point right there's all kinds of stuff you could do where you're searching for products looking for the availability of products checking the stock maybe you just want a general dashboard that gives you like the reviews on products all kinds of stuff you can write now from a business perspective you're probably more interested in collecting more data where you can kind of analyze your competitors you can see what's selling where how many reviews certain items have maybe you're into drop shipping and there's some specific data that you're constantly looking at and that would be helpful to kind of aggregate and bring in one place maybe you build yourself a really general dashboard that web scrape some information from different sites that you're constantly checking there's all kinds of stuff you can do right so i just wanted to rattle off a few ideas here and hopefully get you thinking about some stuff you might want to do in ecommerce now in case this is helpful uh bright data does have a bunch of prebuilt collectors here for ecommerce so there's stuff like ebay aliexpress amazon.com.ca uh the indian one costco uh you know flick flipkart whatever all these things i actually haven't even heard of etsy you get what i mean right there's all kinds of websites that you can look through now the great thing with these collectors is that you can use multiple of them at the same time so you can trigger you know the wayfarer walmart target uh and i don't know let's go ebay collector to all start running at the same time and then as they finish you can collect all the data aggregate that data and do what uh do with it what you would like so i'll just end off the video here by mentioning that there is of course other ways to scrape data you don't need to use a tool like this although it is a lot easier than writing your own web scraper if you're working in python you can use something like selenium or beautiful soup again this is not going to be as scalable as a solution like this but if you're just trying to grab a few small pieces of information that's definitely suitable and i have entire tutorials on my channel on how to use modules like selenium for web automation beautiful soup for scraping html documents and if you're working in another programming language i'm sure you can find some other free resources and documentation that will help you scrape if you are really looking at this from a business use case then i would recommend checking out a site like bright data but with that said i think i'm going to wrap up the video here so thank you all for watching if you enjoyed make sure to leave a like leave any ideas you have in the comment down below and i hope to see you in another youtube video
