hello everybody and welcome to a brand new and very exciting series on this channel on an introduction to blockchain development so in this series i'm going to be showing you how to write smart contracts and deploy them on the ethereum network and i just want to state before i go any further this is designed for complete beginners so if you have never written code before if you don't know anything about blockchain do not worry this is the place for you i'm going to be explaining absolutely everything and in this series we're not going to write any massively complicated smart contracts this is really meant to give you kind of a high speed introduction and just get your hands dirty and actually deploying and writing contracts anyways with that said in this first video here what i'm going to be doing is showing you how to set up ethereum so how to set up a wallet how to get some different accounts and then how you can get free ethereum from an ethereum test network this is important because when we're kind of practicing we don't want to be spending real money and you do need to actually spend ethereum to put your smart contracts on the ethereum network so i'll show you how we can do that for free in this video so i'm super excited for this series i hope you guys are as well and there will likely be more on blockchain related topics on this channel coming in the future so look forward to that now i do need to mention and i apologize for the long intro here that the reason why i'm able to actually create this series is because of a company known as cartesi now cartesi is the sponsor of this video and this series and they've actually been working with me behind the scenes to come up with the curriculum here and make sure that i'm getting everything correct as i'm relaying this information to you i am not a blockchain expert i am kind of a beginner just like you guys but i am good at making youtube videos and tutorials and so they've been kind of helping me come up with the content in the structure and then reviewing all the work just to make sure everything is a hundred percent accurate now cartesi is an amazing company they're dedicated to making the blockchain more accessible for everyone and they have a ton of technology solutions that allow you to develop on the blockchain for much cheaper now we will hear more about them throughout the rest of this series but for now i just wanted to give them a general introduction and a massive thank you for working with me and well with you guys i guess to make this accessible to everyone and allow people to get into this world of blockchain development with that said let's get into this first video all right so let's go ahead and get started in this first video i'm going to show you how to set up a meta mask wallet this is actually an extension for chrome although it's available for ios and android as well and please even if you have an existing ethereum wallet because this will be storing ethereum follow along with these steps because you want a metamask wallet so you can get access to free ethereum and use it with the different applications we're going to be using later in this series so go to this website click on download i'll leave a link to it in the description and click on chrome and then install metamask for chrome now when you do this it will install a chrome extension it should pin this for you but if for some reason you don't see this in the top right hand corner so a little fox icon that's the metamask icon then click on this puzzle icon for extensions and just pin this it's just going to be helpful so click on the little pin and then it will make it so it's persistently up and i guess your i don't know you want to call this a taskbar bookmark bar whatever otherwise if you don't want to pin this you can just click directly on metamask and it will open up this page now for you i'm sure this is going to look a little bit different because you have not yet set up an account with metamask so i'm not going to walk through those steps because they're pretty intuitive but just walk through the basic setup steps on metamask you need a password make sure that's secure you're also going to need some secret words you want to make sure you save those somewhere you want to have access to them and then once you've done that it should prompt you to create an account so if you don't get prompted to create an account for some reason just click on this circular icon in the top right hand corner and click create account now you can have as many accounts as you would like within metamask you can see here i have two i have account one and i have tutorial and this will be very useful for us later on if we want to actually try testing out sending ethereum between different accounts great so that's kind of the basic setup so i have a count one notice i have six ethereum this is actually fake ethereum i'm going to show you how to get that in a second and then the tutorial account where i have zero all right so at this point in time i'm going to imagine that you've gone through those setup steps you figured out how to get to a page that looks similar to this and now i can show you how to get some free ethereum so the first thing i want to mention is that ethereum has a few different networks so if you click up here where it says for you it'll say ethereum mainnet but for me it says this gorelli test network what you're going to do is select one of the test networks that you want to try out your application on now these test networks are kind of a mirror or a clone of the ethereum mainnet the mainnet is the main ethereum network this is where real ethereum exists real smart contracts exist and anything on here is real money so you'll see this is 0.00 usd whereas if i switch to a test network there's no price because this is all fake ethereum it's not worth any money it's just for testing for development so you can use any test network that you would like and you can kind of mess around with different ones if you want but the one that's been working really well for me recently is this go rally one now i'm probably mispronouncing this but this is the test network we're going to be using for right now and i just want to note that the public address of this wallet if that means anything to you is available right here so if you go copy to clipboard let's take this and paste this you'll see that we have this address this is the address for my ethereum wall okay let me go back to metamask here and now we are back on the go really test network in my tutorial account great now that we've done this i'm going to show you how we can use a faucet to access free ethereum and have it sent to this wallet so what we can do is click on buy when we do this we have directly deposit ether or test faucet get ether from a faucet for the corelli now this is the one that we want so we're going to click on get ether you can do this on any of the test networks and it will bring you to a different website now this is bringing us to some faucet i actually haven't used this faucet i'm going to show you how we do a different one or use a different one but what you can do is just stick in your address right here and then request the ether i would need to do the i'm not a robot thing and notice it's giving me an internal server error because sometimes these things just don't work they are test networks okay so they're going to be down sometimes there's going to be some maintenance they're not 100 reliable but that's fine because we're just using them to test so you kind of just have to experiment and mess around with them and find one that's working on a specific day kind of annoying but considering we get free ethereum and we can test it out without without having to pay i am not complaining okay so what i'm going to do is go back to metamask here and actually uh let's just copy this public address although i already have that copied and now we're going to go to this website right here i'll leave a link to this in the description now this website is what's known as a social faucet now a social faucet means that you need to post something on social media that contains your wallet address and then put the link to that post and it will then send you a theorem now you don't need to post on some large account or something you can just make a brand new account on twitter or facebook i think those are the two available ones right here and in fact that's exactly what i did so what i did is i went to twitter i have this actually really old twitter account from when i was like 12 or something oh yeah july 2013. anyways i don't use this account so i just signed in and then i posted this tweet requesting fawcett funds into and then this address now you actually don't need to write anything other than the address of your wallet so what you'll do is go tweet or if you're on facebook you would post something and then i'm just going to make a tweet that contains my wallet address i'm going to click tweet then i'm going to go here and i'm going to go share so i'm going to copy the link to the tweet i'm going to go here paste that link in and then click give me ether now we have a few options select whatever one you want i'm just going to go with six ethers every day i got to select the chimney so let's see if i can pass this okay that looks good and it said oh i have a certain amount of time left until my next allowance uh okay looks like it's because i got ether recently from the same account and so that means that i have to wait but for you guys this should work you shouldn't have a timeout problem i already have six ethereum so i'll deal with using that as i need to as we go through the tutorial regardless this should work it should just give you ethereum and then if you go to metamask you should see in your account so let me swap my account here to account one that you have some amount of ethereum all right so at this point in time i'm going to assume you've successfully got some ethereum if the test network i used didn't work just try another one go through all of them eventually one should probably work for you now it doesn't really matter which test network you used but just keep track of which one it was because you will need to change some very minor steps as we go through the rest of the tutorial if you did use a different test network but everything will still work the general concepts are the same you just need to alter like one or two things very very small anyways what i want to do now is show you how to send ethereum which is really easy to do with metamask and how you can explore the blockchain and look at the addresses of wallets look at different transactions that have occurred and just show you this website here known as etherscan now etherscan is what i like to call a blockchain explorer you'll notice here i'm on goreli.etherscan.io so this is specific to the test network that i'm using if you did use a different test network then you're going to want to search up etherscan plus the name of that test network and just go to that ether skin obviously this one is for the test network that i used so what i want to do is show you that we can actually view everything on the blockchain completely transparently it's one of the great things about the blockchain you can just go and look at any wall address you don't necessarily know who owns that walled address but you can see every single transaction that's occurred you can see who sent the money how much money is in every single account that's one of the great features of the blockchain everything is completely transparent so i want to show you how we look up our own account on etherscan so i'm going to go here to metamask and i'm just going to click on my account address right here and copy it to the clipboard now that i have that i'm just going to paste it in this search bar right here and just click search okay so here we go we can now see my wall address showing up on etherscan now if you guys go and paste this address in i don't assume you're going to type all of it out but let's say you did that into etherscan you would see the exact same page that i'm seeing and you could view all of the transactions in my wallet so anyways here we are this is my wallet you can see i have six ethereum inside of here and i had one transaction that occurred eight days and three hours ago this is correct that's actually when i had the ethereum sent in when i was kind of preparing for this video and you can see it was on this block i had this transaction hash and then i have the from address and the to address so the to address is my wallet address right here but if i want to see where this ethereum came from which was the faucet i can click on this so when i click here notice this has an absurd amount of ethereum 515 000 ethereum right that's quite a bit and you can go and look at all of the different transactions that it's sent and how frequently it's sending them so you can see how many people are requesting ethereum from this faucet anyways let's go back and let's actually click on this transaction hash that's what txnhash is so let's do that and let's just look at some details that we have here now notice it's telling us this is only from this test network okay it gives us the hash of the transaction which we'll discuss later on we have the status this was successful you could have a status of pending meaning it's not yet been sent through then we have the block that this was attached to we can actually click directly into the block and view everything that was associated with this block as well we can see the minor that mined it too which is interesting then we can go and look at the from address the two address the value of the ethereum the transaction fee the gas price and a bunch of other stuff now this is really not going to mean anything to you right now but i just wanted to show you that you can do this you can look at all of the details of the blockchain completely for free transparently and anyone can do this there's not one person who has access you can't hide your transactions from one person everything is completely publicly available all right so now that we've looked at that i'm just going to quickly show you how you could send ethereum now you only can send ethereum between the same test networks so i can't send this ethereum to a different test network or to the main ethereum network obviously that's not going to work but what i'm going to do here is just look at my other account so you'll notice that if i go here i have my tutorial account and then i have my account one so let's say i want to send i don't know one ethereum to this tutorial account well i'm just going to copy the address here notice i'm on this test network i'm going to go back to account one i'm just going to click on send in meta mask i'm going to paste in this public address i'll go with one ethereum i will click next and i can confirm this it's going to tell me how much this will cost i have to pay a very small gas fee i will click confirm and now it is sending the transaction you can see it says pending if i click on it here it gives me the details and this is very similar to what i had on etherskin now let's see if we can find the hash of this transaction copy address copy address no let's go copy transaction id okay so i'm going to copy that let's go to etherscan here and paste this in and let's see if we can view the transaction and there we go we can view it and notice if we go to the from address this is my address that now has less ethereum in it than it did before because i am attempting to send money now it is not showing me the pending transaction because the transaction is currently pending it is not finished but you get the point this is all working and well we can view all of the transaction details all right so i just took a quick cut and you can see that the transaction has now actually gone through so i have a status success the page actually updated live when i was on it so that's how i knew this and if i go back to the from address you can see this transaction is now here uh and sorry it's right here actually because it's more recent and it's saying we sent one ethereum out from this address to the other address and if we go here we can see we have one ether and then of course if we go back to metamask and let's go to this other account so let's go to account number one or tutorial we have one ethereum so anyways with this transaction now being completed i'm actually going to end the video here i just wanted to give you a brief introduction to how we actually set up ethereum accounts how we can send money between different accounts the test networks and the faucets and then of course ether scan so how you can actually view different transactions view wallets and see what's going on on the blockchain a lot of this will start to make more sense in the next video where i actually go through a deep explanation of how blockchain technology works how the network is secure how transactions are sent etc etc anyways i am going to wrap up the video here i hope you guys enjoyed one last massive thank you to cartesi for sponsoring this video and helping with the content we'll hear more from them in future videos i hope you guys are sticking around make sure you subscribe to the channel and i will see you in the next one
