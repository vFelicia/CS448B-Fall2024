this is really going to dictate how much of a pain in the app it is to develop your project or your application it's very important that from the beginning of your software project that you actually determine what subsystems are going to make up the system as a whole now what I mean by this is rather than having say one massive code base that does everything right you want to break it into individual and kind of logical components which work together to solve a problem so maybe you have an authentication system you have a messaging system you have an achievement system you have all of these different subsystems they're a lot easier to write because you're only writing one at a time a lot easier to maintain a lot easier to debug to test and to scale up or scale down depending on what is required in your application
