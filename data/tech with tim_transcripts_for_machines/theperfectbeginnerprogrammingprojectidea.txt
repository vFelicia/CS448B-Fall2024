so I remember when I first started programming one of the first things that I did was create a password generator you gave it a bunch of inputs so say the length of the password if you wanted special characters if you wanted any characters omitted and then it went ahead and generated that password so the best example of this is say you go and try to create a new account on some website and then you get that little notification popping up or you get that little red line saying hey your password isn't strong enough maybe you don't have enough digits or whatever it may be and then the opposite of that is actually creating or recommending a password to a user so definitely a great idea and a great beginner programming project
