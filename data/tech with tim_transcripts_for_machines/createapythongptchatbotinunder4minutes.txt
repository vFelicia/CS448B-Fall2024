let's make a python chatbot using openai and chat gbt in just 5 minutes Step 1 install the openai package we're going to go to a terminal and type pip install openai if you're on Mac or Linux you can try pip3 install openai I already have that installed once it's installed we'll import open Ai and we will set the openai API key so we'll say openai dot API underscore key is equal to a string and is that ever a mouthful now we need to get our API key to do that we need to go to the open AI website so this will be linked in the description platform.openai.com account slash API keys if you don't already have an account you will need to make one if you do you should be able to make a new API key here by clicking on create new secret giving it a name and then pressing on create secret key once the key is generated copy that key paste that into Python and we'll move on to the next step so I have my API key here I will delete this after the video and what we'll do now is create a function that we will call every time we want a new completion so we'll say chat with GPT we will take in some kind of prompt which will be the message from our user it will generate a response using a GPD model so we'll say open AI dot chat completion like so dot create inside of here we're going to specify our model the model that's available today as of filming this video is GPT 3.5 Dash turbo this will be the best one to use if you spell it correctly next we need to pass messages is equal to an array inside of the array we'll pass an object we'll say the rule is a user and we will say that the content is the prompt all you need to do is have this and now this will generate a completion for you now that we have the completion we need to return that to the user so we'll say return response dot choices at index zero Dot message dot content dot strip this will just remove any leading or trailing white space from the message now we'll say if underscore underscore name is equal to underscore underscore Main this means that we're running this python file directly we'll write a simple while loop that will prompt the user to keep asking the chatbot questions so we'll say well true inside of here we'll say the user input is equal to input and then we can do something like U colon we'll say if the user underscore input dot lower is in the following so quit exit or buy then what we'll do is simply break out of the while loop otherwise we'll generate a response so let's say response is equal to chat with GPT we will pass that user input and then we will print chatbot colon comma and then the response like that okay let's go ahead and test this out that's actually our completed Chapa to run the chatbot we'll go to our terminal here and we'll run the name of our python file in this case it's python main.pi I'm going to type in hello how are you and we will see here that we'll get a response hello I'm an AI so I don't have feelings but I'm here to assist you well can you lie to me at least let's see as an AI language model I'm programmed to provide accurate information okay bye and then we can leave by typing buy so there you go that was a python chatbot in under five minutes very simple to interact with open Ai and this is obviously quite powerful you can do a lot more than what I did here I'd love to hear what you do with this code in the comments down below let me know and I look forward to seeing you in another video foreign
