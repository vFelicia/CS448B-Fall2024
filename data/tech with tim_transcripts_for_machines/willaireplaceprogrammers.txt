so here's where we'll talk about where chat gbt is kind of lacking and why we still do need programmers in the world now I think that's obvious but the reality is if you're working on a large application that has hundreds maybe even thousands of files all kinds of different systems different Integrations deployments all of this stuff going on chat GPT at the current point in time is not capable of ingesting all of that data building context around the project and then putting something into practice you need to give it very specific instructions just like you would give like a more low level employee that doesn't fully understand the system so in my situation I can't rely on chat gbt to write a majority of the code for the code base because I would have to give it so much information for it to be able to do that and at that point it's just faster for me to write it myself
