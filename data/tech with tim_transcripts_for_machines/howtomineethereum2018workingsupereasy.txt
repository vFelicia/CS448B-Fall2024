hey guys welcome back to another youtube video in today's video I'm just gonna be going over how to mine aetherium in 2018 so I do already have a video on my channel entitled how to mine aetherium for beginners now if you haven't watched that video yet you might want to go check that one out first because a lot of the stuff I'm gonna be referencing in this is gonna be in relation to that as this is kind of a update video for that and for the people that are still watching that video I'm trying to redirect them to this one so that they can see the new method on how to do this now I'm not gonna go over everything I go over in that video is that ones 10 minutes long this is just a quick update and a quick fix for people that are having issues Mining aetherium and this hopefully should fix those issues so pretty much in my other video I had a lot of comments saying this isn't working I can't have my antivirus isn't letting me download the program and just a ton of different issues that to be honest I don't have all the answers to so what I decided to do was upload my working miner file on to the github here that you can see on my screen where you guys are gonna be able to download it and simply change a few little things and hopefully be able to get mining so what you need to do the first step here is just gonna be to go to the github that I've posted my miner files on so this is pretty much just github calm slash tech with Tim slash download miner now if you're too lazy to type that in I'm gonna put it down in description so you can just click it and once you're on here you're just gonna click on claymores miner dot zip like that and then you're gonna click on download like so now it should download and this should hopefully surpass your antivirus so I tried this on Google Drive first and what kept happening is when I tried to download it it would say there's an antivirus it's not letting me it won't let me download this there's a virus in the file as I'm saying here there's no virus in this file take I mean don't download it if you don't want to but this works for me and I'm gonna show you me running the file on my own program or on my own computer so you can see but yeah just download that and then go ahead and open it up so just double click it I'm using WinRAR if you have another unzipping file that works you might be able to do it without having WinRAR but I'm not sure it says you can't unzip this file then just go ahead and download winrar it's free and you can just get it on the internet so then once you've done that you're gonna grab this folder that I have in here called claymores dual a theory of miner and you're gonna drag it onto your desktop or wherever you want to store it once you've done that you can close your window R and then you can open up the folder now you can see there's a ton of different files in here but the one we're gonna want to be looking at is this ether mind dot bat file now the reason I named it this is because this is the pool that I'm using to mine with ether mind if you want to use a different pool then you're gonna have to watch a different video because ether mine is the pool that we're gonna be using for this so you're gonna double click on this file just to make sure that everything is working and you can see it should pop up with your graphics card and it should start mining now I'm just gonna close this because I'm gonna show you a little tweak we have to do first but yeah you can see that everything is working there now what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna click on edit and then in here you can see these are my settings so pretty much we have the e pool which I'm using the EU servers you may want to change this to North American or Asia depending on where you live and then the ewallet so this is the one that you're gonna have to change unless you want to be sending me all of your mind ethereal so this is my current aetherium mining address or aetherium wallet sorry so what you're gonna want to do is make sure you have in if you're in wallet created if you don't already know how to do that or you don't have one created click on the card then I'm gonna put in the top right of the screen right here and it'll just show you how to make an aetherium wallet it's pretty easy and pretty simple so once you've done that you're gonna use your public address or your public key in here and then you might want to change this name as well because this identifies your miner so if you have multiple miners you might want just wanted to find the location I just named mine Tim because that's my name and then once you're done that you're gonna click ctrl s to save your progress and you're going to close this ok so after that you're pretty much done all you have to do is double click this file and you should be off to the races and started mining now again I didn't go through everything as much or as in detail as I did in the other video this one is just a quick fix for people that are having trouble mining or the people that are watching my old my older video and that method isn't quite working for them so again let me know in the comments below if this method is working there may be some issues with it you may not be able to download some of this stuff but from what I've seen so far and from what I've tested this should hopefully be working if you have any questions leave them down below I'll try to respond to you and if this helped you out please help me by leaving a like and a subscribe thanks and I'll see you guys in another video
