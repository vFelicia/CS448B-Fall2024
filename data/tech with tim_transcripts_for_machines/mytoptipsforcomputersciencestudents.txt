many of you know that I finished 5 out of eight of the semesters in my computer science degree before I eventually dropped out when I dropped out I had a 9.2 GPA I was one of the top in my program and the reason I had such high grades was because I followed this kind of regimen and did these tips and tricks first of all I only did High leverage activities that means if I felt like a professor wasn't teaching me effectively I didn't go to their lectures if I thought a tutorial was a waste of time I didn't go to the tutorial I simply spent time at home learning the content on my own or watching YouTube videos of people that were more qualified to teach the material I only did activities where I could actually see a tangible benefit in my learning for example I would never rewrite a note I would never even hand write notes all I would do is things that actually helped me learn the content and the way that I evaluated that was by doing a ton of practice questions and focusing on practice exams and tests so I was only learning the type of material that was actually going to be on some kind of assessment
