software engineering and programming in general is one of those fields where it can feel like you constantly need to be working and that there's never enough hours in the day to get something done so here is how I balance my days as a software developer typically what I do is I allocate a block of the day typically between 8 to 10 hours where I'm going to be working most of that time I'm not programming I'll be doing something like filming YouTube videos answering emails maybe I have a meeting and then typically I'll block out about four or five hours for actually writing code for doing my development now at the same time I also block out time in my mornings to work out to eat breakfast to have dinner at night to watch TV to go out to have fun what I do is I'm intentional about the time that I'm working as well as the time that I'm not working I'm not just saying oh I need to work nine hours today I'm saying not only am I going to work nine hours today I'm going to spend an hour working out I'm gonna spend two hours doing this and I'm gonna have X number of hours where I can do whatever I want you need to be as intentional about the time you're spending away from your computer as you are for the time you're spending on your computer
