all right so my next category here is mobile apps now this could be like a mobile web app so something that just runs in like Safari or runs on a browser in your phone but I'm more thinking of native mobile apps like a Android app or an IOS app obviously if you're applying as some kind of mobile developer then you're going to want to have this but even if you're applying for a regular Dev job I think it's cool to have a mobile app in your portfolio the reason I like these projects too is because if you can actually get this on say the Google Play Store if you're talking about the app store or iOS then it's really easy for someone to download and test out and this also shows someone that you've gone through the whole process of packaging an app signing an app bundling it deploying it getting everything into a production ready state so I think it's an interesting talking point in an interview it doesn't have to be super complicated as long as it's kind of well polished for it to stand out and be an impressive project to discuss and to look at on a resume
