in this video i'll show you how to read from a file in python the first thing we need to do is open the file i'm going to say file equals open my file is called file.txt so i put that right there and then i put r as the mode that i want to open this file in that stands for read now if your file is not in the same directory as your python file then you need to put in the absolute path to this file so c colon slash etc whatever the path is to it if it's in the same directory you can just put the name of the file now to actually read from the file what you do is the following print and then file dot read lines like that read lines will give you a list containing all of the lines in the file once you're done with the file you need to make sure you close it so file.close when i run this notice we get all of the lines inside of the file we just read the file another way to do this is simply with read if you use dot read notice you're going to get a string that contains all of the text in the file but not based on its lines finally a quick way that you can do this as well that avoids you having to close it say with open file as file like that then you can read the file inside of here now you no longer need to close it let's run the code notice everything works hopefully you found this helpful if you did follow for more
