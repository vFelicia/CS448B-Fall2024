hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video in this video i'll be sharing with you five great python modules that i recommend for beginners these modules are relatively simple to use but allow you to go beyond textbased apps and create 2d graphical applications with python i also happen to have tutorial series for all of the modules that i'll list so feel free to check those out from the links in the description and with that said let's dive in so the first module i have for you is called turtle this is a builtin module in python that allows you to create very simple 2d drawing applications you're given a canvas and a cursor the cursor is also known as the turtle and you can run commands to move the turtle around the screen change its position its speed color etc as the turtle moves a line will be drawn to represent its path and you can use this to create simple drawings shapes fractals and a lot more stuff some of the programs that i've worked on with the turtle module include a turtle racing game where a set of turtles randomly move up and down the screen and race each other a fractal art generator that creates fractal trees and snowflakes a program that allows the user to move the turtle around with key presses and a bunch of other stuff as well if you'd like to learn more about the turtle module you can check out the series i have on this channel the one that's popping up on the screen right now and will be linked in the description all right so the next module i have for you is my alltime favorite python module i'm sure many of you are already guessing this right now but that is pygame pygame is an absolutely amazing module for creating 2d games in python i've created tons of projects with pygame on this channel ranging from simple stuff like hangman to physics simulators and fullfledged tower defense games i even have full tutorials on this channel for tetris snake checkers flappy bird with builtin ai and even an online multiplayer rock paper scissors game pie game is great because you can create very simple games or you can take it to the next level and make super advanced stuff like platformers and online games i've links my beginner pie game tutorial series in the description if you guys want to get started with that but of course there's tons of resources on my channel and on the internet in general to learn pygame i would highly recommend it for anyone that's kind of getting into python and wants to create some more interesting applications so the next thing i have for you here is a web automation framework called selenium so selenium is the name of the module selenium allows you to create bots that can control and scrape data from websites it's mostly used for doing ui testing of websites but you can make it play games fill in login information fill in forms go and scrape data from websites and kind of pull that into an application there's a lot of stuff you can do with selenium now an example of an interesting selenium project i worked on is actually a bot that can play the game cookie clickers so you have to press this cookie a bunch of times then you can upgrade the speed at which you can press the cookie and all kinds of stuff like that anyways if you want to see how that project works i have a whole tutorial series on selenium and the last video in that series actually goes through creating that bot and showing you how you can make a selenium web driver that's what it's called actually play a game on a website so the next module on my list is called discord.pi this is a module that allows you to create discord bots you can get up and running with it in minutes and easily create commands respond to messages and pings and much more my discord server which you guys should join by the way i'll have a link in the description for that has a very advanced discord bot running hundreds of commands moderation polls an integrated database and much more i do actually have a series on creating a discord bot using this module but unfortunately it's outdated now as there's a new version of discord.pi so you can still check it out if you want from the link in the description but if you guys want me to make a new version of this series then leave a comment and let me know and i'll consider doing that last thing i'll mention if you guys are interested in some open source projects i have a lot going on in my discord server so make sure you join that there's actually kind of a section or a bunch of channels related to all those projects so you guys can actually contribute and work on the website and the api and a ton of other stuff we have going on in there now finally my list ends with the kivi module so kivy is a module that allows you to make crossplatform graphical user applications with python it's definitely not the easiest to get this code to run on mobile devices but it is possible to use this module to make ios and android applications with purely python and one code base works for all of these different platforms there's very little that you actually have to change now regardless of the mobile app possibilities for this module it's great for making simple user interfaces forms displaying video or photos displaying data and a lot more you can also make games with this module but i see it being more valuable for utilitybased applications where you're collecting information from the user or presenting some type of data regardless it's a great module to add to your repertoire like all the other modules i do have a tutorial series for this which you can find linked in the description all right so with that said that is going to conclude the five python modules i recommend for beginners of course there's a lot more that i could add to this list but these are the top five that i came up with when i was planning this video so let me know what your favorite module is on this list and if you think i missed any important ones leave a comment if that's the case anyways hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe and i will see you in another one
