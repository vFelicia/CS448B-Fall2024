now I know for me when I was younger a massive obstacle was just trying to understand these Concepts and I think what really benefited me was taking things slow don't worry about rushing through different concepts the important thing to do when you're a kid and you're learning and picking up programming from the beginning is making sure that you don't have gaps in your knowledge and that you build a really strong Foundation before you start moving up into some more advanced concepts so make sure you master the basics take your time and don't worry if it's taking you a long time to learn things
