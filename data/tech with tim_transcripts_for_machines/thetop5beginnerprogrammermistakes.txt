here are the top five mistakes the new programmers make Number One not reading error messages please read through your error messages they do often tell you exactly where the error is and what's going wrong number two is using poor variable names using names like X Y X1 x2p P1 P2 instead use something more descriptive that actually explains what the variable is doing and the purpose of it in the program number three is repeating logic having the same blocks of code multiple times using say 30 or 40 appends or push statements to get something inside of an array rather than using a for Loop next is rushing into complex topics oftentimes we want to get into classes objects all these Advanced programming language features before we understand the fundamentals and lastly blindly copying code so many times people go to stack Overflow they see a block of code they just blindly copy it and dump it in their program if something goes wrong and they have no idea what this code is because they didn't understand it before they actually used it
