hey guys and welcome back today this is the 15th video in my Python programming series and we are going to be talking about some more methods that we can use on strings and on lists these methods are I'm going to put them in a comment so that I remember is the dot find and the dot count method and now these can be used on strings and on lists so let's go right ahead and give an example so the dot find method this is a very useful method in Python it's not in a lot of other languages so it is specific to Python so what we can do is we're going to make a variable we're going to call it string now we can set this equal to whatever we want so let's just say hello for this case for simplicity and then we're simply going to print string oops if I spelled it correctly string dot fine and then inside of the dot find brackets here so the argument for this method we are going to put in what we want to find so we want to see if we can find the indices of any of these letters here so if I put in L you'll see what happens is I get two and that's because there's an L the first L in the string is found at the indices of two just like that now you may be confused right now I haven't completely explained it but that's fine so as you can see we have two L's in the string right now when I put in this L in the brackets it gives me a value of two now that is where the first L is found in the string if I put in Oh for example you'll see it gives me four and there's only one o in the string so it gives me the value of where that o is which is the fourth indicee of the string the fourth index if I put in H you see we get zero and now notice what happens if I put in a number or a letter that's not actually in the string so I'll put in seven for example the string seven and you see we actually get negative one that's because if python does not find that inside of the string it's going to tell you that it's naked one so rather than zero it gives you negative one just like that so this is useful because maybe we want to check in a password for example if it contains a certain element so maybe if there's a dash in there we don't want them to be able to use that password or maybe we're not allowing a certain character or we need a certain character to be in a password or a string this is where dot find is useful and it'll tell us if that's in the string or not now there's actually another useful string method here that is dot count now it does a similar thing except instead of finding the index of the letter it counts how many of them there are in the string so now we're going to go to DA count so we'll go down like this and again inside of the brackets we're just going to put a string so let's do L and you see if we f5 here we get the value of 2 that's because obviously there are two L's in our string now I'm just going to type a bunch of random letters and show you that this does work for all kinds of things so if I type in a for example see how many azide typed we have six A's in that string now let's try a Zed I know I didn't use said here I'm pretty sure at least oops that's my bad we forgotten a parenthesis there sorry okay and we get zero right so instead of negative one it counts and says well there are zero of them the string so we're going to return zero again we can use this to find if there's a certain character in the string so if we say you can only have a maximum of three numbers in your string well we could count and we could say if there whatever how many numbers right the dolt fine is different than this because it actually tells us where that is so if I do don't find again and now maybe I put in an A well we know there's six A's in the string but which a is this one going to give us so it says five because that is the first place that an a occurred in the string so we see here at the fifth in the C or index that's where the first a is it's not going to give us the A's from back here if we wanted to find the A's back here we'd have to use a for loop and we'd have to loop through string in different parts of the string to find where all the A's were again yeah so that's how you use dot find and count it's very useful if you want to check certain things so I'll show you an example here if we wanted to check a string how we would use the dot count method or the dot find method so I'm going to say if string dot count and I don't want to allow any let's say underscores in my string is greater than zero so that just means if it's I guess we could also say not equal to zero so if it has if it contains at least one of these underscores and we're not going to allow it so we're going to print to the screen not good just like that okay just to show how this works now here instead of actually having a preset string we're just going to get input from the console so we can do this a few times and see so input will say please type something as the prompt like that and otherwise so an else statement here if it doesn't contain any underscores we will print good like that okay so now I'm going to type hello what was our first string and oh what happened there good so we get good sorry I don't know something glitched in the program there will rerun it I'm not sure what happened there f5 please type something I type hello there we go now we get good I'm not sure what happened any other one okay so now let's do it again and this time we're going to include an underscore so we'll do underscore underscore hello it's going to say not good because it counted these underscores and said well there is more than zero underscores so it's not good and then same thing if we put an underscore in the middle of the word or we put a ton of underscore so hello not good because there's underscores in the word just like that and yeah that's pretty much how the dot find and the dot count methods work there's a ton of uses for these and it's really useful on that they have this method because in a lot of other programming languages they don't have this dot count and dot fine so it makes it harder if you're trying to find how many things are in a string or if you're trying to find the index of a letter so I hope you learned something I hope you enjoyed it if you did please like and subscribe and I will see you again tomorrow for another video
