today I'm showing you how to make a $1,500 AI chatot in just a matter of minutes and no this is not just clickbait I actually showed this to a company that I work with and that's exactly how much they offered to pay me so thanks for hopping on a call with me here just for everyone watching this is one of my friends and business partners from genzone they do kind of Dubai setup consultancy all of that stuff I made the bot specifically for them because I kind of know their needs and I've worked with them before but I want to ask I just showed you the bot what do you think of it first of all what kind of value does it have and if you were going to pay for it how much could you pay me for that yeah I mean since we move hundreds of people to Dubai we get asked hundreds of questions thousands of questions on a daily basis on sales calls just in general on Tex so it would be really really cool to automate something like that to have uptodate Tech that can always answer questions directly on our website even so I think I would definitely pay uh maybe around $1,500 a month for something like that just to have on our website so that it can reduce some pain from our sales calls that's amazing yeah and I mean this can even just drive one or two extra calls for you per month and you close one of those already you're roing right so that's exactly why I made the butt awesome thanks so much for hopping on for me that was all I wanted to ask you and uh now let's get into the video now this bot acts just like a consultant and can give real world advice on moving to Dubai and egg in Canada its main goal is to actually drive users to sign up for a free consultation meeting where eventually they can be converted into paying clients or to refer them to different accountants and lawyers they can get the expert insights that they need it can capture their email it has a database where it can pull Knowledge from and it can look up real world information from Google and even get access to things like the current weather it's super cool and it's something that you could be making and selling to other businesses quite easily obviously this is a real world use case for a real business that I work with and that's why I wanted to show it to you so with that said let me show you how we build this bot in just a matter of minutes now to make this bot so quickly we're going to use a platform called Coes who have sponsored this video now that said this is really a gamechanging platform and it's super easy to create these AI Bots and you can do them in just a few minutes and it's completely free you can even utilize various chat GPT models for free which you're going to see here so in order to use codes what we're going to do is just create a new account so simply go to the link in the description make a new account on Co again it's free and then we'll spin up this bot in a walk you through the process of building it so once we've done that what we'll do is press on the create bot button here from the left hand side we'll select a team in this case I'm just going to go on my personal team and we'll give this a name now I'm just going to type Dubai consultant here and I'll go with tutorial because I already have one named this and then we can give this a description uh which will be helpful for people that are reading the bot and lastly what we can do is actually generate a profile photo or upload our own for this spot so let's go ahead and do that okay great so it generated a pretty Prett cool image for us and we'll go ahead and press on confirm okay so from this page here we'll actually start writing the bot and the first thing I want to do is write the prompt however we do want to select the model that we're going to be using so notice here it has GPT 4 selected but we can actually utilize GPT 40 which is the new one that just came out and you'll be able to use these with various chat GPT credits that this platform Coes gives you completely for free obviously there's a bunch of other parameters here if you want to use those and you can even toggle the multiagent mode but we're just going to leave it as single agent mode for now now what we can do here with the prompt is kind of describe really basically what we want the bot to do and then we can optimize The Prompt using Ai and it will actually write it in a format that's going to be a lot better for the model so what I've done is just pasted in a pretty small prompt here where I just described what I want this to do and then I gave it some information on the various referrals because it's going to need to know those links for my accountant and for actually getting set up with that Dubai free consultation meeting so now that we have this we'll just press on optimize and it's going to make a new more optimized prompt for us okay great so we have a new prompt here that we can use where it specifies the character it goes through a few different skills that this model has access to or that it should use and then it has some constraints so we'll press on use here and let's just test this out right now before we actually add anything else okay so I'm just asking it here to tell me about the process of moving to Dubai so let's see what we get back from that and keep in mind we haven't added any plugins or knowledge we're just using that kind of Base llm which is GP T 40 so we've got a response now and it's actually pretty decent but obviously we want to improve this model and give it some other skills and things that it has access to so to show you how easy this is with codes what I'm going to do is just add a plugin that gives us access to the weather so if I go to plugin here you can see there's actually over 300 plugins and if I just search for weather here we can find the weather plugin so that's actually the one right here so let's click on that and let's just add the ability to get the current weather so once we add this plugin the only thing that we need to do is just add a new skill here inside of our prompt and just write a few words about the plugin so the bot knows that it has access to it so what I can do is just make a new skill here so I can say skill three something like weather and say you can get up toate live time weather forecast now that's not the best grammar so what I'll do is just reoptimize the prompt here so that it writes it a little bit better for me and then we can test this in real time with the window that we have on the right hand side and see if this is working so I've reoptimized this now and what I'll do is just ask it for the current weather so I'll say can you give me the current weather in Dubai please and let's see now if it can use that plugin great so we've got the weather you can see is extremely hot in Dubai hence why I am not there right now and now let's move on and add a few more features so what I want to do next is add the ability to look up real time information and to do that we're going to use Google search so again I'm just going to go here uh to the plugin tab there's a ton of different plugins I'm going to go on Google web search let's give it that ability and then again all we need to do here is simply go into the side and add a skill that tells it it can look up realtime information so I just added the other skill here you can see skill four perform Google searches search Google for answers to users questions and then what we can do here is test this out and say how is the flooding in Dubai which is only something the model would know if it has access to Google because this was quite recent and it's not going to be in the new trend TR GPT model so let's see now if it's able to actually use the Google search and find this real time information so you can see here it did now use Google and it gave us some sources and some information about the flooding so this is great but the next thing that I want to do to improve this model even more is I want to give it a knowledge base now this is information that we can provide that it can then go search and look at to give us really context specific and just more detailed answers without having to rely on something like Google or just what the model was trained on and this is really more formally known as rag retrieval augmented generation where we're going to provide a bunch of data to the model kind of like a knowledge base and then when it needs to answer a question it can go search within our specific knowledge so we can answer questions really specific to whatever our use case is in this case I'm going to give it a bunch of blogs and articles from my business partners genzone because they have a lot of detailed information on their website but we could give it access to something like our resume and then it could go it could search through our resume maybe give us tips on how to improve prove it or answer specific questions maybe about a candidate if you were using it to do like an analysis on different candidates you get the idea but the point is we can give this knowledge so I'm going to go ahead and do that so for knowledge I'm just going to go here going to press on text now there is a bunch of different things that we can upload here like photos tables uh various different types of documents but I'm just going to add some simple PDFs now you can see that I already have a knowledge based that I've created but for the purpose of this tutorial I'll make a new one now let's call this Dubai articles just so it's a bit different we'll give this a description just so the AI model knows a little bit more about how this works I'm going to say this contains a lot of information about Dubai and Canada uh that's fine okay we could give it a better description but that's okay and then we can upload some local documents Google Docs notion Etc you get the idea there's a bunch of different info so from local documents I'm going to go next and then I'm going to search on my computer for those documents and upload them here so you can see I've uploaded a bunch of different documents here so I'll just press on next and then we have a bunch of options here we can customize this if we want but I'm just going to go with automatic all right so now this is going to get processed just so that we can actually extract the information efficiently once that's finished what we'll be able to do is have this added to our model and then when it needs to it we'll look up specific information from this knowledge base so you can see now the knowledge has been added as text here and now the bot can start using it when it's answering questions now the next step step to build this out is going to be to do a few configurations on some of the settings we have here and then to actually build in something known as a workflow now workflow is something that's a little bit more advanced that gives you some more control and it lets you do things like send emails for example which is what we're going to use it for there's a lot of other workflows and you can actually just use prebuilt workflows but I want to show you how to build your own custom ones so those of you that know a little bit about coding or at least logic can get some more control here anyways what we'll do is we'll go over to m memory and what I want to do is just enable the longterm memory so that when we're chatting with the bot it has access to more context now I'm also going to give this an opening dialogue so that when it first pops up it kind of prompts the user hey this is what I can do and this is what you should ask okay so I've just pasted these in here you can read through them if you want just pretty straightforward and then we have the ability to enable auto suggestions as well so these are like the little suggestion boxes you see down here uh kind of prompting you on what the next question might be we have also can add a background image voices all this kind of stuff uh but from now that will be good okay so now let's move on to the workflows which is another great feature of code so I'm going to press on ADD here and the idea is that we want to build a workflow that allows us to send a summary email of the current conversation chain the reason for this is we can capture the user's email which is valuable to us as a business but also this then puts it in their inbox and it's something that they can remind themselves with and that they can remember our company from so you can see that I have a workflow that I've already built so I could just add this to the bot but instead we're going to make our own now it's also worth noting that there's a ton of other workflows that you could just duplicate and add in here like a YouTube video summary just tons of them and you can publish your own in the workflow shop and other people can use them you can share them between bots so let's go to create workflow let's go send summary email bot I'm just adding the bot here because uh I already have one called send summary email and then we'll give this a description so the llm knows when to use it so I've just gone with sends a summary email of the current conversation chain let's click on confirm and I'm going to show you how we build this out so you can see that this gives us a bit more control and we can start adding in some blocks some code utilizing llms and building something that the llm will then be able to use that's more specific to a use case and we always have a start node where what we're going to do is parse information from the llm question or whatever prompted this workflow to run and then we have an end node where we could return some kind of information or we can simply just end this run so what I'm going to do to begin with is I'm going to go to this end node and I'm just going to remove the output because we don't actually have any information we need to generate uh but we always need to have the start and the end node so the workflow knows kind of when to run now the first thing that we want to do here is we want to parse what the user's email is and we also want to get access to whatever the current conversation was so that we can have that information when we send the email so let me show you how we do that from the start node okay so we're going to begin here with the summary the summary will just be a string and then all we do is describe what this object actually is and the llm will automatically parse it into the correct type so I'm just going to say summary of the current converation okay great now next we have the email which is in a bit more of a complex type because we're actually going to have an array of objects so what I'm going to do is go to array and then select object here I'm going to say email and this is going to be the users email address and then since we have an object we need to specify uh what the object actually looks like so we'll go and click on sub item so inside of here we can specify what type we have inside of the objects in the array we're just going to have a field called email and this will simply be the users email okay so there we go I'm just going to mark this as required and now what we'll do is move on to the next nodes in our ch here where we actually send the email now what I want to do is add a little bit of logic where what I say is if we don't have a valid email address then don't send the email if we do then send it so in order to do that I'm going to go to the if condition and I'm going to add one in here so let's move the if condition up here and let's connect this to the start node and we're just going to zoom into the if so let's move this over here and we're going to say if and then notice we have access to these variables here so actually let's change this to be the string rather than the object and we'll say if this is not empty so this this way the if will kind of work um more how it sounds so we're going to say if the email is not empty then what we're going to do is send an email so in order to do that we're going to have to use a plugin so I'm going to go to plugin and we're going to look for Gmail so we're going to go Gmail like this we're going to import the Gmail plugin and notice we have a bunch of options here I just want to go with send message so let's add that here now we have send message so let's move this over and let's connect this to our if statement so if we do have an email then okay we'll go ahead to send message otherwise we're just going to go to kind of a message block where I tell the user hey you need a valid email so what I'll do is press on message here and what we can do is bring in the message we're going to add this to the else statement and for the output here we actually don't need any variables we can just say here you did not provide a valid email try again okay great so that's the message and then we'll connect this to the end node so that we know that we're finished perfect now from our send message there a bit of configuration but let's also connect this to the end node so we know that we're done after that and what we now need to do is get the content the subject and then we need to specify who this is going to so who this is going to go to is going to be our email okay now for the subject we can just manually type this in if we want so rather than reference we can just make this an input and we're just going to say summary of Dubai consultant chat we could also have an llm generate this but I'm just going to go with something basic for right now and then for the content this is simply just going to be the summary that's it that's really all we need to do now what we're able to do here once this finished save saving s is just test this out so let's press on the test run and make sure this works so you can see here I've just got some mock data so I can go ahead and press on run and we can walk through this in see if it works okay so it gave us an error and I actually know that the reason why this is an error is that the two needs to be of type list and I've actually given it a string so instead I'm going to go with that array object and then I'm just going to test this again which is a nice part of this workflow I can test it very quickly let's press on run and this time it should tell us uh or it should actually allow us to send the email so you can see that it did that and then if we want we can go to our inbox and we can make sure that it was received so you can see here in my inbox I did actually receive this email I just wrote just a test email and the subject is summary of Dubai consultant chat now for you you will need to actually authorize Gmail to be able to send this on your behalf but in my case that was already done hence why that worked okay so the workflow is done now and if we want to start using it we'll just need to publish it so I'm just going to press on publish and you can see here now that it's been published and now that it is published we can add it to the current bot which I will do right now and we just need to specify in the skills that it has access to this workflow and then we can start using it it so I just added the final skill here facilitate email summary and I just gave it a bit more information so I said if requested use the email worklow to send them a summarized account of the conversation in the case that the user attempts to send an email without providing one prompt them to provide a valid email just so that we will actually capture that email before we use the workflow so let me just say hey can you send me an email and let's see what it tells us okay so notice it's asking us to provide the email so let's do that and then again make sure it works so it just sent the email here we can actually look in the workflow and see some of the parameters and the data that it pursed for us and notice that it did send to lifewith tim. official gmail.com which is one of the emails I'm using for my second Channel okay so that's great now that we have this finished or at least in my case this is finished obviously you could add more and make this a lot better if you want to what I want to do is show you how we actually use this on a website and how we deploy it now that's going to involve clicking on the publish tab so let's go ahead and do that so we have a lot of options for publishing this first of all is the co bot store now if we publish to the co bot store which is optional and we put this as private this means that people will be able to interact with our bot but they're not going to be able to view all of the configuration and how we've actually built it so that's good in this case where we have some sensitive data I am going to publish it here just so that you guys can mess with the bot afterwards and we also have a bunch of other options like Discord telegram line Instagram slack all of the places you would probably want to use this however what's most interesting to me me is this web SDK option now this literally just gives you a snippet of code that you can copy and paste on any website and it immediately gives you access to the chat bot it's super cool and super easy to use I'm going to show it to you right now after I press on publish so once I do this it should prompt me here with the web SDK to install this so I'm going to do that I'm going to go to installation and notice that literally all we need to do is copy this code and I can just paste this on any HTML website and immediately I have access to the BX now to prove that to you I have a website that I'm running in vs code on my computer so let me hop over there and I'll add the bot to it okay so this is the website I'm running locally here you can see it's just running on my local Port 5500 just a standard kind of HTML website you can see it's actually a website for genzone I just downloaded their website so I could show you how we can actually add the bot to it and all I need to do is go into vs code here where I have all of the code for the site and at the end of my body tag or really anywhere in my body tag I'm just going to paste in this script and you can see that as soon as I do this and I save and I go back to my site so let me pop this open okay so I just open the site again and now you can see after I added that script tag I literally just copied and pasted it we now have this button here which gives us access to the co bot so it says Dubai consultant tutorial here we have our prompt and then I can go ahead and start asking a questions hey can you tell me the weather in Dubai even though that's spelled horribly it should be able to do that and obviously we can customize this from Coes and immediately all of these changes will be available okay so now we have the weather and we can see the bot is indeed working this is super cool makes it super easy like insanely easy to actually utilize this which is a big issue with a lot of chat Bots that you build you can add this to literally any website and you can start making $1,500 or more AI Bots for companies in just a matter of minutes so now the last thing I'll show you is that if you want some inspiration you can check out the CO's bot store now this is a place place where you can get some inspiration and you can view a bunch of different Bots that other people have created you can see that some of them are starred here you can filter by public configuration and the different categories that they have and you can kind of mess around with this and you can even deploy your own bot if you want it to be on the co bot store with that said guys I am going to wrap up the video here I hope this was helpful and it showed you how to make a great AI bot in just a few minutes if you want to check out the bot that I built in this video I'll leave a link to it in the description and I look forward to seeing you in the next one
