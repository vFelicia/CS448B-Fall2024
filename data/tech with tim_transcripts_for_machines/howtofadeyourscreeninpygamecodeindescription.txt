hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video today's video I'm just doing a quick tutorial in PI game on how to fade your screen so if you guys watched one of my previous videos on a game that I made in PI game it's called a golf game that's just what I called it it's on my channel if you want to go check it out I'll leave a card to it in the top right hand corner here there was someone who asked in the comments down below how I faded this screen now I just pretty much the way that I did that was just by using a surface and PI game and by changing the Alpha property of that so if you don't know what alpha is it's the same thing as opacity so whenever you have a surface you also have an opacity for that service so if you see objects that you can see through like something like glass sunglasses maybe they have opacity meaning that you can see through them if something has a hundred opacity that means you can't see through it and it's opaque a little bit of I guess you might do that in science or something so I'll show you what it looks like here in case you're still confused just by running a little program I made you can see what right here this is what the surface looks like and if I just click on the mouse it starts to fade out now in my opinion that looks pretty damn cool if you're transitioning between like two different scenes or if you're going from like an A level to like a score sheet or something which is what I did in my game so if you guys want to learn how to do this it's really simple and I'm just gonna give you the code for it now you can pretty much just copy and paste it into your program but I'll show you if you watch throughout the rest of the video how to implement it properly so you don't run into any issues so make sure you stay till the end so we're here this is my little thing here now all that we really have to worry about in this program is this right here now this is my function that pretty much creates the fading effect now the way that it fades is simply by creating a new PI game surface that's gonna be the same width and height of your screen so you can see here I take two two arguments width and height now this if you want it to fade only a section of your screen is why I have this on so you could change how large the section of fade is see if I I'll just show you quickly what I mean that is if I change this to like 500 and I run it you can see only half the screen is fading and that's pretty much all that means for the width and height so I'll change it back now and in here we create a new surface and then we fill the surface with block now if you want to fade to white you could just change this color if you wanted to fade to green you could change this color whatever you like in there and then I just do a really simple for loop and it's just for alpha in range 0 and 300 now the Alpha goes from 0 to 300 I believe in PI game it might go a little higher than that but this is what I use and pretty much all this does is it integrates 300 times through alpha property so first we're drawing a window that has an opacity or alpha setting of 1 and then it has 2 and that is 3/4 so it keeps getting darker as we move through the for loop now what I do is you just do fade dot set alpha is how you change the Alpha property of of a surface you could do that with your window as well and then we just redraw everything that we're drunk so you should if you have a game have a function that redraws everything just in that one function so you're not drawing things from different areas now if you don't have this is gonna be kind of hard to implement but just pretty much everything that you're drawing is in a function right that's what I have at least here I fill the screen I draw my two rectangles inside this function now it's important that inside the function you don't update the screen if you update the screen inside of the function then you're gonna run into a slight issue so which I can show you in a second now after we redraw everything that's gonna be behind the fade we now draw the fade to the screen so on our main window which I just create up here and then we do PI game dot displayed update just updating the screen and we wait 5 milliseconds so that doesn't move too fast if you want to go slower or faster you just change this number up or down accordingly now it's important that you call your screen win or if you don't want to call it win then you have to change this you can see that this corresponds to my main window redraw window is the name of the function that I used to redraw everything behind the fade and then fade is just something that I came with just a name for the for the surface and that's about it so I'll show you the issue you run into if you update something in your in your window here or in your redraw function you poly game displayed out up that you're gonna see it looks like it's flickering here when I run this thing you can see it starts to flicker and it just that's obviously not what you want kind of hurts your eyes so just make sure you don't do that in there and I'm gonna put this code in the description down below feel free to copy and paste that into your programs and if you guys have any issues don't be afraid to leave me a comment down below I am usually responding to those comments and helping you guys out so if
