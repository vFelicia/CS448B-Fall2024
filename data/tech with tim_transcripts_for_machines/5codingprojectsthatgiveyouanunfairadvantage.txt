let's face it most software engineering resum√©s are the exact same same projects same skills and same qualifications now if you want to stand out you need to be different and one of the easiest ways to do that is to update your projects and work on things that are unique the best projects are easy to talk about in an interview solve some real world problem and are sufficiently challenging that's why in this video I've assembled five unique project ideas that are guaranteed to make you stand out and give you an unfair advantage now the way I created this list is so that no matter what type of role you're applying for at least one of these projects will stand out and look really really good so if the first few projects don't sound amazing to you just stick around I promise one of them will give you some really good inspiration now with that said the first project idea I have for you is an automated trading bot this means that you're going to ride some kind of Bot using some type of algorithm or technique that could trade cryptocurrency nfts or real assets on something like a Stock Exchange you also could use fake assets there's all kinds of apis you can utilize where you can kind of trade fake money now this is great because it stands out on a resume it's genuinely interesting and it's something you'll probably have a lot of fun building now these are the best type of projects one where you're actually doing a real world activity something that you're passionate about and that's interesting and you want to talk about in an interview the nice thing here is that it doesn't actually have to work it could completely fail you could lose money and it would still be a really great story and something that someone is genuinely interested in if I looked at a resume and saw automated trading bot my first question would be how much money did you make or how much money did you lose so it's interesting either way and this shows that you know how to use apis you can build a real world application you know how to execute some kind of algorithm or technique so to follow instructions with code and you know how to host the bot in a way where it's responding to some kind of events or triggers and Performing some type of action that's project number one really great idea I highly recommend you give it a shot now if you do build a project like that you're going to want to be careful with your passwords security and credentials so you should definitely check out nordp pass the sponsor of this video nordp pass provides the ultimate password and credential management solution which is genuinely something I've been looking for for a very long time I don't know about you but I have all kinds of passwords accounts credentials credit cards Etc many of which I share with teammates and it's a constant struggle to keep them secure but to allow my teammates to access them quickly now with Nord pass you can store all all of your sensitive business or personal data in a single location and securely share them with other members of your team now if you don't believe me you can try three Monon free trial using my activation code techwithtim at the link nordp

you need to get your security under control now you can do that by trying a threemonth free trial using my activation code Tech with Tim at nordp pass.com techwithtim from the link in the description moving on to project number two I have a sentiment analysis tool now this is a bit more generic but you can really make this project pretty Advanced and something that's really interesting and stands out on a resume to start what you would want to do is scrape something like tweets YouTube comments posts medium articles whatever it is that you want and you want to use natural language processing to analyze the text and determine the sentiment so positive negative very positive very negative you can go as granular as you want and then what you could do is actually track the trends over time for example you could track a specific person and you could see if their sentiment goes up or down over time based on specific events you could track an event you could track some keyword that's being searched on Google you can do all kinds of great stuff here and you could even set up the tool to track Dynamic types of data this is a really great project especially if you're someone who works a lot in Python you do any data science related stuff it's going to show that you understand how to work with large sets of data how to interact with ap I how to perform some manipulation or analysis on them and then how to report that in a userfriendly way you can make this project really graphical hosted on some kind of website and it would be something that you could just click a link and someone would immediately be able to see and understand exactly what you did now my next project idea is a blockchainbased voting system now this is interesting because this actually illustrates that you understand large scale system design and architecture because you're building something that's running on a decentralized network now obviously if you're a web 3 developer this is going to stand out more however it still looks really good even on a standard developer resume to illustrate that you understand not just web 2 but web 3 you're able to learn a new technology and that you understand a bit about system design security Dynamics blockchain networks I know for me that I actually learned quite a bit about coding and system design in general when I started working with web 3 Technologies and blockchain because there's a whole new world of things you need to consider first of all is security you need to write your code in a way such that no one can hack it no one can steal the Assets in the case of a voting system you want to make sure things like ties are going to be handled people can vote people cannot vote some people have a higher voting share than others so this would allow you to really talk about kind of your system knowledge how you designed it and it's going to be less about the coding and the implementation and more so your kind of highlevel architecture and design so I think for a more mid to senior level role this could be a great project to have on your resume and really touch on for those aspects of the job so the next project is personally my favorite and this is an online multiplayer game now a few quick examples of ones that I've built I did online chess I did online Pictionary I did an online rock paper scissors I did a battleship one and I did a Gario we actually like the famous game online where you have kind of the bubbles that are swallowing each other and that one I actually had about 20 people playing at the same time and that was super fun to see kind of all these kid I was teaching at a summer camp playing that game so first of all these are super fun I love an online multiplayer game a lot of people can use it you can show it to your friends and family and it's a real app that they'll have some value in but also it's very complicated and it shows that you have some pretty indepth knowledge and are capable of building some pretty cool stuff for example if you build an online game you need to have a client and you need to have a server that also means you need to host the server so you're showing that you have some Cloud deployment skills you understand client server you understand backend development and a bit of front end development and game design you understand networking you understand security and how to make things scalable and if you start thinking about how do I put something online it really forces you to do quite a bit of design decisions right you have to come up with some architecture you have to figure out what's going to be done by the server what's going to be done by the client what kind of machine do I need how do I make this more scalable should I have multiple servers there's a lot of different considerations and it's a great thing to talk about an interview that I think is quite impressive and really makes you stand out highly recommend giving this one a shot now let's move on to my final project now my last project idea is a computer vision related application I'm going to give you one or two examples that I would do in terms of computer vision but you can come up with kind of whatever you want so the first one that I love and that I've personally built is a face detection system for a Raspberry Pi security system now this was really cool because I actually put this in my house had a little Raspberry Pi that I set up kind of at my door this when I was living with my parents and had a camera on it and when someone came up to the door it would identify who they were based on a face detection script and it would just notify me with like a little microphone like you know X is at the door y is at the door whatever the name of the people so that one was super cool use computer vision use the hardware sensor wasn't even that complicated to set up it was a really cool project that I could talk about in an interview and another one that I've set up is actually a cat tracker so at one point in time I had two cats they looked very similar but one cat would always steal the food of the other cat so what I did is I set up a camera close to where the food actually was so I could track which cat was eating at which time and it would kind of notify me if one of the cats was stealing the other cat's food so an example of a real world application that used computer vision that actually did detection of in this case animals previously it was people they're not that difficult to build but they're really interesting they look great on a resumate the real world and something you're going to have fun building so I recommend if you can and if you have that kind of hardw where do some type of computer vision type task it could be solving a Rubik's Cube with computer vision that means you're also going to interact with some robotics components as well could be analyzing your backyard and seeing which Stray Cats hang out on your deck that happens to me all the time a lot of really cool applications here they're also quite visual so if you're able to present this to someone or show it to them they can see right away exactly what you built overall those are my five project ideas I think these are super fun unique and interesting and they're definitely going to make you stand out and give you an unfair advantage
