hello everybody and welcome to the sixth twt code jam project showcase in this video i'm going to show you some very impressive programming projects many of which are made by students people in high school people that are 13 14 years old it is super impressive to see what everyone was able to create and i'm going to be announcing the winners of this sixth code gym now if you are not familiar with the code jam this is something that runs exclusively in my discord server just like a bunch of other activities that we do make sure you join the discord server you'll be joining about 31 000 other people so thank you to everyone who's already in there and you can see how to sign up for the code gym now all of the information related to the code jam is available on this website right here twt codejam.net you do need to be a part of the discord server to be able to sign in you can view the submissions view the projects and all of that anyways this code jam the theme was health now we had a bunch of submissions i think we had over 50 submissions and almost over 200 teams that signed up and in this video i'll be announcing the top three winning teams as well as the top two projects that were hosted on replit now replit is the sponsor of this video more from them in one second alright so we will get into the projects in one second but i do need to thank replit for sponsoring this video and this code gym now replit is what makes this code jam possible they're providing all of the cash prizes for the winning teams they're also going to be giving a free one month hacker plan to every single team so all of the participants that i show in this video now replied provides an online ide that you can use to write code from any device so from your phone from your tablet from your computer whatever if you have access to the internet you can use replit to write code in supports over 50 different languages and requires no time whatsoever to set up you just load up a replica pick your language and you are ready to go now one of the best things about replied is obviously that it's free but you also can collaborate with people in real time so if you have someone else that wants to work on the same code as you you can literally edit the exact same file at the same time i do this quite a bit when i'm trying to help people or tutor people i'll just you know throw a replit open and then i can actually write code and they can modify it and look at it at the same time in the same file replica also integrates with github you can host stuff on wraplets like a website a discord bot all kinds of amazing things and well they're just a great company i've known them for a long time and i'm super happy that they are able to support this code gym so with that said make sure you guys check out replit from the link in the description and you host your project on replit for the next code gem because if you do that you have a chance to win an additional prize anyways now that we have gone through all of that let's actually get in to the different projects that we have all right so now that we've gone through that i just want to remind you here that the theme is health so all of the projects you're going to see are related to health in some way or another and you can read through all of this if you want but i just want to draw your attention to this right here which is kind of the judging criteria so when the judges went through this the way that they graded each project was on the theme so how well does it fit the theme the functionality the code and then the intuitiveness of the application now i'm going to be using that same criteria as i pick the winning teams and with that said let's look at project number one alright so i have project one open in front of me this project is called revive as you can see right here and it is by uh nissarg007 uh i'm probably messing up that name but this is the creator this actually the project that had the highest number of points from the judging round so congratulations to you let's check out what it is that you've created okay so you have made a website called revive health is wealth very nice i like the background already and kind of the style of the website and i can see that we have some services so we have a game that's kind of cut off that's fine another quiz thing a bmi calculator and something to make me laugh so let's check out a few of these let's go to the quiz okay let's start the quiz you have 15 seconds only select one answer okay straightforward different types of vitamins are both a and b okay fat soluble vitamins are i'm going to go all of the above okay good guess can coding cause a disease interesting i'm going to go depends on usage okay vitamin c deficiency causes scurvy and what does health stand for does health stand for something this acronym i'm not sure i'm going to go with none okay healthy eating and active lifestyles and we completed the quiz we got four out of five nice let's go home and try the other things that we have here so you have a bmi calculator okay so i guess i just put my height and my weight i am 175 centimeters and i don't know exactly what is in kilograms about 150 pounds i think 68 maybe 69 is uh is that okay so apparently i'm a normal weight great that is good to know uh let's continue here let's go to make you laugh okay i'll never forget my grand granddad's last words to me just before he died are you still holding the ladder that's funny uh these are actually some good jokes let's see here java and c were telling jokes it was c's turned so he writes something on the wall points to him and says do you get the reference but java didn't like okay i don't know if i can go through any more of these but these are funny jokes very nice definitely uh makes me healthier i guess to laugh and let's do this game here oh tictactoe okay select which icon you want to be let's be x always go in the middle uh okay let's go here and all right just gives me the connect three there perfect okay so i think is that about it uh if i go game yeah okay so it just brings me to what i was just at i mean i guess okay let's just replay this quickly okay it's actually blocking me this time there you go go home very nice awesome website nice work now we're going to move on to the next project all right so moving on to project number two now i just want to quickly mention that all of the projects i'm showing here and all of the projects in general were done really well i've been super impressed with everything that i've seen from you guys especially considering this is a relatively lowkey kind of code jam and it's something that i imagine most of you are kind of doing in your spare time so you guys have done a really awesome job thank you all for participating and hopefully if you weren't in the top five you're going to try again for the next code gym there was a lot of really close projects so we're all kind of you know almost tied for like five six seven eight so i do apologize if you didn't make the video but i did look at a bunch of those projects and they were really well done anyways let's look at project number two so this is by coding with 3dv and dm and this is called wealthier okay looks like this is a website wealthiest your program to stay healthy okay let's open this up and wow okay so first impressions here really like the user interface of the website just looks really clean really professional let's click on features okay just brings me down here go to about okay gives me the profiles of the people very very nice let's go back to home and let's try one of these diet planner okay number of meals per day three four or five meals okay health label um what am i going with here let's go i don't even do i need any do i need to select anything here let's go alcohol free and no sugar okay and then what do i want i want uh let's just go with high protein and calories what if we want to go with a lot of calories let's go with 3000 and let's get a plan let's see what this gives us okay so it doesn't look like this one is working maybe i did something incorrectly here let's just try balanced diet let's get rid of that and now let's try this and okay now we're getting some plans so i guess what i selected just didn't really have any available plans but this is cool it's actually giving me recipes for the meals that i can eat it's giving me three meals if i change this to four let's see is it gonna give me four now it does give me four okay that's really cool and i guess all of these uh will abide by whatever i put down here that's actually really cool i'm not quite sure how they did this they probably had some api or something that they need to hit but regardless the way that they displayed this is is really cool and yeah that's well done okay so let's go back to another feature let's go meditation corner okay hover inhale alright what's next oh this is kind of wow okay this is cool so it actually walks you through i guess some type of breathing exercises i'm not really anyone i don't meditate so i'm not sure exactly how this works but this is cool we've got some waves in the background very nice oh can i change this oh i can change the background let's see ah okay nice let's go to mountains let's see what this one looks like looks like it takes a second to load here ah there we go okay wow this is cool i really like this another neat feature i'm just going to go through them kind of quickly because i can't spend too much time looking at all of them let's go what is this macro calculator okay age height weight uh weight circumference okay i don't know all of these so i'm not going to go through this um let's i'll go through some of it weight 175 waiting kilograms 68 next circumference i have no idea what these would be uh workout goal weight gain okay find uh please fill out this field i don't know what would a circumference be that makes sense like 50 centimeters or something uh waist circumference i have no idea what these would be let's just go like this let's just see if this works okay 103 grams of fat per day 232 grams of protein 310 grams of carb damn okay so it does work interesting glad we were able to test that out let's go to the next one here disease info i want to look up a disease let's go with coronavirus i mean i guess that's not really a disease that's a virus unable to get disease info what would a disease be let's go with malaria is this going to give me anything there you go okay malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite you get it when infected with mosquito bites damn okay again i don't know how they're getting all this information and displaying it so well but they're doing a really good job okay so looks like that is project number two very impressive everything worked which is obviously very good to see pretty intuitive and easy to work with the only thing i wish they would change that i don't have to put in like the next circumference because i feel like a lot of people would not actually know what that is anyways with that said let's move on to the next project alright so we are on to project number three this is called galactic gains already liking the name here that is funny let's see if we have any contributors i just want to see who made this let's go to contributors and okay so just by fin413 10 000 inserts 7000 deletes very nice let's go to your website and let's see my connection is not private uh that's fine let's continue okay galactic gains fitness that's out of this world i like the kind of cartoony ui you guys have done a really good job with the user interfaces on all of these code gems i've been super impressed let's start my fitness journey okay quick start name your alien i'm gonna go with tim really creative let's go with a nice pink submit and damn okay so this is a game wow okay happiness alien weight alien hunger workout eat let's take a tour welcome to the alien word world of galactic gains this looks like a very professional game so far i'm i'm very impressed tim is a bloody alien from another planet their food is scarce and exercise is necessary to escape scary predators now that they've come into your care it's your job to make sure they continue to exercise and stay in shape next your alien's weight goes up every day the dial in the top right indicates how much tim weighs okay tim also gets hungry every day okay this happened this happiness indicator is in the top left shows you how they're feeling make sure to keep them happy nice pressing the workout button will reduce your weight try clicking it now wow okay this is really cool this is a neat game even the way that it's transitioning between all of the pages uh so i'll play through this for a few minutes and see if we can get some progress but i imagine you can probably play this for a fairly long period of time uh do i need to click done or should i wait for the lunges to be finished uh okay click done pressing the e button will fill up your hunger bar okay eat this game is how your alien eats oh my gosh okay use wasd and the arrow keys to move the spaceship around your goal is to collect green healthy foods it'll appear alright at any point during the game you can press e to exercise okay in the side menu you can view your stats oh my gosh this has so much stuff in it this site was made in four weeks for the 2021 timothon very nice even puts a link here awesome okay let's let's play through this uh let's eat let's see if this works press e to exercise okay so i can move my spaceship around nice wait i lost speed oh i want to eat healthy that makes sense damn these things are moving pretty quickly ah come on okay i don't think i could reach that donut yeah that was i don't want that okay this is uh not going very well come on give me that geez it just doesn't want to give me anything healthy uh okay let's exercise let's do some pushups okay oh i actually have to wait for this before i can click done okay eight seven six five four three two and one okay done continue i guess oh it's because my speed is so low that makes sense why i can't reach anything so to increase the speed i guess i need to work out and the speed's even lower now okay i'm going to stop playing this this is just not going well for us um that's fine look how much i weigh now okay um that's cool let's work out one more time and see if the weight goes down and then after that i think i'm going to be done playing this right now but i do imagine you could play this for a very long period of time uh very cool game though very impressed with everything seems like a lot of work went into this so let's finish our five squats and okay we've lost some weight very very good to see very nice settings what do we have here retake tutorial delete alien and let's go back home great there we go create and customize a workout companion learn easy and approachable exercises okay so that's kind of the point every time you're working out it's showing you an exercise that you could be performing very nice awesome work i'm super impressed by that this is a really cool game now we're gonna move on to project number four alright so in front of me is project number four this is called vera or avera uh yeah vera is probably correct right multipurpose health care tools uh has i like when they do all these little uh like information panel things i'm sure they're easy to add on github but makes it look kind of nice okay let's just quickly read through this where are our contributors ben robo very nice okay let's go to the website and let's check it out okay so this is hosted on replit awesome i will wait for this to load and then i will show you what it looks like sweet so it is loaded there we go personal fitness tools it's going a bit too fast for me to read but anyways has a bunch of information bmi calculator coronavirus tracker muscle builder health and fitness news meditation heart rate calculator oh my god it's got so many things let's go with bmi calculator uh can i not click on it does it not bring me is there oh let's go get started uh attention no face mask no entry that's funny i have to wear the mask okay uh username needed let's go with tim sweet okay so there we go bmi calculator now i'm in the tool we'll go male height i've done this a few times now this is in meters i think that means to say centimeters but i'm going to go 175 and weight what do we say 68 calculate bmi um that can't be right unless i go 175 like that okay there you go so now i'm getting correct so it is actually in meters very cool what if i make the weight like really large the guy change oh he does change okay that's cool that's a nice feature all right let's go to the coronavirus tracker can i click into it ah there we go personal covert 19 chat bot okay chat bot it's a simple copy 19 bot all you have to do is type a country name to get coded results okay let's go with canada that is where i am and there we go we get the cases the deaths let's go with usa or do i need to do america usa there you go sweet uh i'm not going to do the voice recognition actually let's see maybe this will work canada canada it doesn't seem like it's working or maybe i just okay let's try now canada no okay so it's not working that's fine let's go to muscle builder current weights uh can you adjust this uh not sure okay just shows you a bunch of exercises you can do oh let's go chest highlights the area that's really cool start workout specify target workout value um not sure what that means uh oh it's like a timer for doing something okay that's cool and then it tracks the number of workouts i've done current weight oh that's based on what i did previously okay that makes sense so it's saved from before and then says i did the chest muscle two times uh this date does not look correct unless that was there before and i guess it gives you some chest exercises cool okay let's go to food recipes see if this one's working okay there we go and bunch of recipes very nice let's click in one and damn it gives you all of the diets that it satisfies the ingredients preparation wow this is really cool you guys have a lot of features on here let's go health news okay i guess it's just a bunch of articles about different health related stuff very nice let's go to the music or meditation that's what this is okay start meditating meditating is about to begin get ready i am prepared let's see what we have here all right let's start disney is going to give me some oh there you go okay breathe in wow all these are cool it even has the moving little guy here this little uh orb moving around very nice okay i'm not going to continue with that but i trust that works let's put my age in 21 okay calculate target heart rate what should i be at 239 beats per minute i feel like that can't be correct that i should be targeting 239 beats per minute um maybe maybe i'm just not sure what if we go like 40 what would that one be let's see 223 okay maybe i'm just not aware of how high the heart rate's supposed to be but that seems high to me i don't usually when i'm working out i don't think i have 200 beats per minute as my heart rate um okay well with that i think that's pretty much it another really impressive website here i was a little bit confused on some of the tools but then after a second i understood them but yeah very nice work let's move on to the next project alright so moving on to project number five we have dadrf and this is the health app so the contributor is dadrf all right so let's just go right to the website and let's see what we got here click on this one here looks like it's hosted on heroku that is fine next time maybe you can host on replit and aim for the other prize for some reason this is taking a second to load here and okay there we go so we are in uh welcome to health or hell yeah health health okay i understand what they did there a simple tool to manage your wellbeing register or log in let's register uh email id okay i'm gonna fill this in and then i'll be right back all right so we have now registered we are in it's giving me something about coven 19. i guess that's like the total number of cases maybe um not really sure what that means uh my tablets blog doctor about facts and exercise let's go to my tablets uh tablet name let's just go with vitamins i just want to test if this is going to work regular time let's go 7 52 p.m why not add tablet okay it's going to keep track of it for me and then if i click at this i can use the dosage the cure prescribed by damn okay that's really cool it shows me the time to take this out let's go back let's try exercise okay some youtube channels to follow that's a cool idea shows you some nice workout channels some recipes to try out let's see here enter waiting kilograms good job i looked at what this was before okay male height 175 age 21 daily activity i would say moderate exercise okay let's calculate and your daily calorie intake should be 2 600 okay that sounds about right let's now go to the blog and let's see here script alert test okay i guess people have just been adding stuff to the blog let's say this is a very cool app nice work title cool app and i won't add an image and there we go cool app by tech with tim no image was provided and you can see there's a very cool app nice work awesome okay sweet that is a nice blog a health blog i guess and then doctor you can invite your doctor let's see how this works so if i enter my doctor's email it would send an email to him or i can copy the code so let's copy the code here and let's just go in my chrome tab and see if this does anything medical information of tech with tim oh that's neat okay tells me the vitamins gives me comments or i can leave a comment i guess add a google map to your doctor's clinic name of your doctor's clinic name of doctor okay i'm not going to do that let's continue this though let's go to your doctor's room okay and it just brings me to the same page very nice that's a cool idea so you can share information online with your doctor not sure how secure this is but i'll ignore that for right now and health facts everyone has a unique smell except for identical twins who smell the same really that's cool uh health fact you burn more calories sleeping than you do watching television nice 20 of all airline passengers catch a cold after a twohour flight that sounds about right i mean that makes sense your buddy has enough iron in it to make a nail three inches long damn that is cool fact too all right so with that i think i went through everything in this application so now that i've showed you the top five projects i'm going to announce the top two projects hosted on replit and then the three winning teams alright so i've just reviewed the projects for a second time i wanted to make sure i wasn't missing any features before i actually made a decision on the winners now i just want to give a huge thank you again to everyone who participated in this code gym yes the prizes are nice yes the hacker plans are nice but at the end of the day i do this just so you guys have an opportunity to practice your programming skills work in a team and have some fun working on a project you can see my cats joining me now anyways i want to mention again that this was really close a lot of these projects were pretty similar to each other in quality in the idea as well and so it was really hard for me to actually decide who the winning projects should be anyways i did come up with a decision i just wanted to tell you it was super close and it really could have gone either way so if you didn't get selected as a winner that doesn't mean your project was bad in fact all of them were really really good all right so let me start by announcing the two best projects that were hosted on replit and then i will go through and select the three winning teams so the first best project that was hosted on replit revive so this one right here by the team code decode okay my cat needs to chill there but let's go and remind you what revive looks like this is the revive website so again we already went through this but it has a few different games that you can play it has these jokes which i actually thought were quite funny i thought the website generally was polished everything was working and well it was the best project that was hosted on replied so congratulations you will be getting a prize all the members of this team and a free one month replete hacker plan awesome so now let's go back here and let me show you the second best project that was hosted on replit this is some suspenseful music please covid ml now this is a project that we have not seen yet so i'm actually going to showcase this to you but as you can see it's right here on wraplet and if i go and click on this it will go full screen for me and i can see this covid ml web application so it says covet ml uses a series of machine learning models to predict whether or not you have covit 19. i like the disclaimer here don't use this as a medical indicator okay so let's take the survey it's a bunch of questions i'll just go through it kind of quickly let's say yeah we have a runny nose no i don't have asthma do i have a headache uh yes let's go heartache no diabetes no high blood pressure sure do you feel fatigued sure this no have you traveled the bar abroad yes no no yes yes no or yes and you use hand sanitizer yes okay get results and zero of our models predict that you would test positive for covet 19. awesome that is very good to know and then we have the three models that it uses right here so relatively simple application but still useful everything worked it was intuitive it was easy i thought the user interface looked good i like even just you know small things like kind of the clipart they have here on the site and that first kind of animation like this that we saw where it brings up these little uh neural network nodes together so congratulations you are the second best project host on replit you will also be getting a prize and a one month free hacker plan i believe this is by uh absurd yeah i'm not gonna be able to pronounce that username but congratulations alright so now that we have looked at those it is time to announce the top three winning teams now in third place i have suspenseful music please wealthier so congratulations guys your project came in third place now i already showed this but it has a lot of awesome features i thought the ui was really well polished everything just worked well and at the end of the day if it works it's useful information it fit the theme and it was intuitive you guys did a very good job so congratulations you all will be getting a prize as well as a one month free hacker plan right so now we are moving on to the second place team and the second place team is suspenseful music please galactic games or the second place project sorry this was one of my favorite projects that i've seen in all of the code gems the reason being it was really creative and unique and i just like the fact that this was a game it's kind of gamifying health and exercise and you did something different from everyone else this was a super unique application and the only reason i put it in second instead of first was just because i thought there could have been more emphasis on the health because yeah we have the exercise but other than that it was kind of the only you know health thing and then maybe you have the foods too but regardless i thought it was really really good this was an awesome game and i'm sure many people like especially kids maybe would actually play this game this could be a legitimate game so really nice work great job the tutorial was really well done too the way that all of the kind of transitions occurred user interface was well polished and yeah i could go on and on but you did a awesome job so congratulations on second place now that leaves in first place as many of you would have already guessed health tools now this in my opinion was kind of the best allaround platform that we had so this is vera right if we go to get started here we had to wear the mask i thought that was a nice touch immediately to go ahead and get inside let's use our username of tim and then we had our profile that we set up right so we immediately put in our bmi or we got our height and our weight so we got our bmi we did the coronavirus tracker it had the voice recognition which i'm going to assume works although it wasn't working for me we had the chatbot which was cool we had the muscle builder we had the food recipes we had the health news we had the meditation we had the heart rate test everything's super related to health the platform looked really nice and streamlined and even something like the landing page if i go back outside of the dashboard here i just thought they did a nice job right you can see little animations it tells you how all of the tools work so that's kind of why i picked it again maybe that's my bias maybe you guys liked a different project better but in my opinion this was kind of the best one when it came to fitting the theme and overall having a bunch of useful features that all seemed to work related to health so congratulations of course you guys will be getting a prize as well as the one month free hacker plan so with that said that concludes this video if you stuck around until the end thank you very much for looking through all of the projects i do try to go through these quickly but there's so much stuff to show and i don't want to skip over important features so i do apologize if the video is long but that is what anyways make sure you guys sign up for the next twt code jam you can do that by joining my discord server this runs exclusively in the discord server and we also have a website twtcodejam.net where you can view submissions view the code gem theme and some other things that happen in the server so again join the discord server from the link in the description i hope to see you there and with that said like the video if you liked it subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another youtube video
