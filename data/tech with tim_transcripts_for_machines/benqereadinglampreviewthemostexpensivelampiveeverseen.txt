now to the right of me here is the van cube II reading lamp and it is probably the most expensive lamp you have ever seen and I know that I have ever owned now in this video I'm gonna talk about a few features of this lamp and if I think it warrants the massive price tag that comes along with it so this lamp retails for just under two hundred US dollars and to be transparent I do need to mention that I was sent this lamp for free from BenQ with the purpose of making a review video about it now it is designed for people that sit and stare at their monitor for multiple hours a day it's meant to reduce strain and stress on your eyes by producing sufficient and accurate lighting and what I mean by that is the temperature and brightness of the light that you're actually getting the standout feature of this lamp is the fact that you can hold down the touch ring like I am right now they will automatically adjust the temperature and brightness of the light based on the surroundings so that means if you need a brighter light or a dimmer light or a different temperature light it will automatically sense that and change that for you now you can see here the L so the amount of light this lamp actually gives off it's really nice because that curvature at the top allows it to light up almost your entire working desk surface so you can work on your computer as well as your desk and this lamp is anti glare and anti flicker now right here I'm just demonstrating turning on and off the lamp using the touch ring this is a super sensitive ring that essentially any slight touch will toggle it to go on and off which can be a good thing and a bad thing which I'll talk about later now this is the dimming ring here which allows you to adjust the brightness as well as the temperature by simply clicking down on the middle of that ring if you can change what one you're changing so once you're done changing the temperature then you can change the brightness by just clicking down the next features of this lamp is the build quality which is absolutely amazing as you would expect from a two hundred dollar lamp it's made completely of metal not sure exactly which type and it's adjustable in almost every way now there are slight restrictions on how far you can move everything but you can see that I can put this lamp pretty high up and pretty far out as well as adjusting the head which you guys will see in just one second now this head adjustment is actually great because it allows to use this as a facecam light as well which what I've been doing for the past few videos and since I can change the temperature I can make sure it looks perfect in my YouTube videos now a next feature to talk about it's just some thinking by Ben Q here which I haven't seen before and it is actually the kind of wiring and cabling that this lamp has now you guys are gonna see in a sec but the power supply is actually separate from the cable which allows you to plug that in and then you can run the cable down maybe a skinny area of your the back of your desk and plug it into this power supply which is something that's really nice and something I like to see being thought of by these companies because I've never seen anything quite like that before now this is actually another feature as well this cable runs right up the actual interior of the lamp which means you don't have to see kind of those ugly cables moving around which is always a nice feature now here I just want to demonstrate the actual brightness of the lamp and the temperature change by putting this on a great backdrop so you can see here I'm just adjusting this brightness right now and when I click down on that ring I can change the temperature and you guys can actually see the amount of adjustment you get so you can have that warm reading light or kind of that white light that's meant for maybe more working and getting stuff done now when I hold down that touch ring like I am right now it's gonna sense the light in the room and then it just accordingly now any good design needs to be both functional and goodlooking and I think that BenQ has really hit the nail on the head here I personally really like the look of this lamp I like that is sleek it's modern and the way that it kind of hangs over my monitor just works well for me it's also very functional in the sense that it gives you a ton of light and just that extra curvature is a really great engineering design and allows you to actually have the entire working area of your desk lit up which is something that I've never had from any other lamp so you guys can be your own judge whether you like the look or not but it definitely does work well for me and I do really like it so now for some of my final thoughts on the Ben qu reading lamp and I'll say it right away this is an amazing lamp and if you guys do have the budget to pick it up I definitely would recommend it now the first thing that I really want to tell you about is how much of a difference this actually makes in viewing your monitor now I don't know why this is about a scientist all I know is that when I view the monitor with oh this lamp on I notice a difference now I think it's because when that lamp is on you it just allows your eyes to relax because you're giving enough light to it I think a lot of people work with either no lights on like in your own room and just the monitor or all the lights on and then the monitors screen as well now the issue with having all the lights on is that you get glare and it's just more difficult to see crisp images on your monitor now a great thing with this lamp is there's absolutely no glare on the screen and that's kind of the main selling point of this lamp as well so by just having it over top of the monitor like that that extra light I think just allows your eyes to relax and it really does make a massive difference now the second point I really like about this lamp is the amount of light that it actually gives off in kind of that cone shape I have a very large desk here as you guys can see and I've always had an issue with regular lamps on trying to see and work on paper on my desk and then work on my computer at the same time I had to either adjust the lamp or I was getting a glare there was just always something wrong now with this and the amount of light this really gives off it almost covers my entire working area of the desk and it just makes it a lot easier to actually do work I think a lot of people underestimate the value of light and I definitely did until I actually received this lamp and saw the massive difference that it made now again it's also crazily adjustable you can put it on every angle everywhere so if I'm working or I just want to read or something I can simply just shift the lamp over slightly so that it covers wherever I needed to cover and that's something that I really like about it now the only kind of finicky details that I have about it that I don't like our one of the sensitivity of the touch sensor now this one is something that I've noticed a lot and it might just be the way that I do it and I just might be you know weird and how I do this but when I go to adjust the rim there to spin it and change the brightness of the temperature I very often accidentally hit the touch sensor and turn the light off now it's because I believe that that spinny thing like that I don't know the wheel is so close to the touch sensor that when you come in like usually what ends up happening as my knuckles will hit that touch sensor and it's super sensitive and it turns off now I just have to learn to be more careful when I go up and adjust that so that I don't actually accidentally turn it off but I figured it was something that I would mention the next thing and this is probably gonna be kind of surprising to you is even though the base of this lamp is super heavy it doesn't actually hold perfectly when you're adjusting the lamp I noticed that in a might just be because of how tight the joints are in my lab but when I try to move the lamp around and adjust it very often that base will kind of pop up just an inch or two off the table now that's because I have mine very far out and that won't happen if you have yours kind of more up because mine's like extended as far as they can go but it is a detail that I figured I would mention to you guys so with that being said this been QE reading lamp is a great lamp if you have the budget I definitely recommend it there's a link down below and one last thank you to BenQ for sending me this lamp for free I definitely have seen a massive difference now if that being said if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe to the channel I will see you guys in another video
