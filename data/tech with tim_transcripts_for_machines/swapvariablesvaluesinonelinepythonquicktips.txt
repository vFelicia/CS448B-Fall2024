hello everyone and welcome back to the video of Python quick tips in this video I'm going to show you how we can swap the value of two variables in one line in Python now without knowing this trick the way that we usually go about swapping variables is something like this we start by creating a temp variable that's equal to one of the variables in this case a then we can reassign a's value to BB and when we resize V we're assign that to the temp variable so that we get the original value of a now this works fine if I print this out you can see that does indeed change our values to be 45 and 65 but this is not very nice and we want to do this the pythonic way now the Python way to do this is just do a comma B equals B comma a and this will perform the swab for you automatically so when we do that and I run the program you can see we are still indeed swapping the variables now this works with any number of variables I can do C equals something like 100 and then maybe we'll swap this process completely so I'll say ABC equals I don't know maybe we'll do something like B C a now when we do that we can print out ABC and you can see that this does indeed work and we can swap that many variables this has been Python quick tips if you guys enjoyed make sure you leave a like and let me know what else you want to see from this series
