in this video i'll show you how to write to a file in python to do this we first need to create a file i'm going to say file equals open i'm going to put the name of my file which is file.txt and then the mode to open the file in if the file doesn't already exist use w mode if it does already exist use a w will create a new file even if the file currently exists so we'll override an existing file a will open an existing file and append stuff to the end of it so if this file doesn't exist you can't open it in a mode anyways we're going to go in w mode i'm going to say file dot write and then i'm going to write my content like this and then after i'm done that i need to close the file so let's run the code and see if this may be a new file if i go here to my directory notice a new file opens file like that now let's do this in a mode if i put this in a mode and now that i run the code let me go open my file when i open my file notice we get hello world twice one other quick way to do this is the following you can use with open file.txt and now you no longer need to close the file because it will automatically close once it's done you need to do as file like this let's run the code now if i go back to my file and i look at it notice we have a low world three times hopefully this was helpful if it was follow for more
