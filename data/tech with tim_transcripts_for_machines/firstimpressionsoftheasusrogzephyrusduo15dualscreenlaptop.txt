hello everybody and welcome to a much different video than i usually post on this channel in this video i'm going to be talking to you about this really cool laptop right here which is called the asus rog zephorus or zephyrus i'm not sure how you pronounce that duo 15. now this is a beast of a laptop it is by far the most powerful laptop that i've ever used and obviously you can tell just by looking at it's pretty unique in the sense that it has two screens here this second screen right here is actually a touch screen and i'll talk about that in this video anyways what i'm going to do here is just kind of give my first impressions and a quick look at this machine then i will talk to you quickly about some pros and cons i've noticed but when using this for pretty much the past two months so anyways let's get into this video and talk about this crazy laptop right here sorry for the quick interruption but i do need to mention that this is not a detailed review video i'm not going to be talking about all of the details of this machine i will be making one of those videos in the future so stay tuned for that but if you want more information about this device then there is some links in the description that you can press anyway sorry about that let's get into the video so even though this laptop is not that heavy i'm definitely not going to be holding it through the entire video so i'll run some kind of broll shot so you guys can see what it looks like but the first thing i need to say here is that this video is sponsored by intel and asus so they teamed up to make this super powerful machine right here this thing is powered by the 10th gen intel core i9 and that's an 8 core processor well as some other crazy specs which i'll talk about in a second but intel and asus were kind enough to send me over this machine for free so i could make a video like this so anyways let's dive into the specs of this thing because this is crazy it blows most desktop computers out of the water as i said powered by the 10th gen intel core i9 the 8 core processor this has an rtx 2080 super for the graphics card that has eight gigabytes of vram inside of it has 32 gigabytes of ddr4 ram and then it has i believe two drives or i don't know the drive configuration but it has two terabytes of nvme ssd storage and that's running in raid 0 and then moving over to the displays this has a 4k main display which is 14 inches and then the secondary display is a touch screen the main display is not a touch screen and it is scaled to 4k so because it's not you know a regular resolution screen you can't really call it 4k but in terms of pixel density it's pretty close i believe to 4k anyways this bottom screen here is a touch screen it's really cool there's a lot of functionality that it implements and at first i kind of thought it was gimmicky like just looked cool there actually is some pretty good use cases for the screen which i'll talk about later other than that this does not have a mechanical keyboard or anything crazy it just has your standard qwerty keyboard it is rgb though which is really cool it also has a trackpad on the right hand side of the laptop which again i've never seen before kind of an awkward place for it but i've gotten used to it as i've used it and then it also has this cool thing where you can turn the trackpad into a numpad uh by activating this like i guess laser or holographic kind of uh overlay on top of it so anyways really interesting device as i said and the reason i'm saying interesting is because i do really like it it's super powerful but at the same time it has a few kind of quirks and some awkward things about it that i don't know how to feel about so anyways now i'm just going to quickly talk to you about kind of my experience using this laptop and what i think because obviously this is a super powerful laptop this is really geared towards people that are going to be gaming or streaming off of this thing or people that are looking to have some kind of portable content creation machine right like you can do video editing on this whatever you would need to do this laptop has the power to be able to accommodate you so now i just want to take a minute and talk about this second screen because this is kind of the focus of this laptop and one of its key marketing points so a lot of people that have seen this and i've shown a lot of my friends and kind of got their thoughts immediately just said you know that second screen is cool but when would i ever use it and in fact i have to be honest the second screen at first when i saw it i thought the same thing i'm like okay this is cool but it's kind of gimmicky like i don't know if i would really have a use for it after using this laptop for about two months i can say that the second screen definitely does come in handy for me personally if i'm programming on this laptop or i'm doing some kind of video editing it's really nice to have a second window right at the bottom now this screen is on a 13 degree tilt so it's kind of at a perfect eye level you actually can't adjust the screen so it can't go up and down but it's a touch screen which is really nice and i find myself just using it to kind of reference things right so if i'm typing something on the main display now i don't need to tab out and look in another window i can kind of just have that at the bottom here and since it's long enough i can read text off of there i've even found myself doing some kind of scrubbing through the timeline so i put my adobe whatever adobe premiere timeline on the bottom here and use my finger to actually scrub through the timeline and that seems to be pretty effective so there is definitely some use cases for this bottom screen i think you kind of need to be creative in how you use it but personally i found myself liking it and using it and yeah i think it definitely does have a use so that's kind of the point of this now it also has kind of a little control board here where you can activate the num key you can put a bunch of windows you can change the brightness just some kind of standard things i don't find this very useful at all but i guess it's cool to have some controls that you can do specifically on this on this little screen right here so now moving on to kind of my first impressions and just some initial pros and cons of this device first of all i do actually really like this second screen as i mentioned the 4k looks amazing this is just a really great screen i haven't seen many screens other than apple screens that look this good this obviously is super powerful this can handle all my editing tasks if i need to go somewhere for a week or i just i don't have access to my big desktop this is really nice because i know that i have the power that i need to accomplish my kind of daytoday tasks and obviously as a content creator i do need a powerful machine to do a lot of the rendering and editing that i do even just coding on this thing is really nice it's super fast super snappy i can you know run as much stuff as i need to and no issue whatsoever the fact that it has 32 gigabytes of ram is a huge asset and the graphics card although i don't really need it it's really nice if i want to do something with machine learning or anything else that's going to utilize the gpu even just a little bit of light gaming so that's kind of my initial pros and thoughts on this laptop i will say that it is just really awkward to have on your lap so the keyboard since it's so far back to make room for this top screen here makes it really awkward to actually type on i find myself kind of having my shoulders up and my elbows back and i can't type nearly as fast as i usually do on say this macbook keyboard and it's just it is an awkward keyboard it's fine i can live with it but it is really strange and then the palm of your hands are kind of resting right on the edge of the keyboard and it's just it's just not the best thing in the world and same thing with this trackpad here this is a really awkward trackpad i find myself having to use my thumb to actually press down on the buttons because i'm using my index finger to scroll around and i just i don't know it's just awkward to me i don't like it and it's not in the middle which i'm used to in most traditional laptops so that's kind of the main downfalls for me it's just the fact that the second screen is here is nice but i don't know if it makes up for the fact that it's a very awkward layout on the keyboard and it just doesn't feel very natural to use other than that the other two disadvantages or kind of cons that i've noticed about this laptop is that it gets super hot and it gets super loud like i want to use this thing in a video and i want to have it sitting on my desk just like this but unless i go in and manually tweak the settings this thing's fan is so loud that my mic which is right here is picking it up and just makes my audio sound horrible i really like a completely silent device i don't want to hear any fans whatsoever and you know if i were to bring this to school for example obviously not now and i open it up and all of a sudden the fan starts going crazy like i'm just gonna have to shut it down immediately because i don't need that kind of attention in a public space or in a lecture or something like that so that's the main thing that i've noticed just because this thing is so damn powerful it uses so much power like it needs so much electricity and of course there's so much heat being generated by this 10th gen i9 and this 2080 super inside of here so anyways that's kind of my first look at this laptop right here i'm going to be doing a detailed review i haven't used this a ton i've just brought a few places with me and that's what i've noticed again advantages just super powerful can handle anything that i need be nice i can kind of game on this if i brought a mouse with me or something like that but do i think that it's worth it at this point in time i'm not sure i'm gonna have to figure out and use this more so anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video i know it's a little bit different than what i usually do i'm not a huge you know hardware review guy or anything like that but i figured we could sit down have a look at this and you know at this point in time i'd love to hear your guys thoughts on this in the comments so anyways let me know what you think leave a like on this video subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another youtube video
