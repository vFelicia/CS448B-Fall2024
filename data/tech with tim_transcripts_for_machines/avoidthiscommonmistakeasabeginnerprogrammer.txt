first and probably the most important mistake I see people making all the time is memorizing and not understanding now in programming as you'll notice as you get more advanced into it it really is so just conceptually important to understand exactly what you're doing and why it works rather than just memorizing Snippets of code and pasting things in so you need to as a beginner really be focusing on why something works and understanding every single component to some piece of code or to some tutorial or whatever it is that you're learning before you go ahead and use that or move on
