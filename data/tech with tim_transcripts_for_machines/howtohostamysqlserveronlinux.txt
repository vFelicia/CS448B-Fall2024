hello everybody and welcome back so in this video what I would be doing is showing you how you can host a MySQL server remotely and that means we're actually going to run this on a Linux server and then be able to connect to it from any machine that we'd like assuming that we set up the permissions and all of that correctly so kind of the basic process here is gonna be set up a Linux server to host this MySQL get our users kind of configured in MySQL and then use some kind of code here which is going to be this Python code which you've worked with before and try to connect to that server and make sure that everything's working so let's go ahead and get started and set up our server so the first thing we need is a linux server now fortunately for us the node has actually sponsored this video which means they're gonna be giving you guys $20 off which essentially allows you to have a server for free for four months now to gain access is free $20 and use these servers you can click the link in the description it's full node comm slash tech with Tim or you can use the code twt 19 now if you guys aren't interested in actually hosting the MySQL server and you want to use this for something else the note essentially allows you to kind of host anything like if it can run on Linux you can host this on the nodes like a website I don't know an app whatever it is a MySQL server minecraft server anything that runs on Linux you can Brown the node so you can use that and fortunately for us the node actually has ten data centers which means you can pretty much get low latency wherever you are in the world and another cool fact about this is that they're actually opening a new data center in Sydney Australia by the end of the year so that's exciting for any of you Ozzy's out there that might be falling because I know they usually don't have much hosting in Australia so is that's enough about lenôtre what we're gonna do now you start actually setting up our server so again if you guys have a Linux server you don't need to do this process but I'm just gonna walk you through because I assume some of you will follow along with me on this I'm gonna choose my distribution I've just done this by clicking create lenôtre that's how we set one up after I clicked on deploy my linux server then we're gonna go a bun to nineteen point 0.4 you can choose whatever version of ubuntu you want or whatever image as long as you know to work with it but a bun two is gonna be the one I'm using for now for regions I'm going to select my region as Toronto Ontario and for my plan I'm gonna go to nan owed one gigabyte which is five dollars a month which essentially means you can run this for free for four months if you've taken advantage of that free $20 now for my label here this is the name of the server I'm just gonna call this MySQL server very creatively and then for my password make sure you guys remember what this password is because this is what you're gonna use to actually log in to your MySQL server so I've made mine here again make sure you remember okay so once we've done this that's all we need to do we'll click on create' give it a minute or two to boot up and then once it's booted up I will be back and we'll be working with the server okay so I've booted up my server now everything seems to be working you can see that it says running here at the top right hand corner says so we know that everything's good now for this tutorial what we're actually gonna be doing is downloading a program called putty which is gonna allow us to SSH into our server in kind of a really easy way and that just means it will actually be able to modify some things and work with it from this computer now the node has a solution for this built into the website if you click on launch console you'll get a little SSH window that's here it's pretty minimal but if you just want to go in do some basic things you can use that but since we're gonna be working with a lot of commands and copying and pasting stuff we're gonna be dealing with honey so what we need to do is download putty I'll leave a link in the description it's free doesn't take up much space it's like a few megabytes and then once you have it downloaded we're gonna open it up and run it now here is where we're actually going to connect to our server now I'm gonna make this a bit bigger so you guys can see it well the first thing that we need to find is the IP address of our server so if you're on the node the way you can find that is by going to ipv4 tab here I'll zoom in a bit so you guys can see it or looking at the after the @ sign of your SSH access that's gonna be your IP address for the server other than that I'm assuming if you have your own Linux server you know the IP address so we're just gonna paste it in this host name or IP address attribute of putty here and then what I'm gonna do is change the font size of my window so that I can actually see it when we're doing this because it starts out very small so let's click on appearance I'll click on change and then I'll go to 20 like that so you guys can see it okay so once we have that we'll make sure this is typed in correctly port 22 is fine and we will click open now the first time you run this you'll probably see a window that says warning just click yes that's fine don't worry about it we're gonna log in to our server as the root user now we're gonna type route as login and the password is gonna be whatever that root password is that we created and you won't see it when you're typing it so just type it then hit enter okay so now we're in we're on our server and we can actually start installing the MySQL server so the first thing that we're gonna do is just install MySQL so to do that we're gonna type sudo apt I can get install MySQL server like that I'm gonna run that give it a second it's gonna ask us to type yes we'll hit yes and wait for this to be done and then it'll be back okay so now we have actually successfully installed MySQL on this server and what we need to do now is kind of configure it set up a few things that allow remote access because by default MySQL is localhost which means you can only connect to it locally from the server and that's fine in most cases because sometimes you'll actually run like a MySQL server on the same machine as a website and in that case you only need localhost access because you're on the same machine so you can modify the database directly from the website but in our case we need a remote so what we're gonna do now is type and actually open up the what is it called like the command I gotta look at my other screen to remember this it's like a command utility window for MySQL which will allow us to modify some security issues so we gonna say MySQL underscore secure underscore installation and then we're gonna say utility if I spell that correctly okay so now we have that so sudo MySQL underscore secure underscore installation space utility now it's gonna ask us a few things here it's gonna say validate password plugin can be used to test passwords and improve security we want this to be secure so we're gonna type Y for yes and validate our password so we're gonna enter what the minimum strength of a password could be for us to log in so in this case I'm gonna choose to actually I'm gonna shoot 0 as low because I just want to do a basic password for this but you guys could do strong and that means every time you create a new user it needs to have a strong password okay so I'll type 0 now it's gonna ask us for a root password before our MySQL server I'd recommend you just make sure that this is a strong password and that you recommend or you remember it because this is how you're actually going to be able to log into like the admin part of my SQL and modify everything in set permissions so you don't want anyone accidentally getting in here so I'm gonna set my password here and I'm not gonna tell you guys what it is and then it's gonna say estimated strength of the password 100 whatever it is and then you can just go ahead and click why okay so now it's gonna say remove anonymous users we can do that that's fine we'll click yes we don't need those and then it says normally root should only be allowed to connect from local host this ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network we'll go ahead and we'll we will hit yes as well this just means that there's no way that you can login to the MySQL server as the root user unless you're actually on the machine and that's fine then it's gonna say remove test database and access to it we will hit yes as well and remove that reload privilege tables now and we will hit yes once again and hit enter so again this process you guys can change what goes on here but that's kind of my recommended security settings and now we're ready to get in and actually creating a user and changing a few things so that this can be seen by any machine so what we need to do now is actually set up a basic firewall on this machine so to do this we're gonna say sudo ufw enable which is just setting up like a really basic firewall command maybe just Rob yep that's fine we'll click yes so now it says firewall is active and enabled on system startup now what we're gonna do is say sudo ufw allow MySQL which essentially means we're gonna allow MySQL to kind of bypass this firewall and you know see other connections okay so now that we have that we need to actually mess with kind of a complicated setting of MySQL which is the server binding now to gain access to this file where this is we need to CD into a certain directory I'm actually gonna copy it in here because I am NOT going to remember what this is just from my other monitor so what we're gonna do is we're gonna CD into etc' MySQL MySQL comp dot d and hit enter so this is the directory path now if you want to go like level by level you can like CD into e.t.c then CD into MySQL then CD into the next row three but this is the command you guys can pause the video and type that it okay so now we're in this correct directory so now what we're gonna do is actually use Nano to modify a specific file now the file we need is gonna be my SQL D dot C and F so gonna say Nano mysqld dot CNF and Nano is just a very basic text editor so now we're in Nano to navigate through Nano you're gonna use the arrow keys so I'm gonna scroll down until I see something that says binding so it says bind address here so you can see that the default value is 127.0.0.1 now what that means is this is actually only binded to localhost which means that only localhost which is the actual machine can access the server we obviously don't want that we want to build to access that from outside of this so what we're gonna do is change this to 0 dot 0 dot 0 dot 0 which is gonna mean that anything can access this server so it's binding to it essentially any IP address that the server has which means we can access it from anywhere else so now we're gonna save this by hitting ctrl s so that saves and exit by hitting ctrl X ok so now that we've done that what we need to do now is simply set up a user that we can actually use to access the database setup a basic database and then we'll be good to connect from our Python code okay so I almost forgot a few important commands here we want to make sure that MySQL is always running on the server whether we turn it off or reboot it or whatever so we're gonna start gonna add this as a service now the command to do this is sudo and I have to look at my other screen otherwise I'm gonna mess this up system CTL start MySQL so what this has done now is started the MySQL service and now what we're gonna do is make sure that the service runs continuously so to do that this command is pseudo system so it's actually the same at the beginning and then it is an able so enable my SQL ok so there we go and now we are good to go so it says it's executed this we've had this so now we've set up MySQL we start it we've enabled it and now what we're gonna do is restart it to make sure that these settings are safe so to do that one we're gonna do sudo I got her look at this again system systemctl restart my SQL okay oops did I do something wrong yep I need to spell system correctly so suitum sudo systemctl restart mysql okay so now we've restarted and now we're actually gonna go into the mysql settings and start modifying some things so to do this we're gonna type mysql u which stands for user we're gonna type root which is the root user then we're going to type Pete I was gonna ask you for your password this will be the password we set up when we went into that utility so make sure you that you know what that one is there we go so I've typed it in I'm now in the MySQL console and this actually will now allow us to type my SQL queries as well as to grant access to specific users so the first thing I'm actually gonna do is create a database so i'm gonna say create database test let's keep it lower case like that and I'm gonna end this with a semicolon so let's hit enter it says query okay one row effected and now we've created test database and the reason I've done this is because we're gonna give access to our user to this specific database on our MySQL server so now what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna type grant all on test dot star now what this is saying is I'm gonna grant all permissions on the database test and test dot star just means any tables inside the database if you wanted to grant access to a specific table like say we had a table called users then we would do test dot users and that would give this user specific access just to the user table from this database but I want them to have access to all so I will stay start and if you wanted to just grant access say maybe you just want them to be able to select data like just look at data in the database you would say grant select if you wanted you know grant select and update or if you wanted like grant select I'm trying to think of other queries you could do here I guess create delete you could do that and that will give that user specific access to those commands so I'm gonna say grant all on test dot star and then what I'm gonna do is actually type kind of a complicated thing so I'm just going to look to make sure don't mess this up I'm gonna type too and in this case we're gonna type the name of our user which is Tim @ and now this is where it gets kind of complicated we need to actually get the IP address of the machine that's gonna be accessing this so right now we set up a linux server we have my school running and now we're actually gonna give access to a specific machine to access this server so to find the IP address of your computer you can literally just go into google and type my IP address now I'm not gonna do that because that would show you guys what my IP address is but let's just do a like you know test example see you guys see what I mean so I'm gonna do two Tim and then you would type whatever that IP address is so you search my IP address you find your public IP address and you put it here let's just say it's like 172.16.0.0 that we want now in this case I'm just gonna make a password like one two three four five six but you guys should make this a secure password because this is gonna be how you access the database remotely from that specific machine so quick recap because this is the most important part I'm sorry I'm dragging this on grant all on database that you want then whatever table or you know all of them with star to the username that you're gonna log in with which in this case is Tim at sign the IP address of whatever machine is gonna be logging into this so the public IP address you can find that by looking on Google identified by some password in quotation marks okay so once we have that we're gonna hit enter sorry we're gonna put a semicolon then we're gonna hit enter I'm getting an error because it's saying my password is not strong enough but I will set that in and then move on so now that we've done this we're actually done everything that we need to do on the MySQL Linux server and we can actually start messing with this from our Python code and that's the part I'll get into now okay so we finished everything on the linux server hopefully for you guys that query worked again you're gonna use your public IP address and then put the password and so identified by you know that string password okay so I hope you haven't forgotten the server IP address because we still need that so here I mean some Python code this should look familiar if you followed the previous tutorials otherwise what you need to do is install MySQL connector on this machine then you're gonna set up a database connection like this and here what we're gonna do now is for our connection rather than using the localhost connection which we had before we're actually going to use the IP address of the server that's running cool so that Linux server that we've created now here so I will take this IP address copy that again put that as the host I'm gonna put that username as whatever the user was that we had before so whatever one we created so like Tim act right and then our password is gonna be whatever password it is now this is the password I set strong password one two three four star I know makes sense and now what we're gonna do is just run this and see if we get any errors so if you run this and there's no issues there's no errors that pop up you can create a database cursor you've set up this connection you are fine and you're actually good to go and start working with this like it was any other database that we've had before now when I say you know show databases I can print out my cursor dot fetch one if I could type properly and then we will see we get information schema which is some database that we have so if we want to connect to that specific database we had before what I can actually do here say database and then I believe I called created one called test right I think I did so then I also say test and you know what it says show databases I want to say show tables and then we see we have no tables to show here so anyways we are actually good to go now we can run any queries we've connected to this MySQL server so if you guys how many questions about this leave a comment down below but again a thank utila note take advantage of the free $20 credit you guys can do whatever you want with these servers and hopefully this helped you out in terms of how to connect there's any steps you want to be you know like you didn't understand or I made something confusing please again leave a comment I'll try my best to respond with that being said I will see you guys in another YouTube video
