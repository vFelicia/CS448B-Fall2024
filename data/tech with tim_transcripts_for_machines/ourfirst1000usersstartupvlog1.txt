foreign a few days ago my tech started velocity released the first version of our mobile app which is now available on IOS and Android if you haven't already downloaded it you can do that from the link in the description and use the invite code Tech with Tim we're only going to be letting on a few hundred more people so if you want a chance to view the app before it gets to the next state and kind of when we're in our early release let's call it that then make sure you do that now regardless after announcing this on my YouTube channel we got a ton of feedback on the app we gained our first a thousand users and a bit more and now after being a few days past the release I wanted to share with you kind of some of the lessons that we've learned challenges that we've ran into problems that occurred and just tell you a bit about how the release went and kind of keep you guys updated this is something I want to continue to do on this channel talk to you guys about how the startup is going things that I've learned from a technical perspective also from a user perspective marketing business Etc hopefully you guys are looking forward to that with that said let's get into the video so in case any of you didn't see my original video that goes through the full walkthrough and demo of the app so feel free to check that out I'll throw it on the screen but now let me explain to you kind of what happened on release day so I posted a video at about noon my time now as soon as I posted the video it did pretty well immediately and within the first two hours we had a few hundred new users on our app now we got a ton of feedback during that time and we had a ton of issues and bugs that occurred now one of the most critical issues that occurred was there was an issue with our invite code system now this was an issue I had never seen before even when I tested with about a hundred other people on different IOS and Android devices but I think what happened was we had a bunch of people join at once which we've never had and it caused a little bit of latency on our back end which essentially resulted in people kind of being stuck on the invite code Redemption page so what they would do is redeem their invite code the app would tell them yes the invite code's all good but it wouldn't move them forward in the onboarding process and that's because of again a bit of latency between when we were assigning kind of a rule that allowed the user in an app and when the app was checking if they had that role so it was checking before that role was assigned so what I needed to do was very quickly and go on our back end do a little bit of a fix and essentially make it so the role was assigned earlier in the process so that they would then be able to join the app so maybe that makes a bit of sense but we lost probably about 100 users in the first few hours of my video being released because we had this bug that I couldn't fix or I didn't know about fortunately the bug was kind of selfcorrecting if you were to close the app and reopen it you were fine you would have got through but again something popped up completely unexpected and right at the beginning of our kind of user registration process which is the worst possible time for it to occur so I guess the lesson here is that anything that can go wrong is going to go wrong you kind of need to be prepared for that and I won't lie to you you know it's a bit stressful for me in those few hours kind of running around panicking making a bunch of YouTube comments and trying to figure out what this issue was so anyways that's kind of what happened at the beginning of the release and then as we continued throughout the day I was kind of monitoring all of the analysis looking at all of our different dashboards and overall everything was going okay obviously there was some bugs there was some minor issues some problems with some games there was a few people crashing in the app but this wasn't anything unexpected whenever you have a brand new app that you're rolling out to a bunch of people around the world on hundreds of different devices you're going to run into stuff like this that you just can't find in internal testing so I wasn't too stressed about that and as I kind of went through the day I started to realize that a lot of the weird bugs that were occurring were occurring on very very old Android devices so we had done a lot of testing on iOS and for the most part iOS was completely fine Android however is a little bit harder to test because just so many different devices and versions and what ended up happening was a ton of you guys I don't know why are on like Android 4 Android 5 Android 6 which are really really old versions of Android and you were having a lot of issues with the app that were causing you guys to crash so I guess kind of the lesson here was that we needed to make the minimum supported version for the app higher which which we didn't know in K until you guys started crashing with all these older versions of Android and the only way I was able to determine that was because I added a crashlytics we use Firebase so it's called crashlytics the package added like a crash monitoring software to the app that kind of gave us information about all the app devices all of the Android versions Etc so I was able to determine that anyone below a certain version of Android uh was just crashing in the app because they had an outdated kind of java SDK that's at least what I think the problem was so we've kind of fixed that now but again something that we didn't consider I didn't think that people were going to be on an Android version from 2015 or from 2014 or on a really really tiny Android device there's all kinds of weird bugs occurring there so we kind of had to mitigate that going forward so again lesson here you know you got to really consider that almost anyone can be using your app especially if you're going on a platform like Android and that's something that I didn't really think and that was kind of an oversight for me when I was doing the original development so continuing here the next thing I'll discuss is feedback now obviously feedback is super super important especially when you're in kind of an early release and there's all kinds of bugs and issues that could occur especially because you guys are Technical and you can actually kind of determine if something's a bug or if it's expected Behavior just because you guys have some experience programming so we received a ton of feedback in the app we actually have kind of like a form you can go into on the app to submit it and through the YouTube comment section which was extremely helpful so this isn't something that we struggled with it's just something I wanted to mention we kind of thought about this beforehand and we made sure there was a way for you guys to submit us feedback directly and we have an internal kind of admin dashboard where we can go and view all of that feedback and kind of check it off as completed like we've handled it we've responded to that now the one thing that we kind of missed here was collecting more information about where the feedback was coming from so this was you know my fault but I forgot to collect like the device uh the username like some other more important information that we'd want related to who's submitting the feedback so we still could track it to who did it but we had no way to communicate back with that user or to determine you know what device they were on if it was Android or iOS or what version of the app they were on because we had two versions at one point in time Etc so that was something that we should have collected that we didn't and now we're gonna have to add into the new version additionally we didn't allow users to submit like a video or a photo which obviously would have been really helpful so going forward we're probably going to add that to the feedback page just to give us some more clarity as to what the issue actually is so moving on the next thing I'll talk about is data and analytics now obviously there is analytics in the app we know all of the page views we have a bunch of events I spent a lot of time building this in however our infrastructure on the back end for kind of viewing all of this data analyzing it quickly is not the best and something that as a company we need to work on so even though we did build custom kind of admin and internal dashboards like analytics dashboards it was still difficult for us to kind of find the information that we were looking for once all of our users were on the app and generated all of this data and it was let's say more time consuming that it had to be to kind of filter through different events look through different data do queries we didn't have everything set up as robustly as we probably wanted so that's something we learned very quickly you know we have all of this data we want to start making decisions based on this but that takes time we don't even know necessarily how to view all this data correctly it's hard to really draw meaningful conclusions maybe we messed up an event in the app and that caused you know some questions on if our data was valid or not so just something to note there I can't really go into too much more depth beyond that but just the importance of analytics and being confident in the data that you have because you can have a ton of different data but if you're not sure where it's coming from or if you logged it correctly then that data kind of becomes meaningless alright next another lesson that we learned here was really the importance of our onboarding process so for our app we have kind of a multistep onboarding process now admittedly this is not the best it needs some work and we kind of knew that before doing the release but this release really solidified in our minds you know how important it is to kind of change the onboarding and make it a more rapid entrance to to the app rather than this kind of slow you know multistep thing where we're going to lose people along the way so that's what we noticed not you know crazy but we did lose a few users through the onboarding process and when users did get through the onboarding they didn't necessarily know where to go in the main application what I mean by that is we didn't have a great kind of starting point we didn't have you know like a guided tutorial of the app where we walked through all the features and I think and from what I saw from some of the feedback that we have a lot of users were kind of overwhelmed by the number of buttons and pages and they didn't know directly what to click on or kind of where to go now most of you were able to figure out the app I think some of you also watched my demo which probably helped but going forward we're going to need to revise that onboarding process and just make it more clear as to what the app is about what you're supposed to do and really simplify kind of the initial phase and then let you figure out the rest of the features afterwards so with that said guys I think that's going to wrap up kind of this first video this first kind of update about the release nothing critically horrible went wrong it wasn't any major mistakes overall the app's working it's scaling pretty well it hasn't been too expensive yet on Firebase generally speaking things are good a lot of you guys have been enjoying the app you've given some really positive feedback with that said of course there's bugs of course there's issues there's stuff that needs to be fixed there's some crashes that we need to address and those will all get fixed in the coming weeks months Etc I really appreciate all of you for supporting the startup for downloading the app from the link in the description and generally just for supporting me as I kind of go through this journey so I want to continue to update you on what's going on give you more information about analytics maybe you'll actually look at the kind of analytics dashboard in the next video let me know what you guys want to see and hear about the startup and with that said I will see you in another one
