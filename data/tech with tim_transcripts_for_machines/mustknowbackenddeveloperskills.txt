okay so moving on to the second skill you would need to have to become a backend python developer this may seem a little counterintuitive but this is some basic frontend skills now whenever you're working on the back end you're still going to be touching aspects of the front end even if you're not writing frontend code you might have to understand it digest it kind of look at it and read it and for that reason you should understand some basic HTML basic CSS you should understand maybe a little bit of JavaScript so I would spend a bit of time maybe a week or two kind of looking into some of those skills learning how to build some basic front ends maybe you want to dabble in something like react view angular some other popular Frameworks that's up to you but I would know some basic frontend skills
