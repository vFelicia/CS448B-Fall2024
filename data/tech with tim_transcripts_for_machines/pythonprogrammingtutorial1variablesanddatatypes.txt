hey guys so welcome back today I'm going to be doing a Python tutorial series so this is the first episode in the series kind of an introduction showing you how to download Python how to install it and then going into data types and variables so the first important thing to understand about the Python programming language so don't worry if you've ever program before I'm going to be going over everything very slowly and in depth so that you can understand I recommend that you follow along with everything I'm doing in the toriel pause the video at certain points rewind if you don't understand it's important you understand these parts so that we can move forward into more complex ideas so obviously the first thing that we're going to do if we're going to learn Python is we have to install it on our computer so we're going to go to the python website up here python org slash downloads right here and all you're going to do is just click download Python three point six point one now I'm not going to do that because I already have Python installed and downloaded on my computer but pretty much once you download this it's going to pop up down here and your downloads folder just run the exe it's very simple and you'll be running Python in no time so now pause the video go ahead and do that and then we can go to the next steps okay so once you've done that you're going to notice that you have an application that looks like this it's called IDL e Python and then it'll have the version so I'm using version 3.5 don't worry if you have a version that is large and not so three point six or even one that's before that most of the things that I do in this will work in all the versions of Python okay so go ahead and run the IDL you'll notice the first thing that pops up is the Python shell as you can see at the top here at the shell now this right here is not where we're going to write all our programs it's the console kind of so here I can type any lines of code for example I want to print a name like this and it will run right away so that's not what we're going to do you can play around with this if you want but we're going to go to file and we're going to click new file and then here we go so now we have a new document that we're going to be working on in Remy programming so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to save this right away as tutorial 1 into my tutorial folder which I believe is on my desktop right here yep right there awesome okay so there we go we've saved it and now we're ready to learn a little bit about datatypes so pretty much Python is a fairly basic language in comparison to a lot of other ones a lot of things that does is a more simple than other languages but it is important to understand the basic datatypes so there's four main data types in Python there is a few more but we're just going to talk about these ones right now the first one is an integer so that can be a shortform int that stands for integer now an integer is any number so such as 1 for 76 any whole number it's important that is a whole number it could be a negative number as well negative 5 0 those are all integers okay now we have strings now if the shortform clear strings is STR now pretty much a string is anything embedded in quotations so like this this my name Tim that is a string and then we also have something like this this would be a string and even like this this would be a string so although there is a number in here since it is between these two quotations here it is a string so even if I did a Mele number like like that string now it's also important to understand that it doesn't matter if you use the single quotations or the double quotations sometimes we use the single quotations because inside of our actual quotations all you want to use double quotations or maybe if we use the double quotations because we want to use the single quotations inside of our actual string like that okay so those are just a few examples now we have boolean variables or datatype sorry so boolean datatypes is something like true and false so true and false pretty basic these are reserved words in Python meaning that they're highlighted in yellow and that you cannot use them for variable names that's going to be important later on just know that they are important words true and false and they do start with capitals so for example if I type true like this it's not highlighting orange right so that's because true in Python the key word for that starts with a capital so true and false then we have the decimals which is a float data type like this so anything with a decimal floating point so one point two three anything like that any decimal number with a floating decimal point would be a float okay so those are the four basic data types there is a few more that'll go on to later on but you just have to understand these ones right now so now that we know these data types I'll give a quick little quiz here so I'm just going to put a few things right here and then I want you to pause the video and go ahead and try to determine what type of data type these things are okay so go ahead pause the video and then I'll go over the answers in a second okay so we'll start with the first one here hello it's the same example that I have up here except in single quotations so we can see that it is a string data type okay so that is the shortform STR now we have the number 123 that would be the integer data type we have another number here that has a decimal point so 3.2 that would be a float we have the keyword true this data type is a boolean data type then we have two in quotations this is very important we don't want to get this mixed up this is a string some people may think that it's an integer because it's two but no it actually is a string because it is inside of the quotations and then same thing here three inside of the double quotations is a string and not an integer okay so now that we have an idea of the basic datatypes I'm going to show you how to create a variable so pretty much you may have heard of variables before in math or something like that in math we tend to use X as a variable we say X maybe five X maybe four anything like that it's the same thing in Python now declaring a variable in Python is very easy all you have to do is type the variable name so in this case I'm going to use name and then simply give it a value so this value as you may remember is a string this is my name and I'm destroying it in the variable name now if I want to access that variable I want to see what that variable is I can print it to the console by simply typing the variable name which is name so now we'll see what happens if I run the program it's going to run run module I'm going to use f5 from now on so that's the thing and you can see it prints out Tim just like that okay now say we did that we have name equals 10 we printed it to the screen now maybe we want to change that variable well it's very easy again all we have to do is just type the value name and now maybe we going to change it to Bob and now we want to see what the new very new variable is so we will print it to the screen or print name click f5 to run that and we'll see name and I are sorry Tim and then Bob so like we have here name equals Tim print name name equals Bob print name right so you set it like that okay so that's pretty basic um now you can create variables of different data types so for example if we had a variable age I would use an integer data type so like 18 for that variable and then again if I wanted to print it to the screen I would say print and then the variable name like that okay 80 perfect right so we printed that to the screen again if the variable names there's a few restrictions on variable names so here you just see I've used three lowercase letters your variable names can contain underscore they cannot contain dashes they can only contain underscores text and they cannot start with a number I believe so if I try to do one one name equals two for example I run into an invalid syntax error because we can't name a variable starting with a number now I can end it with a number I believe let's try yep so that's fine it's let us do that name equals one I could do name underscore person maybe yeah name underscore person you see if I run that program everything's fine there but I can't put something like a star in my variable name you see how we've got an invalid syntax there right this is because these symbols represent something else in the Python language so just know four names we can use capital as if we'd like I could use name like that so then the program that works fine but I cannot start it with numbers so I cannot put a number there and I cannot contain anything other than underscores texts and numbers in or at the end of the variable name now here's a quiz for you if I make a variable called name do another variable called name are they the same thing now that's a good question are these two the same thing no they are not the same thing so capitals do matter in Python the all capitals variable name is different than the variable name so again name like this is different than all of those variables there okay so I think I've covered a little bit on variables and data types today I'm just to be complete basics just wanting to get everyone caught up in the next video we'll go into some more advanced things maybe operations of variables adding them together subtracting multiplying boolean conditions things like that ok so I hope you enjoyed the video today stay tuned and we're going to have another one out tomorrow and like the video if you if it was good and subscribe so yeah thank you
