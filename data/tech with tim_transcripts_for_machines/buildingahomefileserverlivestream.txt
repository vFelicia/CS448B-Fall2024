moment we should be live let's check i think i am live okay so you guys need to tell me i've never done something like this before if the audio is okay if the video is okay if you guys can see everything unfortunately for this stream it's just gonna be one camera angle i don't have like an overhead camera and a webcam and all that side stuff but i think i'm live i think this is working just gonna spend a minute monitoring the chat to make sure we're all good um i will explain how all this stuff is set up and what everything's going to be doing in just one second i'm going to give you guys a second to come in all right i think you guys can see me yeah the chat is saying good awesome okay sweet awesome all right so what i'm going to be doing in this stream is just building a file server so everyone's been asking me like what language are you using what tech stack no tech stack it's a physical file server i have three hard drives these are each two terabytes that i'm going to be putting in here this case which i'll show you guys later actually has room for eight so the reason i'm building this is because as you can see i have my mac i have my big pc and i actually record all my video on the camera and i record all of my audio on the mac so i want to be able to really easily store all of that stuff on the same computer and access it from the mac and access it from the pc also i have probably four or five terabytes of video files currently on ssds on my computer i'd like to offload those and just keep everything on one central server and then that way i can remote into it later if i'm somewhere else and actually access those files anyways that's kind of my reasoning i'm going to go through the parts that i picked right now and i also just mentioned that this is going to be a really casual stream i'm not going to be worried about doing this quickly i'm going to be trying to look at the chat i can see that you guys are saying some stuff here and yeah i'll just be trying to answer some questions and we'll just kind of have fun and just chat and yeah i mean i'm planning on going for probably about an hour and a half two hours depends on if we run into any problems and i will quickly mention that i'm not going to be doing any of the software configuration here i am planning on running these hard drives in a raid array i've never done that before so i figured let's do that off stream and not have you guys to watch me painfully try to figure out all these problems all right so that being said let's start going through some of the parts i'll talk about the prices and everything i've got 279 people watching thank you to everyone uh everyone let me know if there's any problems or anything going on this is like a really strange setup i have a monitor right here where i'm watching myself i've got the camera i actually have a boom mic here that you guys can't see this pc is actually streaming everything so the one down there that you can see the mac is running all the audio you get the point there's a lot of places where things could fail all right so this build is about 900 canadian dollars before tax i need to run a ryzen what is this ryzen 5 second gen processor this is a what's the exact model 3400 g it's 4.2 gigahertz max boost 3.7 gigahertz base it's a four core processor and it has integrated graphics now i would have gone with something like a pentium or a celeron but i don't want to go with intel because they're stopping making a lot of stuff for intel and the guy recommended at the store that this would be better and it would just be faster if i wanted to do anything else with this computer funny enough i could actually game on the cpu if i wanted to i'm not going to be doing that but it's good enough i think this was like 200 bucks or something like that next i've got a single stick of 8 gigabytes of ram ddr4 i don't need anything special again this is just a server it's not really going to be like running any applications it's just going to be storing files and then i have a b450f gaming motherboard i would have gone with something lower end but they didn't have enough sata ports on all the motherboards under 100 so i think this is about 180 the ram i think was like 50 or 60 bucks or something um and this has six data ports on it so this case actually can hold eight hard drives so i will need like a raid card or whatever that extension thing is if i want more sata ports but yeah and then i have a 400 watt power supply and that's pretty much it this is a pretty bare bones build i also have sorry two fans i'm gonna be installing these are just i took out of an old case that i had and yeah so there's not much to do that's why i figured i'd just get on the stream and we just chat let's do a quick look at the chat here see what you guys are doing 200 for that cpu this is all canadian dollars by the way guys i don't know how much i actually paid for this to be honest with you i just tapped the card when the guy said that's what it is um so i bought it from a store so whatever their retail price was but it is quad core so like i don't think it's that bad and it's a ryzen 5. all right what else you guys saying are you going to be awkward in this to youtube i think you mean upload and yes this will be uploaded to youtube afterwards don't worry if you miss it uh is discord glitched what are you guys all saying here hello okay anyways if you guys have questions just pop them in the chat i'll be looking at it periodically but i'm gonna go ahead and actually get started building some of this stuff so i will show you the parts again unfortunately only this one angle so you're not going to get like a super close up high quality look at everything oops that's a great start smash that into my case okay and another great start just smash the boom mic if you guys can't tell i've never done something like this before this is kind of a new setup for me uh but if you guys have any ideas for what you'd like to see in like say a 24hour coding live stream or 12 hour coding live stream leave some things in the chat because i am planning on doing that probably sometime in october and a lot of you guys have been asking me about making like a social media website and stuff like that i'm planning on either doing that as a video series like kinda partially live uh where like i don't prepare anything beforehand because a lot of my videos i do that for or i'll do it on a live stream but the only thing is if i do it on a live stream it could be pretty painful to watch me but anyways we'll see but let me know if you guys want to see something like that uh in the chat and again let's just you know keep chatting the point of this is just to talk to you guys and answer any questions and all that okay i like when nvidia pulled yeah so if anyone is just joining in here i as i said before this is like a 900 build or something and honestly could game with this if i wanted to it's nice because i actually left myself a room if i want to put a graphics card in this i can so we could technically turn this into like a low end gaming machine at some point although i don't really anticipate that happening okay so let's use the tip from ltt which you guys are putting in the chat here to use the motherboard box as a openair test bench now i'm going to take a risk and not test all of this before i put it in the case i've never had a problem i've built a lot of computers before if that happens well then i guess the stream will just be longer than usual all right so this is actually the motherboard it's not as low end as i was planning on getting but uh you know it's just because it's the only one that had the sata ports on the side as i'm not sure if you guys can see it there yeah so this is motherboard decent i o and yeah enough slots where if i want to put a gpu in it i can all right let's see what everyone's saying 400 is really low for cpu plus gpu yeah i know if i put a gpu in this this is gonna be a really low end gpu something that only takes like one single six pin or eight pin or maybe not even any of that this power supply isn't even modular you guys are gonna cringe at the cables but this case when i eventually start showing it to you which i just don't have room to do right now it doesn't have any tempered glass side panels or anything so won't really matter all right let's get that out and let's pull this guy out of here all right yeah so we've got the yeah ketchup and mustard cables yellow and red i didn't even know it was like that but there you go probably not a great idea to hold it from the cables but that's fine the mother boot is too good for the gpu and cpu you bought well i don't have a gpu and i know it's too good but the reason i got it again is because all of the lower end boards only have four sata ports on them and i want at least six because in the future i'm planning on upgrading the server by adding more drives right now i only have three drives but i anticipate potentially adding more and as i mentioned before i will be putting these in a raid array but that's not going to be a part of this live stream all right power supply is here let's actually get the cpu up and start installing that okay here's our cpu not sure if you guys can see that there at all focus focus maybe not okay that's fine we'll show it later and cpu cooler all right does the cooler have rgb is the question probably not but we will see and no no rgb on this cooler when i bought my ryzen 9 which is in the other pc it actually ended up coming with an rgb ish like cooler that had like a ring around it which was kind of interesting okay let's get some of this stuff out of the way and let's go for the cpu install first what's everyone saying what does the server you are building going to do it's just going to store files it's only going to store video files audio files it's going to make it a lot easier for me to transfer files from my mac to my actual big computer which you guys can kind of see the setup for back there because right now i've been using google drive just to send audio files but i have to wait for it to upload wait for it to download it's just kind of a mess and i'd rather just keep it in one location and then all of the video files that i have so i store copies of all my videos even though youtube saves them just in case something happens so i want to have room for the you know 500 plus videos that i have and they're continually just being larger file sizes as i record in higher resolution higher frame rate all that stuff which hopefully you guys have noticed if you've been following this channel for a while all right so cpu is in i guess i'll have to kind of walk you through this because you won't see what i'm doing so there we go and now it is time to put the cooler on now i actually don't even know how to install this i've never installed like an air cooler on a ryzen thing so i think i have to take off these little metal pieces there's these like black bars but yeah do you live in a house or an apartment i have a house uh why are you asking tim how to improve english yeah don't ask me how to do that will you keep up the flutter video uh maybe so you're gonna use raid or unraid i have no idea um are you going to make a stream for coding this yes and also the stream is delayed on my end probably about 20 or 30 seconds so i if you'll notice that when i'm reading the chat but there's not really much i can do about that okay so let's start unscrewing some of this stuff i wish i had set up some music beforehand but then i'll just get copyright striked okay why building a new pc when you can add drives to your existing pc because i want this to be a dedicated server where all it does is just store files so that way i don't have to have a ton of spinning hard drives in my computer i just don't want that to happen it's just going to be a lot easier if i just have a dedicated machine and i also want to do a live stream and build something for you guys so i figured this would be a good way to do that um yeah big shout out to my discord server all the guys with mods with the exception of maybe one or two people are from there you guys can join that there should be a link in the description i'm actually doing these like code jam competitions i'm going to be doing a video announcing the winner of a recent code jam one we did uh pretty soon so yeah definitely join that and check that out okay so these are out i think this should be good to go now i don't know if there's like a specific way to put this on i'm gonna guess the logo should just line up with the other logos i think that's all i need to do okay so that should be good let's see if that fits in there and perfect i think i did it correctly great let me know in the chat if you guys are um what do you call it uh pc builders as well if you saw my channel i did a video building that pc behind me with you guys can see all the lights on and stuff and some of you mentioned that you're in the pc master race but let me know are you going to use linux yes i'm going to use linux there's already thermal paste on this cooler don't worry that would have been an interesting mistake i recently participated in tim's code gym it was dope i'm glad to hear that um yeah i have thermal paste already on the on the cooler i appreciate it though guys yeah if you notice me making any mistakes don't hesitate to uh to let me know okay gotta get this guy down see is that in okay i think so come on get in there there we go let's see what people are seeing pc master race thermal pace thermal pace is in guys i'm telling you i swear i got it don't worry okay and there we go all right so let's just put this into the cpu fan it looks like that's right there now cable management is going to be pretty much irrelevant for this build again because there's no panel right so i don't need that now a question for all of you guys what ram slot does a single ram stick go in uh if we're saying like left to right of the board that's what i want to know i think i know what one it is but maybe you guys can confirm for me we're looking at the board closest to the cpu cooler how many slots over two i guess on yours is probably your left for me it's my right um which one does it go in what distro of linux are you gonna use i don't know i'm gonna that's gonna be after this this video i'm not doing that in this stream that would be too painful i also need to set up a keyboard and mouse and all that kind of stuff all right so here's my ram stick probably the skinniest ram stick i've ever seen in my life i think it's like 30 i think it's 3 000 megahertz i opted to get one a little bit faster rather than go with the uh slower like 2666 okay let's see this i think it goes in the second slot i'm pretty sure let me look at my other pc yeah okay it definitely goes in the second slot i'm pretty sure that's right let's see if you guys are confirming slot b okay yes awesome correct how many of you go in here 366 people well thank you to everyone for tuning in appreciate it see what everyone else is saying second one can you explain what you're doing in a nutshell sure i am building a file server so essentially as you guys know youtube channel lots of videos lots of audio files lots of editing files just a ton of files and i just rather have them stored in one central place and then also just for a sales failsafe right like say something goes wrong with my computer i ruined the os or something i don't know whatever it blows up who knows i want to have all these videos saved in one's central place this server is going to go somewhere else in my house it's not even going to be in this room and it's just going to act as a place where i can store and transfer files between my big pc my mac any other computers i have and that's kind of the objective of it that's what i'm doing here and that's the point because when i do a recording i record audio here video on the camera and i just want to store everything even the raw files themselves and the editing files on the uh the server so that's what i'm doing uh why don't you use cloud servers i could use cloud servers i just prefer to have a physical one i've just it's just better i won't have to pay for it in the future i can upgrade to have as much storage as i want i don't have to deal with outages i do actually have a ups uninterruptible power supply that this is going to go into so in theory unless there's a really long power outage this should never be out of power um and that's yeah kind of the point of it all right so it looks like our motherboard is done i kind of didn't even realize how little stuff i was actually gonna have to do here because i'm i don't have any rgb i don't have a graphics card i don't have any like crazy fans or radiator or water cooler um so i guess when you build pcs without the highend stuff it really goes quite quickly i'm just working on the power supply now and then i'm gonna start showing you guys the case although once that comes out it's gonna be quite difficult for you to see me okay what drives did you buy i have three two terabyte seagate barracuda drives these two are new focus and then this one isn't i don't say older but it was in my other computer and i just pulled it out it has some files on it i don't know why for some reason the form factor on these if you guys can see the thickness level is different i don't i don't know why that is but anyways i don't think that's gonna make a difference okay so let's actually throw the motherboard in first i'm gonna have to clear some space here and then we'll put the power supply all right let's check some stats too 393 current viewers this is the biggest live stream i've done yet appreciate it guys and yeah keep you know asking away in the chat i'm just going to take my time and talk to you guys 7 200 rpm yep i'm pretty sure they are at least that uh what do you prefer windows or apple uh why not ssd because i don't need it to be like super fast storage it's more the longevity of the storage i just want it i mean you could say that ssd is more reliable sure but they are a lot more expensive and if i want to put say you know 20 terabytes of storage in a server it's probably not realistic that i'm gonna do that with ssds um i could but it's just kind of more expensive than i really want to uh to get into here especially for what i'm using this for all right i will sit down in a moment so you guys can see me but just gotta get this case going all right i would love you know what i'll show you guys the case like this maybe and you guys can kind of get an idea of what it looks like on the inside let me know if that's a decent view there you go see look at all the heart oops look at all the hard drive bays it has eight bays that's why i went with this case it was kind of expensive but i think it'll be worth it for sure and it doesn't actually look that bad but as i mentioned no tempered glass or anything like that okay so let's get out all these parts oops like they're stuck in here all right screws sweet what are you saying raid allows for multiple disk use yep that is correct what's the name of the case uh this is a fractal design something i don't let's see if it says here fractal design no it's not giving me the model i have it somewhere remind me later and maybe i'll get it thank you guys like the case i'm glad use arch linux why do you have a computer case you can use little ones i don't quite understand that can you please do a unity tutorial maybe the chair is comfortable for entire day work yeah the chair is great i love this chair all right time to put this motherboard in and there we go i think let's make sure that's in okay ah and another rookie mistake didn't put in the motherboard standoffs that's gonna be something that we're definitely gonna want all right where did i put them now is the question i have them somewhere okay zip ties are here and they should be in here motherboards stand off great see usually they come with the motherboard standoff i was wondering why my motherboard was flexing so hard in the case that would have been interesting okay so these are some rubber thing let's see and a big bag of screws yay okay did you consider trying a linux distro as your main os i have dual boot on my computer with an ubuntu uh distribution as well as windows i just record on windows because most of you guys use windows i can look in my stats and see what you guys use and it's usually easier to explain to someone how to do something on windows um linux is good i would use it like i prefer using linux in a lot of situations but i find that if you're on linux you already kind of know what you're doing you don't really need me to to give you as many tutorials i don't know like that many beginners that start with linux now i'm wondering if i just put these in by hand i used i had this tool in my other case that like let me screw these in i'm not seeing it here but maybe i'll give it a second look um just in case that is a thing yeah i don't think it comes with one of those i'm just going to put it in uh you're missing i o shield the io shield is automatically on the thing beneath donated let's see donations oh someone donated two bucks thanks for the great videos good luck with the pc appreciate it man appreciate it i did not see that i apologize please let me know if people are donating as i'm looking on not my streaming computer so it doesn't like show me all the history um are you going to transfer the files using a cable well yeah it's going to be over the network so what graphics start no graphics card um what's your preference flutter or react native um i don't really have a preference i haven't used react native enough to know all right let's get these screws in ah there we go that's better now the question is where do the standoff screws go on a full atx board why don't you use dual channel memory it's better for ryzen that's fine maybe i'll buy another 8 gig stick another time again this is not meant to be a performance based pc the hardware i have is already overkill for what i'm using it for it's just really just going to store files that's that's literally the goal i already spent more money than i was hoping to spend but that's fine it's just what i needed because i needed a cpu that has integrated graphics but i don't want an intel cpu okay let's go in here do you still work at microsoft i'm gonna be going back next summer but currently i'm not working there it was only for 12 weeks in the summer when i posted that video on my youtube channel that was pretty much the end of my internship see what else you guys asking tim choose a bad time to start streaming because we're watching the ps5 event oops um use correct standoffs yeah i'm using the i'm using the right ones uh i think maybe we'll see okay ah it's helpful this is a label that has a everywhere shows me where to put these okay atx great all right standoff last one going in how to make a computer tutorial this will be the closest thing i do to how to make a computer tutorial follow along closely if you want to learn okay one of these standoffs is not screwing in all the way i think i can probably afford to not put one in but it's gonna like kind of be sagging in that corner oh wait aha this is the tool i was looking for there is one of these tools in here to screw the standups in great it's good to see all right if you want some recommendations on raid or other questions you have about ssd cash from i can answer some of them a few very important when building a fires for sure definitely great well i don't have any questions off the top of my head but what raid configuration would you uh recommend then if you uh if you know 900 canadian dollars or 684 usd well that would be the same thing now um why don't you just buy more storage to your current pc because i it's going to be i just want to have a separate thing essentially like a fail safe you know and then that way say i move my pc somewhere it just it's better to have a separate computer for this and i can have like say 20 terabytes of storage whereas on my computer i could put that but i don't really want spinning hard drives everywhere the noise the extra latency all that stuff i don't i don't want that on my main computer i'd rather have a processor handling all of the almost think of this as like a database right why not run a database on your um you know ui side if you're having a website well it's just better to have it separately right um is it necessary to learn about hardware before you're doing i've built a lot of computers before so i have a pretty good idea i've never built a server before though so this is kind of a new thing and there'll be some interesting points when i started getting to the software stuff because i have no idea what it's supposed to do uh what are you doing uh you should put it in the description what are you saying i want to donate again uh i said hi i think use raid two for three disk use raid five does someone want to describe the difference between raid two and raid five so i know which one to pick all right okay standoffs are in that was a bit of a rookie mistake let's put this in now ah that's much better okay now it's actually sitting in there properly for everyone asking about i o shield io shield is already installed it's on the actual motherboard i don't need to put one in our deep learning strong math knowledge um if you want to understand everything yes but not just if uh you want to be able to do it you don't need to be a master at math to do deep learning if you want to understand what you're doing then you should be decent at math now they never label these screw bags so i never know which one is which i'm going to assume that these are for the motherboard i know you guys can't really see those let's see take care from static electricity can kill your motherboard i'm not wearing socks i am on carpet right now actually if you guys can tell um and i'm not wearing socks for that purpose because i don't want to generate any electric my feet are actually not touching the ground a lot of times in this chair okay and motherboard is going in message deleted thank you moderators uh raid2 is both this basically store the same used for redundancy if you want to learn but okay let's see have you ever done any game development not really other than the python stuff i've shown you see what else you guys are saying can't really use raid 2 with three disks yeah if i need to get another disk that's totally uh i can totally do that if that makes more sense for whatever the raid configuration is i thought three would be enough just because i don't really need more than six terabytes of storage at least right now but in the future i'll probably need maybe 10 and then in the way future if i'm filming stuff in 4k probably like 20. um the great thing with this too is that i can give other access people to server if i set up with like you know vnc and stuff so they can steal files i have editors actually that i work with and i just prefer they can probably strip stuff off the server rather than just google drive too if i set up on the network correctly obviously someone can tell me if that's not right but that's kind of what i'm thinking of such a bad idea deal with screws on the carpet yeah i'm aware but i don't really have another option i've never had a problem with static though i think that's you know it definitely is an issue but i don't think it's as big of a problem now with the type of components we have maybe in the past okay almost motherboard is almost in one more screw use raid 5 or raid 10 rate 10 is faster than 5 and best choice 4 and best choice for file server um esd is a myth tim where are my 4k videos i have a 4k camera it just doesn't do it in 60 fps so if you guys are okay watching me in 30 then maybe i'll start posting 4k but i think it's a little unnecessary to do 4k for what i'm doing right now but you know maybe as the channel continues to grow we'll move our way up there okay motherboard is in so i don't need that box anymore now i'm going to go power supply and yeah i guess we'll just keep moving this is going a lot faster than i thought it was gonna nice looking case thank you guys appreciate it um let's do some i forgot i gotta do all the front connectors too that'll be a later problem when we do a little cable management here the nice thing about this case too is it has this like sound insulation in it so it's really perfect for what i'm doing because i'm not going to hear all the spinning hard drives uh and this like horrible cooler that's on here that i imagine will well if it's under load be fairly loud okay well i might hear it but it won't be as loud as it otherwise would be okay so fan this is the power supply really this is a 400 watt power supply it's the evga bronze it's not anything special maybe i should have gotten something better but whatever that's fine does it have a pci ah it does it does have a pci connector so i actually can connect a graphics card okay all right there we go and let's screw this guy in now okay some reason it's not fitting quite mesh on here quite flush is the word i'm wanting to look for let's see okay i think we should be good all right let's see how are you going to send the files it's just going to be over the network i have a pr like the internal network will be quick i also will have uh i can run a cable to it if i need to because these won't be like too far apart and i have cables run all through my house like for ethernet jacks and all that kind of stuff um that'll be a later problem though once we get this this pc setup uh how are you going to send files yeah someone's asking that uh i'm gonna go to sleep see you later 2 30 a.m here wow if you guys are here at 2 30 i guess i got to say thank you uh where's my power supply screws have those somewhere this is the problem when you have so much stuff i think i put them here perfect can you do a neural network tutorial i already have one do you like competitive programming um yes and no i like solving programming problems it's a little bit stressful when you put it in the competitive environment and you're going against guys where that's that's all they do um so not really a huge into the competitive aspect but i like that type of programming i think that's kind of fun um let's see what you guys are saying i recommend samba as ftp on ubuntu sure where do you get that shirt tim link in description this is a part of the tech with tim merchandise i don't really talk about it very much but if you guys want like python related tshirts and stuff i have some stuff that i think looks decent i wear it in most of the videos you guys probably noticed uh it also is pinned in i pin yeah i actually pinned this exact shirt in the live stream chat uh what are you guys saying what's your favorite part of the microsoft internship favorite part was probably just getting to see how large scale software actually is built because i've only ever really done stuff in like small teams or with like you know you know a few other people or just by myself whereas this i was dealing with a code base that was like you know close to a million lines of code so it's interesting to see kind of all the legacy aspects of it how you maintain that and just a different side of you know software development that i never would have been exposed to otherwise okay power supply is in i guess all that's left to do now is drives i have enough sata cables and then just all the connectors which obviously will be the longest part um let's see what everyone's saying here you inspired me to code made youtube videos let's see what everyone's saying here all right nothing meaningful to answer you guys are just chatting among yourselves okay so let me start can you guys see this at all when i when i tilt this case i don't know if you can see this or not but uh it's too bad if you can't now what let's take off the back side and that would be a good time to do that and i guess this guy will give you guys an idea of the size of this case what software that's that's a later story i just figured i literally bought the parts for this computer about an hour ago and then i was like you know what let's just build this on a live stream i can chat with you guys i thought it would be fun and then i was gonna figure out all that software stuff afterwards okay so lots of fan headers this is actually a great case this is a i'm impressed by this i didn't realize it was going to be this good okay let's start uninstalling the stuff i don't need don't need this disk drive okay come on get out of here that's stuck up in the top yeah oh you guys can actually see this pretty well okay awesome glad to see uh oh someone's asking about the checker tutorial series so i'm doing a checkers tutorial series right now as you guys know the ai aspect of that will be out near the end of this month um it is finished but it's just kind of in the queue i have some other stuff that i need to do first okay now i have a new appreciation for guys that build pcs on on the camera because this is a lot more difficult than it looks to get everything in shot and all this okay there we go unscrew that what processor this is a ryzen 5 3 400 g yeah i think g is the one because it has a graphics not card i guess but unit in it or whatever whatever you want to call that processing unit okay just trying to take out this drive thing here uh i also want to work on vs code like you worked on your internship how can i get started well it is an open source project so technically you could go look at some issues in the repository and just put up some pull requests you'll probably get a lot of feedback but at least that would be a good way to get started if you want to do that thank you so much for the effort in this channel i would don't know where i'd be without the coding journey i'm butchering that well you're welcome can you get a referral microsoft i have a good experience sorry i can't just refer a live stream viewer i don't even know how i would refer someone to be quite honest with you that wasn't something that was like mentioned to me how many people we got watching right now 375 oh all right so 375 it shows me on my youtube on the actual thing that says 393. awesome well thank you everyone for checking this out how why will this not come come on how would they expect me to do this all right so i have this like drive bay thing i'm trying to pull out but it's really not being very cooperative okay i think i'm gonna have to actually do this have you ever considered any hardware stuff like on the channel this is as much hardware stuff as i'm gonna do look drive yay um there we go that's how we get that out i did have to take that out okay this was just for like a disc drive which i don't need throw that there okay and come on how do you slide in like that perfect all right this is actually a great case i'm really loving this case i didn't even really look at it that much before i bought it but i'm happy i did most of my coworkers use windows or linux uh i feel like it's risky to answer this question but a lot of them actually use mac a lot of people do use windows obviously some people use linux but like most of them actually were using mac which is fun um okay come on screw go in all right there we go hi tim love your tutorials keep up the grind appreciate it how many satya slots my motherboard has six sata slots i believe i can get like an expansion card or something in the future but that's why i went with just a little bit of a higher end motherboard just to avoid that extra cost for some adapter i don't know what that would be but i figured if it has six slots that's better than four which a lot of the other ones did why not use a route mac so i don't have a server rack or i do but i won't if i move this somewhere else which i probably will so i didn't want to go with a rack mounted server thing i also just kind of had this idea today and i was like let's just livestream i have time um and i just went out and literally bought these parts right before i did this so it was a pretty like spur of the moment decision but i have a general idea what i'm doing so i think i think we should be good okay so this is not what i want let's pull this through i want to show you guys the cable management i will after but i do need to have it turned this way for right now okay this is cpu there and sata great these are gonna have to go over here okay oh i don't know why they make these cables these colors it doesn't make any sense to me just keep them like a black color just they just look so bad all these multi colors okay what os will you install which specific flavor am i pulling the wrong thing yeah um i don't know i'm gonna do some kind of linux os probably um i don't know which linux operating system if you guys have recommendations for which one's good for a server do let me know but it will likely be linux although i could get windows server os and i can actually get a licensed copy of that fairly cheap because i worked at microsoft um okay so let's start getting some of this stuff done i need to have some water though first yeah they look trash hikery let's see if i missed anything in the chat here no that seems too important sam do you think calculus is hard ah yeah i think like i'd say objectively it's probably difficult i didn't have a ton of trouble with it but someone's saying mint a bunch of servers great send well none of you guys are being consistent i need to know which one to do they put that color because easy to know which is which ah that's true i guess if you have black what is that ground red what's that like the negative i don't know um what chair do you have a dr dxr racer i don't know the model just a reminder not to repeat your questions too often tim won't be able to see all of them true show us your hard drive um i think i already did but here's seagate barracuda hard drive how hard is computer science one to ten let's put it a 7.5 what will be upcoming videos on sure that's a good question i believe i have a video on like balancing school and like uh you know time management a lot of you guys been asking me about that i have a video on what else do i have i have an ai for the checkers thing that'll actually be pretty interesting it's gonna be a mini max algorithm really applicable to game ai i have a video where i'm going to be doing a database project with mongodb i'm planning on doing a um what do you call it social media site i want to do another live stream i got a lot of stuff in the works but that's kind of like the basic i have a python speed course coming out all kinds of stuff add more things to ai do you play games yeah i do play video games right now i'm actually a fulltime student so i'm not no longer working um i like playing i recently started playing warzone that's a pretty fun game you guys can see the pc behind me it has some pretty crazy hardware in it so i like to play games once in a while just to be like yes i can do this i can run you know 4k at 60fps so i can do 2k at 144. are you running dual pc system or one pc two monitors ah so this keyboard here good question really good question observant guy this keyboard is actually from my mac it seems like really overkill i have it here for the sole purpose of not having to reach here because i have this monitor here that actually runs uh what do you call it as a second monitor for this mac so i have like my recording software for my audio because it's all xlr input which is from this like i don't know if you guys can see that interface there so i have a monitor here that runs all my audio and then this keyboard and this mouse here are for this monitor so that i don't actually have to look at this mac screen i can close it if i want and it's just easier i don't have to reach over if i'm like working on this machine so i just tap over press the r button or whatever it may be um you should try rainbow six siege i've played cs go i've played a few other things gaming with tim yeah you're probably not gonna see that on this youtube channel maybe uh maybe a twitch i'll start streaming my pc can handle it i guess okay um it's time to do some more cable management can you guys see this at all let's see if i can like angle no that's gonna be really hard for me to work on if i angle it like this okay so fans i don't know why i don't need a fan splitter oh this is a fan cable ah you know what i can do i can install the front intake fans right now there's only one i'm going to install two more but they're not going to match this color scheme but that's fine okay so let's do that you guys can have a good nice look at these these cables while i try to take this front panel off all right so realistically how would this come off oh there you go just pops off okay let's take that out how often do you go fishing like a few times this summer um pretty into fishing though okay oh look at this i didn't even know this case did this can you guys see this swinging door here let's let's show it there's like a uh oops like a front like thing that's kind of cool i didn't know that i guess it's for the disc drives up top interesting okay pull this off they do not make these things easy oh jesus okay i always feel like i'm gonna break it when that happens all right now how will i install this fan and please tell me if it's a 120 millimeter fan uh oh it does great okay so the fan in here is 140 millimeter um i actually might have an 140 millimeter fan no i don't think i do i think i only have this one so these are both 140ml fans in here i didn't realize that so i guess we'll throw a 120 at the bottom okay and to install that i'm gonna have to take the hard drive phase out well i'm gonna be here longer than i expected um it's just going slow hope you guys aren't in any rush to see this finish but it will be on youtube afterwards again just we're doing this to kind of chat hang out what's your c gpa i feel like i'm just bragging when i say it but my current c gpa is 9.3 um decent power supply do you have decent power supply to hardware components yeah i have a 400 watt power supply i don't think i need anything more than that for what i'm doing gaming on time i would say maybe honestly time out with tim the name would permit me being able to game on it although tech with him i guess technically i could game on it but it's not really something that i'm gonna do just kind of far away from what the main channel is are you kidding me i'm gonna have to unscrew this from the bottom too they really don't make this easy to put these things in okay well and now time to take even more things out of this case okay let's flip this over without squashing the cables i think i can just do it like this that should be fine okay okay bye tim i'll be sure to watch the rest soon great see you later thanks for coming can you make a tutorial about algorithms that's really general it's a lot of algorithms yes go join the official tech with tim discord server if you guys want to be entered into competitions you want to win some money you want to chat with people sorry just came what are you doing well you can read the title i'm building a server and this is working pretty well i'm impressed i'm very impressed the camera i'm waiting for it to shut off when it shuts off everyone starts screaming at me in the live stream because i feel like that will potentially happen um but yeah okay other hard drive thing is out now time to put the fan in great so let's keep the logos the right way perfect okay now we need some screws for the fan ah that's the only thing i don't have okay one sec i gotta get some screws i just gotta walk around here all right i'm back um will you save this on the channel yep okay look at this thing like this is what i really appreciate when they give like these kind of things in the pc cases this is for my other pc case how much easier is it to get screws out of this little 20 cent plastic thing but yet they just don't do that i don't get why okay three and four don't need that anymore i am back this chair looks comfy it is very comfortable it also reclines all the way back and it has like the rocking mode in it so i can like do that um great chair i love this chair okay screw one and screw two oh no is this right no wrong hole ah there we go that's better the mic is behind him i actually have a mic right here that you guys it's like close enough that here if i do this should be able to see it yeah it's uh like a little boom mic okay that's what she said yeah great i figured you guys were gonna laugh about that okay there's oh my god i can't even read this chat i'm gonna get demonetized this is the issue i have i always just automatically start reading the chat just assuming that whatever i read is going to be fine and then i get like halfway through the sentence and it's something like what's popping up right now how big are the files you plan to store they're like a few gigabytes each like if i store like a like a video file that's like 10 minutes it's like two or three gigabytes for me audio files obviously don't use that much but it's just like good to have them all in one place and you know i can justify building this just business expense i put on my youtube channel you know so all right fan is almost installed then we can get the hard drives in and then we can start doing some cable management and we'll boot it up great okay close the front off here oh fan wire i gotta pull you through ah that's not gonna consider let's hope this fan wire is gonna be long enough to run the way that i put this fan in oh yeah we'll be good all right back up and go now to remember did i put the big rack in first i think so yes and it goes no this one goes in first opinions on rtx 3000 i think it's gonna be a lot more expensive than people think it is that's my opinion on it i think it's great value i think it's awesome i want one um even though i have a titan but uh uh like i wouldn't mind getting the 30 90 but that's like i think that's going to go in canada for like probably the same price as my titan and i just i don't need to spend that much money tim i will start coding youtube channel i will make a video with you hey maybe one day how can you afford college um yeah this i mean you can go watch i have a video talking about my earnings and all that stuff from youtube if you want to see how all that i can use usb port can you use 3g router i have no idea what that is how many computers phone laptops do you have in your house oh my god how many computers phones i can't even count i have two laptops i have the mac pro that i'm using i actually have a mac air upstairs i used to have a linux machine uh and then i sold it to one of my friends because i never used it but i don't really need laptops phone i have my iphone the you can tell what one it is just look at the cameras uh all that fun stuff let's see stay at tim live what are you guys all saying here you're a beast dude appreciate a shout out man i'm gonna butcher your name kush arga with a smiley face thing is that how you say it probably not why don't you use cloud storage instead i don't like cloud storage i just i also like building computers you know there is an aspect of like this is fun like i want to build this i want to have another pc you know and i can use this for something else in the future too right like it is just a onetime cost whereas the cloud server if i'm running that for a few years and i keep getting more and more stuff on it or you know something happens or it crashes or whatever obviously you know their servers are probably much much safer than mine would be but yeah hopefully you get the point with that okay it's a little wobbly making me a bit nervous but that should be fine okay i think i've installed this correctly let me start putting in the drives i guess i'm just going to start filling them at the bottom i don't see any reason to spread them out um so let's just start putting these guys in the mods are fighting mods come on you're supposed to be a role model here all right ah so that's what these things are so if you look at the back of this it's kind of weird the way that they have the holes set up like i thought it was going to be a larger bay uh like the full size ones but i actually have to put it on the bottom so i have all these rubber stops here so i guess that's what that's for let me move this over a bit you guys can actually see something kind of maybe all right there we go that's better okay so let's just start installing in these driveways something's on the foot of this there we go great okay move that over okay that goes there trying to figure out how to line these up having trouble i think it's more like about how far out it would have to be at least that i guess okay there we go can you make a series on cue learning i might do that actually i was thinking about making something on cue learning no promises but i might looks like mickey mouse stream would be great would you guys watch me game really you would find that interesting i'm not that good at video games okay so let's put these dang rubber things in it's gonna be annoying okay there's one there's two if you want to see what i'm doing i'm adding like the rubber stops in here i think the camera's focused on that yeah i think you can see that um in this uh thing here i don't really know where they go to be honest but let's see that looks about right maybe maybe that's better how far back are they gonna stick is the question let's see okay perfect great so i can put them not where i have them okay let's move over there minecraft is easy everyone is good no i know my i know like i'm not talking about minecraft i'm just talking about gaming in general what uh time is in your country right now it's 5 30. oh we've been going for almost an hour yeah this is gonna be longer than i than i thought i'm just talking too much uh let's put it in the wrong one again see almost made the mistake and said that joke that you guys kept talking about but uh the cam loves to focus on the case is it still focus on me come on working move it over yeah i have auto focus on obviously um i mean i can't really control the focus manually where i am right now so hopefully it works but it doesn't not much i can do all right so i think these screws ah that's why those go in at the bottom okay i think these are the ones for today there we go your hands are shaking like crazy that's just because i'm using a screwdriver but there you go screws show you guys everything you need to install these ones is this your third pc this is my second pc um that i have here i've built a bunch of other ones but then i've sold them as i move on to another one two new ones but this will be yeah two active pcs typescript react tutorial maybe maybe someone is uh spamming a message deleted let's just remove this guy from the chat you guys are too nice mods can i do oh i can't do that from here maybe i can do it here let's see oh it doesn't even show it on my thing yeah chat isn't working on this computer okay that's fine all right hard drive one installed in the cage let's do the rest now i know where these go why do you have holes for headset cables in your server oh i it just came with them assembly language tutorial no i'm not gonna do that um there are a lot of reasons to have your own system but costs for owned equipment are more than just one off purchase charge and the risk of data loss should always be considered it's always fun building a pc yeah exactly i think that's where that one was yep great all right number two where are the screws right there do servers lower your internet speed not if they're not connected to the internet or if they're not i guess using any internet bandwidth which this one probably won't be do a collab with kale halden and tekley sure go comment on their channel ask them if they want to do one are you going to be doing another internship yes i will likely well i've signed already that i'm going to be doing another one at microsoft so hopefully in person this time we'll see obviously that's going to be dependent on all the stuff happening right now but it looks like fingers crossed i will be there in person now i will note that if i go there in person i will not be bringing all this pc stuff with me that's gonna be way too much to set up so there probably will be like less videos when i go but there's only 12 weeks so how much did this setup cost if you're talking about the entire setup ask but this specific computer is just about 900 canadian so really it's not that bad if you think about it and this is more expensive than i need to spend uh on this i just figured let's get it so it's sustainable for the future and i don't have to buy any more parts again um do you play the lottery no why choose you ottawa over you waterloo i'd like to have a life when i'm in school and i really don't need a u waterloo degree if that makes any sense um are you a senior i'm 20 years old i thought that was kind of common knowledge maybe not all right how long have we been going for on this stream does it say no i think i just have to look at the time to figure it out yeah so about an hour okay and drive three is done all right let's put these guys in this guy will here up there okay i think that's in i'll show you guys this in a second let me just get it all set up and there we go all right so now three hard drives i think you can see them there kind of yeah you get the point i do need to actually flip this upside down though uh it makes me a little nervous while i screw these things in okay let's put that down carefully good so there's some screws here for the hard drive base that i just need to put in um tim have you made your own neural network uh yes i've done that in a bunch of videos but not like coded from scratch if that's what you're asking no i haven't done that ah i just also saw there's room for an intake fan at the bottom which i'm actually going to install as well because i have another fan so that will actually be good to do get a little more airflow in here because there's only going to be two intake fans and there's going to be that crappy cpu cooler that you guys saw this case is not ideal for pc temperature since it if you notice it is blocked from top heat rises so i'm going to heat intake from the left and blowing it out with the outtake from the right yeah there is an outtake fan i'm gonna have another intake fan uh and i can install fan at the top if i want which i might do because i actually have more fans i have to find them now because they're hiding from me somewhere okay so that's it let's put that other fan in while i have access to this side where'd i put it here it is another fan that's gonna go that way up i guess okay let's see if i can use the monitor to put this in nope that's not gonna be any good okay these guys go like that until this fits perfect that can run in here and yeah now this is going to be annoying i guess we'll have to do it this way trying not to squish all my cables all right that's fine i'll be that'll be all right and i need more fan screws good job i didn't put that away all right where are you from i am from israel i am from toronto area generally speaking tim how come you don't use c sharp i just don't even need to use c sharp i used it when i was like really young when i was learning how to program but now i just don't need to use it if i needed to use it i would but just don't really have any desire to or need to uh why does it matter to you if he's paying for school himself asking someone how they spend their money is rude uh it's fine i could see how it might come across that way but i don't mind um do you plan to get a nine to five job when you graduate um i'm gonna refrain from answering that question i don't really know is the answer to that to be honest um i have you know a choice to do what i want to do there but we'll see um get marquis brown on your show you think he would come on my show with only 400k subs maybe i could convince him because i'm young enough we'll see but i'd love to have him on he seems like a great guy i watch a fair amount of his videos um i just want to thank you for making clean videos that are actually helpful other people don't explain well enough or use bad language thank you so much no problem thank you for giving me the thank you okay now i can put the dust filter back in don't hit the hdmi that could end end the stream please don't do that okay and there we go awesome so now i don't think there's anything else to do other than start managing some cables and yeah and then running all the uh yeah running all the other stuff okay grab a quick sip of water here let's see what everyone's saying slow mode yeah that's a good idea how do i put slow mode on don't know how to do that no we got the mods you guys can deal with it um how much do you study slash work in a week um a lot i don't know maybe like 70 hours 80 hours like obviously both combined how many is that a day actually that's a lot that's probably a lie i probably do yeah but maybe 10 to 12 a day but some like those are like you know i'm taking breaks in between i'm not just like going as hard as possible all day um that would be unsustainable but i don't feel burnt out or anything i feel pretty healthy i always want to make sure i'm you know not well rested i'm not tired um i really can't get a good angle to do this for you guys hopefully you're fine just the way it is i don't think many of you really care to watch all the pc stuff i think it's more about just chatting okay you know what maybe it'll be easier to see like that okay and we got some fan hubs here actually i should probably start running these fans yeah that'd be a good idea okay you can go below into that dude make a server using a 3g router i don't don't know what you're talking about i have tutorials on raspberry pi um one os linux i don't know exactly what distribution so i can't give you more answers there but it will be linux okay so that can go through there yeah this is a great case this is highly recommend i should tell you guys the model let me actually grab that i'm sorry all right this is a fractal design define or divine sorry r5 two bucks congrats on finishing the pc thanks bin binique banik i don't know how you say that um but uh it's not done yet but i appreciate it anyways still gotta run all these wires gotta turn it on but it will be done pretty soon okay so that would be the cpu come on get in there really how difficult they gonna make this to do it's my motherboard blocking something no should be able just let's try to do one four pin at a time there we go said express your feelings on all the programming languages you know what's your iq i don't know i'm maybe we'll do that later i want to finish a little bit of stuff here before i focus too heavily on the chat but look we have enough where i can actually use a graphics card i don't think you guys can see this but i have an 8 pin and a 6 pin so that's actually good to know i'm going to tuck that back here cable tie let's let's run that so this could actually be like a low end gaming machine at some point and honestly pretty affordable just throw a gpu in this obviously don't buy all the drives which cost a good amount of money it's like 75 bucks to drive canadian and yeah you'd be good to go fortunately i don't have side cutters i got to use scissors kind of sucks but it's fine you can make do with it i'm interesting you guys know would you um would you recommend having like an ssd boot drive because i could probably do that because i have a bunch of ssds in my other system and i could rip one out because i'm i won't need it as much anymore because i'm going to have this this file storage um let me know if you would think that would be a good idea to have an ssd boot driver if it wouldn't really make like a huge difference especially if i'm not going to be actively using the machine it's just going to be kind of idly sitting there be interesting to know um do you think it's good or would you prefer being in silicon valley or seattle rather than being in toronto honestly right now i would prefer to live in canada just based on you know all the stuff that you guys are dealing with over there in the states but that doesn't mean that i wouldn't want to live there at some point because i do like seattle from when i've been there i think silicon valley is cool like it'd be neat to live there but canada is kind of nice uh no complaints with toronto and i don't really live like right in the city i'm not a big city guy anyways like but i can do it but i just it's not you know i don't really care to live in the city so i'm not uh you know fussed about that okay cables sata run over there no i will show you guys what i'm doing in a minute just want to get a little bit done because i need to focus here but if it's just let's see it'll help with boot times while the pc is running it probably make that much of a difference for your goal if it's just lying in the dust yeah that's what i figured um can you make a tutorial on raspberry pi i've made one is he building a tech with tim minecraft server okay if i get let's i don't know how how can i even do this if a hundred people in the chat say they want a tech with tim minecraft server i will boot one up maybe not like today but i will i will boot one up at some point i've actually really wanted to have attack with some minecraft server i think that would be kind of cool um but let me know because if you want one i would be i'd be down to make one i probably won't host it on like on my network but i will uh you know i'll pay for hosting for you guys if you want that and i would hop on there like every now and then and play around but i need a lot of people to tell me they want one because i'm not going to make it for just like you know a really small amount of people yes yes no please yes yes yes uh watch tomorrow that's gonna be what i'm doing making a minecraft server keep just just uh like you know get the if you guys want one let me know what type of server would you want it to be is the big question like i'm a fan of factions i really like factions but i don't know what you guys would want on the tech with like you want a creative server you want a redstone server what makes sense what do you think let me know is there no sata on this ah dang it's only molex okay i don't even want that then so i only so also if anyone knows how do you go um molex to sata is that is that possible let me know because that's gonna be important to know this is going to have to run somewhere else so yeah question what to minecraft server and molex to seda is that a thing i'm going to assume that's probably a thing but let me know if more likes to say it is a thing and what type of minecraft server you would want redstone world you could program vanilla i can i couldn't do vanilla um skyblock skyblock factions skyblock hunger games ah ripper four dollars from ripper appreciate it buddy thank you ripper go uh go plug your plug your twitch david i uh that's that's my friend giving a uh a donation there go go follow him on twitch he's a rocket league streamer okay let's get this connected now i really hate these cables these yellow and red and oh so bad okay another sata another sata if you're living in toronto i mean when you're on campus class resume you're gonna stop making videos no i've made videos when i was when i was on campus classes uh and i also i'm gonna try to just do it online it's a lot easier for me to do stuff online okay making good progress you've almost wired up just need to wire up the sata cables and some of these fan cables um and then we're gonna be pretty much pretty much good to go i might need to look for another fan splitter there should be enough headers but it's just a question of can i fit the header like can i uh can i get to it oh no there's another one here yes let's go so this splitter i thought it was just two it's actually three i'll give you guys an update in one sec once this last thing is managed and you guys can give me your thoughts okay so let's run that there okay so obviously still got stuff to do i have to take this one and run it over there more these yellows really suck and i have to uh just take this cable and like tie it up but generally i think that's pretty good um let's see thanks for the good content channel no problem i just started my homework wait so why the redding ketchup i didn't know this came with these cables and to be honest you know i'm going to see it on the front it's just going to be on the back so it's not really a big deal at all but obviously i didn't want the ketchup mustard cables that was not in the plan okay time to start connecting some things to this motherboard front panel connectors are gonna have to go in maybe i'll lay it vertically for you guys after i get this big one in come on these things are not easy to get in okay you know what let's just finish this i gotta do these anyways what's the gpu no gpu it's just a server i don't need gpu it has a um builtin graphics unit on the processor which is why i got this one why is this video of eight dislikes yeah if you guys are here right now and you're still watching go like the video come on help me out there should be at least 300 likes on this how many like 404 come on we have some more likes than that okay let's start tying some of this stuff up give you like yes thank you 443 442 on my end maybe it's desync okay good come on guys keep liking it if you're here i want to know is the salary higher in the u.s or canada salary is much higher in the u.s like significantly higher almost close to double as much um which is kind of crazy if you think about it but that's that's what it is canadian dollar just sucks it also i guess honestly though it's pretty expensive to live in toronto compared like in the states yeah it's really expensive too but if you guys heard how much it was to live in some places in toronto um i think you'd probably be surprised if you don't already know of course the how expensive it really is and so i think it's one of the more expensive cities or it probably is the most expensive city in canada maybe vancouver is close let's see what's everyone else saying here maybe we can get 1k likes well not with the amount of people we have in here right now but at some point sure hello do you have any idea how much hosting a discord bought with a hundred servers what 10k users would cost i did i have no idea i have no idea sorry if it's not something that i've done yes i just probably can't tell you okay well cables are looking pretty good to be honest i want to wrap this last one in here now we just need sata cables and then the wiring will almost be done okay so where is my sata ports here at the back okay let's run you there we'll run up actually yeah can you pronounce my name reshab maybe he seems pretty stressed i'm not stressed it just it is difficult to uh talk the entire time and not bore you guys while building a computer are you gonna do a typescript tutorial maybe who tim's building a server yep have you tried using super sata live i don't know what that is what are you building this for just a file server just to just to store files i have a lot of youtube videos i need to store okay see the cables are good let's run those up here there's one two and three trying to find some interesting questions to answer here important question well you put as important so i must read it is flutter dart a replacement for javascript no just not flutter and dart are pretty specific to what they do which is the dart is really only used in flutter from what i know okay now we gotta start wiring this okay these things are not connecting okay i need a light this is too hard to do why build a pc and not use a nas unit because i couldn't live stream myself building a naz unit because that wouldn't be very much fun so i figured i'd build a pc part of this is also just like i wanted to do a live stream so i was like what can i do that i need to do which is build this file server that i can live stream that would be somewhat interesting and related to technology and here we go i actually don't think these cables are going to look that bad maybe i'm wrong when they're just on the front side if i can get this what is this 24 pin if i can get this in it's not being easy okay ah well it would help if i put it the correct way uh yeah oh there you go that's better okay so we still got all front i o and sata and then we're done okay one sata great okay let's see lots of discord messages what are you guys saying here someone is messaging me while watching the stream on uh on discord 280 you guys have dropped off only the real fans are here no no i'm just kidding um let's see what people are saying so the chat is frozen on my other thing for some reason nice i'll watch it later can you code in mips no nothing interesting to respond to in the chat if you guys have any specific questions feel free to ask them but they have to be like something that i'll actually want to answer you know you guys ask some interesting questions okay good can you guys see that it looks pretty i mean it's hard just because all these yellow but it actually is very managed right now although it doesn't even matter because i'm not going to see any of this but what did i need to do i need to pull these sata cables that's what i need to do okay awesome sweet all right front eye let's see can you guys see that how's that look not too bad eh can't even really see many cables at all let's go down and let's fix these data cables oh that would be the microphone let's fix that can you guys see that in the shot no no we're good okay what would you do besides programming that's a good question i would uh i'm interested in like space you know like aerospace technology like rockets like that would be interesting to me i would uh not be like an astronaut but maybe like design rockets or something like i feel like that would be cool like you know i don't want to be like the cliche like rocket scientist but that would be interesting i would definitely like consider something like that um that's only that's honestly the only other thing i could really think i would want to do other than programming uh would be like something with like space okay there we go now those c cables are around nicely all right front io can i contact you personally you can try but i get contacted personally many times a day is there any interesting way to incorporate database into machine learning and ai well an interesting thing is what google and all these huge cloud server companies do they use ai to actually cool their databases so it's interesting but like they'll change how fast the like what the ac level is at based on like determining what the peak load is going to be at a certain time and they actually can save like 20 or 30 percent of their cost by using an ai to like regulate the temperatures of their data center which is kind of interesting let's see i love space technologies as well yeah it'd be cool um you could work at spacex yeah exactly some even like as a programmer like that would be so cool like working at spacex would be in like i mean i i've i heard they work pretty hard like i don't know if i'd be able to do this youtube channel if i work there but that would be interesting let's see what everyone's saying we ever do python packages your phone's light is on aha thank you guys battery was going to be gone under that pretty quickly do you have a car kind of i'm living at my parents house currently so we have three cars between four people so if i ever need to drive something i do but it's not like i don't own the car like i didn't i haven't bought the car if that's what you're asking okay usb 3.0 you are aware on this motherboard i'm gonna have to rerun that cable okay those are all the hd audio uh another fan cable i had to run forgot about this okay at least i haven't really zip tied anything yet so that's good all right we're getting to the home stretch here guys what are your thoughts on code wars i've kind of heard about it but i don't like i've never used it before so i don't really have any opinions on it i'm just trying to find a fan header on this board let's see oh this board has two m.2 slots hello i didn't even know that let's see tell me you have another fan header come on where would a fan header be oh there you go two fan hundreds at the bottom i've gotta run some fan thing there all right okay fan cable ah that's gonna be a problem let's get that under yeah that's not gonna work like that okay i guess it's we're gonna have to run down just have to hide it i could remount the fan no that's fine just we can have one loose cable that's really annoying though that i have to that has to be visible so i'm having this problem right now i have this fan but the cable for it is just so short and they mounted in a way where it doesn't give me enough length to run it where i want it to so i might remount it to be able to actually manage it properly and now it's stuck in this thing here i can't even get it out there we go okay see where's another fan header oh there's one right there okay does anyone know if there's any problem with with plugging this into an aio pump fan i have like a um if correct elso fan pins on the top side of motherboard there's there isn't actually any on this um there's some fan pins but they all say like cpu pump and all this stuff someone if you could put in the chat is it okay to plug a regular fan into like a pump fan header um wait that's weird those are five pin cool geez okay let's look for this there's another one there cpu fan i suppose i could put the exhaust fan on a cpu fan header and then there's two at the bottom okay let's try to figure this out let's see what you guys are saying no no it's not good to do that okay unless you're responding to the the discord plug okay anyways i need to remount this fan but if someone could tell me that that would be great i did it for one of my fans okay well if your computer's still functioning then i'm gonna say that's okay look at this no issues with the stream yet everything still looks good sounds good surprised to give you guys some uh for any of you interested in how this is actually working i have this camera obviously and it's hooked up to a monitor with an hdmi port so i have a mod like i'm looking at the monitor right now if you see me continually looking there and then the monitor has an hdmi passthrough and that passer actually runs like all the way around the back of my desk to my computer that has a capture card in it and then we're connected to obs and obs is streaming just bought the merch today that's what i like to hear well let me know when it comes in you tag me on instagram or something when it comes in and i'll uh put you on my story okay let's run this through here instead of discord nitro all right i think that will be long enough let's see let's get there oh that's such a reach i know you guys can't see right now but i'm just trying to find how i can wire this exhaust fan out hmm i might have to use these where is that even going to fan controller or something maybe there's a fan controller in here somewhere ah i think there is i don't even know these these fans are annoying let's see maybe there's a better way to do this i'm pretty sure i have a fan splitter okay i'm actually well i'm still here but i'm gonna be searching for a fan splitter for a minute i have like a big box of stuff under my desk all right let's move that yeah so for anyone not aware current problem i have is i have a fan wire it's just not long enough to hit the pin without being wired like hidden right without being hidden essentially so i'm just trying to see if i have like some kind of extension for that because i remember i used to have one um but i just don't know where it is and who can guess how old this hard drive is oh my god i think this is like 10 plus years old uh come on the fan splitter being here somewhere oh pci riser that's great so much stuff in this box i'm a router that's great i don't even know if you guys can see that but i have a router ah would you look at this i have a intel core i5 it actually doesn't have that in it it has an intel celeron inside of it maybe i could have used this processor i didn't even remember i have that great so many people left 261 you guys are troopers just watching me search through stuff i have what is this a little little network card i don't even need that for this this has ethernet on it already okay come on have one of these things all right so i have another 140 millimeter fan actually is that bigger no it's not it's just 140. is this cable longer no it's not let's see what other fans do i have in here okay i have more of these fans jeez tell me that the extension is in here it's not i'm just pulling out random stuff look at iphone who knows what iphone this is i don't even remember what one this is maybe i could sell that who knows um what is everyone saying in here is that even gigabit i have no idea this is just all old tech stuff i have and i thought i had a extension in here but i might just have to bite the bullet and and not use it um no sorry use the fan but wire it the annoying way we'll see though i'm going to keep looking this would be a big deal if i find this okay i'm giving up on the search the processor can go away this can go away i'm not going to leave this iphone um maybe someone wants that and what else do i have in here i think that's it okay did i pull any other stuff no it says all right looks like we're gonna wire it the annoying way i'm gonna make pasta after 10 minutes i forgot to uh buy pasta yeah uh i mean i didn't realize that this was gonna happen i just thought it would be long enough oh i found a way to do it we're good i probably should just looked a little harder before i spent that time looking for that thing but i think i found a way it'll just barely reach if i'm correct what are we looking at here so we're almost at an hour or we're a little past an hour and a half i'll try to wrap this up at like the two hour mark but i mean i'm in no rush okay whatcha gonna stream next i have no idea what do you guys want to see me stream doing uh computer science homework i don't have that many other things to stream unless i do like a live coding thing or if you guys want to watch gaming i suppose i could stream when i game but like i don't do that very often join the official twt discord server have i looked at the submission to the code jam i've not looked at them yet because i'm gonna look at them as like a first glance in a youtube video i do i'm actually probably gonna film that soon but i will have the winners announced for you guys in probably a week i got to talk to my discord staff about that but for anyone wondering we're running a code jam right now in the discord server it's kind of like a hack well i don't want to call it a hackathon but it's like a long form of that you have like a month to work on a project you can be in a team i think it's up to four people we set but one of my mods will describe it in there um but that's like the idea and if you win you're actually going to get real cash prizes now i'm not going to tell you what they are yet because i want you to enter not because you want to win money but you will actually get money if you um if you are one of the winners so if you're in the first three teams i will give you money somehow we'll figure out how i'm gonna give that to you all right so i'm able to run it now i found a found a thing to do it with sweets and chassis fan 2 you're being plugged in awesome okay all right what else did i need to do front connectors and then we're done and then obviously i got to boot it up and then when it doesn't work that's going to be fun keep hitting my head on this mic i wonder if you guys can hear that next code gym is in october yeah yeah nexco jam is coming up it's coming up soon it's uh it'll be exciting though i'm looking forward to looking at the things i've like briefly looked through them it looks like you guys have made some pretty cool stuff so i'm actually really excited uh to do that youtube video and see what you guys came up with on what you guys are able to do okay so that's there keep forgetting i got to pull this cable out so hd audio goes in where over there okay this is like the worst way to hold this computer okay and come up here sweet i mean i don't even really need the hd audio on this but we'll plug it in just so i don't have to do this again okay sweet that's plugged in now we need usb 3 and then all the uh i guess these are front panel but like all the power supply reset switch which i would probably need to refer to the motherboard manual for is i don't know where those go okay what are you guys saying i want to know how the server works i don't really know how to describe how the server works to be honest with you it's just like sits on the network my local network and i can transfer files between it and other things um usb 3.0 if anyone's ever built a computer and you probably understand me when i say how annoying it is to have to deal with usb 3.0 they make it like the thickest cable in the world it's so difficult to plug in without being seen all right so let's put that up here now all my lovely management is gone because i forgot about this guy okay maybe it'd be better if i ran it like that no this would be fine okay i just saw your tutorial on free code camp and that's what i can tell i don't know you guys are saying tim dono oh did someone donate let's see did i miss something oh just showing support really appreciate videos thank you keep it techy appreciate that keep it techy yeah sorry guys i uh not monitoring the chat as much to notice all the donations appreciate that thank you for the donation if you guys want to like ask a question or something i don't know if if you give a donation i will you know answer a question for you or something if that's what you that's what you're looking for okay hold that almost done i'm gonna show you guys the back in a second it looks keep in mind it looks a lot messier just due to the color of the cables um but it's it's pretty good i'm fairly happy with it let me see if i can cable tie this in a bit tighter okay come on cable tie there we go sweet tim what is the future of programming languages tim when did tim get a macbook i've had a macbook for a while uh i don't know what the future of programming languages is i have no idea i don't know what to tell you that python i have no idea i think there'll always be need for you know lowlevel programming language or lowlevel programmers i guess like c plus c all that um but i think it's moving more towards these modern languages that are just way faster to write code in not as not as good objectively in some areas but just a lot faster i need a new table this is a custom built table my dad actually built this for me um so i cannot really give you a recommendation and go buy some wood and a drill and a saw and go paint it and that's what we did create a live website with django a live website as opposed to a nonlive website are you talking about like in production because i'm going to do something similar to that kind of soon tim you know you could answered a person with a more useful question i well i'm it's hard for me to find some good questions hey how do you learn some framework do you read the official docs yeah that's usually what i do i just mess around with the language bed or framework and then i do read the docs all right back side starting to look good yeah last thing is really these these front connectors probably gonna have to get the manual up though to figure out which pins are which oh and i gotta rewire this that cable okay that's fine you know i don't understand why they give cds i don't know anyone who has a cd drive in their computer and it's really just a pain like who uses a cd anymore to be honest okay front connectors let's look for this this is chassis fan one air pump cpu fan cpu fan optional okay i plug anything in there yes there we go good rgb header come on front panel where's the front panel oh maybe no it's not ants ah there we go found it let's see what what guys are saying here did i miss anything cds are useless who is psycho psycho is a friend of mine another streamer he should he should plug his stream you guys should go follow him um do you recommend starting with java java's good first programming language i mean might not be the most interesting one nice tshirt where do you buy it link in description there this is it's also if you look in the chat i pinned this exact shirt that i'm wearing because i figured you guys would be asking that um okay system power let's start figuring this out hard drive led positive negative this does not tell me which side is which so i guess white would be positive and um is that right oh 199 how can i get into code all right i will take a second to answer that question um how do i get into code it's kind of vague you just got to he's got to start learning right i mean like what i would do is pick a language that you want to learn just go kind of do a little bit of research figure out what do you want to do like what do you want to do you want to make games do you want to just learn basic coding if you just want to like learn how to code you don't care about really like what you're doing with the code then python is a really easy language to learn i have like a whole course on my channel that can at least get you started on that it's six hours long but i would do a little research and figure out what you want to do do you want to make websites maybe you want to look into javascript but there's all kinds of resource online it's just about finding and practicing it if you have another thing i'll look for a followup for you but um that's uh kind of my answer for that it's a little vague now you have to tell them to start with your video yeah i mean watch my video you can watch someone else's video whatever you want um i'm trying to figure out black would be positive i feel like because that would maybe not an electrical engineer let's see i think that's right okay and what else do we have here power led power led positive negative ah so positive is white okay i was wrong negative is black let's swap that what is this one power switch that's going to be an important one to get right that is why does it not say switch power switch ground ah there we go got it and positive is gonna go power button i don't think it matters which one i do because i think it's just connecting them all right and then reset switch that is recent good p l e d p l e d all right let's see what you guys are saying are you near the finish yeah i'm really close to being done i'm like gonna boot it up in just a second um 216. you guys are still watching your your troopers here i know it's gotten a little bit more boring as we've gone through but i do actually need to focus enough to be able to let's just pull these cables straight you guys can see kind of what we're looking at here in terms of cables i don't know how it's hard for me to see i'm looking at like a little monitor for the computer but let me pull all these things all right and let's come on get through there we go okay those can just kind of tuck in the back there this needs to come through all right let's see what we're looking at okay i think that is is pretty much good now do i take the risk and take my camera off of the mount and start showing you guys that's probably not going to work so i'm going to say no but this is i think you guys can see i'll bring it a bit closer this is what it's looking like so far maybe maybe i can hold it up you guys you guys can see inside i think it looks pretty good the cables are pretty well managed this this fan cable is pretty annoying but it's not really much i can do about that hd audio you can kind of jam in there i'm going to cable tie those fan and it looks pretty good you don't really even see any cables other than there's a mustard one kind of hidden back there all right so backside that's what we're looking at for for cable management here so i don't think that's too bad at all kind of tucked in the back there there's a few loose cables in case i need them because this isn't modular uh and yeah i'm gonna put the back panel on now and yeah we'll boot it up actually should probably boot it up first just in case i need to fix something let's try it okay can we get it can we get a bet in the chat is this going to work what do you think yes no do we think tim did this correctly i won't be offended if you say no let's see power bar here oh i heard something any lights happening here oh there's a light on the motherboard that could be a good sign okay let's let's let's see are we ready for me to press the power button i want to see what you guys are saying but yes yes what do we think hopefully hopefully tim your tshirts are the best appreciate that totally going to blow up guys if the camera shuts off you know what happened to me uh yeah i'm just reusing fans i i know i could use the same size but i'm just reusing fans that i had so um i could actually put another black 140 in the front i'm not gonna do that though okay let's see what are we saying yes all right i'm pressing the button good seems to be working all right i'm going to plug in a monitor now actually i'm gonna use this one i have an hdmi i can steal let's see if it boots okay let's see i don't see anything yet but it's like a grayish screen so maybe oh i'm not getting anything guys this could be bad maybe it's not coming out of hdmi maybe it is there do i have to like would it come out a displayport by default i have a displayport cable one second let me check that this could be bad we'll see though all right i have located a display displayport cable um it does have an onboard graphics card yeah it has an on board i made sure before i bought it uh displayport though let's try that i don't know if it auto detect like sometimes it only comes out at one point i've had that happen before but let's see hmm all right guys oh no i'm gonna try turning it off and back on let's let's just let's just see what that does for us did this turn off okay so i don't even know what the problem would be because the thing is it's like it literally would just be the ram slot is the only thing i could change or the cpu is not installed correctly or something but i 100 put in there right um so let's see maybe it's just maybe it's the monitor who knows oh i got a green light okay this is gonna be fun this doesn't work oh i got it guys we're good my screen is vertical though so it's like impossible for me to actually see it i'm just going to get a keyboard and i'm going to just boot in and make sure that i don't crash or anything but it actually is working so good news and then i'll put the side panels on okay i'm actually going to take a minute just to clean some stuff up here because this is really a mess and this is gonna be hard to do i need to keep all this okay we're good we're good i was getting a little nervous there i'm not gonna lie i uh that could have been really bad [Laughter] i promise it's i someone's saying i'm lying i promise it's working i can't actually show you but it is on i wouldn't be this i wouldn't be smiling if that wasn't the case uh okay let's put those in there let's put away some garbage i i wish you guys could see under my desk there's so much stuff right now it's um not great okay where should i put all this stuff so all right one second i'm just gonna start doing a little cleanup here before i get everything set up what's the chat saying are you guys uh fun fact tim actually needs the vertical screen to read his youtube chat well this screen isn't um i know what you mean but this is not the one that i would use for that okay let's put away some of these screwdrivers let's go i show us never mind maybe i will try to show you this is gonna be if the hdmi disconnects and the stream goes blank you're just understand i told you guys that was gonna happen i will uh i'll try to show you though okay don't need these anymore all right i'm officially picking up the camera this is not oh i've already made a critical mistake this is not gonna go well i know you guys can hardly hear me but there's no way i'm gonna be able to do this let's see can you guys see this this is as far as i can go i'm watching myself lag i don't know if you guys can see the screen or not that's the furthest i can go but that that's the bios screen if if you guys can see it okay maybe this is not let's see i want to tilt now maybe you guys no no okay i'm going back this was this is a big risk already and now you're gonna be on like a completely different angle uh let's see if that's good i'm gonna have to keep going back and forth now because the display on this is off uh will people be able to see me let's see how's this how's this angle oh i've messed my screen up oh maybe even better no i need to change it a little bit okay i think that's good okay i'm back let's see what this was uh let's see what you guys said so it does work oh i thought you were coding something i can see it a little make a room tour no stop camera may fall yeah that was uh see you guys okay oh that was funny all right i think yeah i think we're good i'm showing too much of this area but that's fine i don't think you guys care about anyways this is my keyboard i wanted to show you guys it's uh like a roll up keyboard for precisely this reason so i'm gonna just boot in and just press f1 and see if this is all gonna work and then i'll put the side panels on okay f1 enter setup sweet now you're gonna see me doing this oh the cpu is hot 46 idle okay memory eight gigs i gotta change that okay i'm gonna do this stuff after i want to bore you guys with this i'm gonna put the panels on and let's see what this case looks like uh completed so first of all i don't even know which what display did i even plug into this which one is being what is it going off of hdmi so i didn't need the display port okay all right unplug that and unplug that turn this off all right side panel time the question is which is the front okay i think i know it's like the only time i put a side panel on and it hasn't like squished every single cable inside okay i'm actually gonna is this off yeah disconnect this okay all right i'll give you guys one last peek inside before i put the side panel on i know it's like all crooked but that's the easiest way i can show you that's what it looks like for a server well yeah i guess file server i think it looks pretty good what is a file server it is a machine that holds files and just think of it as like a uh you know i don't even like a database for videos that's kind of what i'm using it for all right and are we locked and loaded here almost boom side panel on how do i take that off i don't know perfect okay let's screw these guys in so another one up there yep how many terabytes right now this has six terabytes i don't know i have these two screws i don't know where they go though oh ah there i got to take the panel off i forgot there's some screws in here that i need to put in i forgot that's okay that makes sense that makes a lot of sense it's uh six terabytes in total each drives three drives they're each two terabytes that is our screw hole there i don't even know it was there was something that i had to screw in here oh no wait that's the thing i detached never mind i don't need to take the side panel off i can't stop thinking about the minecraft server i'm not promising a minecraft server but i would be really down to have one we'd have to run it through my discord though so just keep that in mind tim pixel that's a good name i just saw someone say that that's hilarious okay sweet let's get the scissors out of the way and let's have a look at this now okay so you guys can see the front obviously this front has this cool thing i didn't realize you can actually if i can figure out how to open it i think it's here here it is there's this cool thing so you can actually see the the front fan grill i guess that's where the yeah different colored fans are and different size fans shh we don't care we're not gonna look at that in the filter i guess that's the cover for the drive bay uh and yeah that's kind of cool i didn't know it has that there's some like sound insulation i think you guys can see that we got on the front i o that's kind of what it looks like i've got you know the headphone jack audio all that and i guess i mean this is the other side it's literally just just black there's room for a fan here i think i can pop that off and at the top actually don't know what these things at the top are for i think i can take them off it might not be a bad idea to take them off actually um just because i want some more airflow in here i have more fans too that i technically could mount i might not though okay so that's how you take this off so these just pop in whoops let's try to get this off probably not the best way to do this with a knife but hopefully this will work let's see there we go yeah so it might not be a bad idea to just leave one of these off uh there will be some dust that gets in but i can actually put more fans what do you guys think would a top exhaust fan be worth it do you think i should do that um let's see what everyone's saying here can you make a tutorial on apis for websites i don't have one maybe if you made an mc server i'd love to help with the map in the world sure yeah if i do that i'll set up like staff like it'll be proper i used to actually run a minecraft server when i was younger when i was like 14 i think i had maybe like 20 or 30 concurrent players on it like at most times and it was actually pretty successful so i have a general idea of what i'm doing but things have changed a lot since i did that positive pressure remember yeah i know i have two yeah i only have two intake fans let's see water cooling probably not if the thermals aren't a problem yeah i don't think the thermals will be a problem um yeah i'm not gonna do it i'm a beginner programmer if it wasn't for you and keith galles i don't know how that is tutorials i don't think i would have gone as far so thank you no problem how old are you i'm 20 when did you start programming when i was 12 a long time ago uh let's see what everyone else is saying how much do you cost um i don't know let's just say i'm priceless how about that all right so we just passed a two hour mark i'm pretty much done though um i mean there is obviously all the setup and stuff i have to do i don't really want to do that on stream um it's gonna be hard too and i'm not gonna be sitting on this computer like in this frame for a while come on go in jesus thing there we go that is way too hard to push in that's okay so i'm actually thinking that i'm gonna end the stream now if you guys have any last questions i'll stay on and just look at the chat um but yeah otherwise i'm gonna end this kind of soon so last questions i'll give you guys like two three minutes if you want to ask something or you want to just chat or whatever and then i am going to hop off but a big thank you to everyone who joined the stream really do appreciate you guys coming on i've had a good time hanging out with you guys and i will do some more streams at some point in time but they are like pretty like this is not the easiest thing to run and it's kind of stressful right yeah you know 300 400 people watching you uh every mistake you make just letting you know which is a good and bad thing lots of respect for you do you appreciate that seven oh my god you guys are fast oh i did not realize how many questions i was gonna get um okay i'm gonna have to slow this down do you think learning data science is good idea nowadays yeah i think it's a good idea i mean i think like worst case you get good at data science and then you're good at data science you can carry that skill over to something else as well so i think definitely and there is a huge focus on uh data nowadays right let's see um are you gonna make any ethical hacking videos i'm not very experienced with that maybe uh i'll look into it because i've got gotten asked that question a lot make a stream about programming this i'm not going to write any code for this i don't think hopefully not so maybe that's not really an option yeah if you guys are here please do like this stream i would appreciate that you got to be more active in discord server tim it's hard guys i'm always filming videos it's hard to do you know this is my most engagement when i do a stream are you planning on doing more javascript tutorials maybe probably not post full spec list um that's not a bad idea actually uh i will go through the specs quickly it's a ryzen 5 3 400 g so it has a graphics unit in it someone said i got scammed when i bought it i don't know how much it was so you guys can look it up eight gigs of ram they're 33 000 megahertz i have four two terabyte uh hard drives in there and then what else do i have uh i guess that's about it i mean i have like a where's the motherboard box a rog strix b450f gaming motherboard and this case is the fractal design divine r5 i totally didn't just look at the case box to tell you that 400 watt power supply is inside of here it actually has enough power that i could put a graphics card in it if i want uh not a huge one but and yeah as i said it's about 900 canadian dollars i'm actually 20. i'm not 19. thanks for the stream take care yeah you too where can i practice for python like python projects you just gotta do your own stuff come up with something that you want to make and practice it uh 10 years old and can bench a thousand pounds congratulations do you have a girlfriend no i do not have a girlfriend um computer engineering versus computer science if you would prefer software and you want to work i don't know i would personally recommend computer science computer engineering is much more hardware level i think it's fun you do software stuff as well but it's much more electrical engineeringish right like you're learning about lower level components i'm actually designing say like you know boards or you're designing like this physical motherboard or something i'm not experienced in computer engineering but that's my understanding of it computer science is much more just theoretical programming stuff so if you like that more you'd want to work more in like hightech companies they're hiring more computer scientists than computer engineers from what i understand that could be wrong um have you ever been ta no suggestion for getting an internship what is let me see where this is at 17. be tough to be honest with you you just have to be extraordinary right you got to point your like i don't know sell yourself right on your resume don't put the fact that you're 17 there try to get an interview and get hired and then tell them you're 17 right i wouldn't advertise the fact that you were 17 unless they ask you that and i don't think they're actually allowed to ask you that but maybe you have to be older than 18. but same tips i would give to anyone just you got to do more because you're younger right and it's harder how do you make a chat server using python i have a video talking about online multiplayer game or i have a socket video sorry socket tutorial that shows you how to do that will you make the file transfer system using python i don't need to make a system there's stuff that exists to do that are you going to record a video on how to set up server probably not i'm 20. what's your main interest in coding i like backend development what's the file server for storing youtube videos um can you create some tutorials projects with javascript maybe i'm gonna do like a social media site thing that will probably use javascript any books on machine learning you recommend no i don't really read programming books um hey i'm 14 watching your videos since i was 12. wow you've been watching for a long time appreciate it thank you for the videos no thank you for the comment can you do tutorials in the command line in the future i don't know what that means i'm going to skip that can i make a trained model as an api arrest with an android app as a front end yes you can what documentation can i look up i don't know the answer to that you're just going to have to kind of problem solve on your own but i know you 100 could do that make c plus videos no probably not uh what would you like to do after python programming not sure i like typescript react honestly i had a good time programming that for microsoft uh you already asked me that question would skip that hey i'm 13 and what should i do with machine learning i have a video about getting started with machine learning you can watch that tim why don't you do software engineering at uottawa and do coop first year um that was a good honestly i probably should have done software engineering uh but i just was in computer science so i don't really have an answer for you uh have you ever modded a game before trying to think i used to jailbreak iphones when i was really young so maybe that counts uh html css sql count as programming languages i'm going to say no um anthony fiskus giving five dollars i appreciate it appreciate it thank you no comment but really thank you for the support appreciate that i t interview tips i have a video on that uh will you make the file transfer no i already answered that can you make more tutorials mongodb i have one coming up actually uh thank you for your videos is os is the os linux yes how can you read this i'm literate i don't know what is the average size of your videos like two to three gigabytes probably but i am potentially going to move into 4k videos at some point so this is kind of like a preparation step it's not necessarily necessary right now um you learn programming just through youtube i actually learn almost everything i know about programming at least when i started through youtube videos specifically uh the new boston was the channel i watched a lot all right i'm getting tired here i'll do a few more and then i'm gonna sign off um i'm gonna kind of pick some though why'd you stop making checkers i didn't checkers is coming out again i just took a break from it because sometimes it gets a little repetitive the same video constantly on the channel especially if it's long series so i like to sprinkle other stuff in between um if i want to make a gui with a beautiful design in libraries you recommend what do you recommend in python it's hard to make anything like beautiful in python maybe there's an answer to that i would recommend use another language like use a javascript framework frontend thing um let's see what do you think python will be like in 2025 i don't know i don't think it's gonna change that much i think that it will continue to be used a lot but i think there'll probably be some newer languages that i don't wanna say replace but do a similar thing to what python does um so i don't know i don't wanna say it's going to plateau but i think at some point the growth will kind of taper off if that's what you're asking about if you're talking about like the language features i have no idea i have no clue you got to go to like picon or something and listen to the talks um we'd recommend python as a first programming language yes uh bye see you later uh this became chat with viewers yeah i know but that was kind of the point of this tim what is a good language to learn after python i think javascript is a good complement to python um is it true that programming mac is better than doing it on windows that's subjective it's up to you depends on what you're doing i would say a unixbased machine is usually better for programming in terms like installation setup stuff like that but there is advantages to using windows especially if you're using like c c plus plus c sharp objective c or not objective c maybe i don't i don't know enough about that to give you an answer on that one but i know like using the microsoft languages is probably better on windows uh what's your laptop name and model i have the macbook pro 16 inch base model with some random upgrade i forget what i did on it uh do you plan on making videos with react and flask maybe that's kind of hard to do why you make pie qd5 detail tutorials similar to decanters would you make pie qt5 detail tutorials similar to uh from code emmy's channel i just can't even read today so i'm gonna skip that question i don't even know who code codemy is that what it is i don't know what that is uh all right last question when are you gonna stop cutting your hair never i like my hair short yeah everyone always says that stop cutting hair i i prefer prefer to be short it's just i don't want to say like it's difficult to take care of when it gets long but i just think it looks cleaner when it's short okay anyways that is where i'm going to end so i appreciate everyone that stopped into this stream if you're watching it after well i hope you enjoyed i know this was a lot more of me talking than it was building a computer but that was kind of the point i figured you know let's have something that's kind of fun tech related let me just chat with you guys and if you're going to take the time out of your day to come here at least i can answer some of your questions and talk with you in the chat so yeah that is uh that is it uh thank you guys very much i'm going to attempt to end the stream now and yeah like subscribe if you have not already and i suppose i will see you again in another youtube video
