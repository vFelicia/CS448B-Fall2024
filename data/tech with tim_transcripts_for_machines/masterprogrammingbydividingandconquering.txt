the first design principle that I have for us is known as divide and conquer and what this means is take your large problem and break it down into as many small sub problems as possible solve those smaller sub problems and then that will help you solve the large problem to give you an example of this in a coding context maybe you have some very large scale system maybe the system has some subsystems involved with it maybe those subsystems all have different packages maybe those packages have different classes those classes have different methods maybe those methods use some external dependencies or some functions and now all I need to do is say figure out what all the methods of the class are figure out what all the classes of the packages are figure out what all the packages of the subsystem are and then all of the subsystems of this system as a whole and I'm good to go I've pretty much solved the problem
