now python for me at least is what I use when I want to get something done fast and typically when I'm scripting so it's really used a lot in machine learning artificial intelligence data science it's used for backend web servers and it's used for other scripting tasks so if you want to automate some file operations or you just need to do any automation python is really really good at that because of how quickly you can write code however python is not the best when it comes to Enterprise grade applications anything that requires a high performance and you're not going to see python in a lot of large scale apps it doesn't scale extremely well I would never use Python to create something that's like a massive application that would not be my choice so with all that said the core disadvantage of python is really the performance and scalability of it and the fact that you're not going to be using it in massive applications
