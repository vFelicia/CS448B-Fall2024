all right so let's go ahead and get started now as i was saying in this video i'm going to be showing you how to add attributes to the text as well as different colors styling and all of that kind of stuff now in the previous video i briefly showed you how to do this the way we did it was by adding this curses.a underscore underline this is one of the attributes as the last argument to this add string method now that is actually the way that we add attributes you just add them as the last argument now even if you don't have the coordinates you can just do this that's fine it will still add this as an attribute now this is one of the attributes that i showed you but i want to show you all of the other ones that we have as well as how to set the colors all right so let's go ahead and get started now as you saw in the previous video the way that i can add an attribute to my text which is just like a form of styling is by adding a last argument here to my add string then putting the attribute that i want so in the last video i showed you underline that gives us underline text okay you just add it as another argument curses.a underscore underline there's a few other attributes you can add i will mention that not all of these are going to work in some terminals they may work in some terminals they may not work just because it varies on operating systems and you're going to see here that a few attributes that we have access to just don't work on windows or they give us something that's not kind of expected so for example i'll show you let's go with bold so curses.a underscore bold that's another attribute we have let's go here and run this python tutorial 2. notice this text is darker than this i'm actually not sure if you guys will be able to see that but on my screen it is darker the editing software that we use might kind of get rid of that anyways we have a underscore bold we also have a underscore blink now this is supposed to make the text blink again i'm not sure if it's actually going to do that but let's run and see and okay so it's not blinking but it gives us kind of a gray highlight here so take that for what it is uh let's try we had bold we had blink we have reverse now what reverse is supposed to do is reverse the background in foreground color of the text so it's used for kind of like headings and labels and stuff so let me run this and notice we reversed the background in foreground color okay great so let's get out of that uh what else do we have we have dim this is supposed to make the text dim i mean that's pretty straightforward let's run it and see if it does anything uh it doesn't really look like it's dimmed to me but maybe it is and i just can't see it anyways that's dim and then the last one we have is stand out so let's try stand out and see what that does okay so let's run this and notice standout is going to do a very similar thing to reverse although the text is a bit darker or the highlight is a bit i guess brighter than what we had with reverse okay so let's get out of that and let me clear that all right so now that we have looked at those attributes i want to show you how we can add color it's a lot more interesting than the attributes so to add a color we first need to create a color pair now a pair is just the foreground and the background color combined together so what i'm going to do is at the top of my main function here i'm going to say curses.init underscore pair i think that's all you need to do and i'm going to put the id of my pair now the id can be any number that you want i recommend just starting with one then going 2 3 4 5 etc so on and so forth but you start with the id and then you do curses dot and then the foreground color that you want now i believe that the way you do this is by doing color underscore and then the name of the color there's a bunch of different colors i'm not going to go through all of them but let's try using blue as our foreground color and then for our background color let's go curses.color underscore and maybe something like yellow this will probably be pretty ugly but now we have the pair with id1 referencing this color pair so if i want to use this color pair what i do is i go to my attribute and i change this to curses dot color underscore pair and then i put the id of my pair so in this case i'm going to put the id 1 because that's what i used for my pair if i did 2 here then i would change that to 2 pretty straightforward now one thing you can also do if you want this to be a little bit easier to read is i could take this so curses.coloredpair1 and i could store this in a variable i could say blue and yellow is equal to this and then i could just put blue and yellow here and now it's a lot easier for me to read and understand what pair references what colors so up to you i like to do this and the reason i'm doing it in all capitals is because this variable is not going to change it is a constant so i put in all capitals anyways let me run the code and show you what we get with blue and yellow and notice we have blue text on a yellow background perfect exactly what we expect so let's look at a few other colors so let's actually just make another pair so let's go curses.init pair let's go two let's go with color green and this needs to be in all capitals and then let's go with color underscore and do we have like a gray actually i don't know if we have a gray and would it be gr ey uh i guess okay let's do that so now let's make a new variable let's say green underscore and if we could type properly here and gray is equal to curses.color pair 2 and then we could change this to green and gray let's go green not like that come on autocomplete and gray and there we go okay that was a struggle but let's now run the code and see what we get and curses has no attribute color gray okay so it looks like gray is not a valid color so let's change this to something like black which is going to be our default background anyways we still need to add it though because we're creating the color pair and now if i go here and i run my code we get our green text on a black background okay let's do one more here so we'll go curses dot a nip pair color underscore do we have something like an orange maybe maybe we do and let's go with color white and we'll make this three and then we're gonna say orange underscore and white is equal to curses.color pair three and then this will be orange and white okay orange and white like that okay let's run the code now let's see if orange is a valid one looks like orange of course is not going to be one so i guess they don't have orange let's go with color underscore uh and will be another color we could use here we could use maybe red and let's see what we get here okay there we go we get red text on a white background so if you want to see all of the different colors then you can go to the curses documentation you just look up python curses and it will show you all of them i just want to show you a few different examples of the colors so now though what i want to show you is how we combine multiple attributes together so what if i want it to be orange and white and i want it to be bold how do i do that well the way i do that is i'm going to go down here and do this is i write the first attribute that i want then i put this pipe now the pipe is just the straight vertical line and what you can do after this is put the other attribute that you want to combine with it so if i want it to be blue and yellow and i want it to be bold then i would say curses dot and then a underscore bold like that and what this is known as is a bitwise or operator you don't have to know that but what it does is just combine these two attributes together so that means that this text will now be blue and yellow and bold so let's run this and let's see if this is correct and notice now we have bold and blue and yellow text now let's try using the reverse so we can actually verify that this is working so let's go a underscore reverse let's run this okay and now notice it's reversed our text and our background color so we had uh what was it uh blue and yellow but now we're having yellow on blue because reverse reverses the background and the foreground cup okay so that is the different colors and how you combine attributes now what i want to show you is how you update something in live time so i'm actually going to remove all of this for right now and what i'm going to do is set up a while loop or kind of a counting loop that's going to count to a certain number and based on what the number is i'm going to display that number in a different color so i'm going to import time here and what i'm going to do is put a for loop and i'm going to say 4i in range 100 and then what we're going to do is refresh every for loop as well as clear the screen okay so we don't need to clear up here so what i'm going to do inside of this for loop is i'm going to display whatever i is equal to i'm going to delay for a certain amount of time and if i is divisible by a certain number i'm going to display it in blue and yellow if it's visible i buy a different number i'm going to go green and gray you'll see what i mean but let's look at this i'm going to say color is equal to and we'll start by just saying this is going to be blue and yellow and then i'm going to say if i mod 2 is equal to 0 so if i is even then i want to display with a different color so i'm going to say color is equal to green and well i guess green and gray isn't even the correct one what do we have is the background it's gonna be create green and black so let's get that okay green and black okay now i actually don't need to use the other color this is fine for right now so the point is i'm going to store my color in this variable then i'm going to display this text so i'm going to say let's go std scr dot and then add string we want to add this string let's just leave it at zero zero so we don't need to put any location and the string is going to be an f string and i'm going to say count colon and then inside of here i'm going to say i comma and then color okay let me talk about what i'm doing here so the idea is we're going to clear the screen we're going to pick the color so we're going to start with a default of blue and yellow and if we are divisible by two so if i is an even number then what we will do is change the color to green and black we then are going to display our text we're going to say count i'm going to embed the variable i here so this will be interpreted as a string in case you're unfamiliar with this this is known as an f string and you can directly put variables inside of it by using the curly braces only works in python version 3.6 and above i'm then specifying the color as the attribute and this will mean that we're going to change what this text is every iteration of the form now the thing is my for loop is going to run very very quickly and i want to actually be able to see my count so i'm just going to delay here by a certain amount of time so that i'm actually able to see the change to my text so after i clear the screen and i refresh then what i'm going to do is say time dot sleep and i'm going to sleep for 0.1 seconds just so that this will take me 10 seconds in total to run i think my math is correct on that anyways let's go ahead and run this and see if this works so let's go python tutorial 2 and notice there we go we are changing and it's going to be flashing back and forth because we're going between even and odd and let's just wait for this to get to 100 and then we'll press enter and we can get out of it okay so let's hit enter so that's how you update in live time or update with refreshing the display you need to clear the display draw whatever you want and then refresh the display that way you're not going to be drawing over top of something else so if i don't clear this right and i just refresh then let's see what happens so let's go here and run the code and notice that we're just going to keep adding to the screen right because we're not clearing what was currently on there so our cursor is going to be at the end of wherever we just printed and we're going to keep adding all this so clearly this is not what we want although this did make kind of a cool pattern okay perfect alright so with that said that pretty much covers everything that i need to go through this has been how to add colors and attributes to your text in the next video we're going to talk about windows and padding which allows us to kind of divide our screen into separate windows and then update only one window at a time so that we're not updating the entire screen and we don't want to be doing that anyways with that said i hope you enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in the next one
