hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to talk to you about what it is like to work at algo expert now for any of you that are not aware i currently work at algo expert as an algorithms instructor algo expert is a platform that you can use to prepare for your software engineering coding interviews and well the founder of that platform one of the cofounders is actually one of my close friends and his name is clement so i've been working at algo expert for about four or five months maybe and i just wanted to make this video to talk to you about what it's like to work in this kind of startup environment and for this company that i'm sure many of you know now with that said if you guys know me and you watch this channel you know that i like to have very structured videos so in this video specifically i'm going to talk about the work that i do at algo expert kind of the hours and the flexibility that i have and then finally what it's like to be in kind of a startup environment and a startup company algo expert is very small it has probably like six to eight employees something like that so very much a startup company now with that said if you don't know what algo expert is then don't worry because they are the sponsor of this video so you're about to hear all about them before we get started i need to thank the sponsor of this video which is alco expert oligoexpert is the best platform to use when preparing for your software engineering coding interviews as the highest quality coding interview practice questions with over 115 practice questions detailed solutions in nine of the most popular programming languages a featurepacked browserbased coding environment extensive test suites and conceptual overviews and code walkthroughs for each and every problem algo expert is the best resource to use to ace your coding interviews algo expert also has a data structures crash course coding interview assessments and a brand new mock interviews feature i can highly recommend algo expert as a former customer myself and now an official instructor on the platform get started using algo expert today by hitting the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform all right so now that we all understand what i'll go expert is i can tell you what i do there so first of all my boss at algo expert the one that i report to is clement he is one of the cofounders you guys have probably seen him on this channel before and while i'll leave a link to his youtube channel in the description but we've known each other for a while i a little bit over a year now and if you actually want the story of how i got a job at algo expert i will leave a link to that video i made that probably four or five months ago when i just started working so anyways he's my boss and what i do on a day to day is i come up with coding interview questions so my you know formal job title is algorithms instructor and pretty much what that means is come up with coding interview practice questions write all of the detailed information related to that so the prompt the test cases the hints the space and time complexity and all the other stuff that's involved obviously write out the solutions for those questions i write all of those in python first and then i'll transcribe them into other programming languages that are on algo expert and then once that is done i will take all of that code that i've written i will push that up to the github repository that we will have it will get a review from clement or some of the other guys that work there and then once that is all good to go and i respond to any feedback i film a video so every single question on algo expert has a conceptual overview and a code walkthrough so kind of two separate parts the first part the conceptual overview is very much just kind of drawing and whiteboard style so i have this ipad here that i use to actually kind of do all the illustrations and diagrams and all of that and then i hop into my code editor and i do the code walkthrough so i spend a few hours filming that it actually takes a really long time to film these videos because they need to be absolutely perfect so even just small stutters or small mistakes that i make i have to kind of refilm that section and you know cut stuff out and edit the video once that is done though i you know edit the entire video and then i submit that to clement or to whoever is you know going to be looking at it at algo expert then they give me a review for the video they say yes this is good to go or no we need some feedback or we have some feedback and there's some revisions that we need then once all of that is done we get the video and the question ready to go into production and i'm not really involved in that side that's kind of in the main code base they do all that so i don't really know what's involved in getting the question in to production that is kind of what i do at algo experts so not terribly exciting but it is really cool to kind of be finding these different coding interview questions because i have to come up with the question that i'm actually going to do right i have to pick the questions myself and then you know figuring out how to solve them all of the neat tricks you know doing some research on my own and this is kind of great because this means if i ever did want to go work at a big tech company or something like that i would have a ton of experience because i have literally been creating practice questions for coding interviews so that is kind of my daytoday now i'm going to jump over and kind of talk about my hours and flexibility and when i'm actually working for algo expert because as you guys know i have this youtube channel here this takes a ton of time while i'm doing that as well as working for algo expert all right so let me kind of talk about my hours and the flexibility and when i'm actually doing work for algo expert because it's definitely not like your standard job this is not a nine to five i don't have to like clock in or clock out there's nothing like that going on i can work literally whenever i want and one of the reasons i actually took this job is because it is so extremely flexible there is very few deadlines and the deadlines that do exist are extremely lenient and well i can just work whenever i want so if i'm really busy on youtube for a week i can do nothing for algox but i don't even have to look at the slack group chat that we have there so we do have a slack chat where everyone kind of communicates i don't even have to look at that i don't have to answer messages that's totally fine i just do whatever i want whenever i want so that is the reason why i'm actually working for algo expert because it's super flexible and oftentimes i'm working on algo expert questions at say 9 p.m 10 p.m one in the morning i just do them whenever i feel like doing a question so that is kind of the great thing about this job and another thing to note is that every single person that works for algo expert is working remotely so they don't have an office we just have this slack group chat which in my opinion kind of acts as the office there's all these channels and stuff that we talk in and there's people in all different types of time zones so i'm in eastern standard time i believe clements in mountain standard time there's some people in other states in the us and we're kind of all over the place so it's neat it's very interesting having everyone work remotely and algo expert is a very small team right so there's only like probably six seven maybe eight employees i don't know the entire structure but the people i've talked to at least there's like seven or eight of them and so to wrap up this section on kind of the hours and the flexibility i'll just say that this works absolutely perfect for me um you know sometimes i don't go to bed till three in the morning i don't wake up till noon or 1 p.m or whatever and it's great to just be able to do whatever i want whenever i want to do it now obviously you guys know i'm working very hard i'm doing a lot of stuff but it's nice to have that flexibility where if i want to just grind algo expert questions on you know saturday and sunday and then i want to you know go do my youtube channel for the rest of the week i can totally do that and the algo expert team is really funny because everyone is pretty much a night owl now i didn't really used to be a night owl before i started working there but literally everyone is online at least in eastern standard time from the hours of like let's say 8 p.m to like four in the morning so it's just really a unique working environment and it's not something that you would ever have working for you know like a big corporation or not kind of a startup company so this kind of leads me nicely into what it's like to work for a startup company so if you guys have been following me for a while then you would know that the first big tech company that i worked at the first job i had that was related to programming and software engineering was at microsoft now i think that company has like a hundred and twenty thousand employees or 140 000 employees or something crazy like that so obviously a massive company and in that company i have no idea what i don't even know you know the senior management team i'm talking to like the 10th level of manager down you know the hierarchy of things so it's just a very different environment because here i'm talking to you know the founders of the company which i'm not trying to make that sound super special it's just interesting because you get a really good look at what's actually going on you can see all the new features that are being released you kind of see the direction that the company is moving in and it just makes you feel so much more immersed and kind of engaged in what you're doing it's way more exciting for me personally to be working for a company like algo expert where the work that i'm doing is genuinely changing the product shaping what it looks like and changing maybe even the future of the company whereas when i'm working at a company like microsoft you know i'm just another guy in the corporate office and very disposable you know i could be gone tomorrow and no one would even know so it's just a very different environment it's just really engaging and really exciting and at least for this company here everyone that's working here is just young energetic like they're all under 30 i'm pretty sure and it's just cool to be around a lot of people that are in a very similar field to me clement is a youtuber nick is a youtuber and so i have a lot of similarities and stuff in common with them and it's just fun you know at one in the morning you know you're grinding out now go expert question and making jokes in the slack channel and just all kind of stuff like that so that is kind of my experience working for algo expert in this startup company i wish there was more that i could say but i just wanted to kind of express how different it is to work for a company that's fairly new that doesn't have very many employees and that's moving extremely quickly compared to a very bureaucratic you know large organization now there's pros and cons from both obviously but right now i can honestly say that i am definitely enjoying working at algo expert honestly a lot of the time it doesn't even really feel like work what i'm doing because i genuinely do enjoy you know teaching and writing out these algorithmic style questions and for me i'm learning a ton and i'm getting way better myself at doing these types of coding interviews because while i'm teaching them almost every single day so anyways that was the video for today i hope you guys enjoyed if you have any questions about algo expert please do leave them in the comments i will try to respond with that said if you enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another youtube video
