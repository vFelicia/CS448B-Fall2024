a lot of times when you're writing code especially writing code in python you want to look at the documentation for a specific function module object whatever it may be but you don't want to have to go online or maybe you don't have access to the internet well in python there is a helpful function that you can use called help now what help takes in is any python object so i could pass something like say the sum function and what this will do is actually give me the documentation for this function so it prints out the docs string and then tells me what the arguments are now i can also use this on my own custom function so in this case i defined a doc string in my function and if i go here and i print help on my underscore function notice i get a message here that's generated by python where it shows me the arguments or parameters for this function and then the dock string hopefully this was helpful if it was make sure to follow for more
