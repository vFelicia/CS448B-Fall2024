hello everybody and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on flutter now flutter is a framework made by Google that lets us build pretty much every kind of application that we want so we can build iOS apps we can build Android apps we can build web apps we can build desktop apps whatever you want you can probably build that with flutter and the great thing with flutter is the speed and how easy it is to take code that you've written say for iOS and translate that into an android application and in fact what we're gonna be focusing on here is actually building mobile apps so building Android apps and iOS apps and the great thing is that all of the code that I write is pretty much gonna be able to run on both an Android device and a Nyota vaio s device at the exact same time so they're gonna be no changes you really need to make you're just gonna be able to run whatever code you write here on both an Android device and an iOS device so you're pretty much making two applications with just one singular codebase so it's a huge advantage of flutter and there's no speed decrease in doing this because the language that flutter uses is called dart that can actually be compiled natively into android OS compatible code and iOS OS compatible code right so that's great that means this is a super fast application it's gonna run you know like any native app would run on Android or iOS there's no slowdowns because of a heavy framework around it there's a ton of other advantages of flutter and the language dart and you're gonna see how easy it is to actually build some pretty basic applications and that's what this tutorial series is gonna be focused on we're not going to be building any production level applications we're just gonna be learning a bit about this framework kind of getting our you know hands wet or feet wet whatever you want to call it with it and just getting comfortable with it so if we want to actually make some more complicated apps we can do that everything's set up on our system and we're ready to go so with that being said I'll talk quickly about this tutorial series this first video is really just gonna be getting everything set up so we're getting our development environment set up get all our plugins installed everything downloaded that we need to this process will unfortunately take a long time just because the set up is pretty difficult and pretty tedious but once we get through this it's pretty much smooth sailing and we're just gonna be writing code building applications so let's go ahead and get started so the first thing that we're gonna do and that I recommend you guys do is head over to the flutter website all of the links that I mentioned here will be in the description by the way so you can find them there and go ahead and click on this get started page and go through the installation guide for your specific operating system so of course I'm gonna summarize this whole installation guide but I just know things are a little bit different if you're on Mac or if you're on Linux because this is gonna be for Windows so you might just want to go here at least have this as a reference so that you can see what's happening say on the Mac OS side which might be a little bit different than it is on the windows side again once you get past kind of installing the flutter sdk things will start to kind of synchronize between the different operating systems but I just want to make sure you don't rely solely on this video because there will be some things that are gonna be different between the different operating systems like for example if you're on iOS you're probably gonna be using Xcode whereas if you're on Windows like me we are gonna be using Android studio and vs code anyways once you do that let's move forward the next thing we're gonna do is install git now you don't need get but for this video at least I'm gonna be using it just cuz it makes things a lot easier so go to this link in the description download kit for your operating system most of you probably have this and then just make sure that once you've downloaded that first of all you add this to your system path so that you can go into a command prompt window or a terminal window and type git if you type git and you get some kind of help command stuff popping up boom you're good to go you've installed it download it and yeah we're good to continue so once you've got get what we're actually gonna do is we're gonna go to the location that we want to install our get on or not Herget sorry are at flutter SDK on so essentially the first step is to download the flutter SDK and add that to our system path so that we can use the flutter command from our terminal so what we're gonna do is pick some location that does not have I think it's heightened privileges so that's not like an administrator folder or something so don't put it in your Program Files don't put it you know system32 don't put it anywhere like that find some place like in your Documents folder or in your downloads or on your desktop or wherever you think you're not going to lose it's fine to be there that does not have elevated privileges and install this in so I'm gonna go to my SSD number one I just have a bunch of drives so I'm gonna make a folder on here you can see I actually already have flutter and that's where I'm going to install it so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up a command prompt window in this location so to do that I just went up to this top bar and type CMD that opens the command prompt and you can see the location is on these set drive so just get your command prompt so that this location of the left hand side here is where you actually want to install this if you're on Mac I think you can right click and click open and terminal or something from the finder and that should open up if you're on Linux I'm gonna hope that you know how to navigate the command prompt so once you have that we're gonna use git to actually clone the flood or SDK right into this folder so we don't have to do any extracting or downloading ourself or anything like that so I'm just gonna copy this command I'll put it up on the screen and leave it in the description but this is what you want to do you want to type git clone and then HTTP colon slash slash github comm slash flutter slash flutter duck get be space stable so you can find this from the flutter website as well but again this will be in the description hopefully you can see it on the screen right here and once you've done that assuming you don't have a folder called flutter already in this location it should start downloading all the files and the flutter ste case should be downloaded right here now once you've done that we're going to go into the flood or sdk so open up this folder and we're going to need to go to the bin folder and the reason we're doing this is because we need to copy the path to this bin folder so we just need to find where this bin folder is and copy the path so in my case I'm on the Z Drive I'm in the flutter folder and I'm in bin so let's copy that right here let's say you're on your C Drive you're in your users folder or something like that you know you'd be C Drive users slash flutter or slash bin just copy that path make sure you have that path I think if you can't find it up here you can rightclick on the folder go to properties and you should be able to find the path right here it shows the location so once you have that what we need to do at least on Windows is we need to add this to our system path or our environment variables so if you type env or in you should see the edit edit the system environment variables pan popping up again this is Windows specific if you're on Mac you're gonna have to follow along with this guide here from the flutter Doc's that shows you how to modify your path so anyways I open to my environment variables it's right here I'm gonna select sorry from the Advanced tab environment variables and you're gonna see this thing pop up on my screen that it just has all of these different variables in it so you can see we have like chocolate ego path onedrive all this other stuff we're gonna look for this one that says path here and we're just gonna click on it and click Edit now this is what we want to modify to add our flutter SDK to the paths that we can use these flutter commands from our command prompt so you can see I already have mine added to the path here at the very bottom but what you need to do if you want to add a new entry into this path is just go somewhere near the bottom of it hit new and should bring up a new line you're gonna paste the path that you had to that flutters being a folder so you can see I have flutter /bin you're gonna press enter like that and you're gonna press ok now I've got mine in there twice that's totally fine it's not gonna make a difference you get the point you should be able to hopefully just add that in so actually let me delete this one just cuz I don't want to have it duplicated but once you have this inside the path okay okay you should be able to click apply here or okay or something like that that should save all the settings and now if you restart your command prompt window so let me just actually get rid of both these for a second if you restart it you should be able to type flutter like that now if you can type flutter and you see something popping up you have achieved that step you've accomplished that one so we are good to continue on so the next thing we're gonna do is actually from our command prompt we're gonna type flutter dr. like this now what this does is scan your system and analyze if you have the right dependencies for flutter if you don't it will automatically install them for you with the exception of a few different things so what we're gonna do is type flutter doctor press enter and at any point throughout the rest of the video if you think that something has gone wrong if you don't have the right dependencies go ahead and run flutter doctor hit enter and it will tell you what you're missing or what you need to install so we can see here that's saying flutter channels stable you know good we have that installed it says Android tool chain developed for Android devices some Android license is not accepted to resolve this run flutter dr. Android licenses so we're gonna do that because well we need to do this so it's gonna work for Android devices so I'm gonna copy that and actually I don't think I can paste that and I'm gonna go flutter dr. and then Android if we spell that right licenses is that how you spell licenses I think it is and let's see if this will fix the licensing issue for us so I think we have to review all of these so I'm just gonna hit Y on all of them and all SDK packages licenses are accepted so now we're good to go so let me run flutter doctor one more time and let's see what it's saying now and see if that fixed that and that seems to be good so now it just says Android studio flutter plugin not installed dart plugin not installed that's fine we're not going to be using Android studio for development so we don't need that it's as vyas code that one looks good and no devices are connected all right so now flutter doctor is good hopefully you guys have run that and all the dependencies have been installed and the next thing we're going to do is actually go and install Android studio now we need Android studio because we have to be able to run in Android SDK or have an SDK and actually run on an Android emulator so that we don't have to plug in a physical device when we want to actually test our application now you can actually plug in say like a phone you know an iPhone Android whatever it is and you can run off of that device I find that sometimes that's a little glitchy and I just don't want to be messing around with my physical device in development so I'd rather just run this on an emulator and of course for the purpose of the video it's gonna be a lot easier if I just have it on the actual screen so we need Android studio if you want to actually run an emulator and I think you need it regardless so just go ahead and download Android studio so again link in the description when you download Android studio make sure you install the Android SDK I think that will come with it by default but that's pretty much the only thing you're gonna need and I'll talk about some more specifics within Android studio once you've done so once you've downloaded Android studio you're gonna go hadn't booted up and what we're gonna do here is we're gonna build our actual first emulator there's a few settings in here I need to go through to make sure this is all set up specifically for flutter if you're on an Intel CPU you are lucky because everything is probably just gonna work for you right out of the box you're not really going to need to change anything or make any modifications if you're using an AMD CPU in your system you can find that out I think by either looking at your physical system they will probably say Intel or AMD like there might be a sticker or something like that if you're on a laptop or I think you can go into like device manager something like that and look at what your CPU is regardless figure out if you're on Intel or AMD and if you're on AMD you're gonna need to follow the following steps and actually on Intel you might need to do this too so just follow along we're gonna go to Android studio once this is boot up we're gonna go to tools we're gonna go to SDK manager right here and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna look at the Android SDK and we're first gonna make sure that we have one of the more recent versions installed don't worry if you have an older SDK installed that's fine so long as it's not super old but make sure you have one of those installed here if you don't use this tool to select where you want to install it and install it we're gonna need the SDK to be able to go along with this next we're going to go to SDK tools so here you can see the tools that I have checked and compare that to the tools that you have checked so right now I have the Android SDK command line tool we're gonna need that one for sure so give that a check mark so check like that we are gonna need the Android emulator so make sure that is checked we need the build tools from Android SDK which you should already have and now this is the specific step for AMD if you're on AMD you need to check this box right here for the Android emulator hypervisor driver for AMD processors you also need to make sure you have the Android SDK platform tools I'm pretty sure we're gonna be using that one and if you're on Intel so you have an Intel CPU look down here it says Intel x86 emulator accelerator you're gonna want to install that that's gonna make your emulator probably about 10 times faster than it would be without that so once you have these things checked appropriately you're gonna go ahead and hit apply it's probably gonna run you through a big installation process and to install all these different tools so go through that make sure everything installs properly and then we'll be off to the next step now quick note here if you are on actually any computer what you're gonna need to do with any of these steps a break is gonna need to actually enable virtualization now virtualization is a feature of your CPU you can actually enable that from your computer's BIOS which is something that I actually can't show you unless I film say with my smart phone because I can't screen record the BIOS but what you need to do is go into the BIOS you need to find whatever by us it is you have to look up how you enable virtualization for your CPU and you're gonna need to do that now most of you should actually already have that enabled but if for some reason you don't have that enabled go into your BIOS you do that usually by spamming f2 F 11 or F 10 when you're actually booting up into the system so before you hit the windows load screen to bring you into some crazylooking hackish environment and you need to go I believe at least for my BIOS it was in the overclock settings it was in the CPU features and then I enabled virtualization so you need that otherwise this will not work again that will require a restart of your computer to be able to do that so hopefully you do that once you have you know make sure all this stuff is installed and then what we're gonna do is actually create our first Android emulator and then we'll be somewhat close to the finish line here so the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go to where it says devices so in this little car over here let me see if I can zoom in at all it doesn't look like they have the control + work in here but anyways we're gonna go to open a video and now we are going to actually work on picking our device and creating a device so you can see I have two devices here I have one running API 25 we run one running API 30 but I'm gonna create a new one for this tutorial and what I'm gonna do is go to phone and I'm gonna select whatever device I want to use to actually run my app on so you guys can pick whatever you want pick a phone please for a mobile app but pick any phone you want I usually like to just go with the pixel three but again pick any device doesn't really matter I used I just like picking something that kind of has and in between screen size or screen size similar to the phone that I use so that I actually kind of the layout and how big this is relatively so what I'm gonna do is go pixel three I'm gonna press next and now I'm going to choose whatever API actually want to use on this device now if you're on an Intel machine you're lucky you can pick whatever you want and I highly recommend that you pick in x86 API here so usually you just go with the most recent one in this case you can see are so I clicked download on our I've already done that on otherwise we would show me this download button that's gonna take a minute or two then you select this one and press next now let's say if you select one of these devices and you get a little warning on the righthand side here that says hey you know your your computer's not capable of running this emulator blah blah whatever go to other images and then what you can do is select one of these AR m EA B versions here so if you for some reason cannot work on an x86 ABI or API or whatever you want to call it go over here to other images and download the most recent one that it says is acceptable for your system you're gonna pick one is AR m e ABB and then whatever version number here seven is fine eight is fine just don't pick these air M ones like that you gotta pick one that's air M EA B e a bi sorry that is a mouthful so anyways I'm gonna go on this x86 release here I'm gonna press Next and then I'm just gonna name the device whatever I want you can name this flutter device or flutter emulator something that maybe that's good and press finish now since I actually don't want to make another device because I already have one made I'm just gonna press cancel there you guys would have pressed finish and now we have a device that we hopefully will be able to use so there we go and that should be all good and now we're gonna be off to the next step which is not involve Android studio so what you're gonna realize here is that Android studio is really just being used for the emulator and for the Android SDK we're not gonna use it for development although we could use it for development I just prefer to use vs code so that's the one I'm going to use for this tutorial and I think it's just a little bit better and in my opinion I also do work for Microsoft on the vs code team so take that into account when you're considering my bias but anyways I'm going to leave a link to download vs code in the description I assume most of you we already have that once you download it install vs code there's no tricks there you should be able to just install it fine then what were you gonna do is you're gonna open up vs code you can see I actually already have a excuse me here flutter application open so I'm just gonna open a new window so we start fresh here and I'm going to show you how we can actually setup flutter so we can start developing in vs code so we're almost in the homestretch here we're almost done don't worry what we're gonna do to start is we're actually going to go to the extensions tab which is this one right here so these four little cubes you should see this in your vs code window and we're going to go search extensions marketplace and we're going to search for the flutter extension so you can see the flower extension pops up it's made by dart code we're going to go ahead and click install I already have this installed but it will ask you to install there might be some popups in the bottom righthand corner of your screen that you need to accept and then you should be good now the next one we're gonna do is dart so we're going to install this dart plugin I believe that or dart extension whatever you want to call it I believe installing the flutter extension automatically installs the dart extension I could be wrong but just make sure you have both dart and flutter again you can find that by just searching you know dart like that and flutter in the marketplace once you have that there's no restart required all we're gonna do is actually set up our flutter environment and make our first flutter project so I'm gonna go and hit control shift key on my keyboard what this does is that opens the what do you call it command prompt or terminal or whatever this thing is that you want to call it command manager I don't know the exact name that they go by but anyways that is control shift P that's gonna open this up command palette sorry I think that's what it's called and what we're gonna do is we're going to type flutter like this we're gonna go flutter new project so we're gonna click flutter new project this is gonna ask us what the name of our project should be we are actually going to just go with hello world for right now I'm gonna hit enter and you can see flutter tutorial I already got one named hello world let's just go ahead and put tutorial inside of here so I'm changing the name of it actually I'm gonna go select a folder to create the project in let's see let's let's make a new folder so new folder let's go tutorial like that and let's go inside of this folder and save our flutter project so there we go we can see flutter is now being created so it's creating a new project for us we could do this manually from the command line but since BS code has this nice extension we're just gonna use it and there we go our flutter app is actually up and running now I'm gonna show you how we can get this running on the emulator in just one second but hopefully all of this is working for you this code was generated and now you actually have some you know hello world application or whatever you decide to name it on your system with dart code inside of it so the next thing we're going to do is we're gonna hit ctrl shift B again we're gonna go to the command pallet and what we're gonna do is we're gonna say flutter like this and we're just gonna have a look at some of the commands that we have here so we have launched emulator run flutter dr. change SDK clean project and a bunch of other stuff so if there's anything you need to do from flutter you can use the vs code extension again that's control shift P command shift P I believe if you are on a Mac that will open up the command palette and you can have a look and run these different commands now what we're actually gonna do those pick the device that we want to run this flutter app on so if you have a device plugged into your computer you might actually be able to select it right now what we're gonna do is go to vs code go to the bottom right hand corner here where it says no device and we're going to select the emulator that we created in Android studio as our device now again if you have your Android device plugged in here I believe it only works for Android a physical device if you're on Windows then you should be able to select that device but I'm gonna select start pixel 3 API 30 mobile emulator so I'm gonna run that we're gonna give this a second and hopefully it's going to boot up the emulator for us and we're gonna give it a second to actually start connect and then hopefully run our sample application so there we go the emulator is up looks as though it's working ok and if you got to this stage you have pretty much set up your flutter environment correctly and we're gonna be ready for development now if something's gone wrong here it says you know cannot connect to device cannot find device first make sure that you have those CPU instructions that I talked about make sure you followed this you have virtualization enabled from your BIOS you're gonna need to do that on your computer if you don't already you have that little tick mark on the AMD hypervisor thing that I told you to do if you're on AMD processor and you have the Intel I believe it's ham X or something like that whatever that checkbox was for Intel installed so once you have all that that should work you should build around the emulator if you have a physical device again you can plug that in you should be able to select that from down here so I'm just gonna turn this on by hitting the power button once you can see that's bringing me to where I left off I was running a flutter app on this previously but let's now see if we can actually get our app to run on this device so from within vias code what we're gonna do is run this app to do that you can simply press f5 on your keyboard or you can go to the run tab here so it's little bug with a run icon and you should be able to actually run the app so now you can see that let's actually refresh this here for a second and see if it pops up on the Android emulator alright so I press run I just closed the old app because that was just an old instance that was running on my machine once you press run you should be able to look in the debug console here and see that some stuff is starting to happen now on the initial run this will take a second to actually boot up it needs to take all the code and compile it and actually put it on to the correct device so you can see here it's saying dart dev tools includes additional tools for debugging and profiling flutter ops including a widget inspector try it I'm gonna go ahead and try that so i'm gonna click open and see that's gonna bring me into my browser here into this detailed debug environment so i can actually have a look at everything that's going on in my application now we're not gonna talk more about this later we're not really gonna be using it a ton because we're not doing any crazy development right now but this is a really nice way to actually be able to figure out what's going on in your app look at all of the widgets look at all the dependencies everything that's happening do a refresh select specific widgets all that fun stuff and one of the reasons why dart is just a great development thing to use alright so you can see that now on my device this is actually running this is the demo app from flutter you should have the exact same one what you can do is you can press this button and you can see that some border around our app is changing random colors and we have the count of how many times we press this button now I believe we're getting that border because we're in this debugger tool here but regardless that is all I wanted to do in this video is get us set up and running and show you how we can actually get flooded working on our machine now an interesting thing with flutter is that you can actually do something called a hot refresh so rather than having to rebuild the app every single time you make a change you can press this a lightning button here this is a hot reload what that will do is just take whatever code you've changed and apply that so make the change on the device in live time so you don't need to rebuild every single time you want to test something you just press that little lightning button and immediately it will make the change on the device and I think it does not change state when you do that I could be wrong on that we're going to talk more about this in later videos but I just want to show you that there is this hot reload thing which is a really cool development feature so yeah alright so with that being said it asmin it for the first video in the next videos we're gonna dig into this code Graham talk about more about flutter we're gonna build some more applications and all of that with that being said if you enjoyed make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and of course I will see you guys in the next flutter tutorial
