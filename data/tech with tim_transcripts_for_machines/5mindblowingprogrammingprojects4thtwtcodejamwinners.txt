hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to be showing you five very impressive and pretty mindblowing projects that are coming out of a coding competition that i run on my discord server which is known as a code jet so approximately every two months i run this coding competition in my discord server if you guys want to be a part of that you do need to be in the discord i will leave a link to it in the description and anyways during this competition me and the staff team for the discord server pick some type of theme this code gems theme was visualization and then you can get in teams of pretty much however many people you want or you can work alone as well and then you can work on some project that relates to the theme so all of the projects you're gonna see here are related to visualization anyways then what we do is we give the kind of contestants i guess a month to work on this project at the end they must submit these projects and then there's community voting so everybody who actually partook in the code gym gets to look at all of the projects vote on their favorites and then the top five are reviewed in a youtube video so anyways that is what this video is i'm reviewing the top five projects i've already had a look at them as i said they're very impressive anyways let's get into the video and let me show you what people actually did so quick side note here there is actually a website that has all the information you need to know relating to the code jam this actually where you sign up for the code jam and vote and do all of that kind of stuff this website is twt codegem.net i'll leave a link to it in the description it was actually developed by mostly the staff team of the discord server and some community contributors so massive thank you to all of you guys and a quick thank you to everyone who participated in this code jam i think this is really fun and like i say in all of these videos yes i am giving out cash prizes to the teams that win but the idea behind this is really just to give you guys an opportunity to showcase your programming skills give you an excuse to work on a project and learn something new and well i hope that everyone that participated in the code jam had a good time and at least was able to create something and learn a little bit on the way so anyways with that said let's get into the video i have five projects to show you all right so the way that this is going to go is i'm going to start by showing you the github repository for the project that i am about to showcase i will quickly mention who actually worked on this code give them a little bit of a shout out and then i will actually get into the project demo it give some of my thoughts on it and then at the very end of the video i will announce the top three winning teams now the first thing to mention here is the way i'm kind of grading or marking these teams is based on first of all how well did their project fit the theme how polished and finished was the project was there a lot of work that was put into it did it seem like it was something that was done last minute that's something i'm definitely considering and then lastly i always look at these projects from the angle of would i actually use this does this kind of product platform project whatever actually makes sense is this something relatively practical and yeah would i actually see myself potentially using what it is that they built so anyways without further ado first project here this is called violise i think i'm pronouncing that correctly this is my tech guy 940 otherwise known as just for fun he has been a part of i think every code gem so massive shout out to you and anyways let me go to the website which i believe is in the next tab here awesome so his website vlise of course you know fist the theme of visualize says visualize everything at one place visualize unique things starting from a double pendulum to math problems awesome so there's a few different things on this website first initial thoughts i think this looks awesome whenever i see these kind of really nice landing pages and you know the nice scrolling feature and all of that it just gives a really nice first impression of the website so i'm not going to read everything obviously i don't want to spend too long on each project but i'll kind of scroll through it and obviously you guys can check this out i'll link all of the github repositories in the description so what we provide double pendulum get viz ownviz mathviz codeviz gdp growth okay cool so and there's a little messages form so let's get started with the double pendulum let's see how this works okay sweet so it just visualizes the double pendulum uh let's add another one with n okay let's add a bunch of them and see how this works awesome okay that's pretty cool i can press space to pause and stop it nice looks really clean and i can remove stuff with r switch that's a double pendulum uh what else do we have features there is git biz okay so i need to find a github repository okay i'll be right back i'm just going to insert one in here all right so i just input one of my github repositories so i put my name and then i put the name of the repository and you can see that i can look at all the different forks and when they were happening i guess i can look at different issues although i don't know if there was actually any issues for this oh there was a few issues okay i can see some nice graphs awesome this looks really fancy and professional although it is a little bit slow to load but i can you know forgive that you can see the languages or the language percentage used in the project sweet yeah this looks really nice i i guess submit oh yes submit just change this and then of course i can see when it was created the default branch contributors forks issues stars owner and then the link to the repository very nice this is really cool and i imagine if i had a more complex repository this would look even cooler awesome we'll look at a few more of the features here so we can go to ownviz visualize your own data x and y on a graph uh okay okay let's just 10 20 does it say i do space between it okay 10 20 30 40 10 20 30 40. let's submit and see if that works okay so i do get some nice graphs of that awesome okay sweet let's go to some more features here mathviz let's see what this one is uh math equation visualizer okay x to the exponent two plus y to the exponent 3 minus x over x to the exponent 2 plus 7. let's see what this gives us submit oh i guess i have to make this an equation let's say equals 0. okay can you solve that for me uh submit solutions okay so right away like i'm not really getting any output i imagine the way i put the equation in is probably incorrect but maybe it should give me some type of error message so i'm just going to skip that one i'll go on to the next feature code vis visualize your code okay let's just say for x in range 10 print oh i guess the tab key doesn't work in there okay print x let's submit let's see what this gives us okay that's cool so i can like step through the code and see what everything looks like that's interesting nice interesting visualization okay features uh gdp growth you guys will notice i'm going fairly fast i just want to make sure i get through everything united arab emirates okay cool so i can go to oh that's interesting so i guess as the year goes on it's kind of showing me the gdp growth of the different countries wow that's really interesting i wonder how he made this damn okay that looks really cool sweet okay i guess that's pretty much it for this project i know i didn't get into everything too in depth but really impressive i think everything looks very professional uh there's a few things like i wish there would have been a little bit more help on how to use some of the visualizers just because i feel like i kind of didn't really get the full use case out of this because i just didn't really know how to use some of the different visualizers here but other than that yeah definitely really interesting really professional looks great let's move on to the next project all right so the next project i have here is called figurify i think that's probably how you pronounce it although that obviously is a madeup word i'm trying to find the contributors here let's go to insights contributors and let's see okay so it looks like it was just snowball sh that worked on this project so another solo project sweet and now let's hop over to the website and let's see what it actually looks like okay so let me go back to kind of the homepage here i was messing around with it before so figurify the algorithms right in your browser okay awesome and i like all of these kind of little bubbles popping out that's a nice touch uh here's what you can do visualize 2d data visualize sorting algorithms and visualize the minimax algorithm awesome okay so let's go into 2d data and let's see how this looks alright can i move this point no but i can oh that's interesting so i can actually see like different parts of the graph if i highlight it i can zoom out nice what does this do download oh that's an interesting thing i can change this to a bar graph sweet okay let's add some more data more data to this graph here so let's go negative 20 and negative 20. let's go 10 100 and let's go 120 graph and okay nice that looks great let's change this back to an area graph suite to a line graph nice histogram gives me the same thing as the bar graph uh i'm actually a histogram why can i not remember what a histogram is histogram and bar graph are not the same thing are they like is this a mistake i'm not sure okay anyways that's that part portion let's now go to the sorting aspect uh okay let's randomize randomize can i get some more values okay that's good uh let's select selection sort and let's visualize this okay nice so i can just press the arrow and i can see exactly what's happening in every single step and i guess i can go to the last step in the algorithm and see that okay let's randomize again let's look at quick sort this time okay nice yep looks about right awesome so there's another sorting visualizer suite we can go to the last step there i trust the other ones work very nice uh and i guess what does that do oh remove last element add element okay nice uh minimax visualization so i was looking at this one before i don't quite understand exactly how this works but let's just mess around with and see so i think i can select this and there you go i've placed i guess like the player or the flowers turn i guess has been placed let's place a star okay star goes there i guess it's favoring the flower right i want to call that the flower i don't know if that is right now based on the way that this line is using the many max algorithm okay let's place something i guess right here let's see okay i'm still favored i guess we're gonna have to go here nice go here okay now it looks like it's gonna be a draw game and we can go over here okay here and i guess here and here okay nice uh i'll do it one more time and see if this actually gives it to me if i'm if i do it like incorrectly okay so i'm going to go over here so let's favor me i go here okay i go here and then yes okay it says i'm going to win and i win nice okay awesome so i think that is the entire project another great project really like the ui and kind of you know like the bubble letters and everything it's a different style than what most people go with um so sweet let's move on to the next project all right so this next project is called spotify stats it looks like it's by sand i i apologize if i'm butchering that name senshit maybe uh and arnoff okay awesome so that's spotify stats uh looking at it here it says it can do all of these different things now i swear whoever made this did this just to expose my music taste you guys are going to see what music i listen to now but let me log in here actually do use spotify so this will be a decent i guess app to actually test out here and then once i am signed in i will kind of show you what the website looks like all right so i'm signed into spotify now it's brought up this page and while you guys can already see some of the music that i listen to i'll just quickly state that i'm a very generic music listener if that makes any sense i usually just put on top 50 or whatever the recommended playlists are so don't read too deep into all of these songs anyways you can see here are my top 10 songs go through them okay top artist yes do love john mayer he's great okay you know your your standard artist jack johnson great one too nice nice nice this is actually pretty interesting let's see what else it has here here are your top five genres okay nice rap pop rap pop uh melodic yeah why can't i say that word melodic rap something like that trap okay uh similar artist to john mayer okay jason mraz mostly a bunch of other names i don't know how to pronounce nice nice uh recommended songs for you okay great uh your top song attributes this is interesting i've never actually seen this in like a you know song spotify analysis is pretty unique can i click on this i can download that that's sweet so it looks like they're using the same thing as whatever someone else used to do these kind of graphs and it even tells you what all these things are that's very interesting so i was going to say i don't really know what acousticness actually means um sweet that's very interesting uh some more stats uh longest average shortest tempo and beats per minute highest tempo 188 average 118 lowest 71. i don't know how that really compares to everyone else oh this is really cool i like this visualization see how different artists contribute to your top 100 songs damn okay sweet that's really cool uh and thank you for visiting nice yeah this was really cool i'm sure they just pulled this from the spotify api but the way they kind of laid this out in the ui they made for it is really awesome and this is a very interesting project right it's a cool way to actually visualize something that everyone is very very familiar with which is the music that they listen to so great job guys let's move on to the next project so the next project i have here is called physics lab learn physics by visualizing okay very nice the fastest easiest and retainable way of learning physics awesome and let's see who this is by go to insights where is it contributors okay milan090 nice i think i remember you from some previous code jams so let's see what your project looks like physics lab okay i haven't actually tried this one yet so let's see learn your physics with physics lab learning physics by visualizing try now all simulators uh newton's cradle gravity trajectory pendulum air resistance friction oh that's really cool okay let's try out a few of these is this the pendulum i guess i can change the gravity oh wow that's really cool what if i make it even okay not zero 0.5 restitution is it bad i don't even know what that means is that like the amount of impact or something maybe uh air friction let's increase that will it eventually stop yeah yeah this is really cool this actually i could genuinely see this being you know used in a classroom assuming that all the physics here are correct and i'm not necessarily questioning those uh graph view oh that's cool it's like a sinusoidal kind of wave going on that's i did they have than the other one i don't know that's that's really cool though and i can mess with all of these i can see how the graph actually changes wow that's very interesting uh air resistance oh okay so i guess this oh that's neat i can like make it fall okay let's make the air resistance like crazy high damn okay gravity increase simulation nice box size can change the mass of it this means gonna like bounce or something if i do that no i still don't know what restitution means i guess i'm just not a physics nerd okay anyways try something else let's go to the next simulator let's try gravity um oh is this like stuff is in an orbit around this am i maybe maybe oh yeah it looks like it yeah it looks like this is like a space orbit or something going on uh one thing i'll say is oh that that's cool planets count yeah okay so it'd be nice if there was kind of like a description of what was going on here because if this is like to learn physics it'd be interesting if they at least you know like define these terms but regardless this is still really cool math formula okay and that makes sense because the more objects that go close to the center the more mass it has nice nice uh okay let's try trajectory this one is cool i actually messed with trajectory in a few projects i worked on uh so i can definitely relate to this one so can i like pull this back and shoot it or something um oh there you go okay i have to it's kind of a weird trigger mechanism oh nice that's really interesting awesome and then graph view ah okay that's cool so it shows me i guess the displacement at a certain oh no the velocity at a certain time awesome and then the last one we have is friction okay so just a box sliding down a ramp let's increase the friction and make it even more see if we can make it so it stays stationary yeah okay so when the friction is one it like barely moves nice and i can increase the angle let's try that very nice okay definitely a super impressive project i want to know how he implemented all of these physics here because that is really cool and like i said the only real critique i would have for this one is since it says you know learning physics it would be cool if you actually put some learning attribute in here because it is cool to mess around with this stuff but if i don't know what the terms mean it's uh you know not not very useful to me anyways let's move on to the next project all right so the next project i have here is called a flex chart now this is by zen yu han or han not sure you say that and then tony z now let's actually go to the project all right so it says graph the present change the future nice nice like that slogan tagline whatever you want to call it uh so i already signed in here so i'm with my account so i can sign out by pressing that so it says the modern data visualization tool let's read the about page there are many features that make graphing data is much simpler you can graph your own data is this a word data with a plural maybe i'm maybe i'm just crazy but i feel like this is like not proper this doesn't sound proper you can insert spreadsheet it will give you graph graph it will get graphed automatically you can even see all the trend topics okay nice let's go back let's look at some trends first let's look at covet 19 data okay so this is the global view active cases in millions by day nice nice uh let's go to canada sweet okay so confirmed uh one one two seven dot zero is this in oh it's in thousands okay that makes sense recovered critical deaths let's go to united states u.s usa okay and you can see there's quite a bit more than canada let's go to programming languages python yes on top as always java javascript sounds about right out okay they give the source awesome i was just going to question i don't know where that comes from ide ranking nice same source uh visual studio code right in the middle there that's what i've been using where's sublime text i guess that's not considered an ide okay databases oracle mysql sql server nice nice anime i don't know what any of these are websites youtube yep sounds about right awesome and facebook's still second place eh or this isn't is it looks like wikipedia is higher than facebook but it's not higher on the graph so i wonder why that's the case but regardless i'm kind of surprised that facebook is still the second largest website used but uh i guess that makes sense okay you know what let's go to my own projects actually projects i mean i can view that one or i can create a new project let's do that let's say test okay let's view so i have an empty graph here i don't oh i can change the type of the graph nice line bar pi let's make it a pie graph let's load i don't have any data to load let me type in some data so i don't see here's the thing i'm not sure if these are supposed to be like labels or like i'm just inserting like x y or something um let's see here two three two four five six i know i'm 100 doing this strong okay so those are the labels okay so that makes sense so i can say tim and let's change that to be bill and let's change that to be joe okay so two four six and i can put some label here so i don't know let's say great good fun or something okay uh joe tim bill let's go three four five six eight seven i know this makes no sense i'm just trying to test the graphing thing and see if it works okay it does work looks good let's go to bar okay nice nice nice line sweet is giving me multiple lines okay this makes a lot more sense now i wasn't quite sure exactly what i was supposed to insert compared to the other ones that they had sweet i mean i don't think i really need to test this much more i mean this looks great the graph looks awesome seems like you guys are using a similar one to what everyone else has been using i guess i can add like a sub project in here let's say you know sub okay and yes so now it looks like there's a project inside of this test project unless oh no these are just all different projects and this is the active one that's highlighted in green awesome so i'm going to delete this project here that works sweet and with that said that's going to conclude the five projects now before i actually get into ranking them i'll just quickly say that these are super impressive and even if i'm giving you guys criticism it's very like i'm trying to come up with something wrong with it essentially uh these are great they look awesome great work to everyone who submitted a project i did look at a few that weren't in the top five as well anyways now let's get into the top three projects all right so now we're gonna get into the top three projects first i just want to address kind of fourth and fifth place or fifth and fourth place there's really no order for these two projects that didn't make it into the top three and those two projects are physics lab and figurify now i just want to tell you guys you did an awesome job i was genuinely very impressed by both of these projects and the only real feedback i have for you guys is that i just felt this wasn't super unique super creative for example physics lab i feel like you kind of did the same thing six times nothing wrong with that but it just wasn't something that necessarily kind of stood out as much as the other projects where i felt they had a little bit more uniqueness to what they did and then what i'm talking about figurify here this one same thing really well done i liked the ui decision you kind of went with something different than what most people are doing nowadays um the data visualization was interesting by the same time sorting visualizer this is kind of done all over the internet now not super creative or unique and the mini max i thought was a really good idea i thought that could have had a lot of potential but with tictactoe i just thought it was a little bit too simple simple sorry for me to really appreciate uh what went into actually doing that so either way good job guys hope to see you again in the next code gym please don't be discouraged by any of my comments as i said i am just literally trying to come up with things that are wrong with these projects because you guys did an awesome job all right so now we are moving on to the top three projects what you guys have been waiting for now all three of these projects did a really good job honestly it's really hard for me to pick between these projects even this top five like the reason i'm picking projects is not anything you know super major big difference it's generally just my subjective opinion of what i liked better and with that said the third place project the third place team i have for us is flex chart now flex chart you guys did an awesome job i thought this was pretty well done i know you guys put a lot of work into this website even created a lot of these kind of trending ones which i really appreciated because it allowed me to not have to go in and put all of my data i could actually really see what the program was capable of doing and then uh like even just the ui design you kept it simple but it was nice everything worked well and of course when i went and actually graphed the data no bugs no problems i wish potentially maybe you had started with some data in there just so it was easy to see exactly how you're supposed to input the data and yeah i just thought you guys did a good job but i felt the other ones were maybe a little bit more unique had a little bit more work put into them and well that is why you guys came third place so regardless congratulations i'll be reaching out to you on discord to send you your prize so congrats once more and now let's announce second and first place so the second place team i have here is spotify stats now i didn't think this project was super impressive in terms of a programming side i know what you guys did is you really just went to the spotify api you pulled a bunch of information and you visualize it on the screen however this is the one project that when i was using i was like i would actually use this i don't really care how simple it actually is but the visualization was really nice it was really easy to see it was a quick you know 31 minutes it was a quick you know 30 second to a minute long kind of read of the page and it gave me actually a really kind of interesting overview of all of the artists that i listened to all of the music that i like and some interesting recommendations as well so again i know this wasn't technically super complicated to do but i just appreciated that this was something that i would actually use and i'm sure a lot of people that are watching this video will probably go click on so that they can actually see uh their kind of spotify trends and stats and so that is why i picked this as second place so congratulations guys awesome idea and yeah i will be reaching out to you on discord so you can collect your promise so of course that leaves first place as realize now realize i think it's pretty straightforward why i picked this you guys just had the most amount of features i think you have the most amount of things to visualize i thought that everything here was just done very well everything felt really polished with the exception of i think one small thing that didn't go exactly as i was expecting everything worked it was very intuitive it was easy to use didn't really need to read a lot of the instructions if i didn't need to read the instructions they were clear and easy to see and yeah i just felt like this was really polished really well finished and again just like in a lot of the other code jams when i see these types of websites these remind me of something that wasn't made in a code jam right like if you had showed this to me and just say oh this is a cool website you can use to visualize something i would just believe that i wouldn't have thought this was a hobby project done by one person so anyways that is kind of my rationale i hope you guys enjoyed this video congratulations again to all of the teams and to everyone who participated in the code gem i hope at minimum you guys learned something you enjoyed your time working on a project and i hope to see you all in the next ones with that said make sure you guys sign up for the next code gem or at least join my discord server so you'll be aware of when it starts again link in the description to all of that information with that said if you enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel i will see you in another youtube video
