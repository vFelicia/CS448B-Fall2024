so the first and number one reason I recommend people learn how to code is that it teaches them how to think and it teaches them how to problem solve when you're programming you are going to encounter hundreds of problems probably every day and you need to be able to break those problems down and that is one of the reasons I personally really like coding because it forces me to think I cannot think of many other situations where I use my brain power as much as when I'm sitting in front of the computer and programming building a mental model of what's going on in this programming language and thinking about the tools that you have and how you can apply them to certain problems is such an important skill and you master that when you get good at programming
