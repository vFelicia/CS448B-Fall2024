hey guys and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on Raspberry Pi now I'm super excited because I just got the brand new B+ Raspberry Pi or at least brand new to me what I'm gonna be doing through these next videos is showing you guys how to use this Raspberry Pi right some cool awesome Python programs with it it will allow us to interact with the outside world so for those of you that don't know this Raspberry Pi has something called GPIO pins let's even get zoomed in on here on the side right here and these essentially allow you from code to have voltage going in or out of them they also allow you to connect sensors and cameras and all that kind of fun stuff so what I'm gonna be doing throughout this series is starting off really basic with just how to trigger like an LED which is what we're gonna be doing in this video and then moving into more complex stuff like the Raspberry Pi camera module which I actually have in here and then we're gonna go into like a little security system which I'm actually building as we speak so anyways I hope you guys are excited for the series if you have any ideas on what you like to see with the Raspberry Pi please leave a comment down below with that being said let me reset up the camera and I'm gonna show you guys how we can set up our first circuit on a breadboard using the Raspberry Pi alright so let's go ahead and get started so from this point on we're gonna need a few things now the first thing I'm gonna assume is that you guys first of all have this Raspberry Pi and you've at least opened it up out of the box and maybe looked at it and played with it a little bit I'm also going to assume that you've installed the operating system on to this so this little SD card here at the bottom you guys can kind of see it there I'm assuming you've kind of played with that and assumed how to get that on so if you haven't done that go ahead and do that before following this tutorial now the next thing we're gonna need is we're gonna need a breadboard and we're gonna need some of these jumper cables so I actually have two types of cables I have what's known as a female thank you guys can see that there male cable so this has a prong and no prong and this is going to allow us to put this on some of these GPIO pins and we also have male to male jumper wires which are what we're gonna use for the breadboard mainly and you can see that they have two prongs I know it's kind of blurry the way the camera is but hopefully you get the point there so make sure you guys pick those up you can buy them at any kind of electronics store or you can just get them off Hamazon I'll leave some links in the description down below so now what we're gonna do is we're just going to start looking up this Raspberry Pi to the breadboard so that when we eventually turn it on and start programming we don't have to do anything we can actually just work it directly with the code and now it's very important that you do this while your Raspberry Pi is off if you do this while your Raspberry Pi is on you have a very high chance of shorting it which is not good in most cases when you short your Raspberry Pi what's happening is essentially you're putting voltage into one of the ground pins or a pin that's not expecting that much voltage which means the whole board gets a ton of voltage on it and then it just shuts off now in some cases you can actually fry your board Raspberry Pi tries to avoid this by going into recovery mode but just you don't want to be in that situation so please turn this off before you start working with any of the pins now we're going to talk about these GPIO pins so you guys can see them here and what we're gonna be doing is working with the pins on the bottom right side here so right where that Raspberry Pi icon is and to clarify here I'm using the Raspberry Pi model b+ which has 40 GPIO pins so the pins we're gonna be using I'm trying not to get too close to the camera here are gonna be on this side so we're actually gonna hook up our first wire and we're gonna hook up the female side to this top right pin or sorry bottom right pin which is gonna be the 5 volt pin now this is just always 5 volts going through it so obviously be careful if this is on because it's gonna be a live wire that has 5 volts going through it now the next cable we're gonna hook up I'm gonna hook up this black one is going to be two pins to the left of that and this is what's known as our ground pin so let me get it in and then I'll show you guys so right there you can see that we have one space and two cables like that now what we need essentially whenever we're creating a circuit is we need some kind of power which is going to come out of this and then we need some kind of ground now the ground is gonna be what completes the circuit so if you guys don't know that anything about electricity essentially you need the circuit to be complete like that for anything to actually happen otherwise it just doesn't work so once we've done that now we're actually gonna hook these up to our breadboard now if you look at the breadboard here you'll see that we have what's known as a positive rail and a negative rail so right there positive and negative so what we're gonna do is we're gonna plug in our positive wire which is actually going to be the live wire which the voltage is going into into any slot on this red rail the way that this red rail works is when you plug something into here there's a metal strip underneath it it attaches to all of these other holes so essentially anytime we plug another jumper wire into this red hole if this is giving us voltage then it's gonna get voltage from that as well now for ground we're gonna do the same thing except we're gonna plug it into any one on the negative rail right here now I'm just gonna plug them in beside each other but notice that since this line that goes here you can tell that this is a rail which means the whole thing is going to be charged from any two wires going like this now the way the bread we're breadboard works other than that is you see the rows like this so for example if you look at like row 10 which is right here you can see that what's actually how this works essentially is if you plug something into that pin all of the other pins in that row will get the charge from that you guys might not understand this right now but as we start playing with the breadboard you'll understand essentially the rails go like that and the rows go like that but do not go past this dividing line here so you can almost think this is like two little bread boards where this is one breadboard and this is the other and they're attached by this kind of divider so someone you plug in here is not gonna be charged on this side and you guys all understand that as we go through so now that we've done that we've plugged into the positive and negative rail what we're actually gonna do is we're gonna use this male to male jumper wires and we're gonna hook them up on these rails so just plug one cable in anywhere on the negative rail and another cable in anywhere on the positive rail now we're gonna use these to connect to our LEDs which I'm going to grab in just a second as well as a resistor so the next thing we're gonna need is a resistor and I'll be back in one second with those all right so I've got one of these LEDs now here you can see this little green LED it's not really focusing too well and what we're gonna do now is we're gonna plug this into the breadboard and then we're gonna plug in these male jumper wires to connect to it as well as one of these resistors now the reason we're using a resistor is because these LEDs don't actually use enough voltage to absorb enough voltage so you don't short your board so essentially what happens in a in a circuit is you need to have something using the voltage so in this case our LED is gonna use the voltage and create some kind of light and transform essentially those electrons and that energy into a source of heat which will be this light okay now I know it sounds like really science II it's not that complicated but essentially all I'm saying here is this does not transform enough energy which means that when we pass through this led too much current is going to be coming out of the LED into our Raspberry Pi here which means that it could possibly short so to be safe we're gonna use a resistor now the resistor that I'm using is 100 ohms now you don't really need to know what the ohms means but that's just the amount of resistance so just try to get one that's at least 50 ohms and use that now you can try to use it without a resistor and just see what happens worst case your board will might turn off but I don't think anything will actually happen to it like too dangerous again don't take my word for that but I've used it without a resistor and it works just to be safe though I like to recommend to people to use a resistor like this so what we're gonna do now is just start setting some things up on our breadboard some of these might move my Raspberry Pi and zoom in a little bit here just so we can see this a little bit better so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually going to set up my resistor so it goes into this negative rail so you can see that I'm actually plugging that in on that negative rail so it lines up with that blue wire here which is gonna be plugged in somewhere else and you guys will see where that is actually we can remove this blue wire my mistake guys we're gonna get rid of that blue wire and just leave the green now what I'm gonna do is plug in this resistor just anywhere else on the board close enough to it that it obviously fit so you guess you have just decide to plug that in and bro 21 but to make sure that it goes in the holes and it fits like that the next thing we're going to do is we're going to use our LED now the LED has to what do you call it little sides on it so one of them you can see it's not really focusing here see if I can get that to focus is shorter than the other so that shorter side is actually going to be I'll show you here again is actually going to be what ends up getting the the positive side or the and this longer side is what's going to be getting the voltage for us so what we want to do is we want to plug in so that this shorter side is in line with the resistor and this longer side and you can just bend it a little bit goes in anywhere else on the breadboard so you can see here now and I'll bring it up nice and close hopefully it focuses for us we go like that maybe maybe we can kind of see it that we're lined up directly with the resistor so that green LED is lined up with the short side with the resistor and the long pin is just plugged into one of these other holes what we're going to do next is we're going to take the the jumper wire here so this maletomale and we're gonna plug it in so it lines up in the same row as the positive side or the negative side sorry of our LED actually it is positive side because it's going to be getting the voltage so you can see this green one is lined up on this rail here which gets voltage we're gonna go in here it's going to light up the LED it's gonna come out go into the resistor and then go into this orange cable here or so not orange this black cable here which is plugged in to our Raspberry Pi on those GPIO pins so now that we've done that we can actually go ahead and turn the Raspberry Pi on and we should see that our LED is lighting up so let's go ahead and do that and that will be right back alright so I've plugged my Raspberry Pi in and you can see that our LED is actually lighting up there so if you've done that correctly your LED should be lighting up and you should see a little red light on your Raspberry Pi maybe a green light if it's just booting up so that's because we're getting constant power from that five bullet pin so we've been able to turn on this LED so now what I'm going to show you guys how to do is how we can do this from code so all we actually need to do to modify this is we're first gonna unplug our Raspberry Pi I usually would recommend you shut it off before you do that but I'm just kind of living on the wild side and unplugging it and now what we're gonna do is move actually the pin that's giving us our voltage so this 5 volt pin we're gonna move it to a different pin which is known as a GPIO pin which will allow us to control this from code so what I'm gonna do now is then simply take out this one from that back right 5 volt pin and what I'm gonna do is move it over so it's up on this top row four pins over and I'll zoom in on this in a second for you guys so you could should be able to see now if I can kiss it focus focus maybe that it's four pins to the left at the top so if you look where that ground pin is one up in to the left and that's what's known as our GPIO pin number four so now what I'm gonna do is actually hook up to the Raspberry Pi on the computer and show you guys how we can program to use this pin to turn off our LED from code so let's go ahead and do that now alright so I've booted up my Raspberry Pi I'm on the desktop and what I'm gonna do now is show you how we can actually use this little circuit we set up to turn on and off the green LED now what I just realized is that these GPIO pins and the one that we connected to give out 3.3 volts which is pretty low and doesn't result in much of a light for our LED so if you want what you guys can do is what I've done and just disconnect the resistor I don't know if you guys can see this at all or not and what I've done is just directly hook up the LED in the circuit so that's actually bit of a challenge for you guys see if you can remove the resistor and still get this to work now if you can't put the resistor back in the way you had it you will still see the light light up it just won't be as bright so you can remove the resistor this will be safe to do I've just tested it myself there's no issues so what I'm gonna do is open up ideally from here from our Raspberry Pi and we're just gonna work in the console and I'm gonna show you exactly how to do this so we're gonna say from and this is just a few lines of code here GPIO 0 it could spell 0 correctly imports and in this case LED now that we've done this we're gonna define what GPIO pin we're using to turn on the LED by just saying green which is gonna be the name of our LED we're gonna say is equal to LED and then here we're gonna put for now just 4 like that now once you do that now we can actually use the variable name green to turn our LED on and off by simply typing dot on + dot off so right now hopefully you guys can see this I'll I just have it hovering my LED is off now if I put and I hit enter here you can see that my LED turns on now if I want to turn it off if I go on the screen and I just go off like that and hit enter you can see that the LED turns off and can continue to just turn it on and off from code like this now obviously you guys can write this in whatever kind of Python code you want but that's as easy as it is to turn on and off the LED from a GPIO pin yeah if you're having any issues with this chances are you've probably hooked up your board incorrectly or your what do you call it not typing this or you're defining the wrong GPIO pin so go back watch make sure you've hooked up everything correctly and again a little challenge for you guys try to remove this resistor and see if you can get everything working if you can't put the resistor back try it you still will see the light others be very faint so with that being said that has been it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed the next videos we'll get more advanced and there's a lot of cool stuff and a me show you guys how to do
