hey guys welcome back to another video in today's video I'm gonna be talking about how to overclock an AMD graphics card so in one of the last videos I talked about how to overclock a Nvidia graphics card using msi afterburner in this instance i'm going to be talking about how to overclock AMD cards so raid on cards are X 480 RX 580 whatever AMD card you might have using the global walkman which is a part of AMD settings so the first thing we need to do here is just make sure you have the most recent drivers installed I'm not going to show you how to do that you can find that on the website is pretty simple so all we're gonna do is gonna go down to the Start menu and research AMD settings like that I should find something it looks like this it should pop open fairly quickly and then we're gonna go to gaming up here alright now we should see you can see all my games up here we're gonna click on global settings now this comes up and it says global graphics but we want to go to global Whatman right over here ok so now it pops up all the different properties of our GPU now if you haven't watched my other video I will go back and I'll explain what overclocking does and how to safely do it to your GPU so you might hear instances of people blowing up their GPUs are people completely wrecking them because they didn't know how to overclock and they did it improperly so just follow these instructions and you should be fine so you should see something that says the core clock which is right here the memory clock which is over here and then your fan control and your sorry your Heat over here so your temperature now the first thing we always do when we overclock is we crank our power limit all the way up so see power limit down here it might look a little different for you but you just want to put it all the way up to the max and then up here click apply just like that because in order to get the most of it our GPU we need to give it more power so the more power and more volts that we send into it the better performance we can get out of it now the thing to watch here is the card that I have runs really hot so it'll run on load like a DC which is extremely hot for graphics cards so what the killer of graphics card is is the temperature so you have to understand what a good temperature is for your graphics card and depending on what it is and depending on the cooling that's on it that's gonna be different so maybe just looking up like what is a safe temperature for my graphics card or just understanding anything once you get past 80 or 90 Celsius is probably too hot okay so let's just get into now what the most important factors are so a lot of people think that when you overclock you have to throw this core clock all the way up just as high as it can possibly go that is completely false so the core clock is the one that I'm using right now which is orange all you really have to do is just put it up maybe two three percent you don't need to put it up a lot the thing that we we're gonna have to change here is the memory clock this is what the really makes a big difference for our graphics card so we have our core clock we can just click apply there to set that and now we can start adjusting the memory clock so this is where you're gonna have to take it kind of slower and you're gonna have to keep testing and just seeing what is a good temperature because right now I'm idle and I'm running at 63 degrees after pumping my core clock up so you can see that it's running very hot so now we move to the memory clock and I'm just gonna start and we're just gonna move it up maybe 50 at a time so I'll go to 2050 megahertz and then I would test that I would see how the temperatures doing and then I would move you move it up again so maybe I'll go to 21 10 is that looking good that looks okay and then we move it up and so on and so forth now you'll notice every time you adjust this bar your temperature should get warmer if you're clicking apply afterwards so in order to counteract this temperature we want to change these target numbers so you see where it says automatic here we're just gonna click on that to set it to manual and we're gonna lower our target down to 75 see on this card so separately on your card it'll be different and then we're gonna our sorry our max to 75 in our target to 60 so actually I want to move this back up to 80 because 75 is a little low for my card and then we'll target at 70 so by doing that now it's gonna try to keep the card a lot cooler which in result is gonna mean they're gonna have a lot louder fan noises um but that's okay because you do want the max perform to your card so now I'm gonna mess around with the fan settings so you can leave it on automatic if you want but on my specific card the automatic settings keep my card really running really hot so I want to bump this up maybe about two times what it is right now just to make sure that it's gonna stay nice and cool so I bump those two numbers up now and then I'm just going to go ahead and click apply now you might actually be able to hear my fan revving up on my GPU right now because that's exactly what it's doing as I've put the minimum fan speed to 2,000 it's gonna continue to climb higher as it needs to so yeah now obviously this is gonna vary depending on what graphics card you have and what year it is what drivers you're running all these things are important factors just realize that you want to make sure that when you're overclocking you get the max performance with the lowest temperature so you want to keep your temperature at a safe degree if you're running an rx 480 like me a safe temperature for that is anything under 90 degrees if you're going above 90 you're really kind of pushing the limit um and you're gonna want to readjust your clocks or readjust your fan speed to make sure it doesn't go that high on other cards and then it's probably gonna be lower you just have to kind of look online and see what a good safe speed for your GPU is so yeah and then if you go up here you can monitor your activity here you can see your peak you can see your average and all your clocks what they're running at and yeah that's pretty much it on how to overclock your graphics card it's really not that difficult a lot of people make it out to be a huge deal obviously I could probably push this clock more I can move the frequency up you just play around with it and just make sure you're keeping an eye on this temperature that's the most important part as long as this temperature is safe you're safe and just remember too that these utilities are actually made by the people that design the graphics cards so obviously they're safe to be using with your graphics card and yeah that's it
