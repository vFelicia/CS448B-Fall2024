now an algorithm is really just a set of steps or a procedure that you need to follow to solve a problem an algorithm is not only applicable in the context of coding you could write an algorithm to follow to solve a mathematical problem you could write an algorithm to follow to upload a video to YouTube you can write all kinds of different types of algorithms and usually people refer to them in the coding context but I just want to clarify that algorithm is a general word it's not just for code
