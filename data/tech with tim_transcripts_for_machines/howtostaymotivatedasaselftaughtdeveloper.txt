how do you stay motivated as a selftaught developer well the number one thing that worked for me when I was learning how to code was creating an actual plan having an idea of the topics that I wanted to learn and then checking those topics off as I got through them I know this seems really basic but spending maybe one day or a few hours kind of creating a whole curriculum or list of topics that you want to go through and then every single day that you complete one checking it off that list seems trivial but when you go back to this two weeks three weeks four weeks later and you can see all of the things that you've accomplished it really allows you to conceptualize how much you're learning and how far you're actually moving in your journey beyond that make sure you give yourself reasonable time periods to take a break apply some of your knowledge and work on projects that maybe aren't on your roadmap maybe at week four you're gonna do some cool AI project week five you're gonna do a game that you always wanted to work on allow yourself to have these kind of mini breaks and mini celebrations where you can do things that maybe aren't the most productive that are helping you stay excited and passionate about programming
