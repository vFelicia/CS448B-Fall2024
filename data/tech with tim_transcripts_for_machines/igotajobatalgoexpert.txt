hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so i'm not going to make you wait for 5 10 whatever minutes into the video i will tell you right now the news is true this is not just a click bait title i am indeed working for algo expert now i'll get into all of the details about that and what i'm doing for algo expert and kind of some important announcements and big releases that are going to be happening on that platform but i want to tell you about what this video is really going to be about in this video i'm going to talk to you about what my life is like and what i actually do on a daytoday basis because a lot of you just see this youtube channel you just see all the hard work i put into these videos but i also am a fulltime student currently i'm going to be working for algo expert which is a pretty fulltime job there's a lot of stuff that i need to do of course i run this youtube channel and all of the business stuff related to that and then i do a few other things as well that i want to mention in this video so anyways sit back relax and i'm going to give you kind of an inside scoop into my life and talk about what i've been doing for the past year and kind of what my plans are for this channel and going forward over the next few so i'm not going to make you guys wait to hear the exciting news or what the title of this video is about tech with tim is officially partnering with algo expert now what i mean by partnering is we're actually going to be working together in some different capacities we'll talk to you about both of them but the first thing that i'm going to be doing is i'm actually going to be working for algo expert as an algorithms instructor now if you're not sure what algo expert is let me just give you kind of a quick brief of it so you understand the context here algo expert is a coding interview prep platform that is designed for people that want to become software engineers or pass their technical coding interviews to be able to do so this is the platform that i use to actually prepare for my microsoft interviews as well as my shopify interviews and a few others and while it is genuinely the reason that i was able to get a job at some of these big tech companies especially at 19 which is a lot younger than most of the other interns that were coming in the main selling points for me of the platform at least the reason why i used it when i was preparing for my interviews is that it has really high quality coding interview questions so practice questions that you can do it has a full online ide you can run your code against test cases and you can also see full video explanations for every single question now yes you can go and find coding interview questions anywhere on the internet but the reason why i'm going to be working for algo expert and why i'm happy to promote them and i actually use them myself is because their video explanations are super valuable there's a conceptual overview for every single question that explains to you how to approach the problem kind of the different solutions and avenues that you could go down and how to explain that to your interviewer and then there is a code walk through at the end that actually shows you how to transcribe this kind of theoretical solution into real code that actually passes those test cases so that's pretty much what algo expert is and what i'm going to be doing again to repeat is actually creating unique coding interview questions so as of now there should be a hundred and ten questions on the algo expert platform if you're watching this video right when it goes live and five of those questions are ones that i have come up with or that i have created so i am the one doing the video explanation i'm the one who wrote the prompt and came up with the solution and well that's what i'm going to be doing for the platform now another thing to mention here is that two of the main people that i'm going to be working with both have youtube channels and you probably know who both of them are the first one is clement he has his own youtube channel that really just talks about algo expert all the time and his entrepreneurial kind of career in software engineering and all of that he is the cofounder of this platform and also happens to be a good friend of mine that i met uh probably about a year ago from this point in time and then another person that i'm going to be working with his name is nick white you guys might know him he's on youtube as well and he is the other algorithms instructor that was recently brought on by algo expert so they both have awesome youtube channels i will leave the links down below but you would have seen clement on my channel i've done a bunch of collaborations with him and we've just really been good friends and talked a lot since we met about a year ago and did our first collaboration video two of them were on this channel and then we did one on clemence channel which was actually a mock google coding interview which you can find kind of a reaction version of on this channel as well so that is the first way in which i am working with algo expert and with clement again really excited about this and the next way that i'm going to be working with algoexpert is that they are actually going to be a main sponsor of this youtube channel now you may have already noticed this and you may have already seen in some of my videos that algo expert was the sponsor but from now going forward they are planning on sponsoring a bunch of videos and specifically the tutorial ones and i just want to be really transparent with you guys on this because i am working for the company and of course they are a sponsor and for me this is a really good synergy this works really well and i'm super happy to promote algo expert because as i've said many times genuinely it's a great platform i wouldn't be working for it or allowing it to be sponsoring this video if i didn't think so and i just think this is going to work out really well and i'm really excited about kind of these advancements and what's happening with this channel and what i'm going to be able to do in terms of making questions on the platform now full disclaimer algo expert is also the sponsor of this video right now which means i need to tell you to go to the description and check out the link to algo expert you can use the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform hopefully i've given you enough of a sales pitch by me explaining what the platform is and what i'm gonna be doing for it but at minimum i'm gonna be working there so you know there's gonna be some high quality coding explanations and coding questions on the platform anyways that is kind of the first piece of big news that i wanted to share with you that i'm teaming up with algo expert they're going to be sponsoring a bunch of videos on this channel and i'll be working alongside clement and nick and making coding questions on the platform you'll be seeing regular releases of those questions kind of throughout the months as i finish them and as different batches of them are uploaded so i do apologize that was a long section but my honest intentions are just to be as open and transparent with you guys as possible i want you to know what i'm up to i want you to know why there's algo expert sponsored videos and you're seeing me on the platform well i'd rather give you more information and take more time in the video than give you less and have you guys asking questions and wondering about my intentions and all those different things genuinely i think this is going to be a really positive development for the channel and just for myself personally and i hope you guys are as excited about it or excited for me as i am now with that said let's talk about this channel because i'm sure you guys care more about that so this channel is not going anywhere the uploads are not going to be any less frequent and if anything there's going to be even more effort put into the videos here i hope you guys have realized that at this point i'm investing a significant amount of money into this channel i'll be transparent that this is a business it does generate a good amount of revenue and that's why i'm able to kind of justify the time commitment that i put into it but i also am reinvesting constantly and i'm trying to make my youtube videos genuinely be the best tutorial videos on the planet that is my goal and that might seem ambitious but without a goal that high there's no way that i'm going to get better and improve my videos beyond the current quality that they're at so hopefully you've noticed i've hired out a full editing team they're doing my thumbnails they're doing my videos just small things i've added just like some a little bit better branding i changed my logo that was a while ago but still and i added end screens introductions i'm doing all kinds of new tutorial series that i never really would have imagined doing like this full react web app and i really do see this channel going quite far i don't plan on stopping it anytime in the foreseeable future and if you guys are here just know that there's gonna be lots more videos and i'm listening to you i'm reading pretty much all of your comments and i'm trying my best to accommodate and change my content around what you guys want to see now at this point in time this channel is pretty big we're almost at half a million subscribers that's got to be one of the larger tech channels in the space and i just want to say a big thank you to all of you guys you have made this possible you've made me at 20 years old be able to be successful on my own doing this stuff and genuinely wake up every single morning with a smile on my face because i get to do something that i like and something that helps genuinely millions of people learn how to code it's just a great opportunity and thank you guys so much i'm not going to let you down this channel is going to continue to grow into the millions of subscribers and i have big plans and a lot of things that i want to do now that leads me into some exciting kind of advancements and things that are going on first of all if you're not in my discord server you seriously need to join that that is where a lot of kind of say the die hard fans are quote unquote and a lot of events and things are going on like giveaways we have code jams we have coding competitions and we're planning on actually developing a minecraft server that's going to have all custom plugins and a bunch of really cool stuff all of that stuff is happening in the discord server so just to give you kind of some concrete things that are coming up in the future as of january this year i'm actually going to be taking a fourmonth break from school now i feel like this is pretty obvious why i'm doing this i have a lot of other things that i'm gonna do and there's actually never been a point in my life where i haven't been doing something else full time and having youtube on the side believe it or not youtube has always been a second priority it's always been something that's been quote unquote a side hustle even when i was younger i was working fulltime jobs in the summer and making the youtube channel i've been a fulltime student doing the youtube channel i worked at microsoft in the summer doing the youtube channel never once have i had time to just focus on this and now with the addition of the algo expert work i decided taking four months off isn't a bad idea and it's going to let me really build a strong infrastructure and just get this channel ready to go and ready to grow to the numbers that i want it to be at so anyways some things that are coming up we're going to have a big tech with tim minecraft server now i'm really excited about this i may actually potentially start a game with tim channel just something fun where i kind of do live streams and actually play on the minecraft server some of you guys have been asking me about my podcast i would really like to start that up and expect in the future that's going to be a more fulltime thing right now i just have so many other things in my life that i can't justify the time to do that but that is something that i'm thinking about i'm hearing you guys and i really want to start the podcast channel up again other than that i have a bunch of really cool series coming out i've started to work with javascript you've seen this recent one with react and django and whatever you guys are asking me to do chances are i'm probably going to do it so leave a comment with what you want to see but i have big plans for this channel big plans for a bunch of other things that i want to do and all i'm saying is don't expect me to go anywhere even though i'm working for algo expert this channel will always be a huge part of my life and while i'm so happy that i'm able to run this and again just a genuine massive thank you to all of you now i want to leave you guys with one last thing before i end this video and i just want to talk to you about how i've really been able to accomplish all of this now i don't want to come across as cocky or arrogant or anything like that just realistically i've done a lot at 20 years old and a lot of people ask me how do you do this how do you find the time for this and all i'm gonna say is that it all comes down to mindset i am not some bill gates or mark zuckerberg whatever you guys might call me i genuinely promise you that i'm a pretty normal dude and if you met me in real life you probably wouldn't assume that i do all this kind of stuff but the reason i've been able to accomplish it is because of the mindset that i adopt which is getting better every single day go watch my first videos go look at the stuff i did even one year ago and you will notice a dramatic difference i do not aim for perfection i just aim to beat myself and get better every single day i don't care about the other coding channels i don't care about what other people are doing i care about what i'm doing and doing a better job than i did yesterday and that's how i've been able to grow this youtube channel and have the success that i've had at 20 years old so i hope that doesn't come across the wrong way it's just genuinely something i wanted to share with you and if you can adopt a similar mindset to that and just be committed to getting better and doing more every day then you'll have no problem surpassing everything that i've even been able to do so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video it gave you a little bit of insight maybe even some motivation with that said i hope to see you again in another youtube video you
