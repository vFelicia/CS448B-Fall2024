hello everybody and welcome to the third tech with tim code jam project showcase so in this video i've got five awesome programming projects to show you these are projects that were worked on by the community so subscribers of this channel and people that are part of my discord server and i'm just going to give you some context here about what this competition is and kind of how this works so you can join it if you would like to but if you don't care about that you just want to see the projects there will be some timestamps in the description so go ahead and fast forward to that so every two months i run a coding competition in my discord server this discord server has about 22 000 members we do a ton of other stuff in there as well so we have help channels we have weekly coding challenges and we just do all kinds of other great community things and in the future we're thinking about running stuff like minecraft servers and just other you know great ways to kind of bring the community together around programming and whatever else it is that we're doing so every two months i run this coding competition and pretty much anyone can sign up to participate in this we pick a theme so the coding competition is kind of called a timithon this is you know kind of emulating a hackathon but since it's for techwithsam we're calling it a timithon and this month's or this two months i guess theme was a virtual assistant so this coding competition started january 1st of 2021 participants had a week to find a team and sign up and then they had a month to actually work on a project submit their projects and then there was i believe about a week of community voting so if i go here to the submissions you can see we have all of the teams that actually submitted a project so a ton of people are participating in this which is awesome and then the community goes and votes on their favorite projects and the top five projects projects that receive the most amount of votes get reviewed in a video so like this and then i will pick the top three winning teams and then send them their cash prizes so that's kind of the idea behind this coding competition if you want to participate make sure you join the discord server all of this stuff is ran through discord there'll be a link in the description you can also come to this website right here to check out all of the other projects that i don't show uh you will have to sign in with discord and the link for this website is twt codejam.net again this will be linked in the description you can go to timothon and you can go to view submissions and you can see all the submissions assuming that we have not yet closed this when the video goes live so anyways that is kind of the idea here i've got five projects to show you so let me exit out of this and then i'll go through the projects and then we'll talk about the winners afterwards all right so i've got the first project up in front of me you know i just want to give you some information here before i go through all of this first of all i want to talk to you about how i'm kind of grading these projects or picking who wins now first of all i will say there's a lot of bias in how i'm picking the winner a lot of you guys are kind of upset sometimes and who i decide to pick i'll be brutally honest with you the project that i like the best and kind of ticks my three pieces of criteria which i'll discuss in a second is just the one that i'm going to pick so those three pieces of criteria are how well does the project fit the theme so is this something that is you know right on par with what the theme is in this case it was virtual assistant so pretty easy to fit that theme my next piece of criteria that i'm looking at here is how polished is this project so is this rush does this not look very good does it feel like there's lots of bugs and this is kind of a last minute thing or is this super polished super well done you know everything is thought of and there was a lot of effort put into this project then lastly the thing that i'm looking at is how complicated or difficult is it to make what it is that you have for your project if this is something super simple i may not uh you know like it as much as something that's super complicated and took a lot of hard work to do so anyways those are the three pieces of criteria i'm kind of looking at when i'm you know viewing these projects and anyways let me start going through them so i'm going to start by showing you the project with most votes first and then i will show you second most third most fourth fifth so on uh so we have this first one here which is called nc all of these github repositories i will link in the description and it says researching and creating projects is tedious nc is a virtual assistant developed with the concept of automating research and organizing projects and assignment all right so this is a website really nice read me just small things like this you know make a really good first impression when you're looking at a project we can see this is by team coffee and these are the four contributors here awesome so let me go to the website we're gonna go in full screen mode here and let me start giving you my thoughts now full disclosure i have looked at all of these projects before just to make sure they work and are appropriate before i put them in the video not that any of them have been inappropriate but anyways let's go through this so we have nc the virtual assistant you need summarize narrate personalize get things done with nc nice so there is a video here i'm not going to watch this video but that's a nice touch let's go back to this page here there is a get started so i believe that will bring us and then there's just a nice landing page here so make your projects well managed summarize text or web articles with just a click i'm not going to read through all of this but generally just getting the feel that this looks really professional if you had just sent me this website and didn't tell me this was you know some hobbyist programmer that was in my discord server i would have thought this was just a professional website maybe a startup or something like that looks really great really clean and just really liking how it looks so far anyways let's go to get started so when i go to get start it's going to bring me to my account i've actually already signed in here but you can sign in with google and you can sign in with other services as well which i thought was a really nice touch because i love just that kind of one click sign in you can see i've created two projects here i can create another project let's name this project um what do i want to go with here let's just go with coding okay and let nc provide you with ai generated tips awesome story creating project failed try disabling ai tips feature okay so let's disable that and see if this works and boom okay so it actually did work now we can see there is a little chat bot in the bottom right hand corner here hey hey there it's me nc i found these cool articles thought you might find them useful science science computer science science fiction oh that's interesting so it's kind of like an ai recommending me stuff let's go here computer science this is from wikipedia nice nice that is a cool touch let's go back in here looks like there's some activities that are part of my project that i can say cross off or delete i can also add an activity let's just go with hello even has a little auto saving thing up here just small features like that i really appreciate like the ui is really clean it just seems really intuitive let's add some blocks so let's just go with coding we can add a paragraph block coding is great looks like i can add an image or some text things nice nice okay i can also export this let's see what happens when i press export oh wow okay so i can export this as a text document that's really interesting nice let's see what else we can do here let's chat with the bot hi glad to see you back dude nice that's awesome um what else should i ask this let's see when was coding started i know that doesn't really make much sense i did not receive a response can you try again what is my name uh hey i'm nc okay makes sense all right so let's close that looks like i can summarize text and articles summarize stuff here okay nc is an artificial intelligence based on transformers which is wide leaves oh that's how it works all right nc is a powerful text summarizer which gives you a summary of text or a web page it also gives you suggestions from wikipedia articles and important keywords okay that's interesting so let's summarize this computer science article right here so url article let's summarize that and let's see what we get all right so it looks like the summary came up it looks like it has some keywords here from the article i mean these seem to make sense uh computer science i won't read through all of that but it does look like that this makes sense in his properly formed sentences then it has some other articles to look at glossary of computer science uh does that open up a new page now it's loading i'll wait for that to load oh awesome and it brings me to this page right here okay so really cool i think that's all to look at for this project i might be missing something but it looks like i can do stuff like delete projects yeah i'm going to delete that one right here and everything just seems to be functioning this seems really polished just a lot of these small touches even just small things like the date here the ui the fact that there's you know highlights on the buttons this little online button it just looks really clean it looks really professional and i'm really impressed by this project and specifically the ui and kind of design of this so good job guys this is really impressive pat yourself on the back now let's move on to project number two all right so the next project that i have is called pro box the toolbox for programmers same thing here really nice and simple looking readme first thing i look at when i look at these projects just to read me right and so having a nice readme is already just a great addition nice little image here that they created uh shows me i guess yeah code jam timothon that's cool platform web browser repo size nice nice and this is a website as well so this is by who does it say the contributors are um i can't find all of the contributors in here uh does it say the team that did this uh maybe on the side ah here they are okay so we have these three guys i've seen snowball and fireplank before excuse me if i haven't seen you before but these two definitely participate in some other code gyms awesome so let's go to pro box this is the website right here let's make this full screen zoom in a little bit it looks like there's just a bunch of tools that we can use so code compiler let's try this out oh this is really cool okay this kind of reminds me of like the leak code interface almost um the way that it looks i can change my editor oh let's go with that this is my favorite uh font this is a python template let's say print hello run let's see who we get and hello okay awesome i have no idea how they did this by the way i'm super impressed i can write in c plus plus two um compiling nice ruby lua node.js wow awesome i can remove the cache damn super impressive that's just one of the tools they have a code shortener okay i'm not actually going to use this but i can see that it just shortens the code like this which is really interesting um changes all the variable names and everything wow that's impressive as well uh dictionary let's search something let's search for tim okay clearly there's no definition for tim let's go with like book oh wow okay nice code awesome let's try out the calculator 85 times 96 okay let's go yeah mod or divide or percent whatever it is okay 81.6 nice can get out of that stack overflow uh how to reverse a linked list let's see what we get here create a new links list reverse linked list python load more damn okay this is really cool i'm not gonna click on these i trust that these links do work um yeah it looks like this is a link okay awesome um voice recorder we can try this uh notice this might not work but another app is using the current webcam wait is this video or voice recorder which one do i pre oh video recorder sorry um yeah so my webcam is obviously being used right now so i can't test this out uh but i did look at that previously and it was actually working uh voice recorder this will this work if my mic is being used by something else hopefully uh we're doing a test recording here i want to see if this works okay let's play this okay so i think that is working my speaker's actually off but you guys probably should have heard it through obs so i'm going to trust that works i did test that before and it was working uh regex templates this one is actually really cool i really love that they have these because these are super useful and like you're always looking this kind of stuff up uh so json ipv4 visa card csv mastercard nice nice okay um github so i believe this is oh it just brings you the github for this project okay that makes sense let's go back here to pro box they have a whiteboard uh let's do some drawing here okay so i can't change the color or anything but i mean that makes sense let's reset that awesome there is an ascii chart this is really useful too i can look for all of the characters and see what their ascii code is nice they have a todo list i watch some attack with tim videos i like how that's already ticked off bonus points for that uh add oops add this item okay let's add that seems to be working very nice we can reset that i love how the default is these two that's funny and yeah it looks like that is the entire project oh there's also a home page okay this is a really nice looking homepage i didn't even see this before try the tools you are a programmer some kind of nice motion again the design has just really been blowing me away from these projects that you guys have done this is really impressive we've got a contact page yeah same thing here just some nice animation and movement i can change the background color okay so that goes to green we can change this back to white wow really impressive so that is project number two uh kind of my same thoughts as project one i'm just really blown away by the design and what you guys have done on the front here just looks really professional and really nice um the tools i mean some of these are pretty useful i'm not gonna lie a lot of them are kind of just thrown in here i think just to add some more tools but definitely interesting the code shortener and code compiler i'm really interested by i don't know how you guys did that so that's super impressive uh ascii chart was a nice addition regex templates same thing awesome so now let's move on to the third project all right so the next project i have here is called kryptent uh is that how you pronounce that i have no idea if that's how you say it there's a really long readme here that goes through a ton of stuff i'm not going to go through this but pretty much this is a cryptocurrency like information site or something like that i haven't looked at it a ton i'm trying to find who this is by but i don't see any contributors let's go to the insights and see if we can find this uh contributors looks like we have one guys tech guy 940 31 000 lines of code wow this looks like a pretty awesome project damn you can kind of see the contributing graph okay sweet so let's go to cry uh krypton tier i'm probably going to keep pronouncing it wrong i'm going to say get candlestick graph for any cryptocurrency oh yeah it just says the same thing get started know more about candlesticks go about let's see this wow okay this is a really professional looking website damn get in touch facebook youtube twitter instagram um again super blown away by this it just looks great i'm i don't know how to make something that looks like this services ai advice let's see here um wow okay you can get it but i don't know if this is real or not if he's actually if he actually does this but this is really cool you can submit a prediction um for different coins nice um cryptant ai advice uh cryptocurrency news let's see what's here latest news wow god damn okay this is really cool this just looks like a professional website candlestick graph let's try this one out okay so let's do this was what was on the homepage let's try this uh time interval one minute let's go with one day and yeah sure let's get the graph of bitcoin and wow okay it generates a candlestick graph i wonder what is being used to do this but that's really interesting shows me the highs and the lows this is super speedy and snappy let's do litecoin one of my favorite coins let's see what this one is awesome can i change this oh i can save this too wow and let's see what else they have api okay so this shows you the actual api that i don't know if this guy designed or that just exists that he's using but that's really interesting it's on postman uh let's go back here to this website uh so the thing that i don't like here though is that this is opening like different web pages for every single thing that's my only critique so far i just i don't like when uh websites do that let's go to the contact okay it just brings us to the bottom of whatever this page was and i think that's all i have to go through for this website i do apologize guys if i'm missing stuff i'm just kind of trying to get a quick look at this i can't go through every single possible feature but this one is super impressive it's also very timely with all the cryptocurrency stuff going on right now and yeah as i'm saying with all these projects like if you just showed this to me and you didn't tell me that you know this was some hobbyist program working on this that was a part of my discord server i would genuinely just think this was another professional website i wouldn't question it looks great everything seems to be working and again awesome job on this project especially because it was just one person who did this so now let's move on to project four all right so in front of me here i've got project four this one is called violet i'll just read the description here so violet provides you with five core features a news feed with selectable categories a text editor with the added functionality of text to speech an online recipe browser quick access to common social media sites and a todo list awesome so to access this this is a website let me close all of these uh these website links here okay let's go to this and let's scroll down so we have a todo list latest news stay connected texttospeech view recipes and more features coming soon let's get started here okay it's going to take a second to load all right so i have to create an account so let's do this let's just make this tech with tim let's see if it will allow my extremely weak password and it looks like it does okay so no little message telling me that i actually create an account first critique there on kind of the ui side let's log into this and okay wow here we are so this is the website let's go full screen mode so we can go to youtube google reddit instagram all of the other logos that i'm sure you guys know um blaze with the fire that is never extinguished oh interesting okay create a list enter time enter task let's just go with film this video okay do i need to enter a time um what do i have to do for this say like february 25th or something uh oh okay perfect so it does actually work february 25th film this video uh news let's see what news is giving me okay this is interesting so whatever is going on here just showing me a bunch of news can i change the categories oh yes i can't let's go to technology news i don't really care about the world news right now one thing that i am noticing is this website is quite slow i'm not going to dock anything for that because this just hosts on heroku um the images are also pretty stretched but that's fine looks like i can click on these if i want but that's cool showing me a bunch of different news articles text to speech whoa okay so i can i guess write like an entire thing here let's go hello let's change this text to be bold bold do i have to highlight it and press bold or something okay so i don't know maybe bold's just not working or maybe i'm just an idiot and i don't know how this works um let's go with italic again do i have to highlight this for the maybe these buttons just don't work i'm not sure if i'm doing this incorrectly or something but a lot of these buttons just don't seem to do anything okay the underline work just the italic and the bold doesn't seem to do anything that's fine can i align this in the center okay so that does work i have a what is this a ruler or something i can add notes awesome oh i can also export that and then there's the text speech thing nice recipes let's search for a recipe when they say recipe i'm not really sure what they mean are they talking about like food recipes uh let's just go with a recipe for pizza see how to make pizza dough okay so i guess it is uh food recipes so uh you know a little bit offset here but totally fine this oh internal server error okay interesting i believe that's just a heroku issue again i'm not gonna you know dock any marks or whatever because this is uh host on heroku um serves unknown cook 30 to 60 minutes serves two cook 10 to 30 minutes okay it's interesting that they're able to actually find this information i'm not sure what they're pulling this from i have my account and yeah i think that's pretty much all for this let's go to google this just bring me it just brings me to google okay interesting all right so i guess that is the violet project now my thoughts on this one first of all i will just say this is obviously not as polished as some of the other projects doesn't mean this is not still a great project just kind of hard to uh you know compete with all of those other ones i also don't know how many people worked on this other kind of piece of critique here that i will say is that these categories don't really make much sense to me in terms of how they go together they seem very distinct and different so like news texttospeech recipes it's fine there's no rule that says they have to go together i'm just a little bit confused why these ones were picked i like the fact that we have the quotes here i like that there's lots of different features and that for the most part they're all working with the exception of a few buttons um seems like everything is just functioning as it should be and well i mean this is a cool project it's not really much more for me to say so with that said let's move on to project five all right so in front of me i've got project five this one is by the champions clan team i believe and this is called robert virtual assistant so robert your own virtual assistant with a beautiful text and speech based interface you can see that they have some nice gifs and stuff here i appreciate the effort put into this readme and kind of all the styling and the emojis and everything you've got um so apparently the way that this works is it's a background application that sits in your system tray and then you can activate it with uh like hotkeys like shift plus seven shift plus six now i did read this entire readme i read all of the readmes before i actually went ahead and worked on the project so i will run this code but i will mention just right now that the actual voice assistant part of this project at least on my computer is not working it works once and then doesn't really do anything after that so i will just say that i tried very hard to get this to work i appreciate the effort you guys put into this and i spent about 20 or 30 minutes trying to figure this out i couldn't figure it out and so i don't know what to tell you but i'm only going to be able to review one part of your project so anyways let me run this code and then i'll be right back all right so i've got the code running right here now the idea is that there's supposed to be something in my system tray that has kind of uh this logo right here i'm supposed to be able to press shift seven or shift six on my keyboard which i'm doing right now and it's supposed to like activate a virtual assistant now it's not doing that and i don't know why you can see the keyboard shortcuts are here i can change the the mode of this application okay that's interesting let's leave it at dark mode and they have code snippets so i believe what i can do here is i can save code snippets so i can have like a file i guess that's located somewhere and then this will just organize them all for me so let's try this uh let's find a code snippet here let's just snip it one of their codes well we can snip it main dot pi uh type name of your code let's just go with python okay and there you go so now i can save the snippet and i guess i don't know what happens when i press on this doesn't seem like anything maybe i'm doing this incorrectly anyways i guess you can save code snippets you can sort them by language or by alphabet i can search for snippets nice i have translations let's go hello world and let's translate okay bonjour le monde i don't speak french very well obviously nice looks like that's working uh task manager you can see i added this one in previously uh tim is great obviously that's going to be there i can edit a task let's change the name to be hello testing priority okay there's five priority levels that's nice i guess it's going to show me the highest priority for first in fact we can test that let's change this to five uh oops tim tim is great okay save uh and yes okay so that did actually update i can add another task go test and add that one in i guess i have to add a description as well so let's add that okay nice so i can tick them off true true okay so i guess they forgot to remove the debugging there that's fine and then what else is there here there is a reminder so it looks like i can set some types of alarms so i can turn that on uh in one hour i guess that will send an alarm i don't know how that alarm is going to work but i guess that will function like that okay nice and i guess that's all for this project now uh there's the settings okay so first of all nice project i i really do apologize that i can't get the texttospeech to work i imagine that that's really the core part of this application again i did try to run this i even tried just running the file and it works but it doesn't give me any output so i'm not going to show it in this video there's no point in doing that i do apologize but that's all i have to say so interesting project obviously not super polished the ui i feel like could use a little bit of work just to make it a bit more intuitive i don't really understand um how some of these things work and you know why they work the way they do maybe it's explained in the readme but it's definitely not super intuitive but other than that interesting project again i'm sure the texttospeech was really the core of this so i apologize with that said let's talk about the winners of this code jam i'm going to showcase kind of the top three winning projects so just announce the top three winning teams right now all right so now i will announce the three winning team so third second and first place but before i do that a massive thank you to everyone who participated also a huge thank you to my discord staff team which makes this possible i just really don't have enough time to manage all of this stuff and without the staff team that are all strictly volunteers i wouldn't be able to do this so a massive thank you to them and yeah everyone who you know submitted a project so i'm going to go through the three winning teams and i will also just mention that if i did not pick you as a winner you thought i was harsh on your project or didn't see everything i do apologize this is really just meant to be fun yes there is prize money but it's very small and the reason i do this is you know not just to praise people in a youtube video but to give you guys an excuse to work on a project to get out there you know actually code something out work with other people and have something that you can add to your resume and something that's just you know fun to do right so anyways i hope you guys appreciate that but the third place team here is fast so pro box i am giving you guys third place just as a reminder this is the pro box website i thought this was a really great website i really appreciated the code compiler and the code shortener and i just thought this worked great as a virtual assistant definitely fit the theme definitely was polished and yeah it's just really a great project so awesome work um that's really all i can say about it all right and the second place team is team coffee the team that made nc now this project this is one right here i will bring it up this looks awesome really great work on the design i have very little criticism for this uh the dashboard is awesome the landing page is awesome and really the entire project itself is just a great project that really blows me away so anything that i'm about to say now that is criticism please just take it very lightly because genuinely this is super impressive when i first saw it i was blown away so the only thing i'll say about this project and the reason why i didn't get first place was because i thought the design was awesome i thought there was a lot of focus on that but i just thought that the features or what this actually does was fairly underwhelming i think the online assistant is interesting but i don't really know what i'm supposed to ask the online assistant um the actual you know kind of project template here is nice there's some blocks but again i don't feel this has a ton of actual real world function or use i couldn't really see myself going in and using this project maybe some of you guys can but that's personally just me so that is why i came second place but great job really um you guys did an awesome work on this project so congratulations and now i'm going to announce the first place team which is jff which is actually a team of one person who made kryptent now again this could be my bias because i do definitely love cryptocurrency but i just thought that this website out of all of the projects that i saw was the most professional it seemed the most polished and it has so many different things that you can do i actually didn't even go through everything when i was um you know kind of navigating this website but it has the current price of coins so i can actually you know uh submit or look for the price of say bitcoin i can look at the gainers and losers there's actually an api that i'm pretty certain this guy wrote although that's not really a factor in my decision i know the gainers and losers now i just thought this was really professionally done it just looks like a website that really you know could have been made by a professional software engineer so that is why it is getting first place congratulations to that team let's go back here to jff so congratulations to jff i believe this is just for fun is the one who made this again 31 000 lines of code you definitely put a lot of effort into this i can appreciate that and well your hard work has paid off and definitely showed itself so with that said i hope you guys enjoyed this video again this is all for fun please don't take this too seriously i would love to see more of you guys participating in the coding competitions so join the discord server from the link in the description and with that said i will see you in another youtube video
