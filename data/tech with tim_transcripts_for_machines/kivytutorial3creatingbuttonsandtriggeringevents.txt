hey guys and welcome to the third Cavey tutorial so in today's video what we're gonna be doing is talking about how we can add a button into our layout how we can add some functionality for that button so like when you click the button maybe it gets the name and the last name and the email maybe it checks the emails valid we'll be messing around with some of that stuff and then in the next video what we're gonna be doing is talking about the kibbeh language so making daunt kv files so that we can kind of simplify all of this creation of widgets and all this which is not necessary but it makes our life a lot easier when we can figure out how to do that so essentially let's get started with adding this button so the way we can do that is I simply just be at an import button first of all so say Kitty dot u IX dot button import button and if and if you guys are curious about a lot of think the parameters for example like this is not the only text input parameter you can go on the kibbeh documentation which i'll leave in the description and on my website tech with tim dunn net and it will show you all the different parameters and things you can mess around with for example a label you could change the font size you can change the color there's a lot of other stuff which i will be talking about in future videos but for now if you're curious and the next video is not out you can look at that okay so what we're gonna do here to add a button okay so a button is pretty straightforward I'm gonna say self dot let say submits standing for that button is gonna be equal to a button and then on our button we're gonna do is gonna say text equals and then we'll just say submit and what I'm going to do is I'm actually gonna change the font size as well so font size equals let's play with 40 and see if that's too big or not okay so it's created a button now when we click this button or actually first we can add it to the window and I'll show you what it looks like then we can talk about some challenges you might have so self dot add widget' self thought submit let's just run this quickly and I've just changed this column back to two as opposed to three or six or whatever it was before you can see we get this submit button but when I click it nothing's really happening now it's great that it kind of fills this whole square but maybe we want it to be in the middle so how would we go about adding this to the middle so let's do that first I sort to add this to the middle is actually a bit more complex than you might think now in other kind of GUIs you can do something called column span which means I could say that this spans two columns and it would be the entire bottom now the issue with that here is that we can't do that so what we actually need to do if we want it to be centered is we need to do something that's a bit more complex now what that is is we need to create another grid layout inside of this grid layout and then add it to the other grid layout so essentially it's kind of hard to explain or do a little drawing here quickly let's delete all that so if we have like this and this is our main grid layout right and maybe we have one column in two rows so it looks something like this okay one column two rows now what we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to add another grid layout that goes in here that would be it like let's say for example two rows and two columns so maybe we do something like this and to this so now this is a grid layout inside of this other grid layout and then we can just add our button down here which will span the entire bottom like that so we're gonna have a layout inside of another layout and it's actually good to show you because you're gonna have to do this quite a bit okay so let's clear that and let's actually worry about how we would do that so essentially since we want this button to span the whole bottom it's gonna be in the main grid layout and then all this stuff that we've already created has to be in the other layout so let's start by actually just creating another layout so we're gonna say self dot inside and this is gonna be equal to grid layout cuz it's gonna be a new grid layout right okay and what we're gonna do is now we're gonna say self dot inside dot calls equals to okay and now what all we're gonna do is just replace all of these add widgets so we're gonna do self thought inside add widget and then what we're gonna do is we're going to add at the very end all of these are this entire grid layout into the main grid layout and you'll see what I mean in a second so self up inside dot add widgets wherever you see add widget you just just add this dot inside and we'll do this again got inside dot inside and this is not the most efficient way to go about things but so we're gonna do and then here we can leave this as add widget because of what we're gonna do now okay so now what we have is essentially we have a new grid layout that contains all of this ok so it contains our what do you call it our last name email first name and then the text fields that go with that now currently that is not on our main layout just when we're returning my grid here in build we wouldn't actually see this right now because all this stuff is a part of inside it's not actually a part of this class so the way we have to do that is we have to add it to this this class so to do that we'll say selfthought add widget' and when we add widget' we're gonna add this entire layout so we're gonna add inside so do that we'll say self thought inside and there's one more thing we have to do is we have to actually configure the amount of columns for our main class because now be changed self thought inside calls to be equal to two but for our main layout we're gonna need it to be equal to one right so we'll say self dot calls equals one and not out actually we don't have to do anything else with button because remember we're just gonna add button to the main layout so now if we run this it should actually be working and there we go so we have first name last name email and submit now this might be big a bit large for us and we can actually change the size and we'll do the next video you can see this is now how we can kind of add multiple layouts into one so we'll have hello we can like type some stuff like yes I'm gonna do an axe at Gmail right we can click Submit okay so now let's get into actually messing with this button and what happens when we click that submit button so what I want to do actually is I need to bind a function to the an event now when this button is pressed I want a function to be called so let's first actually create the function that's gonna be called when we press that button so I'm gonna say define pressed okay and this needs to just take one parameter instance okay and I'll talk about why we need that in a second and in here we're just gonna print press okay like that now what I need to do is I got to go back to where I created my button and I need to bind this button to this function pressed so that when we press it it calls this function so let's say self dot submit bind like this I believe that's how you do it I have to have a look here dot bind and then what we're gonna do is when I say on underscore press equals and then pressed like this okay and we're actually gonna need to do self thought press because again this is a method of our class okay so now what's sure to happen if I didn't make mistake and I may have is we're gonna have whatever we press this button it prints pressed out to the screen so let's try this and see if it's working so if I click Submit you can see that now it prints press down here in the console and I can click it as many times as I want and you can see it continues to do that so that's great but there's a few things that I want to do inside of this so I probably want to grab the text of the name the last name the email and maybe clear that text out grab its store it do something with it so let's show how we can do that so let's let's just set up a few variables here so I'm gonna say name is equal to and the way that we actually grab the text from one of our text inputs here is we just say self thought name because that's the name of our text input text and this is how we can actually access the text from whatever they typed in name right so it's name so we'll say it last just standing for last name maybe self thought last name dot text then we'll say email equals and if I spelled email correctly equals self email dot txt and that's again how we get all the text from our different text input like attributes okay so we have all those now so we can start by doing is just printing all these things out so I'll just do it actually it let's just do it like this we'll just say name and then we'll call a name like this don't know what I'm doing here name and I will do last name and we'll just display all these things so that we can see nice and easy what everything is so that would do email and email like that okay sweet so let's run this and let's try it now so if I type in my name Tim and let's say tech and then we'll do Tim at tackle with Tim net which is actually my email and I click Submit you can see it says the name is Tim the last name is tech and the email is Tim at Tech with Tim net and we have this information we can do essentially whatever we want with it right and I'll show you actually so once we print this out how we can clear these box how we can clear the text out of this boxes because usually when you click Submit you want to clear everything out so they could like rempod or do something right so the way we could do that is the exact same kind of way we're doing this so we'll just copy this here say self dot name dot text equals and then here we'll say let's just like a blank string right yeah okay I don't know why I was blanking on that but we'll do that blank string this one is gonna be a blank string as well and self dot email the text is going to be a blank string as well so let's run this and let's see if we get it to work so let's just type some in here if I click Submit you can see that it clears that and it shows me what I typed there great so now we know how to grab information how to clear things how we combine buttons how to kind of mess with different layouts so I think I'm gonna end the video here in the next video we'll do be talking about the KB language we're going to allow us to style things a lot easier and a lot nicer and then again we're gonna get some more logic stuff and yeah so be as enjoying the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe I will see you again in the next one
