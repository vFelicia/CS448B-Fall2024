hey guys and welcome back generally you do video so in today's video I'm doing a quick mic comparison so pretty much I have this mic that I'm using right now which is my blue Yeti USB microphone I just recently got it I actually got it on January 21st I believe yeah let's go here to the Amazon page yeah January 21st cost me 140 Canadian dollars and I'm really liking the sound quality of it so for ourself to tweak with some of the settings but right now I'm really liking it obviously it's a huge upgrade from from the some of the headset mics I've been using before and I just want to show you guys how much better this mic really is so an easy way that you guys can see how much better if this mic is is if you go and watch some of my older videos you'll hear the headset mic and then you can see the difference between the audio quality just from this video and those ones as well so now the other mic I'm gonna be comparing is just this basic headset mic so pretty much I have this Corsair headset I really like it as a headset great sound quality from it but the mic itself sucks so everyone that I've been like talking to on discord and stuff and just even recording with this mic you can hear it's really quiet and it just really sucks as a mic so that's why I'm saying it's probably been a tendollar mic and equivalent to that maybe I don't know you guys can tell me in the comments below how much you think this might cost but really that's not the reason I bought this I just bought it for the headset and obviously I'm pleased with how the headset is but the microphone really sucks so you guys can hear the difference between that in this video now what I'm pretty much gonna do is I'm just gonna open up audacity so I have it open down here and I'm just gonna do a few recordings using each mic so I'll have a sentence I'm gonna say I don't know for example I'll say my name is Tim on my blue Yeti mic and then on the headset mic I'll do the same and I'll play them beside each other so you guys can hear the difference in sound quality so keep watching and looking into the comparison this is a test recording on the blue Yeti USB microphone this is a test recording on the corsair RGB wireless headset microphone as you can probably tell the blue yeti microphone sounds much louder and is much clearer as you can probably tell the blue yeti microphone sound much louder Andes much clearer you may notice some background noise while listening to the blue Yeti microphone this is because this microphone is much more sensitive and is sitting on my table right now therefore it is picking up all of the sounds around it unlike the headset microphone this can be considered a good thing or a bad thing this headset microphone sits right up near my nose and near my mouth therefore it does not pick up the background sound as well it's a much less sensitive microphone and we can tell that just by the clarity of it as well because of the position of the microphone you may often hear me breathing that is because the filter on it is not very good and all of the air from my nose when I'm lightly breathing passes through like so I am currently using a pop filter on my blue Yeti microphone this pop filter cost $13 and it prevents you hearing the sound of my breathing and from hearing large pops when I say peas or bees alright so I hope that helped you guys understand the difference between the two microphones clearly the blue yeti microphone does sound better and it does sound clearer now I do want to note that although this does sound a lot better there are a lot of ways that I can make it sound a lot more clear and I can remove some of the background noise because if you noticed on this microphone it's super sensitive I have to gain all the way down right now and yet it's still picking up some of the vibrations and some of the sounds just from like my fans spinning in my computer so once I have my shockmount for that in the desk mount it's gonna sound a lot better and a lot more crisp but obviously even without that and minimal tuning you can hear how much better it sounds than the headset microphone now the main thing with the headset microphone is I'm not I'm trying to put it down or say it's a horrible microphone because really you get what you pay for right if you're paying for a headset you're not paying for an amazing microphone and it does do its job you can understand what I'm saying it all makes sense it is somewhat clear although it is very quiet and that's the biggest thing I found with this microphone so I don't really care how much it sounds if I'm just trying to chat with friends or just game but it's so quiet that the people on discord I'm talking to half turn me up all the way and I have to try to boost my mic all the way up and if you take off the little pop filter that comes with it just slides on top of the microphone then it's so loud and whenever you breathe because you can't really move the mic further away from your mouth they can hear it and it's really irritating and especially if you have your side tone on and on your mic which means that you can hear yourself speaking it's really irritating for that so anyways if you guys have any questions or anything you want to ask me down below about the two microphones or just in general leave a comment as I do respond to a lot of the comments that are left in the comment section and if this video helped you out and you guys enjoy please leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in another
