hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video I'm going to be showing you how to send emails from a Python script this is actually extremely simple it's not gonna take us very long but I'm just gonna be showing you very basic emails so just like plain text emails with a subject and a message line if you want some more advanced emails with like HTML and like making them look nice I can do that but I need you guys to let me know in the comments down below so anyways let's get started so this function you guys aren't going to need but I'm just using it to read in my email and password from a text file so that you guys can't see it but obviously on your own computer you can just type out your username and password or your email password when we get to that point I'm also importing SMTP Lib and SSL this is what we're gonna do to connect to the server so we can actually set an email so our first step is gonna be to define our username password and then who we're gonna send the email to so I'm gonna say sender is so sender password is equal to read creds now read creds simply returns to me obviously my username and the password now you guys can just type out like sender equals and then just put your gmail address here and then password is gonna be the password to that gmail account now I don't know how this works with twofactor authentication but if you're running into an issue with credentials it might be because your email accounts twofactor authenticated and you can't connect to it from here so in that case I would say maybe just create like a new email account that you want to send it from or disable the twofactor authentication at least for this example okay so now we're just gonna define receive and this will be equal to the email that you want to send it to now in my instance I'm just gonna actually send it to myself so to the sender so that I don't have to bother going into a new email account but for you guys you can literally just type any Gmail account or whatever other account you want in here and it should work as long as it's a valid address okay so our next thing is to define our message and this is what is obviously we're gonna be sending to the person so we're just gonna do a multiline string here and I'm just gonna do this to define that we're going to the next line and we're gonna do subject colon and then whatever you want the subject to be so I'm just gonna say Python email tutorial in the mainline so this is actually gonna show up as the subject line for us this and then down here will be the message content so just say this is from Python exclamation point and we'll just say check with Tim as like the little goodbye message or whatever okay so we have that so we have our sender receiver message what else do we need we need to define a variable now it's called context and what this is gonna be as SSL dot pre 8 underscore default underscore context and we're gonna use this in a second you'll see why I'll explain let me just move up here and then down here what we're gonna do is we're going to actually connect to the server and send email we're almost actually done this is super fast so we'll just say with and then SMTP dot or not dot sorry Lib SMTP SM TP my bad guys underscore SSL and then in here we're gonna put our actual email server so in this case I'm using Gmail and I assume most of you will probably be using Gmail but if you're using like hotmail you're gonna have to find where that server is to put in here but I believe it's just smtp.gmail.com this is the email server we're going to connect to and send emails from now I don't know if you can use this with what do you call it other emails that aren't Gmail if that's your sender email but if you try it and it doesn't work then you'll have to find whatever this kind of SMTP thing for like hotmail or Outlook or whatever it is email that you have okay so next thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna say a port and then context equals context and this reminds we actually up at the top here we got a defined port now so I'm just gonna say port is equal to four five six and this is just the standard port for SSL if this for some reason doesn't work then that probably means that your router is blocking the connection to SSL and in that case there's not really much you can do you can try to find another port on your router that accepts SSL or that's empty maybe but for now that's all I know is four five six so it works for me so we'll see if it works for you guys ok so after that we've kind of connected now we'll just say this is AZ server and sorry one second we're gonna say server dot login so just simply logging into our credentials so to login here I'm just gonna say sender and then password and then we're gonna say it server dot send email and then we're simply just gonna put our sender which is whose sending email our receiver which is who's gonna receive the email and then the message which is message and that should be about it I'm just gonna add some print statements in here quickly so we get a little bit of output to our console saying starting to send and then at the end here I'll just say print sent email just so we know you know if something hangs here and we run into an issue or if it's taking a long time to send the email so yeah that's pretty much what we do port 465 we'll just get your username and password again this is gonna be like your sender is gonna be your Gmail account so the exact address and then password is gonna be whatever the password is for that receive this is any email that you want to send it to message this is what you're gonna be sending context we just need this to create a new SSL thing not gonna explain exactly what that does and then we're just gonna open up a connection to the email server login with our credentials and simply send an email so let's run this now and see what happens no such followed Directory credentials txt okay so give me one second we'll create that directory and then I'll be right back okay so I just realized I made a really small mistake and essentially my file was just in the wrong directory but I also tried to run it and realize that we have two issues that I need to fix the first one here is down here this originally said past W I just had to change this to password so just add that Ord there because I figure out that I named this password and then here where it says send email we're gonna make this sent mail I don't know why I added that either but anyways that should be working now so if I run this we see starting to sent and then sent email you know that's great it's showing us this output but let me prove to you that actually did send that by opening up the email address here so you can see right now it's actually well I mean you guys can't really see the time but it is 814 a.m. and you can see that we've just received an email it says tests anymo this is just whatever the email I'm using this is from Python and then it signs it with tech with Tim and if you go to my sent mail you can see that it was sent from this address and received here as well so that is essentially how you send an email with python really straightforward really basic if you guys have any questions or anything snot working please let me know in the description below and with that being said I will see you again in a new video
