hey guys uh welcome back to the third video in my Python Programming tutorial series um today we're going to be talking about something called conditions so I hope you remember from the other videos we talked about input printing we did variables data types and then we talked about operators so operators like plus minus um division integer division modulus right uh multiplication all those operators today we're going to be talking about a few more operators and then getting into conditions so here in my file right here um I've put down four basic comparison operators so pretty much a comparison is something that's going to return a value of true or false so here we have um let's say if a real world example is Tim equal to Joe well no they're not because Tim obviously spelled differently than Joe so that's going to be giving us a value of false um same thing if we want to go into numbers we say is 18 is greater than 2 well is that true yes it is so that condition gives us a value of true uh it's a very simple concept but it's something that we have to understand as we go into decisions later on which will be in the next video okay so these comparison operators I'll read them off and just kind of give a definition of each of them so the first one can e be a less than or greater than sign uh same thing with the second one right so it's just going to compare if something's less than greater than then um usually these are used for integer values um that data type uh we also can use them for Strings but it's a little more complex and I'm not going to get into that right now maybe in a more advanced tutorial later on now the equivalent operator so the equal sign here now a lot of people think well if I'm comparing something why wouldn't I just use one equal sign like this well that's a very good question and a lot of people get mixed up on this it is actually two equal signs that's because because in Python um the one equal sign is a declaration um declaration operator so for example if I put a variable X and I want to set it equal to four right um this is what we do with the one equal sign we're setting values right so when we did name is equal to Tim things like that we're using one equal sign now if we're going to check something we're going to compare them we have to use two because two equal signs and one equal sign have a very different meaning so it's important to keep that in mind that the comparison operator for equivalency is two equal signs okay the next one is not equal to um so we have an exclamation mark and then we have the equal sign like this okay so an example of not equal to because some people may get confused here say if four not equal to 5 oops what did I type there not equal to 5 okay so what do you think this would give us just think about it for a second well what it's actually going to return to us is true because the condition is if four is not equal to 5 and here we can see obviously four is not equal to 5 so now again if I give another example we put five here we say five not equal to 5 well that would return a value of false because five is indeed equal to five now we can do the same thing with strings so for example we have hello oops spelled incorrectly there we go and Tim uh now you can probably guess by yourself that this is going to return true because Tim is indeed not equal to hello okay uh it's pretty straightforward um but a lot of people may get mixed up with the not equal to if it's returning true or false okay so those are the four basic comparison operators that we're going to use so we have equal to uh not equal to and then greater than and less than so greater than and less than again we use for numbers so 1 less than two again that's going to return true like that okay so now um we're going to start printing them some things to the console and maybe doing a little bit of a quiz here um just to see how you guys are going to do so a booing condition I'm going to store it in a variable so I'm going to say name uh oops actually we're not going to do that we're just going to print to the console 2 less than three okay now you guys guess and uh tell me what you think is going to be returned to the console it's either going to be true or false I'll give you a hint right now now it gives us a value of true that's because this condition 2 is less than three um is true it's equal to three right um so now if we switch the sign and we make it greater than like that well you can get guess what's going to come up so we click enter and we get false that's because this condition returns a value of false okay now we'll do another condition here all right um hello equal to Hilo okay um and guess yourself what this one's going to return false okay that's because they are spelled differently um now we're going to do the not equal sign just to show that one as well hello not equal to hello and we'll see that gives us true because they are not the same um fairly straightforward but a lot of people do get these things mixed up now I'll show you what happens when I try to just do one equal sign like this see we get keyword can't be an expression that's because we're trying to declare a variable here but we cannot do that okay because we're just using one equal sign here we need to use two all right okay so now let's try another example maybe a more advanced one uh this is a little bit of a trick okay I want to see if you guys remember from my last tutorial what I talked about so take a guess right now what you think is going to be return you think it's going to be true or do you think it's going to be false well it was false okay um that's because again what we talked about in Python um capitals matter right so any capital letter is different than a lowercase letter so something like this um yeah it's going to return false all right it's important to understand that okay so we've very briefly uh gone into conditions now um I'm going to write a few on the side here you guys can go ahead um I'll put them in print statements and test yourself and see if you get them right or not okay I'm going to add a few tricks from the other lesson um try to kind of apply some of our knowledge and see if we can get them correct okay so just give me a minute here I'm just going to write a few out and then we'll go through the answers afterwards okay so you know what we'll just we'll just do these ones for right now and we'll do a few other examples okay so these are a little more advanced than what I was talking about before but they are conditions we have a left side of the condition and we have a right side of the con condition so I hope you've taken a guess now of what you think these are going to be because I'm about to print out the answer right now Okay so we've gotten true false and false all right so for the first one two less than three that's an example I already gave that gives us a value of true because that condition is true uh now we have 2 3 + 4 greater then five um so you can do the math there and see that that is going to be false and then this one some people may have gotten a little bit of a little bit confused on cuz I actually use the words false and true in my condition that's going to return false or true so I have print false equals equals true well is false the same thing as true no it's not so obviously we're going to be returned with the value false Okay so we've talked a little bit about conditions now um in the next tutorial we're going to be doing something called decision so I'll give you a sneak peek on what that is something like this okay so stay tuned for that um the next episode should be up tomorrow um um and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed the video go ahead like And subscribe and yeah share with your friends thanks bye
