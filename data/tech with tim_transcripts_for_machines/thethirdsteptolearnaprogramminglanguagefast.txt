so now we're on to tip number three which is go and learn the topics that are on your list you kind of have to figure out what your most efficient learning strategy is and for me personally when I want to learn these different topics usually what I do is I reference documentation usually I'm reading the official language or framework documentation and going through and learning each topic that's on my list so for some of you it may be watching a video on the topic obviously I hope a lot of you guys enjoy videos considering I post tons of them on this channel I just know for me that I'm usually more efficient uh reading documentation but if something's really complicated and I'm not understanding it then I'll go and watch a video I'll usually turn it to 2x speed and that's kind of the fastest way for me to pick up this information
