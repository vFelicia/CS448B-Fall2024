hello everyone and welcome back so in this voice assistant tutorial what we're gonna be doing is using the voice assistant to actually open up applications for us and to take notes so what I want to do in this want to show you guys how we can actually open an application from Python what I mean by that is like launch a web browser or launch in this case actually notepad what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write a note into a notepad based on what we say to the voice assistant then it's gonna open up that note for us on the computer I think this is kind of useful and it should hopefully show you a few kind of things you can do and then you guys can tweak it and mess with it to make it what you guys want for your voice assistant so what I'm gonna do to start actually start let's go back up to the top here is import subprocess now what this is gonna do is just allow us to actually open well a subprocess which is gonna be notepad and show that on the screen now I'm also gonna create a function here which is gonna be called note and what this is gonna do is exactly what it says is just gonna take a note for us so we're gonna take some kind of text and that's gonna be the actual note that we're gonna write into a notepad so what I'm going to start by doing is creating like we need to create a notepad file so that we can actually open it so what I need to do is figure out what kind of name I should make this so we're gonna save it in the same directory as our voice assistant but what makes sense to name this file I can't really just choose like a static name like note or like my note because then if we have more than one note that we make it'll override the last note that's what I'm gonna do actually is say dates equals date/time dot date time done now which is gonna give me the date and time at the current moment so what I'm gonna do is save a file as like date like whatever the date and the time is dot note or like dot txt so that we can have as many files as we wanted to all be organized by the date that they were created now I'm going to create a new thing here new variable called file name which can equal to the string date dot replace in this case colon with a hyphen plus I'm gonna say note dot txt so what this is gonna do is define that our file name is gonna be equal to whatever this date is which is gonna be like twenty nineteen oh eight seven at like 345 p.m. whatever it is but what I'm gonna do is replace all the colons that are in there with hyphens and not just because we can't save a filename with colons we'll run into errors if we try to do that and then I'm gonna add a hyphen note txt at the end of that so we know that this is a note and it is a txt file so now what I'm going to do say with open and here file underscore name W which stands for write mode or create a new file if it doesn't already exist as F I'm gonna f dot write whatever that text is that we passed in okay so that's pretty straightforward and then what I'm gonna do is say subprocess dot p open and make sure you do a capital there and in here I'm gonna put square brackets for a list I'm gonna put the name of the file I'm going to open this insert notepad.exe and then I'm gonna put file underscore name so what this actually means is open the file name in notepad.exe an open e XE comes with all windows installation so you don't need to download this and to use another program what you need to do is in here specify the path to that program and the dot exe file so say you want to open it in like sub line text well you need to find where that is so I would get open file location' here it shows me this is the shortcut for sub line text 3 so if I want to open in sublime text 3 well now I figure need to figure out where this is so I go open file location' this is the Exe so I can copy this directory which is right here so up at the top if I could get that and then do slash sub line text exe and then it would open in that you know what I'm actually gonna do this I'm gonna say its sub line and I'm gonna try to do it in this one as well just to show you how this works so then we do another slash and then it's gonna be sub line underscore text don't yet see and we need to put this in brackets so I'll try to open in both them and show you guys actually how this works so before actually you know like call this properly and write some more code down here let's make sure that this is working I'm just gonna comment out all of this here and what I'm gonna do is just call this function so I'm gonna say note and then we'll put tech with Tim is the best okay so let's run this and where we go when we do that we actually see that a notepad pops up that says tech with Tim is the best and you can see the name of it I mean it's kind of small on my screen is 20 1909 14 and then 14 27 41 so it's pretty much just listing the time here note tht is the name of that note so I know it's long you guys can change that if you want and then you can see that it's saved inside of here in our voice assistant directory okay so now that we've done that let's try this with subline not really confident and this is gonna work but we'll see run oh and there we go Tech with Tim is the best and that opened it in sub line text for us so again the way I did that was just find the exe for sub line text I put that as the first thing so the exact path to it and then the file that I wanted to open which was notepad and conveniently this worked for us I'm not gonna lie didn't think that would work but anyways there we go we got that so that does work awesome so I'm gonna get rid of sub links actually do want this to open in notepad Exe I'm so it'll work on any computer that does have windows on it and now that we've done that we need a good way to actually call this function just like what we've done down here when we check you know if we're gonna actually tell us about our calendar and on so essentially what do we need to say to our voice assistant for it to make a note for us well I'm gonna make some kind of phrases that I would maybe want to say for it to make a note so I'd say like make a note that's probably something that we're gonna want to make a note with we say that maybe write this down we could do remember this like that and I mean I'm sure you could add some more but I'm just gonna leave it like that for now and you guys can mess with that and what I'm actually gonna do is just copy this actually I won't copy it I'll just type it out I'll say for raise in note underscore strings if phrase in text and what I'm actually gonna do is just make a quick change here I'm gonna get rid of this dot lower here and just add it at the end of get audio just so that saves us a bit of time here and then we will do is if phrase in text what I'm gonna do is ask the user to tell me what they want to write down so essentially like maybe you go like hey Siri or like whatever your voice assistant is make a note so if you say it make a note then what it's gonna say back is what do you want me to write down or what do you want me to make a note of so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna say speak what would you like me to write down question then what I'm gonna do is get the audio from this so we'll say like I don't know note equals get underscore audio and we'll put that actually yeah I guess we'll put that in dot lower as well and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna pass that to this note function so we'll say note and then we'll pass note like that or actually I don't think I can name this note let's just name it like note underscore text we don't run into any issues so let's say note note underscore text and then we will speak I've made a note back awesome so that is all we kind of need to do actually I think for this to work so now in theory we should be able to speak to our voice assistant ask it to make a note it'll tell it asked us what we want to make a note of it will listen for us to say something then it will make a note of that open up the notepad window and then tell us that we've made a note of it so let's try this make a note Tim is the best and there we go Tim is the best so that actually worked fairly well and fairly quickly and there we go so now we have these notepad files up here we've written or wrote down Tim as the best and that worked for us now I hope you guys are able to actually hear this audio I'll try one more example now with like write this down write this down this voice assistant tutorial is cool and there we go this voice assistant tutorial is cool and it's made a note so that is kind of all it is to making notes I mean we might want to clean this up by adding a notes directory in here and saving all the files in there but that is again I mean how you write a note how you get it to open up the notepad for you which we've been doing each time and how we can check to make sure we're saying the correct thing we do that now show you this is still working what do I have on Wednesday you have until this day my director like 1 p.m. 2110 toriel p.m. and we can see that that is now still working so depending on what we say we get different responses from our assistant and we're making our way towards a very smart cool voice assistant so with that being said I'm gonna wrap up the video here as always leave a comment down below with stuff you want to see for the rest of this voice assistant tutorial series and with that being said I will see you guys in the neck
