hello everybody and welcome back so in this video we're gonna be talking about the switch statement the way I'm gonna teach you guys the switch statement is essentially comparing what we've written in the previous video which is this kind of function that essentially uses some if some else ifs and some else's or at least if did in the previous video to perform the example of allowing us to type in some color and changing the text of you know I don't know say some element on the screen to be back color so what we're gonna do is do this now with a switch statement so you guys can see a little bit of the difference on how it works and hopefully understand it a bit better so what I'm gonna do is scrap all this code where essentially we had three if statements I'm going to switch this to a switch now the way that a switch statement works is you start by typing the word switch you put brackets inside the brackets you put an expression or a variable that you're gonna be checking so in this case text is what we're gonna check right we're gonna see if it's equal to different values so we're gonna put that variable here next we're gonna put our curly braces like this we're gonna type the word case space then we're gonna tab indent and hit break and put a semicolon now I know this is like some of you guys like whoa what is all this what's happening I'm gonna go through it but just bear with me for a second here so case what does this mean essentially inside of a switch statement we have cases now the cases are kind of all of the different things that could happen that the different branches are different routes we could go on so in this instance we have text and our first case is going to be if text is equal to read now this is case one and what this is saying is essentially case read which means text is equal to read so if text is equal to read we're gonna do whatever is after this and before this break statement so in this case we can change the document so actually we'll just steal what we have here and I'll change this a bit so document dot get element by ID dot style Dodd's color equals red like that and want to change this to header so what this is going to do now is the centrist say okay the switch our first case is if it's red if it's red we'll change the document to be or to change the element to be the color red then we can bring and that's what this case does so let's actually refresh to see if this works so by type red you can see that it changes to red and you know if I type something else if I type blue obviously we see nothing else is happening all right so what's the next thing that we need to do well we need to create some more cases so what's another case that could happen here well we could have a case that our text is blue right that's what equals state so we'll break we'll copy this and then what we'll do is we'll simply put in here and we'll change the color to be blue and I think you guys are kind of getting the hang of how this works essentially the switch statement will check these different cases it will check them in order if you know this text is equal to one of these cases then the case will run and then we'll break out of the switch statement and we won't bother looking at any of the other cases that are there now there's some more to talk about but let's try this for now so here we have red we have blue so let's try blue we can see that changes to blue let's try red we can see that changes to red awesome so let's add one more case and I guess we will do green as our last case to stay consistent with our previous example so we have green like that change our color to green and one last test here to make sure everything's working let's go green and it changes to green awesome now what I'm going to show you guys is called default now what is default well default is kind of like the else inside of a switch statement so here what we can actually do is create what's called a default case which essentially means that if none of the cases above this ran then will always default and do this default now what the default is gonna be is just changing our text color to be black because that is what we need it to be so we'll change it to be black and there we go what we've essentially done is simulated you know an if else if and else using a switch statement now these are useful sometimes because it's a lot easier to actually read your code when you put it in a switch statement rather than having them all in that branching if and else statements but in some instances you know you need to use the if else if you're not going to just be checking one variable whenever you do a condition but for us since all we're doing is checking one variable this variable can be equal to a few different things so we'll check if it's equal to these different things in these cases and then do whatever is after this so anyways let's have a look at this now let's refresh this let's type hello we can see the text isn't changed let's go green oops if I could get in here green it changes to green if I type nothing and I click click it'll go back to black so that is how the switch statement works and that is you know a good example of when we would use a switch data now what I'm going to show you next because we actually have quite a bit of time left in this video is a different example of one maybe you wouldn't you would not want to use a switch statement and that's what I'm gonna use an ifelse statement for but let's just do an example here so I'm gonna delete all of this and what I'm actually gonna do is change this text input example to be rather than changing the color of this header tag I'm gonna ask the user to type in their name and essentially if they type in or sorry not their name their age and if their age is greater than a certain number I'm gonna tell them that you know they're an adult or they're not an adult it's a good example that I like to use so in this case I'll say what is your age just a little header before our input box they can type it in here when they click clicked we'll run this press function and we can see what their ages so what I'm gonna actually do is make another text input here so I'm just gonna say P slash P I'm just gonna say ID equals output and what I'm gonna do is say var hmm actually do I want to do this yeah sure let's save our output equals document dot get element by ID and here I'm gonna call this output and what this is gonna allow me to do is actually change the output tag here by just referencing the variable output rather than typing this entire thing whatever I want to change it so what I'm gonna do now is we're gonna put an if statement and remember that this function is gonna run whenever this user clicks the click button so in this instance we're gonna grab the text which should hopefully be the user's whatdoyoucallit age and what I'm gonna do is try to convert that age into a number so that I can compare it against another number now you'll see how that works so what I'm gonna do in here is I'm actually gonna try to convert whatever it is the user types in into a number and the reason I need to do that is because whenever the user types something in a text input box like a text field it's assumed that the data type that comes in is a string so we know what a string looks like and the strings have those quotation marks and we remember from previously and actually I'll do it down here if I compare something with quotation marks to something say like that so 42 like that and I use my three equal signs we're gonna get the false value for that right and I'd like to be able to use the greater than sign of the less than sign between these different values so I can compare whatever the user types in to whatever number I'm gonna compare to so in this case 18 to see if they're an adult so to do that I need to convert this to a number so to do that I'm actually going to use a function called parse int what this is gonna do is simply take the integer value of whatever string we typed in and just return that to us just give that to us so this will save our text equals the number of whatever string we typed in and this will convert that to a number okay so what I'm going to do is compare the text to some number in this case I'm going to say 18 so if text is greater than or equal to 18 so if their age is greater than or equal to 18 what I'm gonna do is change this output text to say you are an adult so to do that I'm gonna say output which is the variable here that's holding a reference did this ptex with this paragraph tag let me say dot innerhtml equals and in this case you are older than 18 exclamation point next what I'm gonna do is to essentially say this is not true we'll change this output text to say you are not older than 18 and let's run this and see if this works so refresh what is your age let's say 18 click you are older than 18 what if I say 17 you get you are not older than 18 now notice that this one is kind of misleading it says you were older than 18 but you could actually be 18 so what we should do is change this so that we have one that says if you're 18 right so let's say else if text equals equals 18 then what we'll do is and I gotta get rid of that actually and add one here it is will simply add this output text and will say you are 8ki like that then we can change this to say greater than 18 and now what we're gonna do is check if it's greater than 18 if they are we'll say you're older otherwise if they are 18 we'll say you're 18 and then finally else you're not folder than 18 so let's run this refresh let's go 17 you're not older than 18 let's go 18 you are 18 and then 19 you are older than 18 and that is how you use this now the reason you wouldn't use a switch statement for this is because we're tracking any values that are greater than 18 we're gonna print out and say well you're older than 18 but if we use a switch statement we need to check if it's exactly that value right we need to have you know the text up top and then we need to check 18 19 20 21 it doesn't make sense to use a switch statement in that instance whereas before when we were just typing you know red green blue that's totally fine and it makes sense to use a switch statement but here since we're checking values we need to use ifelse ifelse so anyways that has been switch statements and as well as a count a little bit of a more advanced example with if Elif and else if you guys are looking to challenge yourself I will mention to you that you can actually put if statements and hold chaining blocks inside of other if statements and other chaining blocks so you can kind of go and nest a bunch of statements together so you guys can try to do something like that and you know that's good practice actually if you want to create something I could choose your own adventure game you can use what I've just showed you to actually do something similar to that so anyways that has been it for this video if you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a like and subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys in another video
