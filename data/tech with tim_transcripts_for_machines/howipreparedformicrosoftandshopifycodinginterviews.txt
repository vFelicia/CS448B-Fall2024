here's how I prepared for my technical interviews at both Microsoft and Shopify first of all I already knew about data structures and algorithms from my University course what I needed to learn was how to answer these algorithm style questions and how to do that properly so I started by using algo expert this is when I was not affiliated with the platform before I was paid by them or had any kind of courses and I did about 60 Questions on that platform the reason I used that was to get the explanations from the videos so I wanted to have someone walk me through each problem and actually understand why I was doing a specific solution once I did well with algo expert then I moved on to leak code where I much more quickly did about 50 or 60 questions on the platform I was targeting mostly medium and hard problems after that I actually got a whiteboard I bought one and I put it in my room and then I started practicing a few of these questions about five or ten of them with the Whiteboard actually in my room where I would write everything out using the marker and actually simulate the real interview environment after doing this I was able to get job offers from both Microsoft and Shopify for an internship that was about three years ago
