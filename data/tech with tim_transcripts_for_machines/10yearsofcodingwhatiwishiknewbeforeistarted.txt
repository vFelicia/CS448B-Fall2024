I've been coding for nearly 10 years and let me tell you that I've made tons of mistakes and wasted countless hours working on the wrong skills please don't make the same mistakes as me back 10 years ago when I started coding I spent nearly two years learning HTML CSS and JavaScript just to find out that I hated web development and didn't want to continue doing that next I learned PHP Yes you heard that right for some reason I learned PHP then I decided to learn C sharp because some random person that I met said that that was the best programming language to learn the point is that I didn't have a plan I didn't have a goal and I had no idea what I was doing why I was learning what I was learning and this led to literally years of my life being spent doing something that was pretty useless to me that was not something that I wanted to pursue the point is that I didn't have a goal in mind for what I wanted to do and I definitely didn't have a plan I was pretty much just a lone kid sitting in my room aimlessly watching YouTube tutorials having no idea what I was going to do with what I learned what I wish I knew back then was that I should have spent some more time defining my programming goals coming up with some kind of plan and having a direction and vision for where I wanted to go with this programming Journey the key takeaway for me is that I should have spent a bit of time messing around in some different languages looking really to see what was out there and determining what I liked before I just put my head down and started learning a bunch of skills that now today I really don't use and that in hindsight was a fairly large waste of time now to continue my story after a few years of pretty slow progress and learning I finally found a language and Niche that actually interested me now this was building games in Python at this point I was still a very amateur programmer but I had the basics of a few languages under my belt and I was finally creating some actually interesting projects and things that I enjoyed working on now every time I built a new game in Python my code got slowly better and better and I eventually started creating some really cool projects and building some confidence in programming the issue here was I was doing pretty much all of this on my own I had no Mentor I had no support network I didn't really have anyone to talk about programming with and I definitely didn't have anyone to give me any advice tips or guidance for what I should do next now really what this meant is that I just kept making games in Python for about two years I kind of got stagnant in my journey and my learning and I didn't really learn anything new I just got really good at Python and making games and in hindsight that was a bit of a mistake now what I wish I had done back then is gone out of my way to find some kind of community group of friends or mentor and start taking Making Connections in the programming space more seriously I think if I had done this I would have rapidly increased the speed at which I learned different programming languages I was kind of aware of different things in the industry not to mention if I had people to ask for advice tips or help I think that just really would have propelled me forward and allowed me to get past just making games in Python a lot faster now fortunately for you if you're

spending most of my high school career looking at Python and making games in Python I went off to University where I studied computer science now in University I took all kinds of courses obviously math courses computer architecture data structures and algorithms but I also took a few programming courses where I learned python Java go ocamel SQL if you consider that a programming language and a bunch of other programming languages as well now during this time I was essentially forced to learn all kinds of different programming languages and to constantly adapt to different Technologies Frameworks or whatever it was we were learning in class now even though I wouldn't say this was the most enjoyable time in my life this is really where I built the strong programming Foundation that I have today and built the confidence to feel like I could write code in any language any framework and really learn anything that I needed to so really I wish that I had done this earlier in my journey that I had stepped outside of my comfort zone looked at different languages Technologies and Frameworks and just played with a bunch of stuff to build that confidence and learn a bunch of new things really when you stick with what you're comfortable with you're not learning as much as if you dive into a project that you never thought you could complete before so I would encourage any of you to step outside your comfort zone pick some kind of project that you never imagined you'd be able to create and then go out there and build it you might not complete it it might seem daunting but I promise you that working on something that seems really challenging or difficult really is the best way to get better and that's what I wish I had started doing earlier in my career now any of you that have been here for a while will remember that I started taking this YouTube channel seriously as I was in university now what I did was post hundreds of videos on different programming languages topics modules Frameworks whatever you could imagine and this is really what leveled me up to the next step in my my programming Journey where I was having to learn all of these new different topics and not only learn them but be able to explain them to people on YouTube so as I continued to post YouTube videos I realized quite quickly that although raw programming skill was pretty important so was the ability to communicate to explain to break down a topic clearly and to make someone understand it and this was a skill that I started developing that I realized many other people especially in University or in computer science weren't even really considering and definitely weren't taking too seriously so as I started to develop and improve my communication skills I saw the benefits of this immediately where all of a sudden I started standing out in lectures groups Etc and even though I wasn't necessarily the best programmer if I could be one of the best speakers a lot of people gave me more attention or just assumed that I was good at programming now this skill is what eventually led me to actually land a job at Microsoft and to get offers from companies like Shopify while I was applying for internships when I was only 19 years old now I don't say any of this to brag but just to drive the point home that I really wish I had focused more on communication skills earlier in my career earlier in my journey because a lot of the opportunities I have today came up because of my ability to communicate I'd even go as far as to say that communication skills have carried me much further than my programming ability and even though I've never been the best programmer in the room I could make up for it by being charismatic easy to understand and talk to and able to kind of break down my thoughts and articulate my thought process which is something that I see a lot of programmers really struggle with so hopefully you take this point to heart and you too start working on your communication skills as well as your programming skills so my next point to share with you has to do with my experience working at Microsoft back in 2020 as a software Edge during intern as I joined this role I was very quickly thrown into the world of software engineering I had my first experience actually working in a team environment now this meant I very quickly had to learn git testing and other tools and kind of pursue seizures in the software development life cycle now as I completed my three months at Microsoft I did learn a lot of technical skills I got some great experience and met some great people and I had a fantastic Mentor who was one of the top software Engineers on our team and really in our organization who shared a lot of great information with me and kind of inspired me to level up and see what was possible if I continued with programming now at the same time that there was some really great software Engineers who were just really really talented and kind of motivational to me there was a lot of people that was working at Microsoft that didn't strike me as the best Engineers that in fact didn't really do very much and kind of just played the corporate culture game and that's what this point is about when I worked at Microsoft I got exposed to this kind of large company corporate culture at like a Fang you know tech company and I realized that quite a few people that were working there didn't really do that much they did the bare minimum to get by they weren't the best software engineers in the world and they simply were good enough to pass their interviews they had kind of the community education skills to get by and really to fake it until they made it so the point here is that a lot of people that are working at these companies are not as good as you might think they are they're not these Idols or amazing software Engineers that you might imagine and they're definitely not any better than you might be and that's kind of one thing that I realized when I stepped in that I didn't need to have this imposter syndrome that I wasn't necessarily going to be worse than other people there and that most people in Tech and most people in life in general don't really know what they're doing they just kind of have that confidence and arrogance that makes people believe that they do so the key takeaway I took from this experience is that people are not necessarily as good as you might make them out to be they're not these Pro level software Engineers that just know absolutely everything a lot of them are figuring it out day by day just like you are and that's a reason why you shouldn't feel like you can never be on their level I know a lot of you watch this Channel and maybe even compare yourself to someone like me and you say oh I'm never going to be there or I'm not as good as you the reality is a lot of times people are kind of so selfimposing their own restrictions they're defining what they're capable of and I think if you set your bar a little bit higher look a little bit further and just realize that not everyone's kind of as amazing as you might make them out to be that you're going to get a lot further so hopefully you get the message that I'm trying to send here which is that most people really are not experts they're not complete professionals they don't know exactly what they're doing they're figuring it out day by day and they've simply had the confidence to say you know what I don't know what this is but I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna figure it out and I think you should have that as well I know it's difficult to get over imposter syndrome but trust me people are not as great or as much better as you as you might think and you can definitely reach their level if you put in the effort and the work so to end this video the last thing I'll say is that there's no one way to become a software engineer or a developer everyone's journey is different some people do it in a few months some people it takes years and you saw in this video that I had a very unconventional Journey where I started learning how to code when I was quite young and I spent almost five years kind of just doing random coding stuff with no real direction or vision and still I ended up where I am today so please don't worry if you feel like you're behind people or you're not at the same level as someone else everyone goes at a different pace and as long as you keep going you will eventually get to where you want to go so I'd love to hear from you was this video helpful do you have any tips or things that you wish you knew before you started learning how to code if that's the case please leave them in the comments down below and if you're looking for programming mentors then again make sure
