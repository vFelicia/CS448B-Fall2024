hey guys and welcome back to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to be going over something that i've seen a lot of comments about and something that i was wondering about when i was mining ethereum so as we all know the price of ethereum has been skyrocketing lately so maybe not in the past month or so we've seen a decline but if we look back a year ago we can see the price has grown tremendously and that means that the amount of users and the amount of people that are mining ethereum has also gone up so pretty much uh this is my little mining window here i'm gonna zoom it in so that everyone can see a little bit better and you'll notice that i'm using an amd rx 480 as eight gigabytes of video ram it's a good graphics card and it's only mining at 16.1 mega hash per second now it is to be noted this is not overclocked this does not have a bios flash and i am recording a video right now so it is slightly slower than usual but not by much so i usually can expect to get between 17 and 18 mega hash per second which is a lot slower than what i used to mine at say for example if we take if we uh go back in time to maybe about the summer so like july uh september around then i was mining at 22 23 mega hash per second stock meaning without overclocking my card that's how much i could get if i overclocked i could maybe even push to 25 mega hashes per second so we can see that that is a huge difference in uh in speed so now the real question is well why does it look like this why are we mining so much slower now there's a few reasons for this but the main one that i want to bring up is this right here so this is just an ethereum mining difficulty chart as we can see here and it shows us the difficulty of the network starting from october and to now and we can see that this chart is growing and going upwards now if you don't know when you mine ethereum uh there's a certain difficulty level now after a certain amount of my uh blocks have been mined that difficulty level increases so just like we can no longer mine bitcoin off of our computers if we want to actually make somewhat of a profit that's similar to what's happening to ethereum not on the same level but it is similar so if we remember uh bitcoin people used to build a mine on their computers just like we might ethereum but now you need asic mining hardware to actually be able to make any real money mining bitcoin because it is so difficult to mine it so pretty much as the network gets more advanced the difficulty continues to go up and we can see that we are continually growing so obviously as the uh difficulty grows and our graphics cards don't get any more advanced we're gonna be mining slower and that's just the story of it so i'm gonna if we look up here we can see that there's something that says the dag eposh okay now this happens every time you load up your miner it shows you this dag and this dag number now this number represents the difficulty of the network so when i started mining my dag was at about 130 so that was pretty low and that's when i was getting those high mega hashes so 23 to 25 mega hashes and now you can see we're at 170 so as this number increases your mining performance decreases now this is going to be different depending on what card you have and there are still some cards that are mining at the same mega hashes they were mining at uh maybe a few months ago but depending on the graphics card you have your your hashing speed is going to decrease over time and that's just something that you have to understand so for example if you had bought a card a few months ago and you're expecting it to keep the same hashing power well that's not going to happen and the only way that you can really get back that hashing power is by doing something like modding your bios or by trying to overclock your card and even with a standard overclock it's going to be difficult to get those uh those same numbers that you had in the past so i hope this answered your question on why the your mega hash is or your mining speed is going down uh pretty much as the network gets more advanced so does the difficulty and that means that your card is not going to be mining as fast as it was before so if you guys have any other questions or any videos you'd like to see in the future please leave a like and subscribe to the channel as it would really help me out you
