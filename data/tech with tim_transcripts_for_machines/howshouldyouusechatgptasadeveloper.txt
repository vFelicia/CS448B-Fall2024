so first let me share with you how I use Chad gbt now I will admit this is not a massive part of my workflow a lot of what I'm doing as more of a senior programmer right now is writing or architecting code myself however I do treat chat GPT kind of like a low paid intern where I'm handing it off kind of smaller tasks and that would be faster for me to describe to the AI than to write from scratch by myself now a lot of you might relate to this problem where you're working in some kind of engineering team and if you're in any kind of management role or you're kind of leading other developers oftentimes it's actually faster for you just to write the code and kind of fix a problem than it is to try to describe what needs to be done to someone else so in the situation in which it's very easy for me to describe something I'll go to chat gbt describe that and then have it spit out that code
