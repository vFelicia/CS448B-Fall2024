in python there is a very useful function that not many people know about and this is the any function now this function tells you if anything inside of an iterable object is true so let's have a look at using it on some of the examples here if i print any of my string notice that we get true the reason we get true is because this string contains some characters and any characters in python evaluate to true if i had this as an empty string then we would get false because we have no items in the string and so no this is not true anyways continuing now let's look at any on our first lst yes we get true because any value that's not zero that's an integer evaluates to true now let's look at it on lst2 notice we get false because we have zero false and false none of these are true values in python let's look at it on list three notice we get true because true is present here and let's look at it on our tuple tup like this notice we get false again and he can take any iterable object and tell you if any of the values inside of it are true if you like this make sure to follow for more
