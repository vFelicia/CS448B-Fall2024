what I'm holding here is truly one of the most interesting products I've ever seen now this is not a Nintendo DS this is a fully functioning 7inch Windows 10 laptop that's right it has a keyboard on it like this and it folds 360 degrees into a touchscreen tablet that works horizontally and vertically and it's a really interesting product and I've been using it for the past two weeks to gather some thoughts on it then I'm gonna share with you guys today so stick around if you want to hear some of the specs on this thing and if it's actually a usable laptop and can be used as a daily driver so before we get into the review here I'm just gonna quickly mention that I was sent this product for free with the intention of doing a review on it not to mislead any of you guys I'm not being paid to say anything specific about this this is my honest review and my honest opinions about it now with that being said if you are interested in this product there is a product link down below I believe this is available on IndieGoGo right now I'm not sure when it's actually going to be shipped out or when that's gonna be finalized but I'll leave a link to the peak ago website as well in case any of you are interested in having another look and getting some more information about the product so I'm gonna start by just listing some of the specs on this computer and then I'll go into kind of some more details and my thoughts about them so the spec on this is actually an Intel Atom x5 z 8350 cherry processor it has 8 gigabytes of RAM 128 gigabytes of disk space a 7 inch touch screen IPS panel that has a 16 by 10 aspect ratio that turns out to be 1920 by 1200 pixels it has a few ports on the side so a micro HDMI a USB see which is actually how you charge the computer an ordinary USB 3.0 connector a headphone jack a micro SD card reader and a VGA camera as full WiFi and bluetooth capability and a 4500 milliamp battery weighing in at just about 700 grams so if first thoughts here this computer actually seems to be decent but I'm going to talk about some of the limitations of this one of which is that this computer comes in a default mode called windows ass mode now windows s mode is designed for tablet based computers and essentially is meant to kind of boost performance of those computers the main issue with this is it doesn't allow you to download any applications that don't come from the Windows Store while you're in Windows s mode so essentially if you actually want to use this computer for anything other than browsing the web or playing the games or applications that are in the Windows Store you need to turn off windows s mode which makes this computer much much slower I'm going to talk about that as we go through so since this laptop is kind of marketing geared towards people that are traveling a lot let me tell you about my experience traveling with it so recently I've taken the train back and forth from school back to home and I've been using this laptop and trying to see you know what I actually use this on an everyday kind of experience now what's great about this is really the size it fits into pretty much anything if you already you know have a lot packed you can't fit a 15inch laptop it's really easy to throw this in and the charger for its really nice as well because it's just a USBC so chances are you know you might already have that cable you can plug it into a portable charger you can plug it into your little iPhone brick in the wall and that's a great advantage of this computer for sure now it's marketed that you can put this in your pocket you can fit in your back pocket and pull it out you can do that but no one I don't see anyone carrying this in their back pocket I've personally tried to do it it's seven inches would mean it's fairly large it fills the entire pocket and it is heavy 700 grams you know you're gonna feel that in your back pocket it's not like just carrying an iPhone around and it's really not realistic that you're gonna be walking around with that now the great kind of thing with this is that you can pull it out pretty much anywhere if you want to really quickly you know you're standing in line for something you want to pull it out you want to do something you can do that for sure and you can definitely do it on the train as well you know you want something quickly pull it out do something quick put it back and that's what I kind of use this laptop for maybe I'm in class I want to do a quick Google search or I want to just open up you know my virtual campus online i''m pull out this laptop I can do it and I kind of been describing this laptop for myself use case that's just like a glorified web browser because that's really all that I use it for if I want to get any serious work done I'm gonna pull out my 15 inch or my 13 inch laptop and start working on that because the touchpad on this is very bad in terms of actually moving the mouse the screen is great the screen is really nice it works really well but just if I need to do any programming writing or real work I I can't do it on this computer which brings me to my next point which is this is very very slow like I mentioned before as soon as you turn Windows S mode off it just everything takes a very long time to load and that's because the CPU on this is a very weak not very powerful computer a lot of people read those eight gigs of ram and like oh this will be fine it's like a solid computer I don't know to be honest with you guys this is one of the slowest machines I've ever used and it's very painful going from something like I have here and then trying to work on that so that's kind of my thoughts on that aspect and the traveling aspect of this computer alright so now I want to give you guys some of my final thoughts on this product now I want to start by saying this is a great idea it's really a great concept I like the idea of being able to portably bring around you kind of a laptop tablet whatever you want to call it and be able to use it from anywhere because you really can do that with this computer you're in line you're on the train you're in this tight space you need to bring out something and quickly get some work done you can definitely do that with this computer now what I will say though is this is definitely not a replacement for your laptop if you're thinking you're gonna buy this and you don't need to lug around your 13 or 15 inch laptop you're wrong 100% wrong in fact what's happened with me a lot of times is I brought this out try to get something done and just been too frustrated with it just because this mouse thing alone is very difficult to use you I would say it's almost mandatory that you need an actual mouse when you're doing this especially if you're not gonna be using the touchscreen and the keyboard itself you know it's usable you can use it but it's very slow and when I type on it it's just really frustrating so that's kind of my main you know issue with this computer is it's definitely not a replacement for a laptop and I don't think it's necessarily marketed like that but I just want to make sure you guys know that before you know you go and buy something like this look this is a $300 computer so you get what you pay for this works you can use it it's versatile and it's definitely you know for someone that's traveling a lot and just want something quick and easy to pull out and get some simple basic work done but if you need anything more complicated or anything that's gonna be more of a heavy task you're definitely gonna need a real laptop and you can't really use this and that's why I've had a lot of issues with this personally I don't do much work that's just you know like answering emails and light things where I'm just web browsing I do a lot of programming do a lot of keyboard intensive stuff I'd like to have a nice Mouse and that's what my issue comes with this specific computer so anyways this is a great product I love receiving stuff like this and being able to kind of you know use it mess with it and give my opinion on it for me it doesn't really work very well but you know maybe some of you guys have some other use cases where you could see yourself using something like this and I'd love to hear your thoughts about that in the comments down below so with that being said a big thank you again to pica go there links are in the description if you want to check out this product and that being said I will see you guys in another video
