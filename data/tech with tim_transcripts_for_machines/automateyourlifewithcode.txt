there's really good programmers the reason why they can oftentimes get a ton of stuff done is because they spend the time up front to automate set up their environment and make themselves as efficient as humanly possible now when I say automation this can be stuff like setting up your environment so that you know all of your keyboard shortcuts it could be automating testing or automating deployments or automating just like setting up a certain folder structure or different files in your code base the general idea here is that all of these really good programmers that I've seen don't waste time doing repetitive stuff they're programmers after all and they always like to automate pretty much everything they possibly can so they can spend a majority of their time writing code or writing tests or whatever it is they need to do rather than performing these kind of monotonous and repetitive tasks
