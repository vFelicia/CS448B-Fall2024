hey guys and welcome back to another video so in today's video I'm gonna be doing something completely different that I've never done on my channel before and this is a university room tour in kind of like a vlog style video now I have never done any kind of vlogging or anything like this I think I did a decent job but I'd love to hear your feedback in the comments below do you take it easy this is my first time doing a vlog so yeah so anyways before I continue in with that content I just need to give a massive thank you to everyone that's been supporting me subscribing to the channel who's watching this video today is officially the day the tech with Tim has hit twenty thousand subscribers that's right twenty thousand subscribers only a month and a half ago I just hit ten thousand and even that was absolutely unreal and something that I've been working for for so long so to have that much growth to essentially double my subscriber base in only a month and a half it just is so outstanding and unreal to me I can't even believe that I'm sitting at this number but just thank you guys so much I have so many plans for the future so many cool things I want to do we're really just getting started here and I hope that you guys are coming along for the ride because I can tell you there's gonna be some awesome stuff that you guys are definitely not gonna want to miss in the future before I go too far here I just need to say that I do have a patreon account some of you guys have noted that you'd be willing to support that you know that I don't make that much money off of YouTube and it's something that I really want to do more and more and more and focus as much time as possible so even just providing like a dollar a month a small donation via patreon really helps me out and allows me to focus more of my time and efforts here on YouTube to keep creating awesome free content for you guys so with that being said thank you guys once again so much and I hope that you enjoy the video alright so the way that my kind of residence style works essentially is that you share a room with one other person and you share kind of a common area which I'm gonna be showing to you guys right now and then you have your own kind of door you can see those are the two doors right there and your own room which is your own private space so it's really nice because you do have a roommate but if you don't want to see them kind of just lock yourself in your room and having your own bathroom in your room is actually really nice luxury for university I'm sure if any you guys are students you can relate that a lot of the residences are not very nice alright so now I'm gonna walk you guys through kind of the main shared space of my room so this is what I call like the common space there's a nice little table we brought it through a few extra chairs into here and then we have what's known as kind of like a little kitchenette so a bit of space for some snacks and some food and some cupboard space and then we have obviously a microwave a sink we all these dishes and stuff we're stuff that I draw it I'm sure you guys know what that is and then I have a little toaster a coffee maker which is essential I love my coffee in the morning and then obviously I keep some snacks and stuff in some of the drawers here so as well a fullsize fridge which is also awesome because I have a freezer which means I can keep like frozen food and stuff up here if I wanted to so I mean we had like some cookies some other stuff in there and then obviously the fridge just for I don't know whatever stuff that needs to stay cold now we also share a washroom um it's actually a decent sized washroom I mean you guys can see me now and pretty I don't know standard but it's nice to have a washroom because a lot of university residences don't have that at all so anyways that's kind of it for the main common space there's nothing too exciting here but now I'm gonna bring you guys into my room where I'm sure is what you actually want to see from this video so let's go in alright so now I'm in my actual room by the way the audio sounds a lot better in here I don't know why it's so echo II out there but I'm gonna walk you guys through my whole kind of setup so my whole PC set up and then where I also just spend most of my time in terms of what the room layout looks like so if you guys did follow my Twitter around my Instagram you already know what my looks like just saying so you might want to hop on there if you're not but let's give you guys a quick tour now so essentially this is my room right here give you a quick pan of everything this it's pretty small but for a university room having something like a double bed which I have right now a nice closet like I actually really like this room and this style of kind of living is is perfectly fine um so yeah this is I mean the closet nothing too exciting here just where I hang up on my stuff I've got some shoes laundry standard stuff like that a little fan old side table and yeah so now let's bring you over to the PC setup which I'm sure is the part that you guys are actually most interested in so this is kind of my main PC desk setup layout whatever you want to call it and this is where all of the magic happens in terms of recording videos and actually getting work done so I bring you up close here I'm running a dual monitor setup that's actually my disc word server up right now you guys should definitely hop in there too and I did have a third monitor back at home but I couldn't bring it because it's wallmounted and I can't actually mount anything on the wall so right now what I'm showing you obviously is my computer it's hard to get a good angle at it but I mean you get the idea it's got the LEDs and it's actually tempered glass on four sides so on the back as well which I can't really show you from here um let me give you guys a quick sneak peek on my cable management ah it's a bit messy but if you guys have a computer setup like mine you'll know like there's a ton of cables and it's not easy to manage them nicely and I can't really be bothered to do that anyways um so yeah go through the rest of the stuff I mean all you guys ask my keyboard I use this is just like a I don't even know das key don't know what brand that is but it's cherry MX red switches which I really actually like they're a bit like I make a few typos with them as you might notice but it's finally good for gaming as well which I do a little bit of this is just my standard SteelSeries mouse like that Mouse as well it's like fifty bucks or something and then obviously my blue Yeti microphone which is what I used to record all of my kind of screen recording videos this is just like my standard face cam I got like a Logitech whatever the highest Logitech face game is that's what I have and then this is my light that I use for the face camp and for doing vlogs like this um so these are kind of my controllers for all this so this is the light controller obviously um it actually changes in brightness as well not sure if you guys can focus focus maybe ok maybe not but anyways it changes like you can change the temperature of it and brightness which is nice and this is my controller just for what he caught underneath the desk in terms of some other stuff that I have in terms of tech stuff I actually have like a whole beam here full of I can't even pull it out there's so much full like tech stuff and wires and cables and that whole bottom thing there is also full of tech stuff and cables and wires in case I ever need them I have my iPad here usually I have my live subscriber count up but I just haven't done it phone charger fidget spinner which I use like consistently especially when I'm trying to focus and then this is my drawing tablet that I use for like all my kind of illustrations or what not so I mean like this isn't too exciting there's not too much stuff but in terms of like a resin this is quite a bit of tech equipment I would say and I'm valuing it at probably close to $12,000 which is ridiculous when I say it but over the course of a few years that's probably how much I've spent on it Oh laptops almost forgot this is my main school laptop which I only bring it to class I just use it in class or labs I mean just like a standard Dell laptop it's got an i7 has a GPU in it I don't know it's a decent old laptop 15 inch screen by the way and then this is my Mac old Mac that I just used for like watching YouTube and all that kind of stuff because I like the smaller screen size I just have it on my lap or whatnot um yeah I mean that's really almost it there's not too much to talk about in terms of other stuff in my room I guess I can show you guys my view let's do that so this is the view from my room again nothing special that's a highway we're really fast cars go by and make a lot of noise and then that is another building so nothing too exciting there you can see why I usually keep my drapes closed I've got some cupboards here or cabinets whatever you want to call them and then I keep kind of my school binders down below my desk and obviously you can see the LED strips which I really like they add a nice kind of glow and touch to the room so anyways that has pretty much been it for this kind of vlog tour of my room sorry if this wasn't super exciting but I think it gives you a little bit of an insight into what I've been living in for the past eight months and I'm filming this video now especially because I'm gonna be moving out in probably 1520 days and I want to make sure that I got a quick vlog of what it's like even just for myself so I can look back show family show friends in the future at some point I think that's an interesting concept as well so anyways if you guys have enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and if you want to see other kind of vlog content like this please let me know as I do have this awesome camera which is the Panasonic g7 and I really want to use it for a bunch of other videos like this so with that being said I will see you guys in another video
