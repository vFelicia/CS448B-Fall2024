hello everybody and welcome to the fifth tech with tim code jam project showcase in this video i'm going to be showing you some awesome programming projects and announcing the winner of the fifth tech with tim code gem as well as the run up third place and a few other prizes that we have for this code gym if you want to learn more about the code jam and what it is make sure you join the discord server there will be a link in the description but a quick summary is about every two months in my discord server we run this competition it's called code jam we also call it timothon kind of combining tim and hackathon together and participants have about a month to actually work in teams of up to six people to create some type of project based on a theme and then submit that project at the end all those submissions were graded or judged we had a judging panel which is kind of some volunteers from the discord server i'm going to be showing you in this video the top five projects then selecting the three winning teams as well as showing you the two best projects that were hosted on replit which is the sponsor of this codegen so for this code jam we teamed up with replit some of you probably know them they are an awesome company super dedicated to helping the programming community and while an awesome place to work on code and to actually host projects so you can see brought to you by replit i'll go over to the website here you can see you can code create and learn together on replit it is a free collaborative in browser ide i've actually done some tutorials using replit in the past i know the replit team just really great guys and a great team in general and while it has a lot of awesome features on this platform so if you're on mobile if you just don't want to set up a development environment on your own you can use replic completely for free and actually all of the participants that were in the top five and in the top two replit projects are going to be getting free replit hacker plans which is kind of like an upgraded plan that allows you to do more stuff on replica anyways check them out from the link in the description seriously a great company and super happy that they were able to work with us for this code jam last thing i'll mention here is that you can actually host websites and projects with replit so that was kind of another category we added to this code jam the top two projects that were hosted using replit are going to be getting a prize as well they'll also be getting those hacker plans sweet so thanks again to replit now what i'm going to do is just talk to you about the theme of this code gem and then i'm going to show you all of the projects so the theme here was exploration you guys can kind of read through this doc if you want but pretty much anything that fits the theme exploration was you know valid to be submitted and then if we're looking at the criteria here for judging all of these projects we see they're judged on theme functionality code and intuitiveness now you can read more at this link all of this stuff i'll leave in the description in case you guys are curious and then if you scroll down here you can see all of the different teams and then you can view their submissions so without further ado let me go ahead and dive in here and show you the top five projects and then the top two projects hosted on replica alright so i've got the first project in front of me i will remind you that all of these projects were judged by a judging panel and then the amount of points they got was the average of what all of the judges gave them so i'm showing you the projects in the order of highest points to lowest points so this project had the most amount of points as you know decided by the judges all right so this first project is called solario or solar io it is by zenyu liang who has competed in a few other coding competitions as well nice to see you back here so let's go ahead and check it out and see what this project is about all right so immediately looks quite nice i like the ui it says explore the space discover the beyond all right let's press explore our solar system the world swirler came from the latin word soul which means sun nice nice i'm not going to read all of that let's see what learn more does oh this is kind of cool sun a star located at the center of the solar system gives me a definition let's have a look at the simulation here wow okay that's cool i love when you guys do these kind of animations and simulations and stuff it always looks really cool uh nice okay can i click on a specific planet or something oh it highlights the ring that this planet is in okay that's kind of neat let's go back let's see can i press on these oh that's cool let's let's go earth simulation okay it just shows me the same simulation nice very cool let's go planets okay that's what that is let's go do games fps is zero um oh there we go press space to start uh this is kind of cool okay how do i move here oh the arrow keys move me around okay my only complaint is that it doesn't oh i can't hold the arrow keys it's just kind of laggy and i guess i'm trying to avoid the asteroids here okay that's neat nice oh wow okay this guy's following me around okay interesting game i'm not going to play through the entire thing because i don't know how long that is let's go to news here news about space learn more okay this just brings me to another website uh that has space news but that is coolspace.com nice and contact okay i guess i could send an email to them if i want i don't think i'm missing anything i mean this is the explore page explore now brings me to this yeah okay i think that is it all right nice overall really clean cool project i love the idea here exploration was obviously the theme this is very explorative it's giving me a lot of cool information and i like the fact that you have a lot of different kind of unique things in here you have games you have planets everything looks clean very good job on this project alright so project number two is in front of me here this is called booksplore a place to enjoy books i guess to explore books very nice and if we look here we see four contributors i'm not going to read the names but you guys can have a look at them right there and let's go ahead and head over to the website bookexplorer.tech all right so it looks like i need to sign in here so i will do that but first let's just look at the home page a platform for you to explore books with your friends experience whole new world of books all in your browser get started now all right so brings me to this page right here looks like you don't have any activity to show try searching for books or following users on our explore page okay let's go to explore search for a book let's go how to win friends and let's see if that shows me the one that i'm looking for how to win friends and influence people nice let's click on that let's go preview okay oh and that actually brings me the page where i guess i could preview that book nice let's go back here and let's have a look at what else i can do i can read the i guess blurb of the book i can look at reviews or i can write a review i guess for this book very nice and then it shows me all this other information which is cool okay published publisher page count language very nice okay let's go back to explore i guess oh now it has recommendations for me that's kind of cool only show books which are available for download sure we can do that let's search another one that i like happiness add vantage okay uh nice happiness advantage that's another one that i read that was good read online oh cool it actually shows the pdf right here i can just read the book i guess i didn't need to buy it nice okay let's go back to dashboard it shows me the ones that i've read and then i can click on that let's go back to dashboard here looks like you don't have any activity to show i'm not sure what activity would show up here but i think i've pretty much explored no pun intended uh what this actually does really cool website neat idea and yeah that just seems like a cool thing i feel like i'm missing something because i think it should show me something in my dashboard here for activity uh but either way being able to look up books read them online get recommendations a very cool idea nice work on this project all right so i've got the third project in front of me here this one is called plain explore it's a website that helps you meet the aircraft world it is by these two contributors right here so let's go ahead and click into it and see what it looks like all right join the plane world or planesworld sorry and then features let's click on features and these are the three features it has so take a look at the planes flying around the world scan all planes that are nearby find all future flights that match your settings okay let's click into globe exploration uh nice it's showing me a globe here okay that's kind of cool looks like it's loading or we're lagging can i can i move this around okay i can move it around and i can look at different planes and it shows me all the planes flying above that's kind of crazy when you see how many are going above at one point in time like just constantly flights going on okay let's see what happens if i move this slider um can i can i move this for some reason i can't move this slider okay i got the slider to work now i just cleared my cache but this is just like really really laggy like to the point where like my computer is like literally lagging using this even getting out of the tab uh but it does seem to be working i'm not really sure what this earth hour is supposed to do i think it just changes like the amount of light that's currently on earth because it doesn't when i was moving it doesn't seem like the plans were moving at all anyways let's just go on to the next feature now because this one is just lagging my computer like crazy uh scan nearby okay let's check this one out i'm not going to get my location because i don't want you guys to know where that is let's look at can i go to street maps style or let's change it to hybrid oh that's cool okay so it changes the actual map style let's zoom out and let's find planes in this location within 100 kilometer radius okay zoom out and that's cool okay so it shows me the plans that are currently flying above and i can actually click on them okay that's neat and i can see where it's coming from and where it's landing okay that's actually really cool and i guess these guys are currently on the runway and does it show me where it's going damn okay that's really cool this is a cool feature this is probably my favorite feature so far uh let's make the radius larger let's go to like 440 kilometers okay i actually think it starts showing me them before i press find and then when i press find it just puts the radius up there uh either way that's fine this guy shows me it's yeah it shows me all the information and then can i can i click more on this uh no okay that's just showing it to me nice okay that's really really cool this is a nice feature let's go back to the streets map and okay yeah it just changes the thing very nice okay let's go on to the next feature here which is the find flights all right so right now we're looking for a flight from these two airports which i don't know i'm going to change them to ones that i do know so let's look for one from yyz to let's just go lax famous airport let's change the date to be here okay currency can be us dollars and let's search okay it doesn't look like it's showing me anything it's possible maybe there's not a flight going from here uh what's the vancouver airport yv um actually i don't know what it's called i'm trying to look for another canadian airport uh is there a montreal airport i don't know what any of the other airport codes are uh let's go with just y yvz i think that's one see so i feel like these should be updating here to tell me what these are but it's not when i press search so maybe this feature is just not working because it's not showing me anything if this feature does work someone let me know in the comments but right now it doesn't seem like it is working i'll change this one more time and see okay let's change this date to the 26 search okay i i think this one's just not working so i'm going to skip over this okay let's go to the about page uh we have boat timothon repo okay nice little animations here oh that's cool when i move my mouse there's like a gradient that goes over it and then gives me a little explanation of how this works uh web application server configuration front end development nice nice nice and i think that's pretty much all i needed to look at here i see an issue in bug can i report it oh that's cool that they have these nice okay so i think that is plane explorer let's move on to the next project all right so i've got the fourth project in front of me here explore space like never before i'm not actually sure what the name of it is because i don't think this is the name of the project and that's just the name of the repo but it has an about page explore our solar system and some of the most common star constellations in the web by your own hands nice okay let's click on the link here and let's see what this looks like actually sorry i want to first show the contributors of this i want to try to do that for all of them these are the three contributors i believe uh although it says uh i'm for oh these are okay that's information about all three of the contributors nice nice size okay let's go back to the website and let's see what it looks like all right so i guess it is called uh pig oh des pigodes i i'm not really sure how to pronounce that doesn't really look like a word to me anyways let's check it out here explore the solar system like never before features solar system constellations and then it gives me the about the developers okay so let's go to solar system okay nice oh wow okay can i like zoom out of this geez this is cool okay this is a lot more fluent than the uh than the other one wow okay and i can see planets can i like go towards them uh looks like i can click on them oh no just gives me the information about the planets okay that's really cool oh can i move with the arrow keys or something i feel like i should be able to move here um i can't quite but that's fine nice okay this is neat i can click on all of the planets and see information about them name radius distance from sun it'd be nice if you guys had units here i assume this is in kilometers but i'm not quite sure regardless nice and cool okay let's go back to the other features here so let's go back let's check out constellations all right so this is the ursa minor or some major if i click on it oh it brings me to the wikipedia page that's cool is there anything else i can do here looks like it's just showing me two names that i can click on and it brings me to information about the constellations nice okay i think that's it i mean i might be missing something no features is there about is down here i guess that's it for this project nice work guys let's move on to the next one all right so i've got the fifth project in front of me here this one is called airborne and it is by krishna kant i apologize if i'm mispronouncing that i probably am mispronouncing that anyways let's go to the website and let's check it out all right one mile at a time discover the best holiday spots in the world adventure awaits nice okay let's go get your holiday spot also i already created an account on this website if you don't have an account it tells you you need to make one when you first sign in okay so i can see a bunch of different places here uh rome uh italy vacation city not sure exactly where that is sydney australia london england nice nice nice let's search for a place let's see what they have for canada okay niagara falls nice banff whistler okay those are the only three places uh oh this is a contact field okay that makes sense uh let's just go to niagara falls learn more and let's see it gives me a little description gives me the weather 20 degrees right now sounds about right and i guess this is where i would leave a review let's just say test does this work question mark let's give it four stars uh send message um oh it does okay nice so it does actually show up there cool sweet let's go back to locations let's just look at another one here let's favorite this favorite this let's go to new york city learn more okay looks like i can favor this one as well can i click on this hashtag yes okay that's cool so then it shows me all the other hashtags that have hashtag food very nice alright let's go to profile tim's profile this is a place that i visited this is my search history and a few of my favorite places and then one of my reviews and i guess i can delete it just by pressing x awesome nice website let's go to the contact page okay just brings me down here to this form and i guess that's about it awesome nice website looks really cool some great information there i like the fact that you can leave reviews and you have hashtags just a lot of features on this website so nice job all right so now it is time for me to talk to you about the top two projects that were hosted on replit all of these team members will be getting a free replit hacker plan as well as all the other projects that i've showed you that were in the top five and uh there'll be some prizes for these projects as well all right so the first best project that was hosted on replit is the one i actually just showed you which is airborne so that makes my life a little bit easier i'm not obviously going to go demo the project again but they were the top project that was hosted on replit you can see that this actually hosts on replies.repple.com and you can look at all of the code directly on replit if you go to the submissions page on the timathon website all right the next best project that was hosted on replit is fact explore so you can see obviously we're on replit right now and what this allows you to do is actually explore different facts in israel it is legal to bring bears to the beach okay that that's interesting there is an uninhabited island in the bahamas known as pig beach which is populated entirely by swimming pigs okay these are kind of fun facts fifty percent of apartments in los angeles don't come with a fridge really this is legal as fridges are considered an amenity and therefore landlords are not required to provide one damn mount rushmore cost less than 1 million dollars to construct took 14 years to build from 1927 to 1941 and took 400 workers wow okay these are actually some pretty interesting facts oh of course this is what the about page is i'm sure you guys are going to get a laugh from that and this is by cry menzin uh again probably mispronouncing that but nice work you are the second winner for the top projects hosted on replay all right so now what you guys have all been waiting for the top three winners of the code jam before i get into those i will quickly mention that all of these projects have been great in fact i looked at a lot of the other projects that weren't in the top five you guys have done a great job i hope you're going to compete in future code gems and for any of you just watching join the discord server take a look at the code gem consider teaming up with someone it's really a great opportunity to practice your skills alright so let me hop over to the other screen and i will show you the top three winning projects all right so coming in at third place for the fifth tech with tim code jam is drum roll please add some suspension editors airborne airborne is number three so the reason i picked this project for number three is i thought this was a good idea this project is unique i haven't really seen any other ones like this that are actually related to exploring different locations that you could go and visit everything worked everything was relatively polished the ui looks pretty good we have lots of lots of features like hashtags learn more visited which i can click on i have my profile that stores my favorite cities my search history i just thought overall it was a good job everything seemed to work and that's one of the big things for me when i go on these projects i want stuff to be intuitive i want stuff to work and i shouldn't have to read through your entire readme instructions to be able to navigate and use the website so really good job congratulations i'll put up the contributors on the screen for this project now i'm going to announce the second place project so the second place project is drum roll please solario or solar io this project was really well done i'll just kind of go through it again and show you what it had so it had the different planets here you could click on them and get information about them and you can kind of scroll through them you can look at a pretty basic simulation that shows you the orbits and relative speed of these planets and then there was a game on here that you could play right so this kind of space shooter game won't go through it but well done also had news about space contact information everything was polished everything worked lots of feature features fit the theme very well and the reason this got second over third was just because i thought it looked a little bit nicer it looked a little bit more professional and you know it's my opinion my bias that's why i picked this for number two all right so coming in at first place drum roll please is books explore now i'm not gonna lie when i first opened this i was a little bit underwhelmed because it seemed like there should be more features than i was looking at but as i started actually looking through this website more when i wasn't recording i noticed that there was a lot more that you can do with it and you can see here that people actually just started following me so that's why i was confused with the activity tab i didn't realize like something like this could occur and when i click on these people's profiles you can see that actually shows me all of their reviews shows me the book that they reviewed i can click on any recent books that they've looked at here it shows me all the people they're following i can scroll through all of their followers their reviews i can follow them like that and now if i go over to explore i can actually search for users as well so this was a user that i'd found previously if i go to users you can see i can find him click on him and well there's a lot more features to this than i originally thought and i just really like this idea of kind of encouraging people to read review books just seemed really cool the account is working i can click on my profile i can see my little hashtag name it just seemed like this was the most featurerich and looked like the most amount of work went into this project at least for me i also like the fact that i can read the book directly online there's a lot of features here and more than i originally found so i apologized during the demo i didn't see all of this but thank god i looked at it again because obviously that would change my decision on where this should be ranked so congratulations guys on first place now last thing i will say for these last two projects here you guys did an awesome job in fact almost all of the projects i saw were really really well done please don't be discouraged you came fourth fifth uh the reason why these did not make it in the top three was just simple stuff like this right i feel like there should be an image here this fine flights feature didn't work it was just didn't feel polished didn't feel finished and even though it might have had some more impressive features than some of the other projects as soon as you throw something in there that doesn't work or is broken that immediately kind of you know ruins the reputation of the project if that makes any sense and please take that as feedback i'm not trying to dis or roast your project just trying to help you improve for the future looking at this one here this one was well done as well i just thought it was pretty simple some of the other projects were a little bit more advanced had some more work that went into them and that's why i picked them but regardless you guys are saying you're only 14 years old so congrats on that that's really really impressive especially at that age all right so with that said i think i'm going to end the video here those three winning teams and the top two projects hosted on replit as well as i guess the fourth and fifth place team because they're getting replaced hacker plans i will reach out to you with information on how to claim your prize that will be through discord anyone who's watching this who wants to compete in future code gems join the discord server there'll be announcements and all kinds of information there you can ask the staff team you can ask other members and they'll tell you everything that you need to know all right i hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe the channel thanks to everyone for participating and i will see you in another youtube video you
