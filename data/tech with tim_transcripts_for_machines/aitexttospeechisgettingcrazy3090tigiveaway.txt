foreign so I think many of you will agree with me that one of the most frustrating things in the world is communicating with an AI for example you pick up the phone you call your bank or you call some company you deal with you get directed to this really robotic voice that asks you a bunch of questions and I don't know if it's just me but I have to repeat myself countless times to this AI before it actually understands what I'm saying and then it directs me to a human where I just have to reexplain it anyways very very frustrating and while I just wish the AI was better now that's kind of why I'm excited to share with you this video where I'm gonna demo some of the recent advancements in texttospeech and speech to text it's pretty crazy how accurate the speech to text is and how good some of the voices sound now for texttospeech and the best part of this is that whatever I'm showing you here you guys can actually go use and you can customize it based on your domain and the application that you're building now before I get into that I need to show you this very heavy box that I'm holding which is a signed 3090 TI now this is signed by Jensen who is the CEO of Nvidia and if you watch through this whole video I'll share with you you how you can enter to win this massive GPU alright so let me share with you the Texas speech and speech to text advancements I was discussing now this is provided by Nvidia I've teamed up with them for this video hence why I have the GPU which I'll tell you how to win in a second and I'm going to show you the Nvidia Riva or Riva kind of toolkit slash SDK now I believe it's Riva I don't know exactly how you pronounce it but this is a GPU accelerated SDK for building speech AI now the cool thing about this is that you can customize this for your use case so if you're a specific business and maybe you have some products that aren't dictionary words you could actually train that into the model so that it can understand those and then it can actually speak those back properly so it's pretty cool how it works and again you can kind of tweak it and make it really custom to what kind of application you're working on so I'll just show you a very quick example here you can see I have some text typed in hello world my name is Tim I'm making a video right now let's try the male voice and then I'll try out the US Voice or not the US voice hello world my name is Tim and I am making a video right now there you go so it still sounds a little bit robotic but this is a lot smoother and kind of softer than your typical robotic voice I feel like it's not as harsh on the ears now let's see the female one hello world my name is Tim and I am making a video right now so there you go in my opinion sounds better than your typical texttospeech and if I go here to just like a random texttospeech website that I popped up I can say hello world my name is Tim and I am making a video right now okay let's just fix that let's see how this one sounds hello world my name is Tim and I am making a video right now so I feel like that's a lot more noticeable in terms of being a robotic voice so again this is a random texttospeech I popped up but hopefully that gives you a decent comparison in terms of the difference between the voices so this is cool and all but texttospeech just kind of always existed it's just been the quality of the voice what I think is much cooler is actually the speech to text so let me delete all this or let me just refresh this page I have this kind of internal demo that Nvidia gave me and I'll show you that I can pick a model here for whatever language I'm going to speak in so in this case it's going to be English and I can just transcribe whatever I say into the microphone and it will happen in live time which is pretty cool there's really no delay so let's do this here hello world my name is Tim I'm just testing out this speech to text I want to see how accurate and good this model is I usually speak pretty fast so let's see if it can keep up with me and if it can handle all of the words that I'm saying now I do speak clearly compared to a lot of other people but already I can see this is pretty impressive and it's kind of automatically adjusting itself as I go through and adding in say grammar punctuation pauses other things that I add in the text so there you go I've just paused it here but you can see it's pretty good and uh you know it messed up a few words but I think that's fairly common it's adding in the commas it has the proper uh what do you call it capitalization punctuation grammar Etc and I mean you guys can read through and see how accurate it was but I think that's pretty cool and this is definitely better than a lot of other uh Speech and text models I've used in the past and again you guys can use this for free like you can just use the SDK I'll link this in the description continuing we have what's known as the speech synthesis now I think this is like an experimental or kind of new addition because they don't have it directly on the website it's just a demo that they've given me uh access to but what I can actually do here is I can modify the text and change like the pitch or the rate of speed so that I can really customize what output is coming uh from my Texas speech model so for example let's make this first part look really fast so I'll just go rate uh 200 percent okay let's make maybe this part here higher pitch so like negative two pitch and let's generate that read off or something like texttospeech TTS neural voices that you state of the art spectrogram generation and vocoder models Riva pipelines are customizable and optimize addition real time Riva TTS takes raw text as input and can return audio chunks as soon as they are generated in streaming mode or at the end of the entire sequence in batch mode so there you go you get the point right I think it's not perfect yet but it's kind of cool that you can go in and with like almost HTML tags here you can adjust the different words and the tempo and the pace of the pitch and all that and I imagine the future they'll have some other uh what do you call it I guess parameters here that you can tweak so that's really the main content of the demo that I had for you guys obviously I could do some other text but I think you get the point here just trying to show you that this Tech has really come a long way at least from when I used to mess around with Texas speech and speech to text and all that kind of stuff this is something you can use in your projects if you want again it's called Nvidia Riva I'll leave a link to it and you can actually set up your own Pipeline and add in your own words and change the voice these are just you know these standard demos now you could just use a pretrained model as well if you don't want to go through all of that work but obviously if this was like for your business or something you'd probably want to tweak this a little bit more and make it really customized to what you're actually doing alright so now I'll quickly tell you how you can win the 3090 ti so of course Nvidia is hosting their GTC again this year which is the global technology conference happening from the 19th to the 22nd there's all kinds of amazing speakers all kinds of workshops tutorials seminars sessions Etc you can learn pretty much whatever you want related to technology Ai and just the future of computing at this conference and the way to enter to win this 39 DTI is to Simply register for this event which is completely free you do not need to pay for this I'll leave a link to it in the description and then just fill out the really short Google form that I have in the description that says that you've registered for the event just let me know what sessions you plan on attending and then I need your emails that I can reach out to you if you are the winner and we can coordinate shipping I will ship anywhere in the world I will cover all of the customs duty taxes whatever it may be I will make sure that you get the GPU so that is it register for the GTC fill out the Google form again I just need to do that so I can get your email and then about a week after this event ends I will pick a winner and I will reach out to you and send you the 3090 TI now before I hop off here I'll just quickly scroll through a few of the sessions you may be interested in here for the GTC so they have all kinds of topics here like computer vision conversational AI that's kind of what we're talking about here right like texttospeech speech to text cyber security data center data science obviously deep learning neural networks all the kind of stuff that Nvidia does and supports with their Hardware Healthcare video streaming autonomous vehicles anything that you can think of that's kind of future of tech is going to be covered here really cool place to be and again you're going to learn quite a bit if you attend some of these sessions and pretty much all of them are free so with that said I'm going to wrap up the video here obviously I wanted to share with you this 3090 Ti giveaway and talk to you about some advancements in texttospeech and speech to text hopefully that was helpful and you guys can see some uses for this technology and your own applications with that said look forward to seeing you in another YouTube
