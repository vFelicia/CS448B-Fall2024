hello everybody and welcome back so what I'm gonna be doing in this video is walking you through my remote work setup now this is an absolutely ridiculously overkill setup I'm valuing it at probably about twenty five thousand Canadian dollars just because I've been accumulating all these items which you guys gonna see throughout the video for the past probably five years and just keep in mind that this setup that I'm about to show you is for my remote work which I'm actually gonna be doing at Microsoft this summer as a remote intern software engineering intern as well as for filming YouTube videos this is the YouTube set and any other work that I would need to do at home I pretty much live in this setup which I'm gonna show you right now and that is why I've invested so much time and so much money into building it so with that being said let's go ahead and get into my remote work setup alright so what I'm gonna do is just walk around my setup and just talk about things as we get to it's gonna be very casual informal video I really have anything planned so you know I might miss some things but let me know in the comments if you guys have any questions so you gotta see that this is the main set we got some nice foam on the wall I've got a little workstation in the righthand corner here this is kind of my filming set so like this kind of angle here when I'm talking in a video and this is actually the setup for my new podcast called time out with Tim so if you're watching this video the first episode of my new podcast is live it's on a second YouTube channel in video format and it's also on Spotify Apple music anchor like any other platform you can think of it's available on there so please do go check that out I think you guys gonna find it interesting it's just talking about programming technology how I got into coding how I am you know tech with Tim the fulltime student working at Microsoft running this YouTube channel and just have some interesting guests on there as well so please do go subscribe to that second youtube channel even if you guys don't plan on watching it and just support me because this is something that i'm quite excited about starting so this is the podcast set up so i'll go through the first most important thing which is the audio interface so say quadchannel audio interface which takes input from this XLR microphone from this XLR microphone and from this computer when we have any guests on so I am planning on having some guests from the tech space maybe from some other fields as well it's not just gonna be tacky it's gonna talk about like work ethic life finance like things like that as well and the idea here is that we have this kind of connector that goes into the Mac so that we can send audio to the Mac and get audio from the Mac and this is a 2019 MacBook Pro so this is the 16 inch version really nice the display is just gorgeous and the keyboard they did a way better job on it than the previous models so definitely recommend if you guys want to get a new laptop then I have a GoPro up here so this film's my brother if he's gonna be talking on the podcast so the idea is like if you guys watched Joe Rogan he's gonna be like the Jaime of the podcast so he's gonna sit here and do all the technical stuff look some stuff up if we need him to anyways let's get away from that now and go over here so this is my main kind of workstation slash YouTube filming area this is a custom ell desk that we built specifically for this room so this used to be a theater room you can see there's a projector here this little couch that used to be actually on this wall here and obviously the big projector screen so this is usually where we'd watch movies and stuff but we just decided that we don't really use it enough so let's convert this to the tech whatin studio so this is yeah custom L desk we finished it stained it built it by hands in here just went out and bottled the wood for it my dad's pretty handy so he pretty much did that for us you can see this is the road microphone we're gonna use for the podcast this is rode nt1 some of you may appreciate what this is it's on an a shock mount you can see again that's on the swivel so this like PS something rode swivel that's springloaded so the headphones again used for the podcast you can see the tripod this is usually where I'll have the camera kind of facing this way when we're filming a YouTube video so anyways let's go over to the workstation now which I'm sure some of you are more interested in so this is my big PC this is a custombuilt PC I'll talk about that in a little bit but I built that in like 2017 so it's getting outdated now then you can see I have a 27inch main monitor and a 24inch secondary monitor this is a 4k LG monitor I don't know the exact model of it and this one is an msi which is 1080p but it's 144 Hertz so I used to use that for gaming but then I put this one in the middle because I don't really do that much gaming anymore in terms of peripherals the main stuff obviously we have keyboard and mouse so this is my keyboard this is a bass keyboard for Q this actually has a Cherry MX brown switches in it really nice keyboard would really recommend it it's fully programmable so you can actually change the backlighting of every single one of these keys and you can set it up with different API so that like you can have for example these 10 keys up here representing the usage of your CPU you can have like the Escape key flash if you get a new email really cool keyboard I'm gonna do a review on that later probably in the month this is my mouse this is a SteelSeries rival 300 black or something like that zoom in and see if you can get that focused and that's on a fulllength SteelSeries mouse pad just figure out to stay consistent with that so let's talk about the computer then I'll go through some other peripherals this is again custom built so this is on a Corsair crystal series case it's tempered glass on for science and it's rocket an i5 7600 K so that's overclocked with this dual rowdy dual radiator water cooler and a 1066 gigabyte graphics card so this was an older build this about 2017 that I made this can see we have 16 gigs of ram it actually has four hard drives in it so two actual hard drives that are 4 terabytes and then 2 solidstate drives for my abun 2 and Windows operating systems so I can do a boot on there so these are RGB fans obviously probably my favorite part of the build is this front it looks really nice you can change what the fans do so there's some settings up here to do that and a power button and USBs and all that check out kind of the cable management I'll try to give you a sneak peek here you can see this monitors on a wall mount and now we'll talk about some of the other peripherals and items that I have so this is my beats pill this is kind of just my main speaker sounds really good I like listening to music when I'm programming so I usually have that on although now I can actually use the sound system from this theater so that's typically what I do so that's why I've got Spotify up here on my second monitor you can see it says listening on so knows which is the system we use for my house so I also have some ear pods I don't really use these anymore but I used to when I'm loose at school and actually walking around that's on a samsung wireless charger how ironic and then we have two lamps which are what I'm going to talk about now cuz these are really cool so this is a BenQ I believe it's called screen bar Plus and this is the control for it so you can see it goes on and off like that you actually change the brightness and the temperature of that lamp so let's change the temperature now to be like warmer or cooler and it just makes it easier to look at your monitor and gives you some light on the actual desk surface this is called the BenQ reading lamp so this lamp is similar to this the screen bar plus of course obviously it's bigger and it can swivel out and has a lot more adjustment but this does the same thing so you can actually hit this touch bar to turn on it off and then if I can get here you can do the brightness and temperature of the lamp as well so yeah I think we're getting temperature yet that's the temperature so then there's an auto setting you can hold it down it changes it automatically so I guess that leads me to the webcam here this is just a 1080p webcam it's what I use when I'm doing a facecam for any tutorial videos and other than that I guess all that's really left to talk about is this vigil spinner and my metal pen so these are my two kind of like fidget items that I always have on my desk they go with me everywhere I go when I need to focus I'll literally just pick this bad boy up and spin it around you can see how worn out it is I really need to get a new one and then I have this pen that I like to spin around it's like a metal pen so it's nice it has a nice weight to it when you're holding it obviously a coaster so I'm not getting any coffee stains or anything on my desk and then I'll walk you through kind of the bottom area here so I have this headset let's say Corsair gaming headset this is usually what I use just if I'm gaming I've been using it a little bit more now during this quarantine stuff but it's kind of old although is good headset it has like 5.1 surround sound or something on it there's a drawing tablet down here it's not too exciting but that's just what I use if I'm doing like some explaining videos like in whiteboard style and other than that I don't really know what else to talk about here I mean I have this lamp I have my tech with Tim mug you guys can purchase that from teespring there should be a thing underneath the video and then I'll just walk you through the underneath of my desk a little bit of cable management so trying to power all the stuff that I have is always very difficult I need to put like power bars inside of power bi bars inside of power bars you can see there's one there there's one that extends there that actually comes is this green cable that runs all the way over here to where other kind of extra random tech items are and then obviously I'm using blue outlets here and I'm using the power from underneath that desk to try not to short anything in my house so there is another power bar there you can see the cable management going on here and there is actually a network switch back there so that I can have all my different devices hardwired right into the the router of the modem so I'll do than that I think that's pretty much it for my text setup I mean I'll kind of just pan around here so you guys can continue to look at it but I hope this video gave you some motivation maybe some ideas for what you want to put in your text setup again keep in mind I've been collecting these items for the past five years so as much as this stuff is very expensive I'm valuing it at probably just over 20,000 Canadian all of the little things I have combined I mean remember I have like another laptop there an iPhone 8 another speaker a mini laptop here like an iPad like all that stuff it's because I've been collecting it for a long time and this is a business expense like these are investments to me to be able to make videos so ways that is pretty much been it OBS enjoyed the video if you did make sure they like subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys in another YouTube
