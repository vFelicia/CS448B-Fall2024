so the next thing you want to avoid if you want to become a faster programmer is restructuring and redesigning your code constantly now what I mean by that is you go in you just start coding a project you don't really think about what you're going to do and then halfway in the middle of your project while you're coding you're like damn I want to add this in I want to have this feature I want to create this new thing but the way that you've designed this so far does not allow for that to happen and now you have to redesign the entire document the entire code base to add this one feature to add something new before you start writing any code for somewhat of a large project or even a mediumsized project you should really plan out exactly what you're going to need what data structures you're going to need what kind of classes the interaction between objects and other data and pieces of information
