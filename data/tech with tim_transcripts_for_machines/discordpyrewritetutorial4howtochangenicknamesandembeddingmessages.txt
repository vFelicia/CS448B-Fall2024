hey guys and welcome back to their discord rewrite tutorial so in today's video when I would be showing you is how to change member nicknames how to embed messages so they look like nicer how to check and check for like swear words or stuff like that and delete those messages and I think that's about it for this tutorial now I do apologize as I wanted to show you guys how to do voice chat stuff and I was messing with it and I can get in the voice chat and I can leave the voice chat that's all fine but whenever I try to actually play any audio in that chat I'm getting a lot of issues and I messed around with it for about two hours this morning and it seems that I need to install some kind of library that I can't figure out so until I get that unfortunately I can't show you guys I need the voice chat stuff but if any of you know how to do that voice chat stuff please don't hesitate to let me know on discord or whatever on my forum on tech with Tim net because I'd be happy to have a look at that and try to do a tutorial on that but right now this will probably be the last video in the series until maybe I decide to continue it on later on so anyways let's go ahead and get started and I think the first thing I'm gonna do is tell you how to change someone's nickname because that's probably a pretty useful thing and it's actually not as intuitive as it seems from reading the documentation so to do this what we're gonna do or like what I'm gonna do is if someone tries to change their nickname to Tim I am just gonna change it back to what it used to be or if they didn't have a nickname before I'm gonna like make their nickname like you can't do that or something okay so to do this we need to do another event so I'm going to add client events and then down here I believe it is a sync define and then on underscore member underscore updates I think that's it and then it takes two parameters which is before if I spelt that correctly and after like that so we have before and after and what these are gonna represent is the member so it gives you a member I'm not sure if you've been reading the documentation but if you have you'll know what that means before and then afterwards and the afterwards will obviously have all changed properties so for example like a new nickname a new rule etc so let me actually bring this up to show you okay that's something else I was looking at be out on member update so it takes before and after and these are the things that will trigger this function to run so if they change their status the game they're playing an avatar and nickname or the rule so we're just gonna deal with nickname but if you wanted to see like if they were changing what game they're playing or status this will trigger for that as well just you know so she I don't know why the Bloods running right now but that's okay so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna get the nickname that they tried to change to write or that they did change you so I'll say um I'll just say after actually I don't know if I could use a Nick will say n is equal to after dot Nick okay now this is gonna stand for the nickname they attempted to change Jude now if they didn't change their nickname this after is gonna be set to none or it's gonna be set to the nickname they already work so we will do here is will say if and and we'll just do that which means if it's anything and it's not none because if it's none this this won't trigger and we won't go into this if statement meaning we're not going to change the nickname to what it was before if that makes sense so essentially this could be a non value because it's gonna trigger for five different things so if they don't change their nickname this will be none okay makes sense so if n so now what we'll do is we'll say if and lower so lowercase equals equals Tim then we will change this and we can even go as far as to say if it contains Tim so m dot lower dot count and then here we'll put Tim is greater than zero so if they try to put Tim anywhere in their nickname we'll just change their nickname back to what it was before so in here now we got to check if they had a nickname before so we'll say glass doesn't like the last nickname it goes with four dot Nick okay and then if last will simply say that there we're gonna edit their nickname so it is their last nickname and otherwise we'll just change their nickname to like a set value okay so if last so if they did have a nickname let's change it back so the way we do that is we're gonna say after dot edit I think it started it let me look here dot edit yep and then we're gonna do Nick equals and then what their last nickname was which would be last okay now if the didn't have a nickname before this wouldn't work obviously right or it would make their nickname none which we don't want so what I'm gonna do now is let's say they didn't have one before they tried to change it to that well too bad for them I'm gonna change their nickname to no you can't do that so to do that we'll just go to Nick equals no stop that like that okay exclamation point I think that he's allowed a new nickname well maybe let's remove it in case okay anyways so we'll do that and that's now gonna work to change nicknames now the thing is with this bought and I'll run it quickly and I'm actually I'll show you my phone because I'm gonna test it it has tits oh I already was messing with stuff here it has to have a higher permission than the person you're trying to change nickname so right now I actually went ahead and added two bought permission to this and I just gave it the administrator but if I try to change like the system owner or the server owner which would be me my own nickname it won't work it'll say there's a permission error because the bot doesn't have as high purpose a permission as Tim does so we can't change that so what I have to do actually is go to server settings go to what is it roles and I just created a new bot our new role cold bot so you can just literally click plus a new role give it a name and just make it administrator okay and then just assign that role to your boss to do that you go here you go plus and then you just give it that role and then that way now it'll be able to change like at everyone so like any person lower than the server owners nickname I think that makes sense to you guys so let's actually I was gonna test that wasn't it so I have a new another discord account on my phone and I'm just gonna type something I'm gonna try to change my nickname so actually I'll type something first I'm on my phone right now so you guys can see so high and you can see my nickname right now is yes so now I'll just change my nickname in here by just going change nickname and I'll try to change it to like Tim one two three okay so I tried to do that and that works really what's our issue here edit Nick equals last remembered edit was never awaited okay so that's what we had to do after out of that so we actually just have to go in this code here and go await because this is something that like could take a second right so we'll say oh wait like that and now if we close the bought and try it again hopefully this well this will fix this for us so we'll go to discard here and now we'll just try to change the nickname one more time so you can see right now my name is Tim one two three and we might run into an issue here but we'll see so change nickname to Tim one two three four I click Save and now you went back okay so the reason running to an issue is because my nickname okay I'll show you guys in a second it already contains Tim so it has like an issue but let's just make it tea so now you can see it's tea on my screen I don't know why I just pointed as if you guys we're gonna see that but now we'll change it back so change nickname and we'll make it Tim okay ready so if I click it it goes Tim and then it goes right back to tea so it doesn't let me change that nickname now if I didn't have a nickname so I think I can remove it it'll just get rid of it so that's there's my name okay and now if I try to change it so change nickname to like Tim and save it now it just says no stop that because I didn't have a nickname before so it just renames it no stop that okay makes sense I think so alright it's okay so what are we doing now so we've got the nickname thing down you guys can play with this as probably isn't the best way to do this especially if you already had a name that contains a Tim in it then like you would give you some issues but anyways what we'll do now is we'll work with deleting messages so let's say there's a few messages or a few things that if they appear in a message we want to delete them so for example I'll just going to say bad underscore words equals two and I'll put a list of words here and some bad words let's just make one bad okay bad and like stop obviously you can make these swear words if you want but I'm just not gonna type them out bad stop let's say 45 is a bad word okay so if we want um habit so it automatically like moderates these words and doesn't let them show up in a message strain we'll just delete the message if they ever appear in any of the messages so the way to do that is we'll just make a for loop and we'll loop through all these words and check if the message that was sent contains these words so let's say forward in bad underscore words like this if what do you call it will say message got content or actually we're going to do if word is in message content I think that will actually work maybe we went after this message content count word I think the other one would work as well but I want to be safe so this message account outward is greater than zero which means one of these words appeared in our messages then what we will do is well just print to the console and we'll say like a bad word or sad just so we know and then we're gonna actually delete that message so the way we do that is say message dot channel dot courage I think let me have a look that might not be actually what is known is that dot purge and then we're gonna put limits equals and in this case I'm just gonna put one now if you want to delete like a ton of messages you could put I think the max is 125 that you can do for deleting the you guys can play with that this is how many messages up we're gonna delete so in this case since I just sent one message where's gonna delete that one I mean that should work fine let's test this out so I stop run go back to discord now I can actually use this account and what were some of those ones that were bad 45 oh and oh our BOTS is is it online what are we getting channel delimit purge runtime ah we need to await this again by bad awaits that stop run okay maybe let's see this it works this time let's go 45 and there we go it just instantly deletes our and this is a bad word was said if I type bad hello like what's in the same sentence again it removes outward so obviously you'd probably do that with like swear words or maybe just some words you don't want people to say but that shows you how you can do that pretty easily okay last thing that I was gonna show you what was that I don't remember let's have a look I was gonna show you oh how we can embed messages yes okay so actually I have an example here see how I have like this message it looks like pretty decent compared to just like having the bots send like a standard message well show you how we can do this and this is known as embedding so we it's actually pretty pretty useful and it makes it look like decent you guys can see here so the way we'll do that essentially is I want if someone types help or like exclamation point help I want to show them that nice output with all the different commands like easy to see with a little description so we can do that as well just say if message dot content built that correctly equals equals and that exclamation point help like that what we'll do is we'll start that embedding process so I'm gonna say embed is actually equal to discord dot embed like this now inside these brackets this takes a title which I'm going to say is equal to a help like that okay so like help on but we'll do that and it takes a description as well now the description I'll just say some useful commands why not okay so to show you what these ones are that would be this is the title and this is the description and these are what it's going to be known as I'm gonna have to look at it a what is it called here field a field okay field so these are fields and we can add as many of these as we want and you'll see if I go full screen here they show up like dynamically so they're preside each other and it's just like a nice looking kind of output so the way we do the fields is we just say embed dot add underscore field and then for the field it takes a name and a value say name equals and for this one we'll do the first command which will just say is what hello and then for the value we'll set that equal to greets the user okay now if we have another one so embed dot add underscore field that would be our other command right so we should do like next to my exploit users probably need an equal sign there as well and then for value we'll just say exactly what it's going to do so little description so prints number users like that okay so now I think to show this yeah to show this what we need to do is we need to await a message dot channel dot send now we're not just gonna send in bed like you might think what we actually have to do is embed equals embed now that's it's kind of a weird thing as we named our variable embed but essentially this is just dictating what is gonna be embedded in the message now we also have to add this other one which is going to be content and this has to be equal to none because by default we're gonna be sending content so if we don't say anything it's gonna send like a blank message which I don't think you can do so anyways just add this content equals none and then embed equals in bed and if we stop and rerun our BOTS go to our discord server and we type exclamation point help let's see there we go so there we go so help on ball it says some useful commands greets the user prince number so users let's try hello here hi there we go so that is essentially all I'm gonna show you guys for the discord bots there is tons tons tons tons of things you can do go look through the documentation I will be honest it's not great and there's not that many examples on how to do stuff so it's kind of difficult to figure out but if you use you guys do find out how to join those voice channels and play music please let me know I'll like shout you guys out or whatever cuz I really want to know how to do that and I was having a lot of difficulties with it so what I appreciate that and other than that if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I may continue the series in the future but no promises on that
