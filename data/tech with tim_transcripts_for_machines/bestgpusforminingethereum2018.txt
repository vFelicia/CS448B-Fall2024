hey guys welcome back to another youtube video in today's video i'm gonna be talking about mining and the best graphics cards to use for mining aetherium so aetherium you can see right here we've got a price of 310 u.s. dollars and this hasn't been the highest price aetherium is hot it's been if I go to the oneyear mark here we can look at the graph and we've seen it skyrocketed up to almost 400 at some points and now we're just balancing out at about 300 so aetherium is definitely still here in the market place and there's a lot of people mining it and selling it so it's a great time to get in and start mining so that being said I'm just gonna be reviewing the performance versus the cost of some of the graphics cards on the market where the best graphics cards in my opinion on the market so let's get started right away just talking about the gtx 1070 so I've got this Amazon link up right here and you can see immediately the price well the stock price is six hundred ten dollars Canadian but right now it's on sale for five hundred sixty four dollars so the hash rate on this gtx 1070 is about twentyseven mega hashes stalk again this really depends on what model of card you get some of them you're gonna get lower you're gonna get twenty four twenty five some of them you're gonna get much higher you might even get to twenty nine and this is again just the stalk so if you were to overclock this card you could get a lot more performance out of it so personally I do recommend this card as it is a pretty hefty price but not compared to the the next cards that we're going to talk about so for example the 1080 Ti and this one will definitely get the job done and it is overclockable obviously as all graphics cards are and you can get about twenty seven mega hash stock so you can probably get it up to about thirty buy overclocking alright so let's get down to the next one now so now we're going to talk about the gtx ten atti so immediately we can see a huge price difference here almost double the price so again right now it's on sale but usually it costs eleven hundred dollars now the question here is is it worth it so the stock make a hash per second on this card is actually about 30 to make a hash per second again obviously depends on what company you're getting it from and if you get lucky with the card some card some different companies can just range by mega hashes just by the way that they're built in the quality so you're gonna get about thirty to stock again overclocking you can probably bump this up to about thirty seven I've seen some people getting thirty eight out of it which is pretty amazing so is it worth your money well yes or no so it's an extra $500 $600 and you're only getting about at max ten mega hash per second more and that's if you overclock it versus the gtx 1070 so i'll let you be the judge of that but personally I wouldn't get these cards remaining as they have a huge capital startup cost and especially if you're not a huge miner and you're only gonna have two or three cards in your rig this one is kind of too expensive and it does draw a ton of electricity too especially this model with the three fans so I would probably go with a ten seventy in this case okay so now that we've gone through the top two Nvidia cards let's go over to AMD so we're gonna start talking about the 480 so the RX 480 is not as good as the other cards I've talked about but for the price it gets the job done so a stock mega hash for this card is about between 22 and 24 mega hash per second now with these AMD cards you can actually modify the BIOS to get a lot more performance out of these cards and again you can obviously overclock them and get them up to about maybe 28 29 mega hash per second so personally I own one of these cards and it hashes for me at stock at about 23 mega hash per second and with overclocking I can bump it up to about 27 and again this one is used for 375 they're very hard to come by right now you can't really find too many new ones for a decent price I'd say new for this card is maybe around $500 if you can find it but you can also pick up a bunch of them on eBay and Newegg as well they have some Rx for eighties as well so now let's move on to the rx 5 II okay so as this is a model higher than the RX 480 you would assume it is a lot better well as it does get better mega hashes so it gets between 25 and 26 mega hash per second on stock there is an issue with this card that has been noticed so when you're mining aetherium there's something called the e posh so right now I believe we're on about 144 143 but as time goes on this card has continually gone down in performance so back in one at the 130 posh this card was getting about 30 mega hash per second and currently it's getting about 25 to 26 on stock so that's something to look at with this card when you're mining with it as time goes on the performance is gonna get worse now if we look at the price here it's cheaper than all of the other cards so is it worth it to get this card well if you're just starting up mining this isn't a bad card to get and you if you find out that you want to get better cards later on you could always sell this one and invest into a newer card maybe a 1070 or an Rx for 80 even though this one does hash more as time goes on again like I've said the performance is going to go down okay so now it's time for me to kind of rank which ones I think are the best in which one I would personally recommend so like I said before I have an Rx for 80 that's just because I got a really good deal on it buying it used but personally I would probably recommend the 1070 and this is just because of the performance pretty much and because of the cost so like I said we gets talked about 27 when you're overclocking you can probably get up to 30 even higher than that and right now in Canadian dollars the price is 564 dollars which is pretty expensive but compared to the 1080 is a much more reasonable price so getting a rig with six of these cards or five of these cards you can be making quite a bit of money per month and per year and definitely making you return back on this card whereas we go to the 1080 here we're only getting about three or four maybe even five making a hash per second more but for an extra four hundred five hundred dollars and in my opinion that's not really worth it especially if you're just starting out mine because you're putting a ton of capital up and we don't really know exactly where the markets gonna go with aetherium and if this card is gonna be able to sustain this super high mega hash as The Epoch go on so there you have it I've shaved kind of a quick review here of the top four cards remaining so we can go through it one more time we have the 580 D 480 the GTX 1080 Ti and then the gtx 1070 and this is the one that i would recommend if you're looking to purchase any of these cards i do have the link to all of these down in the description go ahead and click on that to load up Amazon and other than that have a nice night if you liked the video please like and subscribe and I will see you again
