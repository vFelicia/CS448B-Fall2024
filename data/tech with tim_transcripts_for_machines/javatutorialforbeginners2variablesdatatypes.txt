hello and welcome to video 2 in our Java programming tutorial series for beginners so you can see where we are right where we left off with printing two lines hello world hello world to the screen and in this video I'm gonna be going over variables and data types the absolute fundamentals we have to understand before we can move on to anything more complex so let's talk about what a variable is now a variable just like in mathematics is something that holds a value now in our case that doesn't have to be just a number it could be a string it could be a boolean an integer like we're gonna talk about the different values and those are what are known as datatypes or objects so let's start by just creating a variable to create a variable we need to first figure out what type our variable is gonna be in this case I'm going to start with an integer and then we're going to go through all the different types and talk about the differences so to start we're gonna type int declaring that this variable that we're about to type out is going to be an integer we're then going to give a variable name now the variable name should contain typically just letters and underscores now I believe you can use numbers as long as it's at the end but our purpose we're not gonna do that when we create a variable name you have to make sure you do not use any spaces and you don't use any special characters as well so I'll go through a few examples of valid variable names and invalid variable names so a valid variable name for example could be hello that's valid because we don't have any spaces we don't have any special characters and there's no numbers and okay now an invalid variable name would be something like hello name okay this whole thing as our variable name is invalid because it contains a space now if I try to put like a what do you call it % like this or I try to put like an asterisks that is not a valid variable name so don't use any special characters you can end with an underscore you could start with an underscore if you want to but we're not going to be doing that in this case typically when you create a variable if you want to make a name be like two words the way you do it is you type like hello and then you would do a capital and then the next word or you would do an underscore representing a space then next word okay so that's enough about valid variable names not super important right now so I'm gonna create my first variable into hello world and that's gonna be equal to by participating an equal sign whatever integer I want so in this case I'm going to say five and then remember in Java whenever we end the line so this is just saying my integer HelloWorld is equal to five we need to terminate with a semicolon so there we go and we see we get int our variable name is now highlighted in yellow and there's no issues so if I hi let's just see what it says this very is never used okay that's fine so we've officially created a variable the variable name hello world now points to the integer five so to prove this to you I am simply going to print out the value of hello world like this okay I'm gonna say system dot out its a comma isn't it system.out.println and what we're gonna do is we're gonna say okay so hello underscore world that's our variable name and that variable holds five so when we print this we should be printing five the way this works in the computer right is it says okay hello world let's see where hello world is it's up here alright hello world is equal to 5 so we print that ok so there we go and we get 5 printed down here in the bottom of the screen now I want to show you something quickly and this is just gonna go this is a really important fundamental thing a lot of people don't talk about in programming tutorials and it's kind of like order of operations or execution so I am going to now put my variable underneath my system dot out dot println ok so I'm first gonna print hello world and then I'm gonna set hello world is equal to 5 hopefully you guys have realized what the issue might be here if not I'll talk about it really quickly and the problem is that I am trying to print the value of hello world before I've declared it because the in programming the way things work is unless you otherwise specify we're gonna be reading from top to bottom and left to right just the way you'd read a book right so we first read this line system dot out dot println a hello world and then we create hello world so here we don't know what hole the world is so if we try to do this you can see it warns me there's an error okay you know what there's Nair let's proceed anyways and you can see that down here we get a bunch of red text and it says we call it hello world cannot be resolved to a variable because we haven't yet declared that variable so we have to make sure whenever we're referencing or using variables that we first have them declared somewhere above our like the line that we're using them in okay so there we go we've created a variable hello world we print that to the screen now let's create a few different variables and talk about what these types are so in case I didn't really specify int stands for integer and that pretty much stands for any number that does not have a decimal point so as soon as I put a decimal like this like 5.0 this actually becomes a new data type and that data type is called a float now float stands for a floating decimal point which means any number that has a floating decimal point so I'm going to say float let's see num2 is gonna be my variable name is equal to and in this case I'm going to say 5.0 what's the issue here add casts from double to okay one second where is it double okay sorry I made a mistake there we're just gonna type double here as the name okay not float don't worry about float right now we'll talk about that later so anyways we have double num 2 equals 5.0 now double is exactly what I was explaining before anything that has a floating decimal point so even though this is still the exact same values this in terms of mathematics because it has a floating decimal point in our computer isn't referenced as a double okay now there's some other data types as well that we're gonna talk about so we have int we have double we also have something called boolean now boolean is true or false and these are gonna be really important in the next few videos that we talked about so boolean I'm just gonna say B as my variable name is going to be equal to and in this case I'm going to say true and again make sure I'm putting my semicolon now there's only two values that a that your a boolean data type can have that is true or false now why these are important is because based on the value of a boolean type we're gonna be doing things later in our program like if B was equal to true we're gonna print something otherwise we won't print something so that's really important another data type that we have is known as char now char is any character okay so this is a little bit different from string that I talked about in the last video but I'm going to talk about string as well so I'm gonna say char C is equal to and whenever we create a character there's two ways that we can do it we can do it with Unicode which you probably don't know what that is or we could do it with single quotation marks so by just simply hitting the single quotation marks we can put one letter in the single quotation marks and that is a character because that's what char stands for a character so like something on your keyboard in quotation marks now a character could be for example 9 in quotation marks so that's still a valid character because it's in quotation marks it's different than the number like 9 if you're if I were to type that up here ok so any letter or character that goes in quotation marks is a char now we have to be careful because chars can only be one one character if I try to do like 0 3 you can see that we're getting read text and job is yelling at us and it's saying no that's not allowed because we can only have one thing all right now I just want to show you I want to go over again really quickly what the main differences between this 9 and this 9 up here we've declared we're gonna have an integer name Tolo world and it's set equal to 9 okay that's what it is this is a character and since this is in quotation marks this is not the same thing as 9 the way like the datatypes really do matter in this sense okay so I'm just gonna change this back to like H something for now ok char c equal to H so that is extremely important now string this is another data type it's a different kind of data type which we'll talk about in a second but to make a string we do string I believe with a capital we'll see and then we give a name so for our variable in this case I'm gonna say STR is equal to and then at this time for a string we used double quotation marks okay and I'm just gonna say Tim in here so chars single quotation marks and strings are double quotation marks okay and strings can contain anything in them so I could have like six seven and three underscore star that's a completely valid string we can put any characters as long as they're with inside of these quotation marks okay same thing with the character if you put a nine in a string this is different than a nine like this okay so these are our main datatypes there are a few other ones but I'm not going to go into them right now because they they're a bit more complex than then we can handle right now so pretty much though you might notice that this string is highlighted as a different color than these and see int as orange doubles Orange boolean's Orange chars Orange why is string blue now the reason it's blue it's because it's a different type of data type these four dog types I talked about up top here are known as primitive and wow I really just did that I'm used to typing Python primitive data types okay and what that stands for is not changeable okay and we're gonna talk more about primitive data types and not primitive data types later on but just know that these ones I talked about here are known as primitive in Java and this one is not primitive okay so anyways let's just see now torrenting out like some of these data types like what we get when we print them to the screen right so if I print for example C to the screen well you should guess what we're gonna get we get H cuz that's C if we print STR we get 9 and so on now last thing I want to show you with variables is that we can actually make variables equal to other variables and we can add variables and we can subtract variables and this we're gonna be doing a lot in the next video but I want to just quickly introduce you so for example I want to create a new integer K let me say new integer and I'm gonna call it let's just call it Tim why not now I want this integer to be equal to 9 okay but I don't want to type nine out what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna type hello on your screen underscore world like this now what we've essentially done is we've taken the value from hello world and we've assigned it to Tim so now if we were to print Tim to the screen we get the value 9 now if I want to print hello world to the screen you can see that we are still getting the value of nine so now Tim points to hello world which points a nine right so Tim is equal to nine and hello world is equal to nine and we can do that and we can add variables together we can subtract variables we can do all kinds of cool things and that's really the point of variables right so we just have to make sure when we're doing this for example that we don't do something like this string Tim equals hello world you can see here now it says cannot convert from int to string because the data type string is obviously not the same as nine so we can't do that until we learn about something called typecasting which will be in a future video so anyways that has been it for this video I hope you now understand what variables are how they work and how we can create them in Java in the next video we're gonna be talking about operations so adding variable subtracting dividing doing stuff like that and then we'll be moving on to some more advanced stuff as always if you guys liked the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe to the channel I will see you again in the next one
