many people ask me should I learn python or JavaScript now both of these languages are a great choice they do have different use cases python is known for its Simplicity and readability and it's a great language for beginners it's also great for doing backend web development data science machine learning and then automation tasks now on the other hand we have JavaScript which is the goto language for web development allowing you to create interactive websites and applications it's also gaining a lot of traction and serverside development thanks to node.js if you want to be a full stack or frontend web developer then you should learn JavaScript if you're looking to do something else that I'd probably recommend starting with python as you can always learn JavaScript after both of these are great options it really just depends on what you're doing if you're more into backend development Learn Python if you're more into the front end and full stack applications learn JavaScript
