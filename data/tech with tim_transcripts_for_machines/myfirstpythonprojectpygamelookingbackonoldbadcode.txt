hello everybody and welcome back so we're not the YouTube video so in today's video what I'm going to be doing is reviewing / reacting to an old Python project of mine notice a project I made in grade 11 and this is actually the first ever real Python project of mine what I mean by realist it's the first one that I was kind of proud of it was the first one that I really put a lot of effort into and that was kind of passed like four or five hundred lines so actually something that took more than just a few days this took a few weeks and maybe actually even about a month to make so keep in mind I did this when I was about sixteen seventeen and the reason I'm reviewing this is because I know that I made so many horrible mistakes in the codebase and I think it's gonna be kind of funny to go back and look at how much I've changed since then and then point out some of those mistakes and hopefully by doing that you guys can look at a few mistakes that you should not make one year programming so with that being said let me actually go ahead and do a quick demo of this game and then after that we'll get into the the code review so this is the game it's called super minigolf and this is largely inspired by a game on the App Store called super stickman golf I used to play this game all the time with my friends at lunch probably in grade 11 and grade 12 and well that's why it kind of inspired me to make this I wanted to recreate my own version of it on the computer alright so I'm in the game now I'm not sure if you guys can hear the sound effects I have them kind of faintly paying in the playing in the background but there is some music and sound effects when you do specific things in this game and the first thing I'll show you is actually the ball shop now I won't spend too much time on it but here you can equip different balls so you can the kind of the objective is you collect coins and then you can purchase different balls and you can see I can equipped let's say like the Aqualand here so I'll use that one if I wanted to purchase one I could select it it will bring up this window and then I can press yes or no so let's actually get into the game we'll start my first level we can see we go to level 1 and I'll just play through level 1 so you guys get an idea of kind of how the physics work and the bounces and then I'm gonna skip through a few of them and show you some of the later levels because those ones are kind of cool so immediately you'll notice there's kind of a power bar in that bottom left hand corner and to shoot the ball it's just all with the mouse you press down once starts the power press again it locks the power and then it shoots you aim by just moving the mouse around you can go close far it doesn't matter and then there's power ups so there's power shop and sticky ball those the powerups that you can use so you'll notice that here there's actually this pink or purple II kind of substance on the wall and that is a sticky pad so if you hit that you actually stick to it and then this laser does laser is another hazard so if you run into it you lose a stroke now I'm just gonna skip through all the levels and get to kind of the end screen here just to show you what that looks like but again a really cool game I made all these levels myself a little bit of inspiration from that original game but you'll see when we get to the code review how difficult it was to actually kind of design these levels even though it is this little 2d thing there's all these different objects we have to check for collision with and while it gets pretty complicated pretty fast and lets go and it says noobest course completed 40 14 strokes par 40 score negative 26 coins collected to press the mouse to continue and that is the game demo so let's go ahead and get into the code review after a quick word from our sponsor I need to thank simply learned for sponsoring this video and introduce you to the machine learning certification course this

description all right so now we're onto the code review which is gonna be very interesting because I do not remember exactly how I wrote this code so it's gonna be yeah interesting to say the least on how I'm actually going to understand what's going on in here I'll try my best to explain it but again this was 34 years ago so god knows if I'm gonna remember what happened in here anyways we can see that I have four Python files here so I have courses dot PI main dot PI physics dot PI and start screened out PI this is where all the codes written I did not organize things all nicely into different classes with a structure which I probably should have done because you're gonna see that main dot pie is like a few thousand lines of code and then I have been nice this is just the Python virtual environment I have sounds at least I put all of the sounds in their own folder so there is actually music and sound effects for the game but I can't play them just cuz I don't know if they're copyright or not so I don't want to uh to risk that and then images these are all the images of all the different things in there so like the icon like the laser there was some other levels where I added some more things that we didn't see the power bar sand the title right water all these different things so that is all the images and now let's actually just get started on let's keep the smaller module first so this is the physics module so as you noticed all of the stuff in this game actually worked off of like pretty realistic physics like the bounce was working pretty good flying through the air was working pretty well and this is based strictly off of projectile motion which you learn in grade 11 so since I actually knew projectile motion because I was pretty good at physics in high school I was able to actually implement a fairly realistic kind of physics simulator that I wrote from scratch I didn't use any module or anything from this and this was the main kind of I don't know module or brains behind the physics so ball paths we have a start X a start Y a power and an angle and the amount of time and this simply calculates at what like what coordinate this ball should be at given it start at this X that Y had a power angle and time and then of course gravity is built in at negative 9.8 meters per second which I probably should have changed that but actually I ended up working fairly well for this project so you can see this is ball path that's what that function does find power this just finds the amount of power based on where that line was on the power meter because that angle the angle off the line determines how much power are you gonna shoot with so I had to figure that out in here find angle I don't actually know what that does I don't remember and then max time don't remember what that does either but those were this is like the physics module and now I'll go into maned up high and then I'll talk about the other ones so maned up high let me just scroll through here is what is it oh yes oh it's a thousand lines of code so I exaggerated a bit but it is a signal an amount of code considering none of its like broken up into functions at all it's just this massive massive while statement others too so there's one for the Start screen and then there's one that just boom for the entire main game loop so you can imagine that like if I want to fix anything oh my god this is gonna be like literally impossible trying to figure out where anything is because there's like Elif Elif Elif Elif Elif Elif everywhere so not the most readable thing well we'll start from the top to bottom and then we'll keep going alright so I load up all the stuff I'm fine with this all these images I probably have made these capitals as they're constants but that's fine we have our global variables here yeah I didn't put anything in classes this was all like this is a very functional was it very functional program if you want to put it that way and yeah so loading all the music power up variables fonts and there is one class I guess I wrote which is the score sheet so let's have a look at this all right so so par with two R's nice okay self dot parlous par I'm not seeing anything that's like hurting my head too horribly except for these just massive methods so draw sheet I mean I'm okay with this but I really don't like seeing huge blocks of code where they're definitely doing more than one thing and like that's the huge thing with this this program here this is just this huge blocks and just chunks of code and I I can't immediately tell you what all these things they're doing and and these kind of things but should probably have gone in their own method at least so they would have been easier to change and mess around although I did add some decent comments so setup grid column lines rows display all headers for rows so at least I did that so that's not horrible catch the index out of range error display strokes each level mmm try catch I don't know why I needed that but I guess I did and then we go down to error so this is displays an error message if you try to buy yeah out of powerups you have no more powers remaining for this course okay so that's what that does n screen this is what handles the main loop for the end screen again right like just all this code oh my god rewrite the text file containing the scores draw all the stuff on the screen I should have put that in its own function global variables we don't want to do that do we but a bunch of global variables so obviously nothing in this project we can take out and reuse it's all just now completely tied together there's no chance that we can even take small sections of this other than the physics module and move it anywhere so that's an absolute mess old score old coins file okay I am noticing that when I name variables I'm not doing camelcase or underscores I'm just doing if you guys can see here the actual name which is not usually a good thing to be doing I have a lot of like one letter variable names which just make it really hard to read like F L wouldn't be doing that anymore Co like I have no idea what Co stands for and I probably could have named that something more descriptive wait okay while loop for events yeah like just a lot of stuff that just doesn't make any sense when you come back and read it which is obviously something you want to avoid and then this just massive diagonal code indentation levels so let's try to decipher some of this set up level okay and maybe that makes sense starting shop click ok so this is handling the main menu it looks like potentially any ways set up what is this view set up set up objects for the level from module courses okay so now what I'm gonna do is go to courses and show you how I actually built these courses so notice that I had like all the lines there and I had these just notice what the levels looked like there was platforms and there was like a sand trap and there was a flag well you're gonna see how I decided to do that so this is courses DUP I yeah just just here you guys can just just look so what I actually did is I defined objects by strings so like a floor was denoted by floor and that corresponds to the image here which is where sit do we have a floor somewhere platform floor green icon laser power tile title water sticky sand edge sand bottom so sand bottom potentially I don't know there's something that was a floor like something is a floor one of the images anyways so if we go back to courses top I though you can see that I denote what the object was by string and then I put the position that I want it to be at so 0 negative 8 1224 okay so I believe what I'm saying here is the this is gonna be the X I believe this is the Y and I believe this is how long and how high it is yeah I think that's what it is so this is X Y width height that's what I'm defining here and you can see I have hardcoded window width and window height up here which is just not a good thing to do and I'm using those variables up here so no you cannot change the window height and the width and I literally went in and manually added all of the objects rather than building some kind of like level builder or something which probably would have been easier and then I put all of them in a list for the courses so course 1 is denoted by just all of this and if you want to move anything well have fun trying to figure out where they are heart and what is what I have these functions in here that are meant to just help get you like a few things from these levels so they get you the par they get you whatever you like whatever else is here gets start Oh getting the start position that's because inside of all of these I have something that's labeled to start I believe let's see if there's anything called start well maybe not but there's like there's some way that we define like where people start and where the green is and where the flags are and all of that that's just a mess that's courses PI yeah and so set up I guess is handling some of that the course is up I couldn't even tell you and then I have some other functions here so fade fade up the screen when player gets hit by ball show score display the score from the class score sheet so these are ok I'm actually ok with some of these functions I can live with these one one if a player gets a holeinone display a special message screen ok that's fine I can do that ah displays stroke okay so this is based on what you get versus the par it gives you all of the the names right so like oh I didn't even know what these were what things albatraoz negative for skipped Eagle birdie par bogey double bogey triple bogey so on and then plus whatever that's okay redraw window this is meant to handle all the redrawing so this actually uses that courses you can see I have sand water edge bottom flag floor green wall laser sticky coin and then of course there's a ball somewhere that I'm drawing although I don't know where it is but essentially I just load in a list of objects and then draw all of them based on what string they have using the correct image so that's how this draw thing works I mean I couldn't really come up with a better way to do that now I probably would but that's how I went about doing it coin image this calculates the spinning coin so how it spins PowerBar this handles out power by moving back and forth find angle I think is a duplicate of something else oh no find the angle that the ball hits the ground out so good I have that comment but that's actually pretty hard to do if you think about it like you have this ball which is a circular object first of all that's coming down and then you got to figure out what angle it hit set so you can bounce off at the corresponding angle and then reduce power core accordingly so that's interesting on green this tells us if we're on the green because if we're on the green you go into puttting mode so we need to know if that's true over whole this tells us if the ball is over the hole so that we know if it went in or not so that's interesting and now yeah we get into this main game loop collision a ball looking angle locking angle and power checking if powerup buttons are clicked shooting the ball using physics module keeping track of strokes and calls all functions and uses module slash class is important to find above yeah so like we should not do all of that in one area which is what I did but you can see that like this is just an absolute mess so this is the screen the Start screen sorry and what do we do Start screen main screen so I believe if I go to Start screen ball so class ball okay interesting I didn't even use a capital there and where's the Start screen somewhere in here main screen so I believe that displays some stuff mouse over like there's just so much code it's hard to wrap my head around all of it now but draw shop oh my gosh just whenever you see these cascading if statements it just can never be a good thing and I just yeah I'm not gonna skip that anyways let's go back here so display Start screen okay and so we say this Start screen works we get past that now we get into like the core of this is the most difficult part by far this main loop which actually handles all the physics so first of all this is Han all the powerups so depending on which one you hit do something right and I don't even know what all these x4 like what is X I don't I don't know what that is I shouldn't have used one letter variable names for X in powerup buttons yeah this is just so interesting I don't I don't know what those are event dot type so this is if you press the mouse button down we can see that this is checking the collision of the powerup buttons and then this is clicking if you click the powerup buttons but you don't lock the angle then it doesn't work so you have to actually lock the angle first if we haven't locked powers stay in this loop until we do so this is waiting for you to actually lock the power for that arm to spit to go back and forth change the position of the angle line so this is Mouse motion what the heck oh so that's based on if I move my mouse left or right that changes how that power bar moves so that's there's a lot of complicated stuff here redraw window crates and now another while loop so while putt and not shoot so if you're putting but we aren't in the shooting mode yet and if we aren't over the hole then do this otherwise do all of this right so you can just see that this is a mess like at least I commented it so I can read it but it's just so many things happening in one place and so many horrible names and inconsistency like I'm using camelcase here and then I use snake case other places and then I have just s like that with no camel case at all all these random constants throwing up like just these magic numbers everywhere like Pi game time ductile 820 like Y 20 why did I pick 20 I have no idea while shoot so while we're in the shooting mode so now this is responsible for actually moving the ball which is oh my gosh yeah collision loop very complex I love how I stated that so if as if everything else wasn't to fix glitch where you go through walls and floors great right like this is these are my solutions to common problems to just comment in all capitals this fixes the glitch don't remove it to leave it there okay collision loop very complex all angles are in radians physics are in jet in general real and correct that's actually true I know I did a decent job on the physics and oh my god so if I for equals coins so if we collided with a coin then check if we collided and do this if we collided with a laser check the exact same thing we did up here except with the laser and do all of this if we collided with water that do all of this we're I'm sure like most of this is the same stuff that I've just repeated like in all of these loops if we hit the flag where we hit the coin do all of this and recalculate the angles and all of that it's just so much reused and repetitive code and it just makes it like we can see here literally impossible to understand at all so honestly with that I feel like I've probably dragged this video on long enough I could go through and review this for like hours and talk about it but I just wanted to to show you guys that what my first kind of real Python project looked like an absolute mess no idea of design practices I used like one class or two classes inside of here I had no idea the proper way to do this and I just jumped into this huge project with no real planning and well you can see that it just turned into something that's really cool that I'm definitely still proud of that I was able to create but just an absolute colossal mess and this should show you why it's hopefully important that you're applying good practices when you're coding so that if you want to look back at a project in two years you have some idea what the heck is going on so anyways with that being said I hope you all enjoyed if you did make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and let me know what you thought of my first Python project
