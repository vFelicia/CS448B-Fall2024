is something I see all of the time when I'm talking to people about burnout and that's that they're feeling depressed or demotivated because someone that they know or someone that they watch or look up to is better than they are now this always is just a negative thing to do to look at someone else that you really don't know very much about especially if they're an internet personality like me it's just not a fair comparison it's always going to have a negative effect on you and you really have to avoid doing that because the only real fair comparison is yourself right you can compare yourself to how good you were yesterday or six months ago or a year ago that's a fair comparison but to a complete stranger or someone else that you look up to especially if they're in kind of the top of a field it's just really not fair and it's not going to be doing you any benefit everybody's different everybody learns at a different pace the only fair comparison is with yourself
