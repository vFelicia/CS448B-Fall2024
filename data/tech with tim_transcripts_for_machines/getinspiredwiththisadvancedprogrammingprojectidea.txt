moving on to my last idea this is to create your own API or your own web service now the reason I'm recommending this is because this is really good practice this is something that a lot of software Engineers will need to do and design an API although you could make a really simple one is definitely not easy especially if you do it well and then you could take an API or take some web service whatever you create and connect that with a bunch of different applications you can have data shared in one main area that's also going to mean hooking this up with a database it's going to mean hosting it on the cloud trying to get some domain associated with it a lot of cool stuff a lot of opportunities for learning and definitely a great project idea
