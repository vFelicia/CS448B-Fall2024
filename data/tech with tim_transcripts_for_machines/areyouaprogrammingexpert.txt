hello everybody and welcome to a video that i've been waiting a very very long time to film i'm super excited today to finally announce the release of programming expert now this is a platform that i've been working on for well over six months this platform is designed to be the only place you need to know to learn how to code and bring you to a software engineering level in programming as fast as possible now i'm super excited about this i'm going to talk all about it in this video but if you would like to you can check it out from programmingexpert.io we're doing a 25 sale for the launch and black friday so check it out from there and pretty much everything that i say in this video is going to be on the website as well but of course i need to make a video and talk to you about this product that i've been working on for way too long anyways i'll start by saying that this is in collaboration with algo expert so as many of you know i work at algo expert as an algorithms instructor they've been a large sponsor of this channel and about eight months ago we started planning this product programming expert with the vision to make the best possible place to learn how to code with this product right here as soon as you get into it as soon as you start looking at any of the content you never need to leave everything is quite literally on one single page you can run all of your code directly in the browser you can code along in an ide while watching lesson videos which is really really cool and then we have over 200 practice questions in this product that you can use to well practice your programming skills along with 16 assessment questions which are extremely difficult programming questions meant to test if you really understand the content taught in this course as i said i've been working on this for an extremely long time i understand this sounds like a sales pitch but i am genuinely very excited to finally be able to release this and show it to all of you so i just want to take a quick step back here and talk to you a bit about the story behind programming expert why we actually built this out and kind of who this is designed for so the story pretty much goes to myself clement antoine the whole team at algo expert are selftaught developers in some respect so believe it or not at some point in time we too were scouring the internet looking for free resources and while trying to learn to code now of course you can do that there's tons of high quality resources online completely for free look at my channel in fact a lot of the stuff in this course you can find for free specifically on this channel however what i cannot give you on this channel is practice questions definitions assessments and all of that complementary stuff that actually allows you to learn these topics everyone knows it's one thing to watch through a video of someone like me who's been doing this for years explain something it's another thing to actually be given those practice questions and make sure that you know how to do this stuff that you understand the content that you've just learned from the video so really that is the key selling point of this product is that not only is everything going to be on one page for you you never need to leave this you can do everything on here you literally don't even need a text editor ide you don't even have to install python which is the language that we teach but every time you watch one of the videos which i've made the highest quality i possibly can for you then you're going to be given a ton of different practice questions where you can actually apply this knowledge and make sure that you understand what's going on now we also have some projects on this platform so three entire projects where i show you exactly how to build them out these are really useful and some of them are pretty advanced actually to make sure you really understand the stuff that's going on in here so of course i could talk about this for days on end but who this is really designed for is the people that want to learn programming as quickly as possible i'm not going to say that the stuff in here you can't learn for free you definitely can learn it for free and again you can learn some of it from my channel however if you want to learn this as quickly as possible this is really the place to go and this is just going to mean the least resistance for you when you're going through your coding journey because again it's all on a single page and you know exactly where to go next the amount of times i get asked from you guys i learned this what should i learn next i learned this what should i learn next okay i know this what do i do next is unbelievable and that's kind of the main inspiration for me making this course is to literally give you the most guided structure i possibly can in terms of what you need to learn to actually become an expert in program now if you want to look at some more features of this you can go directly to the website we have a bunch of free questions free videos you can check it out and see if it's right for you but again this is designed for people that want to learn coding as quickly as possible and not just beginners if you're an intermediate programmer probably about 80 percent of this content is still going to be really useful to you you might just be able to skip over the first section of the fundamentals and speaking of sections just in case you're wondering we have programming fundamentals objectoriented programming advanced programming software design and software engineering tools as well as those coding projects and i'm still working on this product even though it's released i'm still adding all kinds of stuff to it and as we continue to go through the months this is only going to get bigger and bigger and so if you do want to get access to this i'd recommend grabbing it sooner rather than later because i'm not sure if we're going to have to increase the price if we add a ton of content to this anyways i could talk about this for days i hope you guys can understand where the passion and excitement is coming from i've been working on this for a very long time and mainly because one of the main things again that you guys ask me is where do i start how do i practice how do i get better i truly believe this is some of the best value you can get in terms of a paid programming course this is not like a lot of the other youtubers i see that just release 20 videos and charge you however many dollars for it the main bread and butter of this content is the practice is the editor is the glossary terms is all of that extra stuff that i just physically cannot give you for free on youtube it's just not possible they don't have the implementation to do that anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video please do check out programming expert from the link in the description any support you guys provide would be awesome and if you cannot afford the course or you don't want the course totally fine i'm of course going to be posting all kinds of videos on youtube and like i said a lot of the stuff you can get for free on youtube just not going to be the same quality that you're going to get in programming expert anyways with that said i will end the video here i hope you guys enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another one
