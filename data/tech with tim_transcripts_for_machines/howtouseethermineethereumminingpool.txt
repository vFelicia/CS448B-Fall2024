hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video today's video I'm gonna be going over how to use the mining pool ether mine org how all that works how payouts work how you can actually get your etherium into your wallet and a lot of questions that I've been having on my previous video how to mine aetherium for beginners from a lot of people saying that they've been mining just like me they have their command prompt up they've been mining for a few hours a few days and they've been checking their aetherium wallet and they see there's zero aetherium in there and they're freaking out they don't know what to do they don't know why it's not working they're wondering if this is a scam possibly so on so forth so pretty much I'm just gonna be going over how to use this website and just so you all know don't worry if you have zero with your m in your wallet and you've been mining for a few days this is completely normal and I'm gonna explain why in this video so pretty much aetherium or ether mind org is a mining pool and we use a mining pool just because if you try to mind alone you have to have a ton of different heart a ton of different graphics cards a lot of hashing power otherwise you're not really gonna get a lot of shares it's gonna be difficult to make any viable amount of money so when you use a mining pool it pretty much splits shares up between different regions of people so you get what's called more luck kind of and you can get more shares and make more money so the mining pool here ether mine takes a 1% fee meaning whenever you cash out it's just gonna take 1% of the etherium that you've mined and yeah so once you've set up your miner like this if you haven't already done this and you still are wondering how to mine aetherium go check out my previous video I'll put a link up in the top right here it's gonna be as a card and it'll be one in the description below go watch that one first as it's kind of a prerequisite to this if you have watched that and you're wondering how ether mine works just continue on with the video so pretty much since you've set up your miner that means you have an aetherium wallet address so you have your private key and your public key so this is my public key here 0 X so on so you're just gonna copy this and you should already have this say saved in your miner so if you go to wherever your miner folder and then you go to whatever script you're using to start it so mine's just called ether mine you click Edit then you can see it's right after a wallet here this will be your address so you can copy that another way as well and you're just gonna go to ether mind org so if I just go to the basic page I go to the home screen and you'll see that it says address up in the top right here's a little white box all you're gonna do is you're gonna paste your address in there and you're gonna click enter now if you just started mining and you've done this it might not show that you've mined anything these numbers might all be 0 don't freak out it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to actually register on ether mind that you're mining so if you don't see those numbers there right away don't worry just give it a few minutes and if after about 10 or 15 minutes you haven't seen anything then maybe there's something wrong but just give it some time ok so you can see I've been mining for 22 minutes my stats are popped up here it shows my current mining rate my rate per this hour and then my effective mining rate if you want to know what those are you can just read on the website it shows you you're gonna have a table that says payout slash rounds now this is what we're gonna click on here just to view a few statistics quickly so when you click this it's going to give you an estimated earning step now this is what you're gonna want to look at to determine how much you're gonna be making in u.s. dollars by the way per day per month per year etc per week per hour and that'll show you how much you're gonna be making and then if you go to settings this is where we can configure our payouts so by default all of the theorem your mind doesn't automatically go into your wallet it's actually stored on this website under your miners address so whatever your theorem will address is that's your miners address you punch it in like this and then you're able to see how much aetherium you've mined now it doesn't get paid out until you reach a certain threshold so what I mean by paid out is it gets sent to your aetherium wallet so you can see right here I have 0.0001 aetherium in my wallet I don't have any that's because I haven't reached my payout threshold so if you want to change this threshold you can go to settings and by default it is at 1 I'm gonna tell you right now Mining 1 aetherium takes a very long time unless you have a lot of hashing power so you're going to want to change this to probably the minimum amount unless you're mining with a lot of hashing power so you're gonna want to go to 0.05 especially if you're someone like me who's only mining at 17 mega hashes per second right now so that's the minimum amount you can see right here it shows what it is and then you're gonna want to save this information now to do this you need to type in your email address and then you also need to type in your public IP address now to find your public IP address you can just open a Google tab and just search what is my IP like so I'm not actually gonna click enter because then you'd see my IP which is not a good thing don't share that with anyone you're gonna type that in here and you're gonna click Save like so so once you've done that it will save your threshold and then you can come back here and it should show you what percentage you are at of your payout threshold so once you get to 100% so you've mined 0.05 etherium it will pay you out automatically there's nothing you have to do and you can go and check your theory and wallet and you'll see that the etherium is actually in the wallet now so that's pretty much all it is to using ether mine now I will tell you that sometimes ether mine is a little buggy your miner may go offline once in a while and it's a good idea to make sure you type in your email address here as it'll send you an email when your miner goes offline if you have this little checkmark ticked like that now this is really useful because that means that you can check the status of your miner so say you're at school you're at work wherever you are and one of your miner goes offline if you have the ability to bring it back online then you're able to do so and you just know when it's online and offline and it's really useful if I do that whenever I'm mining with my regular address so yeah so yeah just a quick recap if to use ether mine all you have to do pretty much is get your aetherium old address you're using mine type it in this address tab up here click enter it'll pull up all your statistics here all your octave workers all your hash rate it'll give you the last scene so this one's useful it shows you how long ago that it was online so on and then you can see all your shares everything like that and once you reach your payout threshold which can be changed by going to the Settings tab then you will find that your aetherium is in your wallet alright so I hope you guys enjoyed the video if it
