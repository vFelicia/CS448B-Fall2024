hello everybody and welcome to the third video in this python cursus tutorial series in this video i'm going to be talking to you about pads and windows now a window is something that we've already seen but what we can do is create our own windows that are smaller and a part of the main window and that allows us to control the text that's going in each individual window and refresh or clear each one based on what we want to do now a pad is something that allows us to show a certain amount of text on the screen at a time it's kind of hard to explain but i'll show you an example in one second alright so let's go ahead and get started now the first thing i'll show us how to do is how to create a new window and then we'll look at pat so i have the same code that i had in the previous tutorial i've just copied it in a new file and what we're going to do now is just create a new window so i'm actually going to take all of the stuff that i've added to the screen and instead i'm going to add it to a window and then that window will be a part of the screen so the window is stationary it stays on the screen it's not going to move off of the main screen and we can place stuff inside of the window so it'll be a little bit weird to understand this but we're going to place the window on the screen we'll call the screen just the terminal okay like the main screen that we have and then within the window it kind of has its own coordinates so if i want something to be at the top left of my window then i place that 0 0 in the window that doesn't mean it's going to be at 0 0 on the screen because the window could be placed further on the screen so let's just look at an example and this should hopefully clear it up what i'm going to do is just use the same example i had before except this time rather than adding my count to the screen i'm going to add it to my new window so i'm going to say counter underscore win is equal to and then this will be curses dot i'm going to use the new win function and then what i need to pass to this is the height the width and then the row and the column of where i want this window to be placed on my screen now you may have noticed by now it's kind of weird we're always passing the ycoordinate first and then the xcoordinate that's just the way it works for for curses so i'm going to say we want this to be maybe a height of 1 so just one row high and then we'll have it be 20 characters long because we're only going to have to place count inside of here so i don't need it to be crazy big then we will place this at let's go 10 10. so it'll be 10 rows down and then 10 columns to the right from the left hand side of the screen okay so that's our window it's going to be stationary on the screen it's not going to move and then what we're going to do is rather than adding here so rather than adding to the screen we're going to add to the window so i'm going to say counter win dot add string and then i will say counter win dot refresh as well now i still do need to clear this window and i do need to clear and refresh the main screen as well which i'll show you in a second so i'm going to say counter win dot clear so at the beginning of our for loop we're going to clear this if you're unsure about how this works i explained it in the previous tutorial anyways we'll clear the window then we'll calculate the color we'll then add the text the window and refresh the window and we should be good to go now i'm curious what's going to happen with our screen here because i'm not refreshing or updating the screen so let's just run it and then we can make any adjustments so i'm going to say python tutorial3.pi and notice we are getting this showing up completely fine and the window is down 10 rows and then 10 columns from the left obviously it's flashing because we are changing the color and then it goes away as soon as we finish the for loop okay so it looks like we didn't actually need to update or clear the screen to be able to see that that's good to know okay so now we have looked at a window let's just see what happens if we place some other text on the screen while we have a window so what i'm going to do is say let's go with std screen dot and then add string and let's just add the string hello world here exclamation point okay and then we'll refresh so that's the screen dot refresh like that so i just want to show you here that when i go and i do this this hello world text is going to stay persistently on the screen even though if i can kind of move over here we're clearing the window so what we're doing to the window is not affecting the screen and since i'm moving around the terminal that's why we're getting some weird output and of course now it's closed like all my stuff let's run this again but the point is that all of my operations on the window don't affect my screen and that's kind of the idea if i only want to refresh say one piece of text i just put it in a separate window and that way i don't have to constantly refresh and update the screen i just have to do it with the one window so that's going to be more efficient and that also means that i'm not going to potentially be messing up or removing any of the text that i want to persistently stay on the screen okay so that is windows pretty straightforward you can make as many windows as you want and again that's the point of them is that you can refresh them independently all right so now that we've talked about windows i'm going to talk about pads now a pad is kind of a special type of window that allows you to have content that's overflowing off of the screen now the reason you can have that is because with a pad you can show part of the pad on the screen now it's really really cool but you can actually kind of trim the pad and only show an aspect of it and then pick where on the screen you want it to go and you can move it around very very easily really hard to explain it's kind of an abstract thing it's not usually what you think of when you think of a pad so let me just show you an example and then you will understand so i'm going to delete all of this and i'm going to create a pad now to make a pad i'm going to say pad is equal to and then this is going to be curses dot new pad and what i need to pass is just the height and the width of this pad so i'm going to go 100 100 and just make it nice and large now what i'm going to do is i'm going to fill this pad with a ton of content specifically just a bunch of characters so i'm going to say 4i in range and then this is going to be 100. i'm going to say 4j in range and then this will be 26. and the reason i'm doing 26 is i want to generate 26 characters a hundred times so i want to essentially generate every single character in the alphabet a hundred times and add that into my path so what i'll do inside of here is say that my char is equal to and then this is going to be the char of and then 67 plus j now you might be confused on what this is doing but every single character on our keyboard has a unique number that represents it so for example uppercase a is represented by the number 67. now we have this function in python called char chr that takes in some number and gives us the character that it represents so when j 0 we're going to get a when j is 1 we are going to get b because it follows right after a we're going to have b that's one number higher then c then d so on and so forth so that's why i'm doing this 67 plus j so now that i have the character let me add it to the pad so i'm just going to say pad dot and this is going to be add string then i'm going to add the character and we could add it in a different color so let's go with green and black okay perfect now one thing i'm not sure that i mentioned before is that when you add stuff to a pad consecutively it's just going to add up where the cursor on the pad is so you've probably seen this in the terminal but you know you type your cursor moves with what you're typing and then whatever the cursor is is where you're going to be typing next so if i add this character my cursor is going to go to the end of the line where this character is or at the end of wherever the character so that means the next character comes after it i'm not writing this character on top of it for that to happen i would have to manually put 0 0 here since i'm not putting that it doesn't mean i'm just placing it at 0 0 it means that i'm placing it wherever the character currently is okay i wanted to go over that so now that this is in the pad what we can do is refresh the pad but the first thing i need to do is actually refresh the screen so i'm going to say screen dot and then let's just go with refresh because we're going to add the pad right and we're going to refresh the screen or this isn't on the screen yet but you'll see what i mean and then we say screen.refresh and then down here i'm going to refresh the pad so i'm going to say pad dot and then refresh now when i refresh the pad i actually need to pass six values to this and to explain what these values are i need to hop over to paint so i'm inside of paint you can see i have a lovely drawing here the black box is going to represent my screen and the green box is going to represent my pad now let's say that we only want to show this area of the pad on the screen well what i'm actually able to do here is when i refresh the pad i can choose how much of the pad i want to show and where i want it to be on the screen so the first thing that i can actually pass to my refresh is the coordinate of where i want to start showing my padded content relative to the pad so when i say relative to the pad that means we're going to treat 0 0 as the top left hand corner of the pad now let me actually draw a better example here so that i can show you so let's say we actually want to display maybe this okay so if i want to display this area of the pad then what i need to pass is this coordinate relative to here so it would probably be something like i don't know i'm with my mouse so i can't really draw it maybe like 2 and 7 or something that would be the coordinate that i pass and the point of this is i'm saying i'm going to start displaying my padded content from here so all this stuff in this area i'm not going to display because i'm starting to show the padded content right here so everything to the right of that and down of that coordinate is the content i'm actually going to show so once i pick the content in the pad that i want to show then i need to decide how large i want the pad to be on my screen and where i want it to be located so what i can actually do is i can pick the top left hand corner of this padded content and the bottom right hand corner of this padded content that i want on the screen and i can cut off part of the content based on the coordinates that i pick so i would have to choose a coordinate relative to the screen for the top left hand corner of this and for the bottom right hand corner of this so now if my padded content is say let me just continue this red box everything in the red box so ignore the kind of dividing line but if that's the padded content what i can do is show i'm trying to find another color here like maybe only this amount of the padded content if i pick the bottom right hand corner and the top left hand corner to be certain values hopefully that makes a tiny bit of sense but i just have to pick how much padded content i want to show and then where i want to show it on the screen kind of the dimensions of the pad so now that that maybe clears it up let's look at what the arguments are going to be to pad dot refresh so i'm going to pass 0 0 5 5 and then 25.75 now what this says is i want to start my padded content as 0 0. so pretty much all of the content i want to keep in my pad because i'm starting it right at 0 0. again relative to the pad then the top left hand corner of my padded content on the window i want to be five five so i'm going to start showing it at five five on the screen then i'm going to end all of it at 25.75 so i'm going to show it 25 rows down and 75 rows to the right let me just show you what this looks like so you get an idea and then we'll mess around with some values so notice that this is what we get so i'm starting to show it at five five i started the padded content at zero zero so we're not cut off on the left here and i'm going to 25.75 okay so we're 25 rows down 75 rows to the right now let's close this and let's look at what happens if i do 25 25 okay so we change that let's run this and now notice we only go this far to the right we're showing 25 uh characters on the screen or sorry not 25 characters but we're going to column 25 and we're showing 25 rows let's hit this again let's change this to like 10 25 and now let's look at this and notice we have a much smaller area great now i will change where the padded content starts so when i change this let's make this maybe 5 5 you're going to see that the content inside of the pad is going to look different so let's run this and notice now we don't start with c which is what we were starting with before we have different characters because we've started the padded content at a different area so to reiterate here we are passing the row where we want to start showing the padded content the column where we want to start showing the padded content and then we're passing the row and the column where we want to display this on the window and then the row in the column of the bottom right hand corner of where we want to display it so this is the top left hand corner this is the bottom right hand corner it kind of forms a rectangle and then we display whatever content this gives us in that area hopefully that is clear um yeah that is how the refresh works okay so now that we've done all of this i'm going to show you how we can actually scroll through our padded content which is going to look really cool so i'm going to do another for loop here i'm going to say 4i in range and let's just go with 50 and what i'm going to do is continually refresh the pad and i'm going to change where i'm showing the pad so i'm going to leave this at 0 but i'm going to put i here for the column of where i want to start showing my padded content i'm also going to say time dot sleep 0.2 just so that we have enough time to actually see this pad being refreshed so before i even really explain this let me just run this and show you so then the explanation makes more sense so look we're actually scrolling through this content we're continually kind of moving to the right and looking at more of it and it's staying stationary on the screen so this is one way that we can scroll through it another way that we can scroll through it is by actually moving the pad itself that wouldn't really scroll through it i guess but we can move the pad too so now rather than doing that so i had i in the column here so since i was incrementing i was changing how much of the pad i was showing now we're going to move i here so when i move i here this is going to change the top lefthand corner of where i'm displaying this but since i'm doing that i also need to add i to the bottom right hand corner so that we're going to be kind of moving a square across the screen not the square getting smaller i'll show you all of these examples but this is changing the column for the uh was it top lefthand corner and for the bottom right hand corner okay let's run this and now notice that it's scrolling on the screen but see that we're getting all of the previous pad like showing up on the screen still now the reason that's happening is because we're not clearing the screen after we move the pad so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to say std screen and then dot and this is going to be clear and then i'm going to refresh it because of course after we clear we need to refresh otherwise it's not actually going to do anything so now we're going to clear the screen refresh and then show the pad and then clear refresh and then show the pad so let's try this now and now you can see that we're actually kind of moving a rectangle across the screen that contains the content inside of it so this is pretty cool i mean this alone can allow you to make games because you can literally you know kind of move stuff around the screen in this fashion using these pads there's a few other ways to do it but this is probably the simplest way that i've seen now let's do it so that we're actually scrolling through the content while we move it to the right so the way i'll do that is i'll put i here as well so now i'm changing the amount of padded content i'm changing the location of the padded content and i guess that's all i'm doing okay so let's see this now notice that as i move it's kind of like i'm taking a window and moving it across my padded content because i'm getting different content inside of the pad it's not the same content awesome now let's see if we can move it diagonally as well so let's go like this let's go 5 plus i and 10 plus i and let's look at this on the screen now and it should go to the right and down so yeah we're moving it kind of diagonally and then we got an error now the reason we get an error here is because we tried to display this in an area that was invalid on the screen so what would have happened is i would have been too large for this coordinate right here so we would have kind of exceeded the row that we could show this out sorry it wouldn't be that coordinate it would be this coordinate right here so keep that in mind you can only display in a valid area of the screen and if you want to check the coordinates of the screen i have a kind of cheat right here that you can use you can use this curses.lines and then this is going to be minus one i don't know why it's showing all of these characters here and then curses.calls minus one so this is actually how you get the coordinates of the screen this tells you the number of rows or lines and the number of columns and to get kind of the maximum one you could place them at you just have to subtract one because we start counting at zero i'm not actually going to use these i just want to show you that's how you get the number of rows and columns kind of the screen dimensions okay so now that we've done that let's just look at one more example because it's pretty cool how we can scroll say vertically through this content as well so let's go back to kind of our original here so i had that at i let's make that 5. let's make that 10 let's make that 25. so let's say we want to actually scroll the other direction well if i want to scroll the other direction all i need to do here is actually make this i and i'll probably have to make this a bit less uh oh no our path has size 100 so that's fine if i do that okay anyways if i make this i now so just that first coordinate and now i run this uh wait scrolling in the direction okay that was a little bit weird what was happening there uh let me have a look at here because that that was not what i expected it to do so to me that kind of looked like we were scrolling horizontally when i wanted to just be scrolling vertically so this should in theory be scrolling vertically but it did look like it was going horizontally so let me just change a few coordinates here and see if we can make this a little bit easier to see so i'm just going to make this 0 0 and we'll go with 20 and then 20. now let's see how much different this looks this time because last time okay so there we go so now it looks like it's scrolling vertically and we're going to keep scrolling a bunch because we don't have the entire padded content filled right our pad is 100 by 100 we've only probably filled like 20 or 30 lines of it and so that's why uh it's like continually scrolling right now even though there's nothing on the screen it's still moving the pad upwards or moving the content in the pad upwards even though we have no more content left okay so let me get out of that all right so with that said that's pretty much everything that i needed to show you that was pads and windows pretty useful and pretty cool especially the pad because you can kind of scroll through it and move it around the screen definitely something you have to practice with i'm no pro as you can obviously see in this video but hopefully i at least showed you the syntax and gave you a few examples of kind of what's possible with it so anyways i am going to end the video here i hope you guys enjoyed if you did make sure they like subscribe the channel and i will see you in another one you
