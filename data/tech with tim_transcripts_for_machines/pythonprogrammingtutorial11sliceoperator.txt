hey guys welcome back to the eleventh video in my Python programming series in today's video we're going to be talking about the slice operator which is a cool thing that we can use on lists and strings in Python so if you remember in the previous video if we wanted to access an element in our list we did fruits so the name of our list here which I've already got defined as apples pear and strawberry and then we would do the items so for example fruits one we can print that to the screen just to remind us what this did and we got pear just like that because that is the second item but to reference that we have to use one because in computers we start at zero right okay yeah and I just want to mention I didn't don't think I did this in the list video that you can actually do this on strings as well so say I wanted to access the e there I would just do text one and we get the e because that is the second item in this string or character maybe I wanted to do the eleventh one then that will give us another e because that 11 is right here at the end of like so yeah now what is the slice operator look like so pretty much the slice operator is these two square brackets but inside of them where you're going to put two colons just like this now these colons in between them we type some words or we're going to put some numbers in this case I'm just going to show you with words so we have start stop and step that's what goes where these colons are now if I remove this colon that means I just have a start and a stop and then if I remove this colon I just have a start and that's how we reference what element we want to we want to print out right if we had just put a number there so we'll add the colon back in in this now we're going to use numbers so the start stop and step works exactly the same way as the range function so you may remember when I did a for loop we did for X in range and then inside of the range we did some numbers like this so we would start at one stop at two and step by three like that right so it works the exact same way except in this case we're going to be using it on lists and on strings right without these numbers the range like this okay so let's just do an exam so let's start at zero and let's n at this Oh so the O is one two three four five but if I want to actually include the oh I have to put five because remember five would be this space here and if we stop on let's say four here you'll see what's going to happen it's not going to print out the O because when we stop we do not include that number remember from the range function so if we want to have vo will stop at five just like that hello okay yeah now if we wanted to start just from the beginning say we didn't know all we have to do is just put nothing there and it's going to default start from the beginning so it'll give us the same thing and then if we wanted to start from somewhere so say we want to start at two and we just want to go all the way to the end now we say we don't know how long our strings we don't want to count all of these things and say oh well let's stop at 17 or whatever number it may be by just leaving this blank it'll actually default to stop at the end of the string and you'll see that so we get LLO I like Python right it stopped at the end of the string automatically okay so now let's talk about the step feature so if we want to start at the beginning and we want to stop at the end we'll just put nothing in between these two colons because it's going to default from the beginning and default to the end but now we want to skip every other letter that means we're going to put a two here for the step so that way we're going to get h lde oh then we're going to skip the space here we're going to get I skip the space get L and so on so I'll show you and you see we get that a bunch of gibberish like this maybe want to go every third letter that means we would step by three like this and there we go we get a few less letters and same thing we could do four or five and continually going now say we want to start at the third letter R the fourth because we're typing three here so L we want to stop at the end and we want to step by three then you can see what's going to happen there so we get L I I TN right so a bunch of gibberish okay now this works again same thing for fruits I just don't have as many items in the foods list so that's why I was showing you with text but if I put the colon in here and we put another let's say we start let's start at 1 so that means our going to start up hair and let's just go to the end and we'll print that out and again we get pear and strawberries so we didn't include the apples because we started up pear right so yeah that's pretty much how these slice operator works now there is one other cool thing we can do with the slice operator and it's called the insert function or the insert kind of thing with the slice operator so if you remember we have when we wanted to add something to a list we use dot append right so I showed you that in my list video we did troupes dot append and then maybe want to add blueberries like this I know that's spelt incorrectly but there we go we'll fix that quickly blueberries okay and then we can print out fruits once again just to see what it looks like so if you remember this just adds it to the end of the list but say we don't want to add blueberries to the end of the list we want to add it in between pairs we want to add it in between apples and pear we want to add it at the beginning we want to add it somewhere else right how would we do that well we can use the slice operator to do that so instead of using the dot append we'll use a slice operator sort of like this and this time we're going to put one colon and then type the indicee where we want to insert it so if we want to insert it at the beginning we're just going to type 0 and then 0 like this we do need to do them on both sides and then an equal sign and we'll set it equal to what every one in this case we'll just put B for simplicity and you'll see we get B at the beginning of our list now say we want it in between apples and pear well in that case we put 1 and we put 1 again like this and we get apples comma B comma pair comma strawberries just like that now if we want to add it to the end we would have to find out what number that is we do 3 3 I believe that should work we'll see ya so that I added to the end for us and then if we want to insert it in between pear and strawberry we would do to 2 like that and there we go we get in between there so that's how the insert work so the slice operator I hope you learned how to use a slice operator today we will be using it a little later in some other videos and doing some more complex things with it if you liked the video please like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
