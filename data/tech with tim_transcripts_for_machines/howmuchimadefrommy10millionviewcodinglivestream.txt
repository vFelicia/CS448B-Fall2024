three and a half years ago I decided it would be a good idea to sit down and live stream myself coding for 12 hours now it turns out you guys like to watch me suffer and this video now has over 10 million views let me show you some of the analytics for it so 10.1 million views 428.5 000 hours of watch time I gained 88 000 subscribers and I made 18 000 Canadian dollars now this revenue is fantastic but if we go to the tab here you can see that I only have a 1.80 RPM that's actually extremely low for my channel usually I get four or five dollar RPM so you can picture the amount of money I missed out on on this stream regardless thank you all for watching and let me know if you want to see another coding live stream in the comments
