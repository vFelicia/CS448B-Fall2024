so I end up making the decision to drop out again it is a tough one the two perspectives that I kind of have here is that one why would I drop out when I've already done two and a half years only have a year and a half left to finish it just kind of seems like a lot of wasted time and money and it's always nice to have a degree right it's a really good safety net you can't really go wrong by having one but at the same time anything that a degree would have given me I kinda already have I've already gotten a job without having a degree in the tech space for a large tech company I've been offered a return position all that kind of stuff and any value that I can really attach to a degree it's becoming difficult to say that the degree is what provides that right because I'm able to kind of find that without having the degree it's a wasted two and a half years and twenty five thousand dollars but at the same time I can always go back and complete the degree if I want to and that's kind of what really pushed me to make the decision is that if I ever really do need this I can go back and complete it
