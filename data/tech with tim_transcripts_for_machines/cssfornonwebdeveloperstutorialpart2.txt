hello everybody and welcome to part two of this css for nonweb developers series in the last video i gave you a pretty long but hopefully fairly comprehensive overview of kind of the core css properties you should know and kind of be memorizing if you want to be efficient at writing css now in this video i want to actually take all of that theory all of that knowledge and apply that by building out kind of a basic layout and showing you how we would nest different flexboxes inside of each other how we would align items how we would just kind of create something by looking at a visual so i'll walk you through my thought process on doing that and show you kind of how we design that basic layout i'm hoping this shouldn't take too long um but yeah that's that's kind of what we're doing so what i'm actually going to be doing is designing a component from the programming expert website so if you guys don't know i have a course it's called programming expert if you are not interested in web development but you want to learn python goaling software design software engineering tools there's all kinds of stuff here i mean i'm on the website right now then definitely check it out i think this is great value for people looking to get better at programming if you want you can use discount code tim however i thought okay well it would be kind of a cool idea to just design one of these components from the programming expert website um again i mean i haven't actually made this i wasn't the one who coded like the ui for this website i just did the content so i'm kind of doing this from scratch if you will anyways what we're going to build is kind of this right here which is like one of the cards for one of the sections so i'm going to show you know how we do the header how we do everything laid out how we have these kind of things inside how we add a shadow how we have a hover effect for a button uh how we have images beside each other you know it seems pretty simple but when you actually think about building out this layout if you're not familiar with css this can look a little bit intimidating if we want it to look exactly like this so that's what i'm going to try to do with the exception of the progress bar which we're not going to add okay so let's uh let's try that then let's put this on the right hand side of my screen i have my html document here i have html and css excuse me at times you probably won't be able to see both of them just because you know it's not really enough screen real estate for that but let's start by by trying to design this and we'll try to make it responsive as well so that it kind of looks like this on this screen size right so the first thing i usually do is kind of just build out the html layout myself i start adding classes to it and then i go style it after um you know there's times when i'll style before but usually i like to just get all the content on the page and then once the content's there we can kind of lay it out how we need to so let's begin by creating a div in this div will be kind of the card i'm going to call this white thing like a card on the page and then that way we could reuse this div and make multiple cards and see how those are kind of laid out so i'm going to say class is equal to card okay so that's div 1 that's going to be the container for everything inside of this div we need a header so let's have an h1 tag let's say class is equal to header text and then this is going to be two dash programming fundamentals uh is that how you spell it yeah fundamentals like that okay uh after we have that we have kind of three icons of sorts let me just make these a little bit larger so we can see so we have you know 17 hours 25 videos 131 practice questions and i see immediately that i'm going to probably need these in some kind of row right because they need to be kind of aligned with each other if i just put 3p tags they're going to be block style and they're not really going to work very well so what i'm going to do is make a div and i'm going to say class is equal to and let's just call this stats or something i mean the naming is not super important right now because we don't have a lot of content so i'll just call this the stats container okay now inside of here i'm now going to make three divs one for each of these kind of things because we're going to have the logo or like the little emblem and then the text and i think i should kind of keep those in a container so that we can then space them out differently from from the text itself there's a bunch of different ways to do this by the way so don't think that how i'm doing this is the only way you can challenge yourself to do this as well so let's say class is equal to and let's say stat item like that now i'll make three of these because we're going to have three stat items and inside of the stat item container i want to have a paragraph tag this first one will be 17 hours and my icon which i will show you how we can add that in a second okay so 17 hours uh we're gonna have 25 videos let's say 25 videos and then 131 practice questions so practice questions like that okay and then of course again we need that icon but again i will i will add that later all right so we have this div now outside of this div we're going to have our description so let's make a p tag i'll say class is equal to description like that i spell that correctly i believe i did and we just copy this and dump this here inside of the description okay beyond the description we have these things right so we have kind of this i don't know i don't know what you want to call this button container you know pressable item i'll just call it a graycard or something i don't really know what we would want to call that so let's say div like that slash div by the way notice how whenever i open a tag i close it right away usually just makes sure i don't forget that to close the tag so that's why i'm doing that i'm going to say class is equal to and let's say gray container now we're going to need two of those gray containers so let's just copy them here and we'll use the same class name right because they're going to have the same styles now inside of the gray container let's make this a bit larger so we can kind of analyze how it would look in the proper format we're going to have a button we're going to have another like logo of some sort and then we're gonna have the text so i'll just put those in there and then we'll wrap them in some kind of div uh later on let me just close this for right now okay so let's make a uh i guess we'll make this like an h3 tag and we can just say lessons and then copy this and this will be assessment okay assessment like that okay and then we need a button so let's say button and class will be equal to we can just call this button and for this one we'll say class is equal to um sub header okay that's fine just copy this and put that here and then for the button this needs to say resume and then we'll just add an arrow okay nice so we've just built out pretty well the content for this right now of course when we look at this you know actually doesn't even look that bad to be honest obviously it's not looking like this card but we kind of have all the content that we need and now we need to lay everything out now we also want to add some icons uh and i'm gonna show you how we add kind of these little icons by using something called font awesome let me load that up and then i'll show you how we have that okay so in front of me i have something called font awesome now font awesome is just kind of a free cdn that lets you use kind of prebuilt icons now the way it works is you need to enter your email and then kind of create an account and once you do that it will give you access to a cdn and anyways you could just follow this website it's very straightforward but essentially it involves just copying a tag into the head of your html document once that tag is in there you can then use some predefined class names like i'm going to show you to use some predefined icons so go to this website fontawesome.com i'll try to leave it in the description someone remind me if i forget and download or get access to your cdn copy that into your head tag it should give you the instructions on how to do that and then you can start accessing the different icons okay so let me start using this now so for the icons i'm just going to copy in mine which is this i mean i guess you could copy mine as well but i don't know exactly how that works if i'm going to get rate limited or something and now the way that you add an icon is you do the following you go here you go i and i kind of stands for icon the tag and then you say class is equal to and then you write the class of the icon now i'm just going to pull up a cheat sheet here and find the different icons so i have to search for them okay so the first one actually i'm just going to copy this in is going to be f a f a clock dash o arya hidden is going to be true okay next one this is going to be f a video okay i'm just trying to get one that looks similar to the the programming extra ones here and then i think this is just f a pencil and then we also need two icons for this so let me grab those okay i'm just going to copy them in here so go lessons we're going to have fa solid f8 clapperboard and then i'm going to have this one here which is fa solid fa file lines they won't look exactly the same but they should be good enough okay so there you go we can see our icons are kind of showing up here obviously nothing's really laid out how we want it to be so now that's what we need to do now one thing i don't know why these are getting like why is lessons getting um highlighted like that all right so i was kind of tripping out there for a second i just forgot to close one of my icon tags so it was like messing up the whole document and showing it like a bunch of times uh anyways i just i closed it here so now that that looks good okay so let's just go back here and figure out what we want to do first so i probably want to start with the exterior container that's usually what i do set its color um set like a little box shadow for it i guess a border of some sort kind of the interior margin and then once i have that i will go with the rest so the first thing i need to do is kind of color the card so let's open up our styles here okay just close that and go split right here and we have card so i'm going to say doc card and the first thing i'm going to do is say background color i'm going to set that to white now i'm also going to say margin i'm just going to add a 5 margin here and that will be 5 margin based on the height of the body now what i also want to do is just add a background color to the body here so we actually see the uh the background color of the card so i'm going to say background color and then this will be light gray and now we can actually see the card okay next i'm going to make the body 100 height so we're going to say height 100 vertical height just so that my margin now is going to be based on the height of the screen uh not based on just the body content okay continuing i want to add some rounded edges here for the card now to do that there is a property called border radius and i'll just set this to be 5 pixels and now we have kind of some rounded edges now the next thing i want to do is add a little bit of a shadow here so i'm going to say box shadow now for the box shadow i don't remember all of the properties for this but i believe you do the offset in the x y direction and then the color so i'm going to say one pixel one pixel and then rgba and then zero zero zero and zero point nine so we have some kind of opacity okay and then you see i'm getting a bit of a shadow however i want to kind of blur this shadow so i'm going to add one more property here which is 5 pixels and now notice i kind of get a blur around this and i'm also going to change the opacity to be like 0.7 so it's not quite as thick however i also want to get this box shadow on the other side because right now it's kind of heavily on the bottom right based on the way i've done it so the way you do this and i apologize that it's kind of hard to see here is you copy this you put a comma and then you put it again and then it should do this in the opposite direction but i need to change these now to be negative so negative 2 pixels negative 2 pixels and now notice i'm getting a shadow kind of on all sides there might be a better way to do this but this is the way that i'm familiar with so that's what we'll go with for now and again the opacity is very very thick so let's go with 0.5 and make it a little a little more blurred there okay i think that's uh that's fine for now all right so now that we have that uh let's make this a bit smaller just so we can see this a little bit easier i want to make it so that there is kind of margin within the card right so if we go here obviously these items are not hitting the the card there's some margin between them so how are we going to do that well we're going to add another div inside of here and then add margin to it so this is a common practice what you'll do is you'll have kind of a main container and then you'll have an interior container and that interior container will kind of be have a margin to the the outside container now i also just realized though that we can probably just add padding to the card and avoid doing that so let's try that there's many different ways to do stuff here in css so let's say padding let's just go with 10 pixels and it's because i didn't have a semicolon here so let's add that and notice when i add my 10 pixels of padding now it actually pads the content inside however i want kind of the same padding on top and bottom so i'm going to say 5 pixels 10 pixels 5 pixels 10 pixels so that it looks a little less extreme on the vertical padding but we still have the same horizontal padding that we wanted before okay so that's actually good right now for the kind of container of the card going here now we want to lay these out in a row and kind of change this this font style so it looks a little bit nicer so for the font let's just say font family and we'll set this just to i don't know what do we want to have here uh let's set it to this that looks fine to me for now i don't really care to to pick the font and actually why is there so many let's just set it to arial yeah ariel is fine okay so font family will be ariel when i set that on the body it will set for all of the other elements so that's why i'm doing that all right now we want to lay these out um what do you call this want to lay out these these items here so they're in the correct position so the first thing i want to do is make it so this icon is beside my text so the way i'm going to do that is i'm going to first look for what i need to change which is going to be stat item so i want the stat item to be a flexbox essentially that has the items laid out layout laid out sorry horizontally so let's say stat item if we could get that correctly and this will be f display flex okay when i make that display flex now they are aligned in a row now the next thing i need to do is say align items center so now i'm going to align on the vertical axis the cross axis in the center okay now that i've done that let's add a gap between the items of five pixel and now they're kind of spaced out a little bit so that's nice and actually let's just do one em as the spacing just so that that will kind of scale with the font size all right that's nice now for our text within the stat item container i want it to be bold so i'm going to say stat item p and i'll say font weight and this will be bold like that i could add a strong tag but i think it's better to do it in css styling so that's how i'm going to do it and just to show you how that works now that these are laid out properly i would like to change the color of my icons so to do that again i can say stat item and then i can say i and i can say that my color is red and now i've changed my icon color to be red now i also want to have some padding or kind of like a box around my icons so there's a few ways to do this again but let's do the following let's say padding 10 pixels okay and that's going to pad the uh what is it the content box here then i'm going to say my background color is and let's just go with red alright so that's fine but i would like it to be transparent so we're going to say let's do it in hex this time ff000 and now we have kind of this transparent box around and then i'm going to say my border radius is 5 pixel all right so that kind of now matches up with what programming expert one had my boxes are slightly different size because it's sizing based on the icon size but that's fine i won't get that picky right now okay so already looking much better the next thing i need to do now is lay all these out in a row so i see i have my stats container so i'm just going to now apply flex styling to my stats container so i'm going to say stats container i'm going to say display and then flex okay and now automatically they're going to go into row now we need some gap so let's say gap be 1em and there we go and then i will align items in the center and i will justify content flex start so now let's make this a bit bigger and this is looking good okay so good looking card so far of course obviously we got to add these down below but if we go look at this uh you know we're not too far off somewhat from uh from what the layout's looking like let's look at that we might want more a slightly more of a margin there but for now that's fine okay so let's add more of a margin on our uh interior padding so let's go 10 15 10 15. now we just squish it in a little bit more that looks a bit nicer all right continuing we now need to handle the bottom uh of of what we need here so the bottom section is our gray container so let's start with that and then we can do what's inside of the container all right so let's say dot gray container okay background color will be light gray all right and then we want to add a border radius so border radius of 5 pixels add some rounded edges here okay so now we have our rounded edges now that we need to align the items within the gray container so i'm going to say display flex okay and now we've aligned on row that's good but we want to push the button to the right hand side and keep the icon and the text on the left hand side right so if you look here we have kind of if we make this larger this kind of stays on the left hand side and then the button gets pushed to the right so we'll do that with flexbox let's not minimize that let's put that over here the way we will do that is we'll change this slightly so we have three items here now what i want to do is i want to use the property space between when i use space between it's going to push my items out with the space between now the issue is since i have three items if i do space between right now and actually i mean we might as well just add it because we're going to add it anyways let's say justify content space not around space between you'll see that we get them kind of all aligned right i don't want lessons in the middle i want this pushed to the left so the way i have to fix that is i have to make it so i only have two items here so to do that i will now take my i and my lessons wrap those in a div and then by wrapping those in a div the two direct flex items will be the div and the button so the contents of the div will push to the left and then the button will be pushed to the right hopefully that makes a bit of sense i don't even need to give this a class right now i just need to wrap it in a div and when i do that we get pushed to left right so let's say div div now i will add a class because as you can see since i have my h3 tag which is display block i'm going down what i want to do instead is i want to push them so they're on the same line so to do that we'll add our class and we'll say class is equal to i'll just call this left for right now okay now let's go here and add our left so we're going to say dot left okay and then this is going to be display flex like that and now they are kind of pushed together however again we're having this issue where this icon here right is uh not in line with lessons so to fix that we just say uh align items and then this is going to be center and now we've aligned them now of course the problem is we want some padding here and some margins so let's add that we're going to say gap 5 pixels now we're separating slightly from the icon which is what we wanted okay so that's going well continuing we want to style the button we want to add some space now between our two gray containers and how are we going to do that well there's multiple ways to add space between the gray containers the first way is just to add a margin bottom property or alternatively a margin top property so i'll show you the first way if i do something like margin dash top of let's say five percent now you see that we just have a five percent gap based on the height of this card um between the items now the reason why you may not want to do that is because that adds five percent margin to both of these not just the assessment one right because you have the same class for both so now you're getting five percent margin from the description tag now i actually don't think that's too bad but then you see when you do something like this okay well now five percent looks really really big right so maybe we don't want to use five percent maybe we want to use something else so rather than five percent maybe we just do one em and now we'll have the same amount of margin no matter how big the size is and that looks fine to me uh okay yeah that's that's good for for right now uh okay looks good all right so actually let's just leave the margin top of 1em and i'll show you if you change this to bottom now you just get some margin at the bottom right so you're getting a margin of this plus the margin of the original content so just to continue this there's a lot of stuff to go through here if i now change my margin bottom which is this to be zero pixels um okay no actually i don't want to do that um okay i don't know where i was going with that anyways you get the point the point is we have you know the padding here right for the card padding the content but then we also have added a margin here so you're getting a little bit of a weird kind of layout thing going because we have margin bottom on on both of these uh these classes anyways that's fine for now okay so this is looking good now we want to style the button and we want to just push everything in a bit so let's go to our great container and let's add some padding with the content so let's just say padding dash left 10 pixels okay and then we'll just do the same thing on padding right and rather than pixels uh just to keep it a bit more dynamic let's go 1em and uh and one em here as well now i'm just doing that because i don't really care about the padding vertically at least right now but once i resize the button i will probably add the same padding actually everywhere so let's just say padding 1em uh like like that okay yeah so that looks a bit better so let's now adjust our button so let's go here to button and it'll be dot button although i guess we could just directly access the button and let's change the color so let's say the background color of the button will be i guess navy and then we'll say the color of the text will be white and then we want to adjust the font size so i'm going to say font size be 20 uh px okay so that's nice now we want a border radius on the button so it's a bit rounded so let's say 5 pixels okay that looks fine to me and then we want to remove the border so we're going to say border dash color and i'm just going to make that transparent and now that gets rid of our border all right so i know it's not quite the same color as this and we also probably want to make it a bit longer so let's do that by saying padding dash left 1em and padding dash right ym as well all right so now let's have a look at this and it's starting to look somewhat like this car now i know this cart takes up less less width on the screen but you get the idea we kind of have a general layout as opposed to the colors and and all of that okay so that looks good uh last thing i'll do is just add a hover effect here to the button and then i think we'll be pretty well good so let's go button let's go hover and let's change the background color just be blue so now when i hover there you go all right so let's now just add one more of these to the screen so let's copy the card we'll add some margin between the cards uh and actually oh they already have did i already add the margin on the card let's see where's my card oh yeah margin five percent so since i have margin of five percent they already have the margins that's what i need so you can see here i have my program fundamentals and then of course you know i get the same thing again and there you are so we have essentially created this i know it doesn't look exactly the same but you guys get the idea it's close enough for me and that hopefully showed you how you design kind of a responsive flexible layout and as i continue to change the size here these cards still make sense there is a minimum size i can't go any smaller based on the way that i've done this and everything should kind of automatically be scaling because of the way that i've used flexbox so with that said i think i will end the video here if you guys want to challenge yourself try to create some components on programming expert maybe buy it while you're at it you can use discount code tim with that said hope you enjoyed the video if you did make sure you hit like subscribe to the channel let me know if you want to see some more css content and i will see you in another youtube video you
