hey guys welcome back to another youtube video in today's video I'm gonna be going over some of the common errors that people have when trying to mine aetherium strictly software related I'm gonna be going over how to fix those issues so in my last video how to mine aetherium for beginners I was talking about well obviously how to mine aetherium and I got a lot of comments saying yes it worked and I got an equal amount of comments saying no this didn't work when I opened my command prompt it just crashes I got red text and so on so I'm just gonna be going over those issues and talking about how you can fix that so first let's see an example of what an issue looks like so this is one that I believe you guys we're having from the comments I saw so pretty much you were saying right when you run your batch file it just closes right away so it comes up like this you can see every time I run it it just closes right away a bunch of text comes down and then it closes well the first thing we need to do here is we need to read what this text is saying because believe it or not it actually is showing an error message at the end on why this isn't working properly and we need to be able to read that error message now the issue is how can we read it when it goes so quickly so I'm gonna show you how to do that first so you can first figure out what is wrong with your minor so we can do this by just clicking on command prompt like this and by the way while I do this I just want to mention if you haven't seen my last video how to mine a theorem for beginners go check that out first as its gonna go over how to do it and then this will go over if you had any issues doing that how how we can fix that so now what we need to do is we need to change our directory into the correct directory so we need to find our mining directory so mine is called miner right here this is where I have my batch file and that's what we need to get into so to change your directory using command prompt you type CDU which stands for change directory and then the name of the directory you want to change to so on the left side here it shows your current directory in this case I am currently in the user 1 my user directory so I want to first go to desktop and then I want to get into that folder so I'm gonna do CD minor now if you want to go back a directory so say you went into the wrong file can type CD dot dot and you see that moves me back a directory I'm just gonna go back into the correct one and then if you want to see a list of all of the directories you can type a tree oops so tree you have to type before so say if I do CD dot dot and then I type tree like this then it shows me all the directories that are in my desktop so you can see the name of them if you're not sure alright so let's just go back into my folder so C D minor by the way if you still have it as the default name of claymores dual whatever just change it to something that's easier to type in so you don't have to type in that whole mess all right so now that we're in that directory this directory right here we want to get the name of our batch file so in this case we call it start with all capitals dot bat so all we have to do to actually run that is just click start type start dot bat like so now once you type that it should run it in here you'll see the lines of text come down and then you will see at the bottom an error message now this just says that this name here is not recognized as an internal or external command opera program or batch file so that pretty much means well this does not exist now this is the first common issue and this means that you pretty much downloaded an outdated version and you need to download a newer version so it's a really easy fix to do this all we need to do is we need to go to the website so we can go to ether mind or I'll put a link in the description you're gonna scroll down so usually if you go to the top it looks like this until you get to somewhere that says claymores minor and then we're gonna click on the Bitcoin talk thread which will bring you to a page like this now in my last video I said ok just go to google and download the latest version now obviously if you're watching this that didn't work for you so we're gonna try this sometimes we're gonna go to omega because you can see here it says that google blocks some files and if you can't find the latest version use mega so we're gonna do that we go to make up it will list the newer versions just find the newest one as the zip archive and download that version so I've already done that it's this file right here you're gonna download that open it up and then simply get all of these files here and just put them in folder on your desktop so I've already done that and I have one right here which is claymores dual aetherium Deckard mine or whatever and you can see we now actually have this file which is one that we were missing in the last one inside of our directory and that's because of it it's the newer version alright so now we need to do the same thing in here and we need to create a patch file so we can run our miner so let's actually we'll leave this open just to see if it's working laughter so yeah so let's start up our miner so again we need to create a batch file if you watched my last video you know how to do that already so I've already actually created a batch file and I'm just gonna open this up to show you what's inside of it so let me just get rid of this for one second so we have this it's the same basic batch file I have my miner name I have my pool that I've set here and then I have my address my theorem address right here again if you need help doing this go watch my other video I go over how to do it alright so now that we've done that we can double click on our batch file and everything should be good right so let's wait see if everything works and we get red text again and yeah so how do we fix that now same thing if you want to read that whole thing again you can do the same process I showed to run this file I've already read it and pretty much that red text there is saying there's an issue with this pool and you need to type something else into your batch file to make it work and this is a new thing that has just shown up so don't worry if you followed my last video and it didn't work at that time everything was working fine but this now we need to add something to our miner so we can go ahead and we can click Edit right here and then at the end here it's a very simple fix I don't know exactly how it works but all we have to do is just type all pools like so one now don't ask me why this works but pretty much it just does you can do all pools one and now if we run it we should see some green text hopefully coming up showing us that everything is working like so so yeah that is pretty much the fix to two of the common problems that I was having Mining theorem and that you guys were having mining aetherium and this has just come up recently so don't worry if you followed my last video completely and it didn't work this is a new thing so yeah if you guys liked the video and it helped you out please leave me
