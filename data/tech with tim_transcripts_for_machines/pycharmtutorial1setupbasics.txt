very useful and will save you a ton of time every minute that you watch of this video tutorial which probably is not gonna be longer than 10 minutes will save you hours and hours when coding so make sure you watch throughout the whole video and actually understand a lot of the things that I'm showing here because I guarantee you you will thank yourself later for watching this video okay so let's get started with it I'm gonna assume that you guys have no idea how to use pi term we're going to start directly from the basics if you're someone who already knows how to use PI charm you know to add configuration set up a project go ahead and skip to the next video in this series but if you're not then follow along so if you've already opened up pi time you're gonna have something that looks like this you've probably created a project or you might have opened an existing projects what I'm gonna do right now is I'm just gonna close this project by going to file close project and now we're gonna be at a window that looks like this and this what might be something that it looks like for you if you haven't done anything yet with PI charm on the left hand side here you can have your most recent project so you can open really quickly just by clicking on them and then you can create new projects or open new projects in this case I'm gonna open a new project and a new project is pretty much any folder that contains any files in it so like a text file or a Python file so I'm just gonna go to desktop go to Python YouTube and then I already have a project I've set it up here it's called pycharm debug so you can see I can open this I could open the individual file but I'm just gonna open this entire folder because this represents a project okay so I've done this and you can see that have my files on my left hand side here now these files you can open them multiple tabs you can see I have debug ivdel if I want to create a new file in here then I can right click and click new python file regular file which i could add like a text file or something like that okay so that's pretty much the basics of how you open this up now before I even start writing any code I want to show you how you would run code so let's say you open up one of your existing Python projects and you want to run your code you're gonna notice up here I'm gonna just gonna get rid of this right now so that we can do it fresh it's going to say add configuration and this is because you need to add a configuration and a Python interpreter before you can run all of your files so what's great about PI trim is you can add multiple configurations and you can run different files by simply selecting the configuration up here so let's go up here and click Add configuration we're gonna click this plus icon we're gonna click Python and then we're gonna give it a name so in this case I want to be running my gal file so I'm gonna name it Dell so that I know which configuration it is I need to now select the script path I'm gonna click this little folder and find my Dell file it should default you to your project folder so it should be fast to find click OK and then I need to go to python interpreter and select one now you may or may not already have a python interpreter if you don't don't worry I'm going to show that in just one second but in this case I'm multiple I'm gonna select Python three seven and this is useful as well as you can run different interpreters on the same project so now I have that and if I wanted to run the file I could just click this little run icon now if you don't already have a Python interpreter it's very easy to set up all you have to do is click on file go to settings and then go to build execution development you're gonna go to actually I believe it's here sorry project pot charm debug you're gonna go to project interpreter and then you're gonna select one up here so if you already have Python installed one of them should show up like python 37 and I'm gonna do that here if for some reason that's not showing up for you you're gonna click on settings click add and then you're just going to go to what do you call it system interpreter and the find the basic Python interpreter and click OK I'm not going to do that because I already have one set up but that's how you add a Python interpreter to your project ok so I'm going to apply that click OK and we're ready to go so now I'm going to get into just coding a little bit and showing you some of the things that Python our pycharm can help you out with and save you a lot of time the first thing is autofill so you can see I start typing here and already it's showing up what it thinks I want to type so if I want to do this I can simply click enter or I can click tap so now I'm gonna say import and then I want pygame so I'm going to use the down arrow key and hit tab and you can see that that automatically fills up here now notice already it's giving me some little squiggly lines and it's graying out my text it's just letting me know that I'm not using this import statement so if I start using as I say pygame duck Anette you can see that that this goes away because it is a used import statement this already shows you some of the power of PyCharm it's extremely I want to say intelligent and it'll keep giving me recommendations and it knows when you're changing things and doing things wrong so you can see I'm getting another error here a little like recommendation at saying no new line and file so if I click enter then you can see it gets rid of that it just because it wants a new line at the end of each file ok so another really cool thing in PyCharm in terms of coding and this is basically already shown in one of my other videos but I'm just gonna create a variable called X and I'm just gonna print X like a bunch of times to the screen here ok ok so this will work fine it's going to print seven we call it three times but what if I want to change this variable name to something like P okay so if I want to change this to P now if I want to change all of these variables here that used to be called X sorry because this used to be called X and I want to still be printing the same value seven I'd have to change all of these manually and go P P P like that okay now it's not that bad for only three instances of the variable but what if you had this P showing up or the X originally a hundred times in your program well that would take you a long time to change all those very blames it's a really cool thing that pycharm has is it's called refactoring so if you highlight your variable you rightclick on it you click refactor and then rename you can change it to whatever you want so in this case I'm just gonna change it to test I'm going to click refactor and you can see that it changes all of the instances of that variable to the current name and this works within a scope do so if I do something like define main and then I just do test equal to zero and then same thing here I'll print test and I decide that I want to now change this and I click this and I click what do you call it refactor rename and then bootycall it lets go like hello you can see that it now changes it over here so this did it a bit differently just because test already exists but you can see that it's only changing within the scope it didn't change any of the tests up here like that okay so now let's show some other cool things so pycharm has a ton of different commands if you go just to view navigate code just scroll through them you can see uh I tell them things that can do move statement up if statement down move line down move line up there's tons of different things but I'm going to show you a few keyboard shortcuts that should save you a lot of time so the first one is just simply find now this one you can probably guess it's ctrl F and if you do this it brings up a little window here and you can search for things in your programs say I want to find test you can see that it shows me test here and then you can go to the next occurrence of test and keep moving through it's not going to search within the scope or actually it will but it's just because it's not name testing more so if I search for hello you can see it shows me this here and same thing we can move down move up edit them change them and so on so another cool keyboard shortcut is to see recent changes that you've done in your file now you might not find this useful for small files but if you're working on large files or with multiple people to see the changes is really useful so if you click alt shift and then F or not F sorry see it actually popup all the different changes that you made you can see I mean external change 20item insko create a Python script debug deleting creating Python script L and it'll show you all the things you've done in terms of like files and changes to the actual project which can be useful yeah okay so now another keyboard shortcut and this one is useful as well especially if you're gonna be doing the same thing multiple times so maybe just changing your variable name and it's controlled D you can see when I press this it duplicates the line that my cursor is on so if I go on hello and I click control D you can see now I've duplicated hello and that's really useful as well and by the way all these things you can do without the keyboard shortcuts these just save you a bunch of time so you can see that if I highlight this I go code and now I believe there's something says duplicate line mmm it was somewhere but anyways there's ways to do it from just looking at the things up here so to navigate yeah anyways forget about that but there's ways that you can do that without using the keyboard shortcut in case you guys forget okay so another useful thing that PI trim has is this little todo list and this is useful if you're working on a large project are you working on something and you're not sure when you're going to come back to it and like you're you'd be at the end of the session and you want to remember what to do next so if I make a comment just by simply using the pound key here and then I write to do and then I can fill this with every word up whatever I want so I'm gonna say to do finish oops finish in this function like this guy I'm gonna add another to do up here I'm gonna say import other modules I need to start this with to do and you can see whenever I put to do in lowercase or capitals as well it's gonna turn this comment into like a little green comment here and you can see that if I'm in the to do tab down here it shows too to do items so it'll show me exactly where in my file and what line where the comment exists and then if I click on it it'll bring me to it so it's not working so you can see that it would scroll down when I went to main to show me this comment and it's a good way to remember what you have to do and it's useful because you can put these right on where you need to change something or do something new again you might not find this useful if you're only using small what you call it small files and small projects but on large projects this is something you really need to keep track of and it's really useful when you can comment it directly in the code okay so another one that I want to show you guys and this one might not seem as important but it's kind of a weak cool selection tool that you can use and some of you might find it useful so I figured I'd show you so if you hold down the Alt key and you start selecting something and then you move up or down you can see it selects on only the column that you're working in so this is holding down alt key and I'm just pressing the left click on my mouse and just scrolling around you can see it just selects the current column that I'm working with again I don't know why you would find that useful but in case any of you have a certain use for it I'd figure it I show it to you okay so another thing that we can do as well is this thing called surround with so if I type something like and say run equals true and then I'm just gonna type run I'm going to select this and then I'm going to hit the keys ctrl alt and T so ctrl alt T and you can see that it pops up this thing called surround with and I can do if well try except try finally if expression while expression if expression is none you know it just automatically creates all of these different things and if I click for example three then it automatically will surround my variable with the expression that I selected and this is useful if you want to do things quickly and you remember the key lines and if you get used to it it'll save you a bunch of time in terms of having to type out all these expressions and worrying you're like indentation and stuff like that now there's obviously like a million other commands and things that you can do within pycharm and i'm gonna cover them in future videos but i just wanted to show you guys a quick overview of some of the basic things you can do and show you the power of pycharm i recommend that you continue watching the rest of the series because in the next video i'm going to go over debugging and this video I guarantee you will save you a ton of time and a ton of headache when you're working with code and running code because pycharm has a really useful and super powerful debug thing and I'm gonna go through exactly how that works anyways that's been it for this first video I'm gonna be coming out with a lot more showing you more things you can do with pycharm this was just a general overview if you liked the video please leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
