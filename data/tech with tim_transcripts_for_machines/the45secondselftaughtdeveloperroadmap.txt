if you want to be a software engineer or developer well if so here's a list of things that you need to learn first of all programming fundamentals then object oriented programming then you need to move into advanced programming where you look at things like asynchronous programming threading and multiprocessing then I'm going to learn about data structures and algorithms then you want to learn about the basics of databases continuing you might want to learn about how to use your IDE how to use tools like debuggers then you're going to want to get into git and GitHub and be familiar with those commands I'd also be learning A bash Linux and terminal commands then I'd move on to testing so endtoend testing unit testing Etc and then lastly learning about some design principles and software engineering best practices obviously I left a few things out on this list if you want the full curriculum then check out my course programmingexpert.io from the link in the description
