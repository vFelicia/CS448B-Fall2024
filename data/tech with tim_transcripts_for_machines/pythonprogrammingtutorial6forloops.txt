hey guys welcome back to another video this is the sixth video in my Python programming series and today we're going to be talking about four loops again if you miss the other videos in the series please go back and watch them first as it's going to be hard to understand if you haven't seen them already okay so let's get right into it today we're going to be talking about four loops and a loop is a new thing now if you're a beginner in Python and I'll talk about how they work we're going to start off by just writing one out getting right into it with these syntax so for X in range and then we're going to put a number which is going to be our starting position so in this case I'm going to put zero and then a stop point so ten okay and then we're simply going to print out X now I know we did this pretty quickly but let's talk about what this is and the syntax so a for loop is going to run a certain amount of times so in this case we're going to start at zero and we're going to go to ten this means the for loop is actually going to run ten times so what's going to happen is we are going to have our variable X which is right here and every time before loop runs X is going to be increased by one now we can increase it by more if we'd like to by adding another comma here but by default it is set to one like this I've just put it in so that you can visualize it so really we have something start a stop oops stop and an end start stop step sorry mother those put commas here to show you how it works so you can see we have our zero that's our starting number our stop which is ten in our step which is going to be one so I know you don't quite understand yet but you will after I show you a few examples so we have X is our variable which is going to be holding the number of what iteration we are through now iteration just means how many times we've already looped through this loop okay so let's do an example here all right so we have X and we've just started running this for loop now right now X is zero we're going print X we're going to print zero to the screen and then we're going to add 1 to X now this time we come to the loop we say well is X less than 10 yes it is so now we're going to print X X is 1 now we're adding 2 okay so now X is 2 is 2 less than 10 yes 2 is less than 10 so let's print two okay and we keep going until eventually we print 9 then X has one added to it so it becomes 10 well 10 is not less than 10 so we're not going to print out 10 all right I know I just talked a lot there but let's see it in action all right so just like I said we print out the numbers 0 through 9 now this may seem weird because I have the value 10 here so you'd say well why doesn't it prints out 10 it's because of the way the loop works so like I said really what's happening here is this plus equals 1 so pretty much this means we're just adding 1 to the variable X you can also write it like this x equals x plus 1 like that alright so we print out X and then we add 1 to X and we have to be less than 10 for this loop to run so on the 9th iteration we have well 9 is equal to 9 plus 1 so X is equal to 9 plus 1 we get the value 10 now again 10 is not less than 10 so where you're not going to print out 10 yeah so that's pretty much how a for loop works it's pretty basic this is the syntax we have for and then a variable name so this doesn't have to be X we could use anything we'd like to use I could use hello I could use any other word it could be as long as the 1 assures a lot doesn't matter then we have the word in which is highlighted in orange and then range now the range takes a different amount of arguments pretty much an argument is whatever's inside this brackets so like at the beginning how I showed you we just did 0 and 10 this means we have a start and we have a stop so we start at 0 and we go to 10 now I can also I can actually put 1 our in here like this 10 and that just means that we just have a sub so by default Python will say well we're just going to start at zero and we're going to step by one now I haven't showed you the step yet so we'll do that so again we're going to start at zero we're going to stop at 10 and we're going to step this time by two now what step is is how much we add to X every time so before I showed you had x equals x plus 1 in this case since this step is it's going to be by 2 like that ok so let's go ahead let's run this we have 0 2 4 6 8 and you notice how we again do not print out 10 because 10 is not less than 10 okay again we'll do another example with the step let's put 5 in this time now you can guess what's going to happen 0 5 it actually only prints out two things because we start at zero so we print 0 and then we add 5 we get 5 now 5 plus 5 again is not less than 10 so we are not going to print out 10 okay so that is the tutorial on the for loop we're going to do another type of for loop where we're going to use something called lists a little bit later on but right now we're just using this one this is the basic one I encourage you to play around with it yourself and yeah so if you like the video please go ahead and like it and subscribe and I will see you again for another video thanks good bye
