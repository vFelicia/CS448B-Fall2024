hello everybody and welcome to the fourth video in the ordering a pizza with Python series now what we're gonna be doing in this video is just wrapping up kind of showing the items that are on someone's border I'm gonna show you how we can remove items from the order although I'm not really gonna implement like a script that does that for us we're actually gonna some how much all of the items that we've decide to order cost and then we're going to display that to the user and then ask them for their credit card information so they can insert that and pay and place their order so hopefully we'll wrap up everything in this video that we might extend into another one depending on how long this takes and as always a reminder and thank you to our sponsor kite for sponsoring this tutorial series they're the ones that are providing all these awesome auto completions you can see like even when I'm just typing print it gives me the completions from kites when I've been using some different things in the API it's been giving me a lot of useful suggestions for all the different methods so for example these methods are not built into a library like they're just from the IB the API Pizza API and kite is giving us those completions so anyways you can download that for free and a link in the description alright so let's get started now what I want to do is display not only what the code of a specific item is but I'd like to show the name of that item as well as how much that item costs so to do that what we need to do is look at all the information we have about a specific item so I kind of whiz through this in the last video but essentially what we've done here is we said for item in order dot data products now products stores all of the specific items that we've added into our order and all of those items have some information associated with them like for example a code so let's just print out the item which we actually ended up doing in the previous one so let's clear that and have a look at what this is so let's look for an item so let's look for just I don't know Pepsi like that there's no results for Pepsi okay so let's add something else so let's say yes let's look for a pizza what we want um I like this one so we'll take that can I paste that in here no I cannot so I'll just type in 112 T s I X enter nope that's all we need and we can see this is all the information we have about our item so quantity one price 1974 we're is the price there's just like all this information that we have associated with this we have the name so twelve inch thin six cheese pizza we have what else flavor code product code code price so we're gonna use the price tag as well as the name tag to display this item in a list for us so what I'm gonna do is simply do item name plus and in this case I'm gonna do a space a dollar sign like that and then plus item price and make sure that we have a capital P on our price and a capital n on our name so doing this should actually print out the items name and then the price but I also want to collect all these prices and add them together so what I'm gonna do is take this I'm gonna say price equals that will do stupid loss price in here and now what I'm gonna do is say total equals zero so this is gonna stand for order total and I'm gonna say total plus equals and in this case we're just gonna say float price like that so now we should be collecting the total in this total variable and at the end once we've listed all of our items we can say your or your order total so your if I could type correctly here border total is Poland Plus and in this case we'll just do string total like that and we actually might want to add a dollar sign like so okay so this should tell us how much our order total is and then after this we can ask for the credit card information which is what we'll do next so let's run this python tutorial dot pi you're now searching the menu look for an item let's just go for you know sprite like that so please type the code to the items you'd like to order press ENTER to stop ordering okay so let's just get a 500 milliliter sprite so 500 sprite like that and stop now let's actually look for another item so let's get some kind of pizza so what's an easy one to type we have 10s cccan okay so 10 SC can I think that was right let's see SC and okay and then we'll say no we don't want anything more so these are two items we have a 500 milliliters sprite which is 177 a 10inch hand to US Canadian pizza which is $13.99 and our order total is 15 dollars and 76 cents awesome so let's actually just separate the order total so it goes it down one line for us a little bit easier to read and now we need to talk about tax so tax is interesting because this is gonna depend really on what state you live in or what province or even what country you live in so I don't really know a way to get the tax rate from the API so what I'm gonna recommend to you guys if you care to actually implement tax into this and I might just even do a little plus sign and say plus tax so that people know that you know that is you know you need tax on top of that actually will do plus tax like that you could hard code some like tax variable up here and you can say like tax rates equals and in Canada for me where I live it's one point one three so 13% tax which is like very high but I know in some states it's like 7% so you do 1.07 and then you could just multiply whatever this number is so whatever this price number is by that tax rate and display that now that's up to you guys I just figured I mentioned that beeps in case anyone you know is gonna get mad at me in the comments for not including the tax okay so now that we've done that what we're gonna do is ask the user to insert their credit card information so they can actually place this order before we do that though I will show you that if you want to remove an item from your order you can use order dot remove item and then you can use just the code of that item and it will actually remove it for you so if you guys do want to implement that or create a more complicated program than what I'm showing you then you can do that because the point of this is not really to make like a fully functioning program it just to show you guys how to work with this and how we can actually use kind of some weird strange API switch this is okay so how are we gonna get the credit card information well fortunately for us I've actually written a kind of extension to this API called console dot pi you guys can have a read through it I documented it fairly well that actually has a method inside of here that will get a user's credit card information from the console so all we need to do is say card which is here is equal to and in this case it's going to be console input get underscore credit underscore card I believe that's correct we'll have a look here so get underscore credit underscore card and obviously since we're using console inputs what we need to do is import that from here so we'll say console input at the top like that and now we can actually use that to get the credit card and I'm going to show you what this does so inside of here this is what this method is that we're calling it asks for the payment information it says please enter your credit card information enter your credit card number expiry date security code zip postal code and then it actually checks to make sure this is a valid credit card before it returns it to us if we have an exception that what it does is simply calls this method again and keeps asking the user to insert their credit card so what we're gonna do now is say python tutorial dot pi we're gonna say you're looking on the menu okay so let's go for Coke let's go 500 Coke like this just because it's easy and then we'll say nope that's all we want okay so we can see your order is as follows 500 milliliter coke your order total is 177 plus tax payment information please enter your credit card information this information will not be saved so now we can insert a card number a expiry date three digit security code and zip slash postal code obviously this is an invalid card which had just told us so it's asking for the payment information again but once you insert valid payment information then you can actually pay and make the order so this is kind of the part of the tutorial series where like if you don't want a pizza to test this out just insert like some fake credit card numbers that are technically valid but aren't gonna have any you know numbers on them and then after this what we can do is actually place the order and see if we're gonna get a pizza now I'm gonna save that for the next video I think cuz I actually want to use this to order a pizza to my house and like make sure this works and show it to you guys but for now I think I might leave it at that so essentially what we've done is we've got the credit card information we have implemented kinda yeowwww this is what the tax is going to be for your order we've added up that we've looked at how we can use this console input and actually I'll add one more thing because we're not quite at ten minutes for this video yet we'll just extend it a little bit we can actually use this console input which I've created here to get some customer information when we're creating an order so for right now you see we've actually hardcoded the customer object up here so we've said you know this is all the information but we can actually do is simply use a method from console input which I'm gonna show you to do this we're gonna say console input dot get customer like this you can see we have get customer I'm actually gonna do get new customer and what this is gonna do and I'll show you because I've kind of programmed this slightly complex is ask the user to insert their information and then will actually save that information into a folder so that we can access it faster the next time we want to make an order so here we can say to start an order you must provide the following details country if you're ordering from Canada please type yes now so we type yes name please enter your name so it's Tim into your last name we'll do it tech insert your email address so we'll go Tim at Tech with Tim dotnet enter your phone number so we'll go nine oh five seven seven seven seven seven seven seven and then address we need to insert something here so I'm just gonna say forty Bay Street Toronto Ontario what was the postal code of this that's a good question I need to just look at the postal code here before I can insert this so that was whoops let's go over here so m5j x2 okay so let's paste that in there hit enter and then there we go it shows us the closest store so which is that asks us for the menu let's look for Coke we can add items to our order now so 500 coke no we don't want to add anything more assets for our payment information and there we go we've pretty much almost finished this program so anyways that has been it for this video you guys can mess around with this looking console input if you want to see what I've actually written here and kind of how this works and how these things are validated and with that being said if you guys enjoyed make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel in the next video we will be ordering a pizza
