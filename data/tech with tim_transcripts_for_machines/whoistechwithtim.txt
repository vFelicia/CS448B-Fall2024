hello and welcome now if you can't already tell this is gonna be a very special and very different video than anything I've ever posted on my channel before and obviously that is because well you can see me and this is the official kind of face reveal of tech with Tim now I hadn't been planning on doing this doing this I hadn't really announced it was kind of just a spurofthemoment thing I saw webcam on Amazon it was on sale I was like you know what let's just pick it up I feel like it might be a bit more engaging with maybe when I'm explaining certain things or doing some my tutorial videos if you have a chance to just kind of look at me in the bottom right hand corner of the screen so that way if there's not a lot going on on the screen then it's something that's more engaging that you can kind of watch while you listen so anyways I'd like to hear your thoughts on this guys what do you think about is this what you thought I looked like is this a my completely different than you had imagined I don't know I'm kind of curious to see what people had imagined about me in their brain and anyways I just want to talk about a few things in this video first of all I just want to share some information about myself because a lot of you guys asked me a lot of questions and you asked like what do I do how did I learn programming that kind of questions like that so I feel like if I can answer some of those in this video that might give you guys some value some information about myself you guys can get to know me and I also just want to talk about some of the future stuff that's gonna be coming on the channel and some of the stuff that I already have that I think some of you guys that are new subscribers might not know about because in the Matt past month or so I've been gaining a lot of subscribers and a lot of views and I have to say again a massive thank you to everyone that watches videos that likes that shares comments is subscribed it's absolutely amazing keeps me going every day so first of all I guess I'll just talk about kind of some of the stuff I have on the channel that you guys might not know about so I'm just gonna go to playlist here and go to create a playlist and this is what you guys can do too and this will guide you on all YouTube channels whenever I go to view the miter scroll look at all their playlists I have a ton of videos on a bunch of Python programming so a lot of people ask me like hey I'm trying to learn Python programming the PI game stuffs too hard I'm like man just go to my channel like I have beginner Python tutorials I have tons of other game development tutorials like sidescrolling tutorial I intermediate Python tutorials Tetris snake have some module tutorials where I talk about the turtle module the numpy module pycharm I have all kinds of stuff so just look through there and I'm sure you guys will find some other stuff that you're interested in I just finished two classes and objects tutorial series for any of you that were kind of confused when I did objectoriented programming especially my PI game stuff um so yeah also I just want to say make sure you guys are keeping an eye out on the community tab here I've started to post and I'm probably gonna be posting like once a week just giving us some updates about what's going on what's coming next to the channel and for any of you that have been following this you knew that today was gonna be a special video because I kind of announced it on here and that the machine learning stuff is coming kind of near the end of January midjanuary and that Java tutorials will be here very soon I'm almost finishing finished recording all of them so I just have to kind of edit them go through them get everything working with that and then they're gonna be on the channel now in terms of just some information about myself because I did tell you I was gonna answer some questions I just like to say first of all I'm 18 years old I live in Canada and I am in my first year of computer science and actually just wrapping up my first semester as of recording this video right now and pretty much what that means for you guys is that everything that I learned through computer science and all the stuff that I'm doing throughout my fouryear fiveyear degree is is gonna be posted on this channel completely for free and that's really the goal here is to give you guys all of that information completely for free and obviously I'm going to be adding my own touches to it teaching you stuff that I haven't learned so make sure you guys just subscribe for the long run because I'm gonna be showing you guys some pretty cool stuff I'm excited about it I hope you guys are excited about it as well now in terms of myself a lot of people ask me like how to get into programming how'd you learn it like what what's so cool about it would not well when I was really young like I was just really into technology and computers I just found them fascinating so I kind of I don't even know what got me onto it I think I just looked up like coding or something online one day and anyways I ended up learning HTML like a full like HTML course this is what I'm like 12 and then I taught myself like CSS like all that stuff I was doing all this HTML stuff eventually that led me into learning JavaScript and then once I got into JavaScript like I was really interested in making my own websites and stuff so I started learning like MySQL and PHP this is to keep your timeframe around like 13 14 years old and then I kind of just didn't really like the web development stuff anymore like I was learning about all this cool stuff you could do with JavaScript like all this dynamic programming based on like user input I was like well is there any way I can move out of this cuz I don't really like any of the graphic design stuff if you guys can't tell if you've seen any of my videos where I have handwriting like I'm the worst artist you probably ever see so I started learning csharp actually off a recommendation from one of my dad's friends who is a programmer himself and he said it was a decent first language to learn like a real language and I was like okay sure so I learned that don't know if that was probably the best language to start off with learning but anyways kind of got decent at bat by the time I was like 14 15 years old and then getting into high school and taking my first like computer science class like programming class whatever you want to call it I had to learn Python is that's the language they were teaching so I learned that I'm sure you guys can obviously tell I fell in love with Python keep like I've been using Python since I started learning that honestly if you ask me to program in C sharp right now I could probably do like a little bit but I hardly remember any of the syntax from because I haven't used it in so long and now that I'm in university I've just recently started teaching myself Java because I know that I'm gonna have to be learning Java next semester like in a course so started teaching myself Java got pretty good at that and now I'm gonna be teaching that to you guys so in terms of the way I go about kind of learning programming languages now that I'm at the point where I know most of the basis like a lot of people always tell you right once you learn one you can learn any other one and that's pretty much true for the basics of the language but once you start getting into some of the advanced stuff languages are very different in terms of the way that they work in memory and certain functionality they have things that you can actually do with them in terms like crossplatform compatibility as well so yeah so once you learn like a basics and the way I do that is I usually just go online I look up like Java tutorial I find some like text online and I just read it like I just read the text and and I literally learn the syntax and I go on to like Eclipse or whatever IDE and I just try to make something like I'll only spend like a few hours actually looking at syntax and reading or watching videos or why not and then I'll just go on and I'll just try to do something and or like I'll follow like a video tutorial of someone doing something like making a game or making a project because I find that that is the absol because when you're doing that you're trying to accomplish something you run into like like a small project per se okay you run into a ton of errors you make a ton of mistakes and that's the best way that you can learn because every time you make a mistake every time you make an error and you don't know what the issue is you have to go online look it up research it and once you've done that for yourself you haven't just had someone tell you the answer you remember it a lot more and that's really the way that I learned all my programming is I go i watch some videos i do some syntax for a few hours and then i just try to make something and by making something i'm looking up and i'm constantly learning as i'm doing that and i'm making mistakes and whenever i make a mistake then i learned from that mistake i remember that mistake and if i make it again i know how to fix it and typically it doesn't happen too often right and that's what i always recommend to anyone who asked me how can i remember all this how can i do all this will i say well it's awesome you want to start off watching videos learning the syntax getting the basis down maybe following along like a project video with something but then step out of that and try to do something by yourself like pick something that's like somewhat challenging but not kind of crazy difficult and just try to make that and if you can make that and you can accomplish that not only do you now have like an awesome thing that you just created yourself which i think is amazing that you can do on a computer in like a few hours of your spare time but you just learned a ton anyways this has just been a little bit about tech with Tim just doing a few answering a few questions kind of talking to you guys letting you guys get to know me now if there's anything if you want to see a video like this again in the future like like a QA something like that let me know ask me some questions and yeah so with that being said I hope you guys enjoy the video thanks again for all the support that I've been getting recently that's amazing and I'll see you again in another video
