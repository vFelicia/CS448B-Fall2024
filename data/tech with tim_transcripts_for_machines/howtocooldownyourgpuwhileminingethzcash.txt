hey guys I'm just doing a quick intro for this video uh I realized after watching this video I talked a lot and if you guys are just looking for the quick easy solution on how to cool down your GPU you're going to want to skip uh to the time that I have up here I think it's about 5 minutes in uh if you want to learn about why your graphics card runs so hot why uh these temperatures are important and why it needs to stay cool then go ahead and watch the whole video but if you just want the fix and that's all you're here for go ahead and Skip to this part right here and it only takes about a minute or two to explain that so that'll be a quick video for you guys hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video I'm going to be going over a problem a lot of people have and especially a lot of people that are mining ethereum or uh just GPU mining in general encounter and that's the fact that your graphics card runs super freaking hot now when I say that I mean that my card when mining ethereum is actually hot enough to cook an egg now I haven't tested that theory uh but that might be coming up in a future video we'll see because it runs between 80 and 90 degre CI uh if I put my hand on the outside of the card I can't hold it there for very long without starting to uh feel like I'm getting burned now that is way too hot for my liking and probably way too hot for a lot of your likings uh especially if you're watching this video trying to cool down your GPU so I'm going to be going over a way that we can fix that now right now I just have MSI After Burner open this is a useful program if you don't already have this program uh go ahead and download it I'm going to leave a link in the description down below it's free and it's actually made by MSI so it's perfectly safe to use and um don't worry about it all we're going to be doing here is simply changing the fan curve on our GPU now you can see here I have a temperature I'd say somewhat idle because I am recording a video so I am using the GPU a little bit uh 57° C now this already is very hot I know um for an item graphics card now you guys probably have yours running anywhere between 30 and 60° C if it's much higher than that on idle when you're not doing anything then you probably have an issue with your card or you have pretty bad air flow in your case now you can also see I have this other hardware monitor up here just to show you that it is running again 58° you can see over here the for temperatures of my card uh so that there's no question that we're getting the right temperature from our software here so if it's coming both the same here then it's probably fairly accurate so I'm going to go ahead and close this one that one is just to prove to you guys um and now I'm going to start mining ethereum just to illustrate to you the problem that I at least was having and the heat that we would that I would be seeing on my graphics card so I'm going to go ahead and open up my minor just by double clicking the little bat file here if you guys don't know how to mine ethereum uh go check out my video it I'll leave a card in the top right hand corner up here on how to mine ethereum for beginners it's pretty useful I go over all the steps uh make sure you check that out if you haven't or if you don't already know how to mine ethereum and we'll just give it a second to start mining while we are monitoring the temperature on MSI now I just notied as I look back over here we've already jumped from about 57 to 77 and we haven't even got through the initial setup stages of our Miner yet and we've probably only been mining for about 20 to 30 seconds now we're going to see this continue to Rise um not sure exactly how high it'll go right now but sometimes I see this go up to about 90° C uh my room's fairly cold right now so the ambient temperature is probably going to affect a little bit and yeah we can see we're already at 82° C and if I were to continue to mine on this for a few hours we'd probably be sitting anywhere between 88 maybe even 90° Celsius which is too hot for my liking now you guys probably can't hear it but the fan is also starting to rev up on my GPU you can see we've gone from 21% to 33% if we're just looking at the minor and if we're looking at MSI uh it says we're at 40 7% fan speed right now so I'm going to go ahead and close my minor uh and now I'm going to show you how we can fix this issue and then see if it actually did work for our minor now I am going to say this is not going to give you incredible results you're not going to go from your 90° C to 60° CI that's just very hard to do uh and there's a lot more that need to be changed than just the fan speed but pretty much when you have a graphics card it is set to Target a certain temperature meaning it wants to run at that temperature my card is set to Target 80° C so it really doesn't start kicking the fan up until it gets past 80° C and that's something I don't want I don't even want my card to hit 80° C so the way that I can make it uh and cool it down is just by using a simple thing that comes in MSI After Burner now you can see we have this little Auto button here and if you unclick this button so it's no longer red now we're actually able to drag this fan speed here so this percentage now this doesn't tell us in RPMs uh but that's fine percentage will work you can see that my card if I put it back on auto right now at 55° C we're running 39% now typically it's a lot lower than this uh just cuz we were just really hot so it's cooling it down uh but you'll see it go all the way down to 21% now a quick really fast way uh to cool down your card and if you don't mind having a really loud temperature is you can just uncheck this Auto button and slide your bar up to what percentage you always want it to run at so I'll go ahead and check that there and you can probably now hear my computer uh revving the fan if you can't I'll just let you know just trust me it's very loud um the fan on my graphics card is ridiculously loud and that's why I don't do this specific one because while I'm not mining ethereum I don't want my card to be running so uh so loud at least I'd rather have the silence and a little bit more heat and you can see we've dropped down a little bit in temperature we're going to continue to drop as if I'm running my fan at this high speed then more heat is going to be taken off my card you can see we're going down to 47 so that already illustrates that this is a quick fix to cool down your card now this is great if you guys are just going to do this and put your fans at 65% or whatever you want to put them at and then just leave your computer down in your basement and it doesn't bother you it's not sitting on your desk you're not going to hear it but if you're someone like me who still uses your computer while you're mining then you're probably not going to want to do this and the way that I like to fix this is by doing something different so I'm going to uncheck this here and click the check mark so that my fan speed slows down a bit and I'm actually going to go to this settings button on MSI now here I'm going to go to fan and I'm going to go to this enable userdefined automatic fan control we're just going to check mark that box now this brings up a little fan curve for us here now you don't really have to understand exactly how this works but pretty much this is just a little graph or a little chart or whatever we have fan speed on the y AIS and temperature on the xaxis and you can see these dots represent that at 90° C our fan will be running at 100% so I'm going to go ahead I'm going to start editing some of these fan curves uh so that my card is going to be running at a certain fan percentage based on the temperature now you can see at 30° we're going to be running at 40% I'm going to bump that up just a little bit so maybe about 4 45% I'm just going to really bring all all these uh up slightly so I'm going to bring this one up uh from 50° to 60% going to move this one over a bit going to move this one up and just play with this graph uh so that it's something at your liking and you can see now we have at 70° C we're going to be running at 90% now I wouldn't recommend running your fans at 100% as that's going to wear them out I usually don't like to go any more than 80% on my fan especially on my GPU because it gets really loud when I go that high and whenever you're done this little fan curve here you're done this chart just go ahead and click okay and then you can probably hear now that my fan is starting to rev up a lot if you want to disable and enable this all you have to do is click this little setting button on MSI and it'll change the fan speed so you can see we already we just went back down to 19 you click it again and then we're up so what I do with this is whenever I'm about to mining ethereum I'll click on this little fan curve here and then I'll start running my Miner and you guys can see the temperature is dropping and was dropping before when I had it running at 65% and that's pretty much all you need to do to cool down your GPU
