if you use pandas at all you need to know about this library that can literally give you a 150 times performance increase with no code change I'm not exaggerating this library is the Rapids KF Library provided by Nvidia and I've teamed up with them in this video to demonstrate how easy it is to use and the massive performance benefit you can get obviously this is free you don't need to pay for anything and I'm going to show you here how it works and how much faster it is now as a quick primer the Rapids CF Library is a python GPU data frame Library that's aimed at accelerating data science workflows now what this allows you to do is unify the CPU and GPU experience so whenever you can't use the GPU it will just default to using the CPU now what this also allows you to do is continue using pandas when you have massive data sets that traditionally wouldn't be feasible to load on the CPU a lot of people when they use pandas had the issue that as soon as they got into big data sets or a lot of kind of heavy computation they they had to move away from it because they just couldn't utilize it in their workflow now when you have this massive speed increase in this library or specifically at the update to this Library you're actually able to continue using pandas which is the tool that most people love to use so I'll leave some links in the description as you guys can check it out for yourself one of them is going to be this right here which is The Notebook that kind of demonstrates the use case of the Rapids Library now it's the new update to the Rapids Library that came out about a month ago that really brings this huge performance benefit to pandas but Rapids has been around before as well anyways as we go into here you can see that there's just a few commands we got to obviously install CF once CF is installed we can simply import it and then we can literally just use CF as if it was the Panda's import so that's one way to use it but another thing that you can do is there's actually a command that you can run that simply changes over pandas so any import to pandas or third party libraries using pandas to just use CF so if you look right here it says load extension CF pandas when you do that inside of this kind of jupyter notebook environment now any import to pandas whether your codee's calling it any other code is calling it will just default to use KF the way it will work is anything that can be accelerated by the GPU it will just accelerate it and it will just be a lot faster anything that can't it will default to use the CPU so you're not going to have any breaking code everything literally just works let me just get these examples set up for you here and I'll show you how much faster it is all right so here's a quick demo just in the collab notebook you see analysis using standard pandas won't read through all of it we imported pandas I downloaded a data set that's about 455 Megs and we can go ahead and run it and Sample the first 10 entries that are in our data set so give this a second to run here you can see already it's being a little bit slow Okay so we've got 10 entries in here now we can try to answer some questions related to it right we can do some grouping we can sort some indexes some data science stuff that I'm sure most of you probably know know more than I do anyways as we go through here you can see there's some more things like which vehicle body types are the most frequently involved in parking violations Etc right we can go through and kind of run all of these different things now what we can also do is time this so what I'm going to do is just run this and get how long it actually takes to kind of go through this pipeline of operations then we'll compare the same thing later using the CF Library all right so this took 9.93 seconds on the CPU a total of 12 12.7 seconds I'm not sure what the wall time means but says 11.6 seconds anyways we have another timed operation which is this group by uh if I'm not mistaken these sometimes can take a little bit longer actually I guess I was mistaken this took 4.53 seconds and if we go down here this one let's give it a second here looks like it's going to take even a little bit longer took 6.33 seconds okay nice so now let's use KF so what I'm going to do is just just run this load the CF extension so CF extension is loaded and now whenever I import pandas we're going to use CF so we can time this one now when I run it you can see this takes 1.13 seconds when I run this here 24.8 milliseconds run this one here 140 milliseconds pretty much happens instantly now there's a bunch more stuff in this notebook if you guys want to check it out but I also want to show you my own custom demo in the installation process so let's get into that all right so I'm just on the rapid cf's GitHub page I just quickly want to talk to you a little bit about the installation this is going to widely vary depending on the operating system you're on but obviously you're going to need an Nvidia capable GPU and you're going to need Cuda installed on your system now this will work in some kind of Linux environment if you're on something like Windows like I am you can use WSL there's a few more setup steps there anyways as you can see here there's install for this to work again you need Cuda you need a Linux environment that's kind of the basics you obviously then need to have Pand do installed and then you need to install the Rapids CF Library there's a few ways to install that one of which is to install it using cond so you can see here it gives you all of the requirements and then gives you the cond install so in my situation all I did was I opened up WSL I enabled Cuda inside of WSL I installed cond and then I just installed the Rapids Library once I updated my Python and did all that kind of stuff I'm not going to bore you with that if you guys are going to use this chances are you're going to have to go through your own installation process anyways point being here we have two demos right first demo here is just using pandas I'm calling this demo slow I can do python demo slow. piy and you'll see that this works okay it just prints out information about some tip percentages or whatever using pandas now the normal demo here is not going to be any faster because we're not really doing anything that uses the speed increase the point of this is to illustrate to you that all I have to do is change out import pandas from import CF and now rather than doing pd. read CSV I'm just doing kf. read CSV and this will now work so if I do demo. piy we will get the exact same result and you can see we get the same result now just as a quick note here you don't actually have to import CF like I have here what you can do instead is simply run the python command with a specific argument and it will actually automatically kind of override the pandas import for you so I showed you that we could just use CF but instead what we can actually do here is we can say Python 3 and then we're just going to put this argument which is M and then cf. pandas then we'll put the name of the file we want to run so demo slow. piy now that we're doing this we're going to run it with CF enabled and I actually had zero code change so let's go ahead and run that so there you go all functioning correctly throughout the rest of the video you'll see that I do have uh KF for example but again we don't actually need to change it to CF instead we can just use this manual argument that I have here now if we go here to the real demo what I did is just set up a little bit more advanced code and I actually downloaded a fairly large CSV file uh this file I believe is about 1 Gigabyte and as soon as you start using files that are over about 500 migs and you start to do some sord operations mean operations things that are doing a lot of aggregation or a lot of different operations on the data that's when you'll really start to see the performance impact so what I'm going to do is just run the regular demo here so real data demo and just kind of show you the speed I'm doing a bunch of operations here like getting the mean getting high severity sorting grouping and then applying a function to all of the different rows inside of my data you don't need to worry too much about exactly what's going on but you're going to see the DraStic speed increase I'm going to say Python 3 real data demo. piy this is going to take a minute to run once it's done I'll be back I'll show you how long it took and then we'll compare it to the fast or KF enabled version all right so I just ran the demo here and you can see that we're getting you know 46 seconds 39 seconds 19 seconds which actually quite a bit of time especially if we had a larger data set 49 seconds 1.64 seconds okay so the main thing here is the Sorting which took a while so now what we can do is run the exact same command so python hyphen M cf. pandas this time and then the real data demo. pi and you'll see that now we'll enable KF you'll see how much faster this is with no code change just adding cf. pandas all right so this is finished now and you can see we're getting 1.2 seconds 0.02 seconds we're getting 0.4 seconds it's almost a 40 times speed increase from the previous one we're getting 0.28 seconds and we get a bunch of other ones right that are quite slow 0.53 seconds Etc so not quite 150x on every operation but for something like sorting you can see that we're getting a huge performance impact by literally changing nothing we just ran the command using kf. pandas now for some reason you're curious about the data set here this is some us accident data so we've got some stuff like weather conditions severity of the crash start time visibility temperature all this kind of stuff trying to get some Trends based on that anyway it's not super important just wanted to show you the demo here and really illustrate the power of this Library obviously it is completely free and a big shout out to Nvidia for sponsoring this video and for coming with tech like this cuz this is quite incredible and I'm sure is going to help a lot of you now I've left some links in the description one of those links that I left let me see if I can pop it up here is actually a link to the AI and data science virtual Summit now this already happened but there is a bunch of replays of some really interesting events here so if you guys want to check it out feel free to do that this is pretty much just talking about AI data science tools Innovations in the space Etc I'm sure you guys might find some value in it all the links you need to get started with CF are in the description I hope you guys found some value if you did leave a like subscribe and I will see you in the next one
