hello everybody and welcome to another python curses tutorial in this video i'm going to be showing you a few extra functions that we haven't yet looked at this should be pretty short i'm just going to cover a few interesting things that you can do now i will note before we dive in here that i will leave the curses documentation in the description there is a ton of stuff that you can do i cannot possibly cover all of this in this series and the stuff i've showed you so far is probably the most important and the stuff you're going to use most commonly anyways with that said let's dive in alright so in front of me here i have the curses documentation now i just wanted to quickly scroll through this to show you that there is a ton of stuff so please do look at this if you're looking for more features from curses obviously as i was saying i can't cover all of this and it will be in the description anyways what i'm going to do now is hop over to my code you notice i have a similar example to what i had in the previous video except now i just have a rectangle that i'm drawing on the screen and i'm going to show you how we can change the color of the rectangle so if i go here and i run my codes let's go python tutorial 5 dot pi notice we get a rectangle i hit enter and then we get it now let's see how we can change the color of this so there's actually a method that we haven't looked at yet and this is going to be on our std screen called dot and then i believe this is adder and on uh now what this does is turn an attribute so either bold or a specific color on or off so i can turn on for example like the blue and yellow color and then that means that my rectangle will be drawn in blue and yellow and anything else that i do will be drawn with blue and yellow until i turn that attribute off so it's kind of a semipermanent way to declare an attribute rather than adding it to the actual i guess add string method that we saw previously so for now i'm just going to put blue and yellow and then i'm going to make sure that i turn this off after i draw the rectangles i'm going to say adder and then this will be off like this and i think i need to put blue and yellow as well to disable this specific attribute because i could turn multiple attributes on at the same time anyways let's see what this does now by running our code and notice that we're going to get a blue and yellow rectangle right so we have yellow as kind of the border color and then we have blue as the actual i guess outline for the rectangle okay then when i hit enter we are done okay so that's nice let's see what happens when we turn on say just a color i'm actually interested to see if this is going to work or not i'm going to go curses and then color underscore red rather than a color pair and i just want to see if this is going to work i'm not actually certain here i haven't tried this yet but let's give it a shot so let's try to turn on just one color let's go python tutorial 5 and notice it actually doesn't do anything so i guess that didn't work just me turning on individual color i do need to add the color pair now if i don't want that kind of outline right or that highlighting of the rectangle i would just need to make the background black so let's just use the green and black color pair and see if this is going to look any better so let's go green and black like that let's run the code and now notice we are getting our green rectangle perfect now just to prove to you here i'm just going to add a string to the screen so i'm going to say this dot add string let's add hello world let's add this at maybe 5 10 or let's go 5 30 okay and then we don't actually want to add an attribute to i just want to see if this is going to show up green and black so let's run this go here and run and notice we have the green string because that attribute was on and then one more example here if we turn off the attribute before we add the string we should see that it just adds in the default color so let's run this now and notice it does add in the default color okay so that's useful add attribute or attribute on and attribute off now i'm going to show you how we can add a border to the screen so to add a border to the screen is i guess useful as well what you can do is std screen like that dot and then i believe this is just going to be border now if i just add a border all it's going to do is add a rectangular border around the screen so let's have a look at how this works let's go here and notice we have a white border now if i wanted a different color border what i would need to do is add the attribute before i draw the border now i also can specify what the border is made of i'll see if i can actually find this in the documentation because i can't remember exactly what it is so if we go to border notice it's saying we have the left side the right side the top side the bottom side uh the top left corner the top right corner the bottom left corner and the bottom right hand corner you can read what this means and how you change these i just wanted to mention that you can actually change what the border is made of but what i want to do here is change the color of the border so i'm going to add an attribute here and let's just make this orange and white for now again it's called orange and white it really should be red and white so let's change this to red and white so let's make this red and white okay so red and white oh why am i putting that in there okay i wanted to turn it off so let's put this down below and let's go adder off okay so we're going to turn the red and white on we're going to draw the border and then turn off and then we'll go with this okay so let's run this and notice red is not defined oh i didn't want to have red inside of there my bad let's try this again and notice we're going to get our white and red border we then have our green rectangle and everything is working as we expected all right so now that we have looked at how we add the border the last thing i'm going to show you is how we change the cursor location on the screen which is something we want to do sometimes so to do this what we actually do is we use our screen and then we say dot move now this allows us to move the cursor to whatever location we would like now i'm actually just going to move it after i add all of this stuff so let's move it and then let's just go to a position like maybe 10 20 just so it's pretty clear to see where this is so this allows us again just to move the cursor so let's run this and notice that now my cursor is over here rather than at the end of this line which is the last line that i trim so that's how you move the cursor and i said that was the last thing i was going to show you but i will show you one more thing here which actually allows you to view the keystrokes that someone is typing so to do this what you need to do is do the std screen like this dot and then i believe it's going to be echo and inside of here i'm going to put true now what this does is it actually tells the the screen to echo the keystrokes that the user types now i'm just going to go inside of here and say wow true and i'm going to say that the key is equal to this dot get key and i just need a way to exit out so i'm just going to say if the key is equal to q then we will break otherwise though this should just show what we type on the screen this might not be the exact right command but let's try this for right now and see if this is going to work we might have to refresh the screen as well not quite sure let's run this though and see okay so there's no object called echo interested why that's happening let me just have a look and i'll be right back all right so looks like it's actually not this it's going to be curses.echo and i don't think i actually even need to add true there so when i do this it should initialize curses to show me the text let's try this now and notice that if i start typing something in i can now actually see the text that i'm typing in so hello my name is tim and then of course i can hit q here and then that will end the program so if you want to see the text the user types in that you need to do curses.echo that doesn't mean that we're going to easily be able to see it because if you don't wait for the user to type in a key then the program's just going to immediately end so you do need to handle it in kind of the way that i'm doing right here anyways that is what echo does and of course if i remove this so i comment that out and then i go here and i start typing you can see nothing's going to happen and when i hit q then we exit okay so that is pretty much all i had for this video again this is the documentation this is what i've been referencing the entire time feel free to read through this there is a ton of awesome stuff and hopefully this video helped you out if you guys enjoyed this series please do let me know in the comments
