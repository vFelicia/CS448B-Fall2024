hello everyone and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on ordering a pizza with Python now if you didn't guess from kind of the thumbnail and title what we're gonna be doing here is actually working with an API which stands for an application programming interface we're gonna be learning how we can work with api's how we can kind of dig into a codebase understand what's going on and start using the tools that have been built for us and then obviously we're gonna be using that to well order a pizza so basically what this API is going to allow us to do is create some kind of customer object which is gonna have information about a customer so like name address all of that we can find stores that are close to a customer once we find a specific store that we'd like to order from what we can actually do is look through the menu and then order some specific items from that and then finally we can insert our credit card or payment details and actually place an order and have it arrive at our house so before I go too far I will mention that everything you guys are gonna see here will be up on github so there will be a link in the description you actually need to go to this link once we get into the setup phase of this video which will be in just one minute and just in case anyone gets mad at me here I would like to say this is largely inspired by a YouTube channel called Jarvis Johnson which I'll leave a link to in the description as well he made this video here you might see my mouse hovering over it I wrote a program to order a pizza and I believe that the API were actually using here I forked this from his github repository he's made a few changes to it himself so I don't know exactly what changes are his but you can look through kind of the commits to see what he's done versus what Domino's done you can also see some of the changes I've added to the API to make it a little bit easier for this tutorial series so anyways before we get too far I need to quickly mention the sponsor of the series which is kite so let's get into that before we get started I need to talk about the sponsor of today's video which is kite now kite is a free plugin for your IDE or text editor uses machine learning to give you the best possible completions for your Python code it's capable of completing entire lines entire function calls and it ranks all of its completions by relevance so you get shown the best ones first even as another feature called intelligence snippets which allows you to quickly tab through the different options and choose which completion you'd like one of the coolest features that comes with kite is called copilot now what code pilot does this provide oneclick documentation it shows you information about modules classes methods and functions based on your cursor location and best part of kite is that it's free and you can download it at the link below so kite is awesome guys trust me you know I've use it for all of my coding you'll see throughout this video that I'm using kite auto completions which actually makes it a lot easier to program and use api's like this but anyways enough of that I want to go and start talking about how we actually start writing some code and exploring this API so essentially this is not you know a typical Python library this doesn't exist on pip I can't just pip install you know dominoes what you can but it's not gonna have this version what we're actually gonna do is clone this github repository and use this on our system to start writing some code so I've done this you can see you know click the link in the description there's a little bit of documentation on how to do this setup we're gonna run through this together to make sure no one makes any mistakes and then you know if you want to whiz through this and you don't want to wait for all the videos you can get an idea of kind of how some things work by reading through the readme file there is a part of this repository so step one go to the link in the description get on this page and what you're gonna do is click clone or download if you know how to use github you're welcome to clone it by using the link for our purposes we're just gonna download the zip folder so I'll do it like that now I actually already have this downloaded so I'm gonna cancel that but you guys just need to download this github repository somehow and then we'll move on to the next steps so we're gonna close this I actually have my github repository open so this is all the files I've just opened the entire folder and what's called sub line text you guys can use whatever environment you want for the series I'm going to be using sublime text I'll leave a link to that in the description you are an absolute beginner and you know this will be ok if you're an absolute beginner you can go to open folder from sublime text find the folder you want to open in this case I've saved it to my desktop it's called pizza pie or pizza API click open it should open all these files for you and then you can browse through them ok so what we need to do now is actually install the requirements to be able to use this module so we're gonna go into the folder that we just downloaded so whatever you know that github repository lives on your computer wherever you put it what we're gonna do is just get into this interior folder so inside of Pizza API and I'm gonna open up a command prompt window now if you're on Linux you're gonna or a Mac you're gonna open up a terminal window but essentially just open one up I'm gonna type CMD in the top bar here that open a command prompt window like this and we're gonna use pip to install some requirements now if you don't know how to do this or your pip isn't working someone remind me cuz I'll probably forget but I'll leave a card to how to install pip in like the top right or top left hand corner of the screen okay so what I'm gonna do now is simply type this command now it's very important that you make sure you're inside of this directory so where it says users tomate desktop Pete's API make sure you're inside this folder in your you know terminal so you can actually change directories by doing CD and this will allow you to select a directory that you want to go into but the easiest way is just again to go up here type CMD like that hit enter and then it will open at least if you're on Windows so we're gonna do is type pip install our requirements dot txt I just completed that by hitting tab what this is gonna do is look through the text file called requirements txt which is inside of this directory here and it's going to install the following modules for us so requests PI harm crest whatever all these other ones are you're just going to install them so what we're gonna do is hit enter they're assuming that your pip is working everything's good it should install that and you should be fine now I know I'm getting some like weird errors popping up here at my computer I actually have everything installed already so there's nothing to really be too worried about but that is essentially how this works so pip install art requirement stop I get the requirements and we should be good to go okay so now what we're gonna do is we're actually going to just open up this folder and create a new Python file and actually start working and looking at this API so I've opened all of this up here and I've create a new file called tutorial dot P now what we're gonna do in this file is just do a few imports and stuff but before we do that I want to kind of explore what this API is kind of some of the features of it and how it works so let's go to this github page before and let's actually read through this readme dot txt file or whatever it is that's up here and see kind of how this actually works so we can see this is a Python R apple wrapper for the Domino's Pizza API it's a port of the pizza node.js module and you know you can go through all that so what we are seeing right now is that the first step to actually working with this API is to create a customer object so it says customer equals customer and then we can insert some information so it looks like lastname firstname we have an email I believe this is a phone number and address and I think that's it for the customer information it says once we have a customer what we can do is use the store locator module to find the closest store to the customer by doing a command like this then what we can do once we have that store is called the get menu what this is going to do I guess has returned to us some kind of menu object and then we can search the menu for specific items and in this case it says we have you know coke is what we're searching for now when we do that it prints to the console a bunch of codes followed by what the actual item name is and then the price of the item these are the codes that we're actually going to use to be able to place an order and kind of select the different items that we want to put you know in our order so notice here then we go to the next line and we can create a new order so order begin custom order we give the customer and the local Domino's we want to order from and then here we type the codes that correspond to what we would have found up here when we were searching through the menu and we add these items to our order so in this case we have a 12inch pizza we have an extra Mariana cup or whatever that marinara I think that's how you say it and a two ounce bottle of coke or 20 ounce bottle of coke so we can remove items by doing ordered remove and then our last step here is to have a credit card object created and then place our order using that credit card and I also place the order I guess at the local Domino's so that is essentially kind of the steps we need to go through and that is kind of how this API work so this is what's the QuickStart usually this is good to read to understand kind of how these things are and what like what this is so let's now talk about how we actually start using this so we'll notice that actually there's a folder inside our kind of directory here called Pizza APY so pizza pie I guess right and we can see that there's all these different files in here we can actually go ahead and open them up and have a look at what they do and I would recommend that you guys read through a few of these if you want to understand kind of how this works on a deeper level now we have this a knit top pie file as well and notice in here we have all these imports essentially importing all of the different files that are else in this directory now when we create this init Pi file or when this and nip/tuck PI files inside this folder what this actually means is this folder is what we call a Python package now this is good because this actually allows us to import the package as a whole rather than importing individual Python files like we might have had to done or might have had to do before so if when we create a new file what we're gonna do is simply put that file somewhere in this kind of exterior directory and that's exactly where I put this tutorial PI file and in here what we can simply do if we want to use all of the different parts of this Pizza API you know kind of package that we've created is simply import pizza a py like that now by doing that that's going to allow us to have access to all of the different files that are inside of here and we're gonna use some of these different files to you know create objects create a customer and all of that and what we're actually gonna get started with here is just making a customer object seeing how this kind of works and then we'll move from there into some more detailed stuff later on okay so I've imported pizza apo a py now what I'm actually gonna do is change this import statement around a little bit and import a customer object because that's where we need to get started when we need to order a pizza so I'm gonna say from Pizza API the import customer like that and now what I'm going to do is create my first customer object now to do this what I'm gonna do is just say customer equals customer like that and then when I put my brackets here I'm gonna start typing the different parameters that this customer object takes now for example right like when we looked at if I can get out of this at our github repository we saw that it's looked like last name first name and then all these different things right but it doesn't actually tell us what all these parameters are we don't really know what we need to feed into the customer and since there's no real documentation for this other than whatever is on this QuickStart page what we actually need to do is look at the code ourselves to figure out what we're gonna need to do with this customer object so what I'm gonna do is click on this customer dot PI file it's inside of Pizza API like this and I'm actually just gonna look at the initialization inside this class and we can see that we have a few different properties here and these are the order of which expecting different arguments so in this case we can say you know this is the customer who orders a pizza that's what this customer object is and in the initialization we have first name last name email phone and address so that's what we need to feed to our customer object so in this case what I'm gonna do is put my first name which is Tim I'm gonna put my last name which I'm just gonna go with tech for now because I don't really feel like giving you guys my last name then what else did we need so we had first name last name we need email so I'm just gonna say Tim at Tech with Tim dog net which is actually an email of mine if you want to send me something phone number which 905 I'm gonna put in some random stuff just so that you guys don't call me on my cell phone and then finally an address and this address needs to come in in a certain form now if we're ordering from different countries our address might look a little bit different right so what we actually need for the address is a well I'm just gonna go here and reference this is we just need the street we need the state or province depending on where you live or sorry city we need the state or province then we need a zip code or a postal code now I live in Canada so for this address what I'm gonna do is actually just find one online and just throw it in here so I don't give you guys my actual address but if you live in the States just know this is gonna be a little bit different for you right you're gonna need to put a zip code which I believe is five digits whereas my postal code is gonna have numbers in it and it's gonna be six characters long okay so I'm in sort of inserted the address here which is forty Bay Street Toronto Ontario m5g and we're gonna actually need to do a comma here so what we're gonna do is make sure that our address is you know kind of separated correctly so we have that street number and name so forty Bay Street we have the city we have the province then we have the postal code and notice that even though I live in Canada and typically the postal codes are separated by space I've not done that in this instance so this is important we need to make sure the input looks like this and if you know what this address is if you guys live in Canada leave a comment down below because I think that'll be kind of fun if you guys guess what that is okay so now we've created a customer object what's the next step so let's have a look at our github here and we can see that the next step is once we have a customer object is to find our local Domino's so what we're gonna do is I'm literally just gonna copy this line here so my local Domino's equals store locator dot find closest store to customer and we're gonna use this so let's go back into a sub line and let's paste that there but what I need to do is make sure that I import stoat store locator first so I'm gonna do comma paste and put store locator up top here so now we can use this and what I'm actually gonna do is simply print my local donut Domino's and again you know you guys probably might realize that while I'm typing or getting these completions those completions are from kite which is the sponsor of this tutorial series okay so let's have a look at this so let's actually run this I'm just gonna hit control B what's my error here ah okay I need to do something I'll be back in one sector spine to finding a way to show you guys how to run this code okay so I've got my code running now I apologize that this is a little bit small for you guys but you can see now that when I print in our done python tutorial pi so that's how I'm running my code I get a store and address and then I get open now yes or no so this is apparently or I guess not apparently this is the closest store to the customer that we put in and it's telling us the closest Domino's is at 344 Front Street West unit 107 Toronto Ontario open now yes so mess around with your address in here or some other different addresses and use this kind of code and see if it's giving you different results and if it's working because this is where we're gonna end off the video for now so anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this so far I know we haven't done much in the next video we can do a lot more programming but I want to get you guys kind of comfortable with the idea of using an API working with an API understanding where some of this code is coming from for example this is the customer class in here so you can see kind of how this works and then the store locator class is inside of store and you can guess kind of how we're actually you know getting that information and read through kind of the bottom you know underlying code to what we're writing up here so anyways that has been it I hope you enjoyed if you did as always leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys in the next tutorial
