hey guys and welcome to a very special video so I've actually been waiting to record this video for probably about a month or two and it's finally here and I'm really excited about it and I want to officially release and tell you guys about my website tech with Tim net so right now if you guys are not gonna watch through the whole video which I'm just gonna explain and go through the website please do me a favor and just click on the website link just go through click on a few pages it takes you literally like five seconds and actually helps me out a ton so if you guys aren't going to go through the video at least do me that favor and just click on the link in the description because that really does help me out and it costs you guys absolutely nothing so anyways I want to talk about my website tech with Tim net so I've been working on this website for probably about the past two months just writing tutorials getting everything set up doing a lot of coding and stuff like that and reason it's taking me so long is because I've pretty much had to write textbased tutorials for almost every video that I have on my channel but I'm glad I did it and I'm really excited to show this to you guys so make sure you watch through the videos I'm gonna explain like how this website benefits you so I think the most important thing is probably this this forum page okay so this is the home page you guys can read through that I'm not gonna bore you with that but I'll go to the forum page here and this is what I think is really exciting and you guys should be excited about because on here I've just started a forum that has topics for all of my major kind of tutorial series so any of you guys are subscriber so probably at some point had some issues coding or some problems where you required help and a lot of you guys have been asking me for help on discord and I love that and I try to help you guys out as much as I can but I'm getting to the point now where I can't help everyone in one day I just simply don't have enough time with what I'm doing and the amount of questions I get so what I've done is I've started this forum that is gonna allow you guys to kind of help each other and that I can kind of prioritize questions on this forum so essentially from now on if you guys have questions I would recommend you to hop over to this forum page I'm gonna leave the link in like every video description and just post a question in this forum because I get email notified whenever you guys do that and I can help you out and answer here in that way other people that have similar questions can see the thread and they can look at that for the answer as well and essentially if you guys ask me questions on videos that's fine but what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna copy your question paint making a new topic in the forum and then answer it and then I'll just leave the link like underneath your like as a reply to your comment so you guys can have a look at it but it will be on this forum page okay so this is really exciting please guys don't hesitate to make threads ask questions it's this is an awesome thing I have a ton of different topics and there's general topics as well you can just ask like any kind of question about Python okay and I already know that I have a ton of people on my channel that love to help you guys out I already see them on in the descriptions like commenting back to people that's awesome so I would encourage you guys to answer topics on the threads and yeah and the next really exciting page is this tutorials page so essentially this has all of the major tutorials on my channel in textbased version as well as the video so essentially you guys can pick a topic so this is like Python programming tutorials this is game development module walkthroughs machine learning which is coming out soon and if you want to know the exact date you can go follow my Twitter right here because I have it posted on there Java programming tutorials those aren't done yet for the text base but they will be done soon so let's just say for example we go to Python programming tutorials you can see the four main topics I have on this o classes and objects tictactoe game intermediate beginner let's say we go to beginner it gives you and this is the same for all of my tutorials it's gonna give you an overview of the series what you're gonna learn and then some prerequisites in case there's something you should know before starting the series once you're ready you can obviously click get started and on the right side you can see all of the different topics that are in this series and you can see that we have the video that's already up on YouTube and then there's a whole textbased version of it pretty much exactly what I talked about in the video obviously it's not as extensive but it's kind of a quick summary and it goes through and has all of the code that I use in my videos so let's actually just do an example here because I think this might benefit some of you more so if I go to pygame and I go to like Tetris tutorial and let's just skip to tutorial 4 okay you guys can see that I have all of the code that I use kind of briefly explained and then if you go all the way down to the bottom I have like the full code which I would usually post on paste bin or github and this is really awesome because paceman sometimes has bugs and people say that they can't like copy the code properly so this way you guys can just copy and paste it with no issues and it's really easy and it's all in one place on tech with Tim net to find obviously I have a support and donate page so some of you guys have already donated to me and that's amazing thank you guys so much but if you guys do benefit from the content you know I don't make a lot of money off this so I really appreciate it if anything that you could possibly donate unive it's just a dollar a dollar month dollar one time really does show me a lot of support the amount doesn't really matter just the fact that you guys are showing that you're supporting the content is what really matters to me so I have a PayPal donation and a patreon link if you want to support me on a monthly basis again like these are all the different tutorials and these are just the main like series on my channels I'm probably not gonna do like individual videos on here because it's kind of hard to organize them I might just post all the code so that you guys can go come to the website to get the code but yeah so I'm really excited about this website I think this is gonna be awesome for both of us it's an ongoing project it's by its note by no means done I have a ton of work to do on it but I'm now at the point where I feel comfortable releasing it to you guys so if you see any bugs or an errors broken links please don't hesitate to let me know let me know on Twitter discord just a comment on a video because obviously I want to fix it and make it as good as possible but full disclosure I have not proof read most of these things that I've written because I've just been focused on getting them out so you see like spelling errors and grammatical errors I know they can be annoying to read through but please just bear with me I still have a lot of work to do on this website and you guys are gonna see kind of the growth and and how big this is gonna get so this is really the next step for tech with Tim from now on any big series or videos that have more than like one video like a part two a part three I'm gonna be posting on this website and yeah so this is amazing please guys do me a favor just check out the website even if you don't want to go through any of the tutorials and you may even find that there's some stuff on here you didn't know I had on my channel like the game development stuff a lot of people don't know that I have all these different tutorials and like regular Python programming a lot of people don't know that I have intermediate Python programming writer classes and objects tutorial so please do me a favor go check out the website it would mean a ton to me and I guess only the last page that shows this community page but I'm assuming you guys probably already know I have a discord server and this is where I've been doing kind of oneonone help just chatting with you guys feel free to join with that but again if you want help I would really recommend you go to this forum page and leave a link because not only can I answer you on there but everyone can answer you on there and that's just an amazing place to go and we're kind of starting to build a community so with that being said this is kind of the end of the video I would recommend you guys go follow me on Twitter if you want to see like what do you call it leaked videos release dates if you scroll far enough down which I'm not going to because I want you to go follow my Twitter I have exactly when the first machine learning tutorial is coming out and if you guys think you're gonna be slick and go to my website and click on machine learning you can see the first three videos in kind of a summary of what the series is gonna be like but if you try to click on these it's passwordprotected so you're not gonna be able to get in until I actually release the video on YouTube so with that being said this has been the end of the video please guys go ahead over to tech with Tim net just check out the website browse through it it would mean a lot to me and I'll see you guys again in another video
