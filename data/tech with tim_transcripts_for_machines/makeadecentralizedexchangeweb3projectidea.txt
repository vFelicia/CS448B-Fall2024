the next project I'm going to recommend is creating a decentralized exchange now obviously this is going to be a more basic version the ones like pancake swap or other very popular ones you may have used before so you can create something very basic where say one user submits a custom erc20 token to a decentralized exchange contract then someone can buy that token or tokens at a specified price the next way would be to create something like a liquidity pool now if you were to create a liquidity pool what you would need to do is have an erc20 token which is your LP token your liquidity pool token and you would give that token to users for providing liquidity in your pool it's not overly complicated if you do kind of a simplistic version of a liquidity pool and you can learn again how to exchange and transfer tokens how to actually do like a trade if someone wants to trade their ether for a specific token or a token for ether Etc
