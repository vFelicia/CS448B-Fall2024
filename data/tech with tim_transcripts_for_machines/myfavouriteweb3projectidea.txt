so project one is kind of the traditional project that I like to recommend to everyone when you're just starting out and this is a bank account that's really critical to understand as you become a blockchain developer how to send and receive ethereum in a safe way to a Smart contract how to maintain user balances and if you wanted to get crazy you could do stuff like having an interest rate on funds that were sent into the bank account right so if you're holding funds in the bank account you get a very small interest rate like you would in a normal bank so that would be my goal for this first project create a bank account contract test it deploy it write a basic frontend to interact with it and now you've learned how to send and receive ethereum properly
