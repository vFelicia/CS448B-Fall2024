all right so you've done all of that you're banging your head on the table you cannot fix the bug what do you do next well you may not like this answer but honestly it is what works for me the best take a break and try again tomorrow or try again later you've gone through and you've checked everything that you need to check you've got looked at the logic you've used the debugger you've checked the variable names you've looked at your dependencies if you've done all of that and you still can't find it you need a mental brick honestly whenever you find you're running into a lot of issues or there's a bug that's just really difficult to find seriously consider just stopping taking a break doesn't have to be for a long time maybe half an hour go for a walk come back to it chances are you're going to be in a better state of mind and able to find that a lot easier also you can kind of have your perspective drilled into one thing that you think is the issue when it's something completely different and by kind of taking a little break you can reset that get rid of the tunnel vision and hopefully find the book
