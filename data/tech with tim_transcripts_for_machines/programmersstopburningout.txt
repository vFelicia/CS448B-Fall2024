oftentimes I see especially younger programmers are just constantly grinding the most brutal boring and difficult computer science topics they're just going through these quite frankly pretty brutal topics without ever working on something fun without ever doing something that they actually enjoy the reason I think I'm as good as I am today is because when I was younger I didn't do this because I wanted a job I didn't write code because I wanted to show off to friends I did it because I genuinely loved it so please keep this in mind it is totally valid and fine to work on fun stuff because after all what is the point of grinding through all these topics making this money getting this job if you just hate what you do and you're not happy and looking forward to actually writing code being passionate about the field that you've kind of chosen to go in
