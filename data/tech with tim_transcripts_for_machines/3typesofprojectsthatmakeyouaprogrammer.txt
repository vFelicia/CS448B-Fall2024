if you want to be a competent developer you need to work on projects but not just any projects ones that actually give you the skills that make you stand out as a developer that's why in this video I'll share with you three types of projects that are guaranteed to make you a programmer now the first type of project that you need to build is something that you have no idea how to build that's right you need to pick an idea up that seems so incredibly difficult so far out there so forign something that you genuinely don't even know how to begin I'm talking about projects where you might not even know the programming language you're going to use you don't know the framework you don't know the IDE you'll be using what operating system it's going to run on something that is so foreign and so out there where you genuinely have to start right from the beginning pretty much as a beginner now the nice thing is you still have your programming knowledge and a lot of what you know is going to carry over into that project however when you start a project you have no idea how to build you have to learn a ton and you have to figure figure out how to learn as efficiently as possible so right when you learn something you can apply it into the project I find the times I learn the fastest and the best or where I have something I need to build and I don't know how to do it that forces me to be resourceful go out there learn a new skill and pick up only the information I actually need to immediately apply it in the project this is a massive skill and that's why I want you to build this type of project now what this will also do is help you build your confidence being able to finish a project that you genuin had no idea how to build when you started is going to allow you to realize hey I'm a programmer I'm not just a python developer or a JavaScript developer I'm a programmer I'm someone who can write code in any language any framework and I can figure it out it might take me a little bit longer but now that I've done it with this project I feel confident to do it with any type of project those are the best programmers ones that are experienced in multiple languages multiple Frameworks and have the confidence to know that their skill set can be applied in pretty much any domain any role any application doesn't matter what it is now that's exactly why in my software development course which you can check out from the link in the description we teach you multiple programming languages and actually get you to specialize in a specific area of development so you realize that you can be good at JavaScript go and then you can go and learn devops then you can learn backend then you can learn front end you're flexible Dynamic and you're someone who really stands out as a junior developer if you guys are interested in that course check it out from the link in the description we have an entire network of employers that are ready to interview the top students graduating from the program we've already had a few people that have finished the final exams and are just getting to that phase right now anyways I'll give you an example of an app that I built when I was younger that did pretty much exactly what I described now when I was in grade 11 I had only ever written code in Python I was actually pretty good at development already but I had really no experience outside of python and a little bit of c and some basic web development now I had a problem I always had to walk every day from school to home it was about a 30 minute walk and I constantly had to carry these super heavy textbooks that were like 20 30 pounds in my backpack and it really kind of took a toll on me so what I would do instead is take photos of the textbook pages I needed and just look at them at home the issue was by the time I did this the 50th 60th day I had hundreds of photos in my camera roll and it was pretty difficult to actually locate the pages that I needed so what I wanted to do was make an iPhone app that I could have on my phone that could just organize all of these photos for me and kind of keep a log of all of my textbook pages homework assignments questions I needed to do Etc now I had no idea how to build this so I actually had to start building an IOS app and I didn't even know what IDE to use what framework I needed what language I was going to write in so I ended up learning Swift learning xcode building a UI learning all of the intricacies of iOS development and in about a month I was able to make this app now this was really the first time in my life that I gained that confidence to feel like hey I just went from having no experience how to do this to building a fullfledged IOS app in about a month what does that mean I can do in the future that means I can learn any language that means I can learn any framework and it really made me feel like much more of a programmer and not just a python developer so I encourage you to build similar things like that especially if they help you in your real world life those are some of the best projects where again you constantly have to find exactly the information you need apply that immediately and continue that process until you finish the project now the second project you need to build if you want to be a programmer is something that has real users now this doesn't need to be millions of users or hundreds of thousands of users or even tens of users it could be two users it could be three users it could be your mom it could be your brother it could be you who's using the application but it's so important to actually build something that's used by real people that's because people interact with an application a lot different than you think and often times it's very difficult to actually imagine how someone's going to use the code that you've written and it makes you think about about things in a very different perspective when you have real people using your application giving you feedback you need to think about things in a very different way first of all is what I'm building actually helping the user is it just cool for me or is it something that's actually going to be useful and worth their time second of all how easy is it for the user to use this feature can they understand it is it intuitive do they need instructions it just gives you a very different mindset on things and it forces you to be almost a product manager while an engineer at the same time which I think is a really valuable skill at the same time you need ways to track your users analytics you need to figure out if bugs are occurring or errors are occurring you need way to capture feedback and you need to design with the user in mind so I would encourage you pick some type of application that real people are actually going to use I'll give you an example of one that I made my friends and I would constantly complain about who was on aux Ox meaning controlling the music and all of my friends pretty much use Spotify so I actually coded a solution that was going to be used by about five or 10 of us where what we could do is go onto some kind of app we could see the current Spotify song that was playing and then we could vote to skip that song Or vote to add a new song to the queue I essentially tried to design a collaborative kind of music playing system so that we no longer had to have these arguments about who is going to be controlling the music at a party event when we were playing cards whatever now I actually put this project on YouTube you guys can go and check it out if you want to see that anyways this was a real world app where I learned a ton and I had to constantly commun unicate with the users of the app and see if they were actually getting the value I intended them to get there was a lot of changes I needed to make a lot of things I needed to add and it really made me think about development in a different way that's why I encourage you to build an app that has real users now the last type of project you need to build to really become a great developer is something with a team or a partner you need to go outside of your Solo preneur or solo developer mindset and realize how you can actually develop with someone else or with a team of people now this will change a lot of things especially if you've never done this before because immediately your code quality now is going to be put into question other people are going to be reading and working with your code people are going to be looking at your poll requests your commit messages and it makes you think about things in a very different way all of a sudden it's not just for you it's for other people as well and you need to learn how to collaborate how to delegate how to make sure multiple people aren't working on the same tasks how to deal with conflict how to use git properly or Version Control software and that's exactly why in my course we encourage you to collaborate with people through our Discord server and our community and we have all kinds of lessons and resources related to git and also just software engineering tools and kind of best practices that you don't stand out as a complete beginner when it comes to collaborative work anyways I encourage you find someone that you can work with now you can do this with a friend if you know other people that are into development you could do this with someone from like a Discord group so whether that be my or my free Discord server you guys could check that out people are always looking for other people to work on projects with and even if you join an open source project that's good too the point is you need to get experience working with other developers see how that works the communication channels and you'll realize that a lot of what you're doing on a daytoday basis isn't just development it's actually collaboration and it really changes the way in which you do things so to summarize you need to work on a project that you have no idea how to build one that has real users and one that involves collaboration with real people whether that be a team or a partner if you do all of that I guarantee you you will massively improve as a programmer and you will see a huge confidence boost in yourself and the quality of work you can deliver if you guys enjoyed this
