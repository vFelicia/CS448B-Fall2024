first tip I have for you is to have a goal and actually to have multiple goals let's say you're in a computer science major and you guys are just lazy unproductive you're like oh I don't like this I don't want to do this one of the main reasons you're probably like that is because you don't actually know why it is you're doing this computer science major you haven't created those goals in your head when I'm talking about goals I'm saying something like where do you want to be in 30 years what's the point of getting a degree what's the point of this education you can't work on something very hard and be productive if you don't know why it is that you're doing that
