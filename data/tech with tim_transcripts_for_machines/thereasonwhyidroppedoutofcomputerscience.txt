so I did go into a computer science degree no regrets going into that initially I was learning a lot in the program and this is right about when my YouTube channel started to kind of grow so this is first year of University and I'm in computer science I have a YouTube channel with probably about 5 000 subscribers at that point in time there's no doubt in my mind you know I'm finishing this degree I'm getting the computer science degree now as I get into second year university the channel is really starting to take off and this is also when I get a job at Microsoft as a software engineering intern so now I'm kind of at the point where I'm starting to achieve a lot of the stuff that I only really have thought would be possible by having a degree I have all these opportunities I start working on algo experts start building out programming excerpt so it comes to the middle of the year right I'm 2.5 semesters and and that's kind of when I started hitting my breaking point and start seriously contemplating dropping out of school I'm starting to realize that I just cannot sustainably work the way that I'm working and I can't continue to grow this Channel and this business to the point I want to bring it if I'm going to be in school
