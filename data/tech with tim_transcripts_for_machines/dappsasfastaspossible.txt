now dapps are really just decentralized apps that's all they are that means they use some type of blockchain technology and we can trust all of the code associated with this application because it's completely open source it never has any downtime and once it's added to the network it cannot be removed modified or changed so just like transactions we know we can trust when they're on the blockchain we know we can trust all of the code that's on the blockchain because we can see it ourselves we know it cannot be changed or modified and we know it's never just going to disappear because the blockchain is always available
