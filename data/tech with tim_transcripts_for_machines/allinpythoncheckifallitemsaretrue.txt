in python there's a useful function that nominee people know about called all now what all does is tell you if all of the values in an iterable are true let's have a look at how this works if i print out all on my first example which is lst c we get false the reason we get false is because zero is interpreted as false in python let's try an example two lst two we get false as well clearly there's no true values in this list let's go to lst of three we get true the reason we get true is any string that has content inside of it is considered true in python clearly true is true as well and then let's look at our last example which is on the tuple notice that we get false because the false is present if i were to change this to true then we would get true hopefully you found this helpful if you did follow for more
