in this video I'm gonna be showing you how to download and install tensorflow GPU on windows 8 and Windows 10 now this is only gonna work if you have a cuda enabled graphics card now if you don't know what that means the way that you can check this first of all is if your card is in a video graphics card and if it is on this list so if you're not sure if your card has CUDA typically all the newer cards within the past three or four years that are any nvidia cards do have that enabled but to check you can go to the link that i'm gonna have in the description down below and look through this list to attempt to find your graphics card now if you can't find your graphics card at all on this webpage don't bother attempting this as this is not going to work you do need CUDA for tensorflow GPU to work on your machine okay so now that we've done that I'm just going to go over that this is a very tedious process this takes a long time and the steps that you have to do to do this are very important that they're done in the correct order so please watch through the entire video and if you're not sure about something I'm doing pause and rewatchable which I personally had to do when I was installing this and it is a pain so the first step and the first thing we need to do is we need to uninstall all of our Nvidia graphics cards and what he call it drivers sorry not graphics cards so what we're gonna do is we're going to go to whatever the uninstall list is on your computer and just find anything that says in the video so for example I'm going to keep going and you can see I have a ton of Nvidia drivers so I'm not gonna do this because I already have it installed but uninstall all of these now don't worry if you have your graphics drive around here we can reinstall them afterwards but to save us a lot of time uninstall anything that says in the video after we're finished that go to your C Drive and your Program Files times 86 and again find anything that says in the video and delete it so in this case Nvidia corporation just delete this folder all right go back go to now your other Program Files and find anything again that says in the video so Nvidia corporation of idiot GPU computing tool and delete these folders that we and reinstall them afterwards this is just to save you a lot of headache okay so once we're finished with that the next step is to download and install Visual Studio 2017 now all of the links that I'm going to be showing you here are in the description down below and there's a very brief description of all of the steps that you have to take so if you get lost you can read the description but this link right here is gonna lead you to download Visual Studio 2017 download and install the free version and just do whatever it recommends for you so once you've installed that we can move on to the next step now the next step is to check the current version of CUDA so we need to install a CUDA driver to our system so that our graphics card is going to be enabled to use that and to work with tensorflow so go to this web page that again I'm gonna have in the description down below and check what this version says so says NVIDIA GPU drivers check this version so CUDA and 9.0 requires that you have a driver of 384 point X or higher and then CUDA toolkit it will tell you what version of CUDA is currently supported by tensorflow and this is the version that you're going to have to download if you're what if you're not watching this recently and this says like CUDA ten point O or eleven point O then that's what you're gonna have to download in this case I'm gonna have to download version 9.0 so check this webpage and then move on to the next link that is going to be in the description this next link is to download and install CUDA sorry that's the wrong page so this is CUDA toolkit 9.0 now I'm gonna put this link in the description down below again if you have to download CUDA ten point o or a different version please download the correct version I will leave the link that what do you call it goes to all of the different versions so you can pick which one so first we're gonna select our target platform windows and you can see that right now it's asking me to download 10 point oh that's not the one I want I want 9.0 so I'm gonna go back and find nine point oh here we go cool CUDA toolkits 9.0 so I'll leave two links one for 9.0 and one for all the other versions okay and I'll label them in the description we're gonna click on Windows and you're gonna leave that and just click version 10 and you can download and install that and through the installation process now I'm not going to do that as I already have that installed but once that's done you can move on to the next step okay so the next step is downloading and installing si UD nn okay now I'm gonna leave this link obviously in the description again and you need to install the correct version for your version of CUDA so you can see here on this page we have ten point oh and 9.2 and 9.0 now obviously for we're using 9.0 so we are going to download from this link once you click this link it should give you a folder that looks like this in your download bar once you get that folder just open it up and you can see that we have a folder called CUDA now we're gonna move to our desktop we're going to extract this folder just by dragging it on there and you can see that once we open this up we have three folders bin include and lip what we need to do now is open up a new file explorer and we need to navigate to Program Files so C Drive Program Files now you can see here that you should now have two folders so after installing CUDA and afternoons are sorry just after installing CUDA I guess you should have a folder that says Nvidia corporation and NVIDIA GPU computing toolkit if you don't have this one it's fine but make sure you have this computing toolkit we're going to go into this folder I'm going to click on CUDA and then we're gonna click on version 9.0 and you can see that we have three similar folders we have been we have Lib and we have include what we need to do is open up the first of all the bin folder and we need to open up the bin folder over here and we're simply going to drag CU DNN in to this folder so you can drag it and it should just copy in there I already have it in there that's why it was causing an issue right so we'll just replace file and destination ok continue and there we go now it's in alright now we need to do the same thing with include so we're gonna go back let me go to include take all the files that are in include and simply drag them in here like this replace file and destination already have them in there but I'll just go through it with you guys okay next one lib same thing times 64 so we'll go back here to Lib we're gonna go inside the times 64 folder inside over here and we're just going to drag this in replace file and destination and just click yes okay so that's all with that si UD n n and that is officially now installed in our system now the next step is to add something to our path so to do this we need to edit our environment variables you can find that just by searching in your bottom windows bar so we go to edit environment variables when you go to environment variables and we're going to go to path now in here we're going to click Edit and we're going to click new now the path that you're going to add is going to be this path and this path okay now I'm gonna leave these in the description I'm also gonna put them up on the screen right now in case you would rather type them out now these two paths this version number is going to change depending on what version of CUDA you have if you have version 8.0 this is going to be eight if you have version 10 point O this is going to be 10 other than this these should be the same except for that version number so just check that when you're installing that you have the right version here in your path and again these are in the description once that's done click OK click OK and since you've changed something you're going to click apply and ok and that is all for downloading and installing CUDA and C UDN owners whatever name is okay the next step for us is to download and install anaconda now this is a Python distribution which allows us to set up virtual environments so that we can run tensorflow now tensorflow currently is only supported on python 3.5 or 3.6 I believe so for this video we're going to be working in Python 3.5 it really doesn't matter as long as you have a version greater than 3 there's not really a huge difference in Python Justino so you can download any version of anaconda that you want but when we set up the virtual environment we're gonna use 3.5 so download and install anaconda I already have it downloaded here 3.7 version is fine and then open it up run it and run through the installation process now I already have it installed so I'm not going to go through this but just notice that actually let's go through it quickly just me let's see I see it's already there so it's not gonna let me do that but pretty much what you guys need to make sure that you click when you're installing that is anaconda path it's going to give you like some red text and say are you sure you want to do this just click yes make sure that you add anaconda to your path okay make sure that you do that otherwise these next steps are not going to work for you okay so now I'm assuming you have anaconda installed you have CUDA installed you have Visual Studio installed and before that you uninstalled all Nvidia drivers if you're caught up with me we're gonna move to the next step and this is the easier stuff so we're just going to run our command prompt and pop it up like this and we're simply just gonna type Conda to test that everything is working now once you test this if you don't get any error messages you've successfully completed the beginning part of the Tauri tutorial at least so far so you can continue on what we're gonna do now is we're gonna set up a new virtual environment and get ready to install tensorflow into that environment because up until now we haven't even installed tensorflow so we're gonna type Conda and and then we're gonna give it a name so you can call yours tensorflow I would recommend I already have a virtual environment called tensorflow so I'm just gonna call this tutorial okay and this is gonna be the name of the virtual environment that you're gonna use when you are using tensorflow so name it something that you're gonna remember okay and then you're gonna type python equals 3.5 now don't think you can put any number here if you put a number greater than 3.5 i will not guarantee that this is gonna work for you as tension flow is only supported on certain versions of Python as of today when you've done that click enter no what's it Conda and no command Conda tutorial ah sorry I need to add creat my bad Conda creates add tutorial and then python equals 3.5 my apologies about that okay so once you've done that it should start saying solving environment and everything should start working now once this is done it's going to go through installing a bunch of stuff you're just gonna continued and click yes and wait for this to finish okay so now that everything is downloaded and installed we need to activate the virtual environment so this is what you're gonna do anytime you want to install a new package into a virtual environment you first have to activate that environment especially if you're using anaconda okay we're going to type activate and then the name of our environment so whatever you named your environment in this case I named mine tutorial okay so we activate tutorial it should give you the little brackets like this and that's how you know that everything is working now what we're going to do is we're going to install tensorflow so to do this we're something going to type the pip install and then ignore and then installed upgrade and then tensor flow gee pete you like that okay it that it's going to run through an installation process that will most likely take a few minutes and once that's finished we can move on to the next step okay so now that we have finished installing tensorflow within our package or sorry within our virtual environment there are a few other packages we need to install now I recommend that you should install all the packages you think you're gonna use right now just to save you some time so you don't have to go back and reinstall packages but one that you're definitely gonna want to please pip install and then care us okay so go ahead click that and you should run through this and same thing wait for this to finish and then we're gonna install one more package okay so now that care is is installed you have the option to elsewh install the packages I'm going to type that so I'm just going to say sorry import pip install and then I would recommend you install pandas because you're probably gonna have to use that when you're reading in data and creating data frames especially if you're using any machine learning stuff which I assume is why you're installing tensorflow GPU version I would also recommend you install numpy I'm not sure if it automatically comes with tensorflow but if it doesn't you should install that while we are already in the installation process now that this is finished I will show you what to do if you wanted to get back into your Condit environment to install stuff say you forgot ru there's another package you want you could just go here to your command prompt and simply type activate and then the name of your virtual environment we'll activate your environment and you can now go and install all your things so if I just type Python in here you can see it says Python three point five point six we get anaconda and I can test out to see if everything is working by importing tensorflow and you can see that we haven't received any error messages yet it should actually go to the next line yes there we go so importing tensorflow was successful and that's how you know that you have officially installed tensorflow into the in virtual environment now that's all you need to do when you know how to work with tensorflow feel free to click off the video but if you want a quick tutorial on how to actually use this virtual environment I suggest you follow along now what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up PI charm which is the IDE that I like to use I know this is not the best for data science but I'm going to show you how you can actually use your virtual environment and where to find it and this will work in other editors as well so I'm just gonna create a new project and I don't know let's just call it yeah untitled is fine for right now now where it says project interpreter you're going to want to change this to an existing interpreter now you can see that I already have a virtual environment called web scrape but I'm just gonna set up a new one so click existing interpreter click this dot dot dot and then go to kondeh environment again click this dot dot dot and you're going to find your conda environment now your Kannada environment should be in your c drive users your user name and there should be a anaconda folder like this so this is going to be wherever you installed your ant Conda now within here there's gonna be something called env s okay inside env is you're gonna have your virtual environment so you can see that I have four new web tensorflow tutorial and web scrape you will have one if you haven't made a second one open up your desired virtual environment like this and then find the file that says python w exe so click on that one and this is going to be the one that you select you click OK now this is going to be your project interpreter and this is how it works with pygame now if you'd like this to be available to all projects you could say make available to all projects other than that just go ahead and click OK and you've now officially you can see that we have Python 3.5 and it is the tutorial virtual environment which means now that tensorflow and all the packages you installed within there are gonna be in this interpreter so you could go ahead and click create if you're using pi tram and then if we want to test this out i can create a new python file really quickly I just call it del and then I could simply import tensorflow well it's gonna take a second to scan the packages but once that's done we'll import tensorflow okay let's see tensorflow and if you don't get any errors on that import statement and everything looks fine you are working and you are good so that is pretty much been it on how to install tensor flow GPU you guys have any questions or something's not working leave a comment down below if you got lost in this tutorial and any errors popped up I recommend you restart the process watch the video again and really make sure you're following everything again all the links to everything that I do are in the
