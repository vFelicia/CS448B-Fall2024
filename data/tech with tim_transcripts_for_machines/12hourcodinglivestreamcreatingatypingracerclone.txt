e e I don't know if you guys can hear me I don't know if this is working I'm going to take a minute just to make sure that everything's working here obviously I don't stream very often the last time I streamed was probably like a year and a half ago so I apologized that there was like 17 streams going on with like some working some not working some people there some people here anyways we are starting I'm just going to make sure you guys can hear me yeah okay let me know in the chat I think the latency is pretty good on this stream on the last ones I've done it's been like I would talk and then you guys would reply to me in like a minute okay I'm just reading the chat looks like we're all good no audio crisp and clear you're good you're good works okay sweet let me know in the chat guys keep uh keep me updated on what's going on here because a lot of the times I'm probably going to mess something up we've got 48 six people watching this is awesome um yeah thank you guys all for coming out this is going to be an awesome stream however long you guys can stay that's great obviously I'm going to be going for um what do you call it for 12 hours not audible um can't hear let's see the quality turn on slowmo no sound H okay I'm getting an your audio stream is zero okay one sec guys it's really hard for me to tell if this is working or not suggestion the audio streams current bit rate is lower than recommended okay good no sound can hear perfectly well are you guys trolling me or not can you hear me I'm going to go on my phone and just and just make sure that it that it sounds good because I don't want to stream for 12 hours with bad sound okay oh guys I sound great stop trolling me okay if you guys troll me it's actually good I I don't want to tell you that but it might work because I don't stream very often anyways let me go through what's going on here first of all I need to thank the sponsor of the Stream it's algo expert you guys can see the little overlay that I have here you guys probably know algo expert you know that I work there it genuinely is in my opinion the best platform to use to prepare for software engineering coding interviews they've got about 155 coding interview questions data structures crash course a ton of other just awesome features on the platform to help you guys prepare and land a job in the software engineering industry obviously you can check them out from the link in the description and then you can use the code Tech with him for 10% off with that said I would really like to keep looking at the chat we've got 661 people thank you everyone for tuning in but oh and look my thing is working the donation thing is working this is great this is good news thank you for the the Super Chat uh let me just Shout at the name here gaming with Gant via uh yeah I'm not going to be able to pronounce that here you go Tim appreciate that though okay what we're going to be building here is a clone of the popular website type eraser now I know I've called it typing eraser just cuz I think that's a better name uh but let's go to typing eraser here and I'll show you guys what I'm going to be building so if you go to race um let's go to practice yourself you can see that it shows you like a block of text it has like you know the lights or whatever and then like you go and you are typing and racing against someone else so right now I'm doing this just like single player but usually there'll be a bunch of people that you're racing against so I want to make the same thing obviously the UI won't be as complex as this but I want to make it code racer so I want to have a block of code show up on the screen and then like we'll probably do headtohead so two people two people will race to type out that exact block of code like indentation and everything now I'm not going to be able to do it as well as this because uh since it's coding like the way you code is you can't you skip characters all the time right like when I'm coding if I go here and I go to I don't know let's just go to some some file here go to app. TSX okay if I go inside of here when I'm coding if I do parentheses right like I'm always going to type like this like this is how I type and so if we make it so that you have to not skip a character like you have to type each character perfectly that's going to be a problem for most people when they're coding so it won't be as nice as that uh but that is what I'm going to try to do okay 752 people wow this is awesome um Tim common you can do this in seven hours no need to go all the way to 12 yeah okay and so I am going for 12 hours if you guys follow this channel if you've been subscribers before uh then you would know that I've done a few of these streams the first stream I ever did it was 18 hours long I wanted to go for 24 but my body just genuinely couldn't handle it like I got to 18 hours and I was just sitting there like I couldn't do anything like I was just stupid essentially after 18 hours uh and then I did a 12hour stream that one went really well I did another 12hour stream and now I'm doing a final 12hour stream previously I'd done like a 4our stream or 4 and a half hour stream uh but yeah this is tough uh for the first few hours I'm probably going to be moving relatively quickly and then as soon as it hits probably hour five 6 maybe 7 uh you're going to start to notice that I am just not as intelligent as I was before and my coding productivity is going to drastically decrease so I want to get started I'm going to get started in 1 second but I want to walk through kind of the stack just really run through the idea what I'm going to start building so you guys have an idea of what I'm doing uh you guys are asking a ton of questions I'm trying to keep up with chat um na uh Navy Anish uh technical Point best of luck for the project donated 40 uh whatever the Indian currency is I don't know what that's called is rupes the correct one I I might be wrong in that anyways thank you for the donation appreciate that uh um no music can you guys not hear any music I think there's music isn't there let me know if you guys can hear the music or not because I do have music playing can you guys hear it music type in the chat music if you can hear the music or if it's too loud or if it's too quiet I can they're trolling yeah guys this is so hard when I'm streaming cuz half of you are trolling half of you aren't trolling and the people trolling are like spamming more so it's really hard to determine uh if the music is is on or not if you guys want to check out who uh who made the music is actually a friend of mine it's uh Linked In the description you guys are saying it's it's too quiet okay I think the next song's cominging on right now anyways we'll we'll deal with that later uh bad music music so the thing is I have to use copyright free music I don't trust using any music other than music I know someone who made it from so the person who made this music is like a close friend of mine and I know he's not going to copyright strike me so that's why I'm using it it's just to have something in the background um now it's audible slow mode how do I turn on slow mode is there a way to do that I genuinely don't know how to turn on slow mode is it like that does that do anything no okay I guess that doesn't do anything um is there music music music okay great you know what let's get started I'm going to walk through kind of the stack I'm going to be using here I've set up a little bit of stuff but it's not like fully functioning I still have to go through the rest of the setup so what I'm going to be using here is react flask typescript and then a bunch of other like libraries through npm that are going to help me do stuff like authentication um what else sockets all that kind of stuff so react obviously will be the front end I want to use typescript just cuz I haven't I actually haven't like written in typescript for about a year and I think it would be fun to use typescript and I think it's just better for like a large project like this and then flask for the back end cuz I don't really need a ton of stuff on the back and it's going to be a super simple database and all the database is going to be doing is storing like login authentic credentials and then some stuff related to like users typing speed like that's all I really need for the back end there's not a ton of data involved in this application the most complicated part is going to be how do I send live uh the progress of two people's kind of typing on this code and then actually validate like who's typed the code properly what percentage of the code they've typed and then calculate their wpm so words per minute um live that's going to be the hardest part um please no music we can provide our own and get rid of spammers I'll turn the music down I I do like music just for myself so I'm going to have a little bit of music on um but yeah if you guys think it's too loud or whatever let me know lower the music okay make make music louder lower the music okay I have music on uh I think it's probably quiet enough now good good music good what do you guys think music too loud it should be good now now good now good okay remember this level it's at negative 32 DB music is perfect I know I should get a haircut guys oh my God I want to get a haircut so badly I literally cannot legally get a haircut in Ontario right now and I won't be able to legally get a haircut in Ontario for the next like 3 weeks so this is going to be this is the longest my hair has ever been and it's going to keep getting longer okay nice perfect can you please say Okay wear headphones guys chill can you put 28 DB it's on 30 DB right now your hair looks good thank you appreciate it go enable slow mode guys I don't know how to enable slow mode I want to I want to enable slow mode but I don't know how to do it um how do you do this okay let me let me just look that up quickly before we get started I want to get all this setup done how to enable slow mode YouTube um toggle on slow mode there there's I don't see anything that says slow mode maybe I'm just settings let's see maybe have to do it through actual YouTube not uh OBS um it will it will be on streamlabs is it on streamlabs uh schedule stream start no guys if someone sends me like a photo of where to do it then I can do it um okay uh yeah this should help oh did the nightbot do slow mode for us alt f4 yeah okay guys I'm not I'm not going to get trolled that hard I uh I do know that okay awesome so let's let's get started where I'm going to try to set this up there's like a bunch of setup I still need to do I should have done this before but it's fine so I have like a python API file or folder here this is where all my flask stuff going to be I have like some basic setup here but I need to configure the database and then what else do I have here um obviously all of the stuff related to react so I have like my SRC folder here with all this typescript stuff I'm going to start just cleaning this up actually right now and removing all this crap that I don't need there's actually a lot of it uh references I probably need that I don't I don't know if I need that actually okay let's delete that let's delete that great oh and in terms of the no breaks thing I will like go to the washroom obviously and I'm going to go like get food and bring it back here but the stream's not going to end like I will be live for 12 hours and like the longest I'm going to be away from this uh computer is probably like a few minutes um so that's kind of what I mean when I say no breaks although like if I'm like just absolutely exhausted I will uh what do you call it take like a short break in terms of like um I'll I'll play like a video game maybe or something I don't know we'll we'll see uh it'll only be a few minutes long okay index. TSX react okay I think that's good also just to note I I forgot how hard it is to focus when the uh the chat is going because like I'm trying to code right now just very very lightly just deleting stuff and while I'm trying to talk and read the like millions of messages that are coming in uh it's it's actually really difficult so big uh what is it appreciation to people who do this like all day okay so the first thing I need to do here is I need to enable a proxy for my react application so that any of the routes that you try to go to if they're not actually like react rout uh will be forwarded to my API so I forget how to do that so we're just going to look that up uh I'm thinking it's probably smart to go in incognito mode while while I do all of this okay so let's uh look up how I'll say Pro proxy react okay proxying API request that's exactly what I want okay proxy and I believe I add that in package.json perfect okay easy so do that down here proxy who remembers what the port is for flas development server it's either 8,000 or 5,000 uh we can see this pretty easy CD into code racer and let's go python run API uh starting on 5,000 okay so Local Host 5,000 that should be good let me end that let me just add a script in here it says um API oops that needs to be a comma and we'll say Python and then runor api. piy great okay let's see what everyone's saying here um is the latency low Tim yeah the latency is hey Tim your screen is not clear can you guys not see the screen is it blurry or something um but let's see are you guys on high resolution I have two of these things open uh if you're using react you can remove the import react okay it's blurry clear no clear it's fine it's fine it's fine screen is a little blurry screen is good screen's good yeah let guys obviously let me know perfect screen it's fully clear okay great perfect I guess people wouldn't be trolling by telling me that it looks good okay let's continue um TS config see I haven't used typescript in so long so I genuinely forget like how it works um so this this stream is going to be a lot of me just figuring stuff out I have no idea how to do what I'm about to do here uh but the first thing I do want to do is just get this server running and just make sure everything's working so let's just yarn start here uh and let's see if we we get a crash or something or if this is going to be good okay yarn start and then in a new terminal window here I'm going to say CD into code racer and then yarn API okay let's get our server here can't resolve logo SVG okay let's wait what file was that in that is in app. TSX okay remove that excuse me uh we can remove yeah I don't need all this crap get rid of all this okay so now save that should be good let's go here refresh perfect now let's go P tag and test if I can get a lowercase here okay perfect great all good uh enable slow mode you can remove the import react see I'm God I have a stack Overflow right beside me uh minus 10 please still screen is a little blurry 10 AP for me is just fine you can remove import react stop spam uh want to see live progress yes you guys are going to see progress yeah Jango is overkill for this that's why I'm not using it um as a beginner will I pick anything up yeah definitely probably just the um what do you call it uh like the way in which I'm like writing the code like at least when I was a beginner I wouldn't write code very cleanly uh and you'll probably see here kind of like some of the Styles and ways that I write code okay I want to enable slow mode sorry guys I am uh I don't stream very often so this is like really new for me I just want to make sure that everything is is working before I go for 12 hours and look back at the recording after and be like damn it it's not working uh moderate live chat okay let's see what it's saying here subscribers only slow mode create a live stream click settings click live chat toggle on slow mode turn on in stream now go to your live dashboard click in the chat module click settings okay see I'm doing this and it's not I don't see like a settings page settings participants timestamps H okay go here stream Health viewer activity analytics merchandise is there anything else here okay stream settings guys I can't like this should be way easier to find I genuinely like cannot find the button for slow mode share add stream marker create highlight video okay you know what we're we're going to go without without uh without slow mode because I genuinely can't uh can't find it it says I should be able to do it while the stream's running but I just I can't seem to find it maybe I actually have to to go to the stream itself and not the uh the dashboard although I did try this already YouTube and yeah obviously I have two extra monitors that you guys can't see one on my right side one on my left side that's for that's for any of the uh the confidential stuff while I'm streaming although I guess like this isn't really confidential but just so I don't leak anything okay looks like the stream's working screen looks uh looks clear to me doesn't look very blurry that's that's good chat um toggle timestamps manage moderator hide chat yeah okay I mean until until I can figure that out we're just we're going to go without slow mode on okay so what I'm going to do now is start working on the back end a little bit actually uh and I'll create like a login form as well I also need to install material UI so I'm going to do that now npm install app material UI although I believe there's a certain version I need to use for typescript so let's find out what that is and yeah we should keep it in incognito mode okay uh typ script uh material youi okay let's see usage just give me the damn npm command in order for types work you have to at least have the following options enabled in TS config okay create react app with typescript okay and PM install mpm start do any of you know do I need to install like a special thing for material UI for typescript okay install material UI typescript uh material UI is this going to be the same app yeah it is the same app okay I'm just going to install it and see if it works mpm install at Material UI uh is that not what it is at Material UI obviously I haven't done this stuff in a while see here getting started install material UI I think it's just mpm install material hyphen UI uh oh no at it's okay I found it now at Material UI core that's what it is although that seems to be working materal UI slore at types at types that's the one okay someone's helping me in the chat here do you have anything on your channel for beginners to learn I have lots of stuff on my channel for beginners to learn okay so this is at Material ui/ core and then someone said that I need to do the at types that's what it was I forgot that's what's there okay sweet so once that installs then we should be good I can start building the login screen and then I can start doing the authentication for the API so I'm going to say at views do and then I guess this is root I'm going to say slash login uh methods equals get post Define login pass okay and this would be signore up okay sign up methods okay great Divine sign out methods equals get okay I don't think we need a post request for sign out please use functions uh yes I'm obviously I'm going to use functions damn material UI is like massive it has to install a ton of crap okay and deprecated why is all this stuff deprecated H interesting okay I think everything is working good you can do yarn ad instead is yarn ad better is it better to use yarn than it is to use um to use mpm you guys are copying the code yeah good luck trying to copy the code I'm not probably like going to be going like pretty fast to like a lot of stuff would you please code your walkin clinic app live please says sujal something can't pronounce the last name thank you for the Super Chat no I'm not going to do that live I wouldn't code something out that I already have coded right uh you should be consistent yarn is better imagine using Create react app LOL yeah well I'm using Create react app because I'm definitely not a uh what do you call it expert here in in in web development okay so yarn API did that not work when I did that no okay that did work good and yarn start sweet so let's build a um actually let me fix this first I'm kind of all over the place right now I got to get into the flow of things here okay app. config DB nice from Models import this is going to be user excuse me let's go create database nice okay so now I have to figure out what I want to do why is this not working oh I need to install that um actually I can just change my interpreter select interpreter I think this is the correct one we'll see though and that's giving me an issue for some reason um file for module react GSX runtime implicitly as any type if the react package actually exposed this module consider sending a poll request okay damn it that's annoying I might just restart uh the react setup and do it uh without typescript because I feel like the typescript actually might cause more problems than uh than I was anticipating so let me take this API folder let me move it out here let's just restart this entire thing okay remove giveaway what are you guys talking about what giveaway did I announce a giveaway or something Tim say hello hello everyone if you're restarting then give nextjs a shot um no I don't know nextjs I'm not going to use that I know react enough that like once it's set up I can start working through it uh how are you going to tackle the part where you have to give the input code I don't know what you mean failed to delete do you yeah okay that's fine oh it's cuz it's running in the server okay and delete Tim VC not responding uh hi Tim GitHub repo x x team giveaway I did announce the X team giveaway that is on my um what do you call it uh Community tab for YouTube hi Tim hello everyone hello how many still have 750 people watching wow you guys just watching me you do nothing right now but uh happy you're here uh repo please I will do a repo but I got to obviously get this working first I don't need to uh commit to a repo this second okay let's do this again so CD dot dot or yeah okay npx create react app code racing okay how did you learn these many languages I don't okay I did not I do not remember these languages you're going to notice that like a lot of this stuff I've taught before but I still don't remember it just because there's like so much when you go between different programming languages that it's more just like knowing how to learn the new stuff if anything okay so this should uh create a database for us we need to create a user model in flask let's start looking at that flask um authentication I actually found a really good article inside of here that I'm going to reference okay so let's do this okay setting up and deploying JWT based authentication using flask and react perfect I'm just going to follow through this and hopefully this will work for us okay I already have all of that flask I need these okay let's add those in okay and oh my God I have so many Chrome windows open hey Tim can you create DSA playlist I might are you going to host the website I will try to host the website okay awesome so why why did this not work why did this not create the the code racer thing do I need to refresh this there you go okay now it's here Pi instead all right another Super Chat here is there some tutorial you know of that shows how to connect a flask app to a demone using Lode but using cloudfare DNS no I have a series that does everything uh that you just mentioned except cloudfare I have a video connecting a domain to a lenoe uh VPS uh for flask API but it uh does not use cloudfare DNS okay there we go so now we're all good now this is working okay let's delete all this crap again that I don't need delete delete these two can be deleted okay logo SVG why did that not delete delete okay uh did I delete something else that I needed where's the index.css file or index.js file did I accidentally delete that ah I did okay delete and delete delete okay app.js that's delete that delete all this index no this can just get deleted package Json let's set up the proxy to P Local Host colon 5000 okay so please can you code any Android app live for my CLG um I'm probably not going to code an Android app live to be honest with you it's just not something that I really want to do uh people are focusing on chat rather than on your code yeah I'm focusing on chat rather than on my code this is why we're getting nothing done right now it's okay this is what happens in all the streams I start being all flustered looking at the chat and then as soon as uh what is it we start really getting into it then I can start moving and actually coding stuff out because right now I haven't really done anything okay CD code racer yarn start nice and yarn oh I need to add that API script okay API and then this will be Python and run API py great okay let's go back to flask here views.py nice request jsonify is what I need to for now let's return jsonify sign up just to test this uh this needs to be inside of a dictionary okay data sign up return jsonify sign out and okay and log in nice okay so that should work now failed to compile uh can't resolve web vitals forgot about that that okay that should work now and how many damn Chrome windows do I have here react app that's good don't need that what else is here don't need that okay refresh and go to slash login and that didn't work oh it's cuz I'm not running the API command failed can't open run api. py oh crap I deleted that file okay I need to remake that let's find new file runor api. Pi okay from API import what is it what's in here create app okay and then we'll say if then app equals create app app.run debug equals true great okay so this should work now yarn API python run API perfect let's go here refresh log in come on work why isn't it showing me that um is that is it still rendering the react page even when I when I do this cannot find report web vitals come on SL sign in is my proxy not working hm okay let's see see here package Json proxy oh maybe I need to restart this cuz I restarted the uh or rewrote the package Json I also have two of these my music keeps turning off all right let's see what chat's saying wrong Port uh what port is this 5,000 I put 5,000 didn't I HTP yeah I did okay yeah I know it'll work if I go to uh 5,000 SL login uh wait did I not do this properly uh nit models views I have a login route am I doing something wrong return jsonify remove the space in return no no no that's that's definitely not the problem uh at views. root I think it might be in my init.py from views import views register view PL see no it was working SL log in say I'm getting a 404 though um oh it's cuz I have/ API as a prefix that's why okay slash API slash login there you go now it's working okay so let's go back to 3000 SL API SL login why is it not working um it's I guess the proxy is not working let's see here run API package Json Local Host colon 5 ,000 it shouldn't make a difference if I do 127 or not um let me see what what is what did I have I have another project where I did this and it worked so let's open that file open folder okay oops go to desktop and react tutorial no that's not where I did it I did it somewhere else hm check the Chrome console it's a good idea actually console yeah there's no problem that that should work though that's why I'm kind of confused because the login should be it should be going to the proxy uh but if for some reason I think it's just react is not sending it to the proxy uh maybe because I need like react router or something okay I'm going to this is how I got it to work in the previous one so let me try this uh yarn add react router I think that's what it's called let's see if that works fetching packages info warning react scripts oh did I not H why do have typescript interesting okay I think react router added itself uh what I can do though is just set up a route and then see if that works no I know uh guys video quality is good okay sweet uh you guys are saying I'm on the wrong thing the thing is what I want to happen is from here I want it to re redirect me to my flask API so I want to be on the react URL and then I want it to work so like proxy over to the uh the flask one I know the flask one works uh but uh I I need to get the proxy to work essentially okay I need to delete that read me G ignore is fine okay API views maybe I didn't save this file or something no this this file is working package Jon proxy and now I want to do in Source the router okay so now I forget how you do this damn router I know I have to import it say import router from or import yeah is it router from react router again need to reference some code here so I can see how this works Sublime Text file open folder and desktop YouTube code I know I did in this react Jango okay let's open that okay music controller no front end and SRC component app oh my God that's really big app is rendering the homepage homepage has my router in it here okay router switch let's just copy all that and then we can leave that there okay that actually looks like that works now let's go and take the rest is the music did the music stop I think the music did stop how do I put this on a loop okay Play There You Go import this nice okay I guess I don't need link right now now let's get rid of all of these other roots that I don't need nice okay exact path render no I don't need all that slash root okay nice and then let's just put a P tag here and just say home okay this should work now hopefully react app we just throw that on here why is that not going is there a reason I can't put this tab here okay um that's annoying can I put this tab on this one yes I can okay what the heck that's all right that's fine I guess that just doesn't have to work oh yarn start uh Local Host refused to connect oh now it's connect connecting twice it's Incognito oh Smart Guys very smart uh could not resolve react router Dom is it is it just react router browser router is exported imported as hm is react router Dom a different thing than re act router oh man you are an ad react router dumb yeah chat is going crazy right now it's react r or Dum thank you thank you guys thank for the help uh 850 people watching well thank you guys for watching I feel like I'm not entertaining you very well because I haven't really done much but I'm I'm trying now um so let's let's go now okay refresh react app this is promising home ah beautiful okay now slash API slash sign or slash login come on work no it's not working E I don't know why that the proxy is not working what app did I do this in okay this I actually worked on this in a private repository that I can't show you guys unfortunately but I did get this proxy thing to work so let me go and check what I'm doing wrong here um okay package Json yeah that's exactly what I have have let see here HTP colon Local Host colon 5000 okay proxy you aren't even fetching guys you don't you don't know it's okay um a lot of you don't understand what I'm trying to do here I believe I'm trying to uh proxy the react routes so that they go to my backend API I had this working like flawlessly previously so I don't know why it's not working right now but uh let's look here J okay router go here I don't think I need the switch actually I think I can do it without the switch um oh no I do need to switch oops either way I'm confused why this isn't routing back to my API H Source index.js H you need the switch 12 hours it's router not route um yeah I have if I have router here I don't I'm so why is this not working I don't know why this isn't isn't going here slash let's just see Slash login like it should be sending anything that's not I don't get it just like save this again maybe it wasn't saved if it wasn't saved that would be that would just be an L let's see though on start okay maybe I need to clear the cash maybe that's the problem see nothing's getting sent over here I don't know why because I can't really do much until that works uh Slash API slash login console no I don't understand what are you guys saying you need to restart server which server you have route use git you need flask cord Google your problem check your console proxy to localhost API maybe that is actually what I need to do um actually I don't think that it's going to work GBS Local Host 5000 okay I'm just going to copy my other project that had this working website oh what the heck okay let's see if if that did anything no still not working eh you you need to remove yarn react router okay maybe that is why yarn remove react router your proxy's Local Host colon 5,000 I know that's the that's the port for my my thing maybe it I just need to make it HTTP no that should work okay let's restart earn start refresh oh oh that that's okay I no but that should work that should still work someone say someone was saying something that I thought made sense but um so maybe this is actually working it's just not returning anything it's just not showing anything on the screen uh let's go Network developer but the thing is I should see it hitting the end point here which I'm not seeing use uh use legendary stack Overflow guys stack Overflow isn't um isn't going to help here just run on diff server run just run server on diff ports these the okay let me explain the problem to you guys cuz a lot of you don't understand what's happening I have two servers I have one for my react front end and I link is defined but never used okay that's fine and then I have one for my python backend what I would like is whenever I go to a URL that is not defined by my react front end it automatically sends the request to my back end however uh when I do that nothing's happening and you can see that nothing's happening because if you look here on the right side this will show me a request for example if I go here and I go to 5,000 and I go to slash login you're going to see we get a 404 right because it actually hit that Port however what's happening with react is it is not uh proxying the requests over so I mean I guess we could go to the legendary stack over overflow but I I doubt it's going to give us our answer react not proxying okay sure let's do that uh by default uh the fetch API when used with an absolute URL will mirror the host page so calling fetch okay maybe I do need to fetch it let's let's just try this uh run API index. yes whoever said fetch I apologize I kind of ignored you let's just use a a hook here to do this so we'll say import use effect from react okay and say use effect I think that's how you do it yeah okay use effect and then we'll say actually Fetch and then let me just go SL API SL hello this be slash login do then response no stop going capital I don't want it to be capital okay and then dot then data okay uh response is not defined oh it's cuz I spell response wrong okay let's see this oops slash API that works now let's go 3,000 still not working eh log in okay so it does work when I do the fetch you know what that's fine because all I need to do is is work for fetch you can see it's it's console logging that so the fetch does work okay so it's it is actually working I was just an idiot before I thought it was going to show me something on screen uh but it didn't okay so we're good now now we can actually start setting something up so let's make a new let's actually make a folder let's call this components uh let's throw app into here let's throw our CSS in a new folder although I won't really do much CSS here move move now how impressive would it be if it automatically changed oh it did wow go vs code okay app.js I think it's good CSS nice okay let's make a new component uh actually I guess we could do a folder for like off and then do one in here new file this will be login. login.js okay new file this will be sign upjs and and then do we need a sign out page no we just will send a request when we want to sign out okay we got a $5 super chat here thanks for teaching me the basics of selenium great lesson no problem appreciate it uh okay let's make sure everything else is is working here what are you doing what theme is that stop spam using jangle or flask I'm using flask add an array after the curly braces ah smart someone actually reminded me that I had to do that in in use effect otherwise it's just going to like spam okay nice um response Tim is it okay if I come back later of course come back later see I'm just reading up in chat realizing I I should have read it more because you guys are uh actually very helpful how are you Tim I'm doing well um hoping actually get some good progress now what music this is my friend's music he makes like um like kind of ambient like beats and stuff anyways you can check out his SoundCloud it's linked in the description uh he's what's done the music for like all of my live streams okay nice all right so we have that now I guess we could build a login page uh I want to make sure that material UI is working too so apps there let's close some of this stuff database is created model nice nice nice okay so we'll make a login page and then once we have that we can test our kind of off end points uh once we actually write them let me just copy all this and go here and we can delete that and delete that and we'll leave that in for now and we want to design a form so we need from Material UI import and this will be grid from Material UI SLC core let's see if we can steal one from the internet material UI login just save us the the time here um sign in oh this looks perfect can I just rip this can they where's the code uh source code there you go oh beautiful sign in JS okay we're going to we're going to take all this and we'll we'll modify it a bit but that's great we don't need to spend time uh doing this if we don't need to okay so function copyright is this do I need to insert this copyright from them if I'm just ripping it who knows use Styles um I'm going to get rid of all the Styles too actually I think the style is probably fine okay sign in this is going to be I'm going to change this to be login oh my God they got a lot going on here okay export default login form control label text field oh my God they ever put so much stuff here classes. Avatar okay app.js and if they go to that that's the homepage otherwise go to slash login did it import that for me no I going to import that question is I should probably keep this consistent and do it like that and log in log in in yeah no that's that's wrong okay nice see no such fileer directory uh Source index. CSS where is the problem for that oh it's probably here go to index.html uh was I no maybe that's not it actually although I do need to change this I'm going to say um how fast are you at coding oh what the heck exclamation point okay react app we're going to say code eraser nice I don't know what file this I'm getting this error from Source index.css yeah cuz I put it in the CSS folder something's inputting it at that's where it is CSS index.css and then app same thing here here and go CSS slash can't resolve login it's cuz I need the component before it probably yeah that would be why okay components slash login canot resolve components I spell components wrong components I think that's right uh is the name oh login doj really why is that not working is it cuz do oh it's cuz it's an off that's why export default login is it already exported yeah that would be why okay let's do it down there compile please failed to compile CSS what is this app I think this is dot dot SL cannot resolve material UI core SL Avatar uh uh okay let's just look that up ah it's cuz I need the icons that makes sense okay all right let's see what people are saying here um login not login Tim login login login yeah okay maybe you should use question mark and exclamation point it's funny CU you guys catch all these errors as I'm typing out this is fun okay we're making progress though once we get like you know the core like the login and everything then there's like we can do a lot more um is flask for back end yeah the flask is for back end yeah I don't need these right now uh but I will actually I will need them because I'm going to make a like banner and stuff right on the page also can this finish hurry up okay ah sorry for wasting your time whoever's spamming in the chat apologize okay nice now let's go we don't need these anymore code racer is here fresh after we start the server okay it's not the URL I want to go to but that's fine oh it's still compiling okay can I find really you can't still you can't find it failed to compile canot resol okay you know what we'll just remove it I don't need it uh where is Avatar I just don't need the copyright that's going to be an error failed to compile uh okay live stream Mill UI core box is there why can it not resolve this stuff is this is this not I swear I installed material UI core I mean I can try it again but let's see here UI SLC core could swear I already installed that I feel like I fixed all the um yeah see this off login.js that's correct get rid of that okay now let's try this please everyone stop chatting no you guys can chat as much as you want it's my decision if I want to look at the uh the chat or not all right work yes homepage let's go nice never did I think I'd be so happy look at how nice this sign in page is beautiful um I totally didn't make any of it but that's great and the remember me box we're going to remove that because I'm not going to implement that into the code okay where is the remember me here it is get rid of that okay does this have any state in it no it doesn't have any state in it so I'll have to do that um I also I don't feel like I don't need any of this I'm going to remove these these Styles we'll style it my own although that's going to mess with it yeah okay you know what fine we'll leave them okay so now we need some state for all of the values here and then we need to actually send something when we press the button so let's do that let's go um I need to import use State and remove all the stuff that I don't need so let's get rid of that let's get rid of that okay import oh there already have it react import up here use State okay const uh what do we need here I guess we're going to say username is equal to or actually forget how to do this what is it const do you do username set username is equal to use State empty string okay and then const this be in Brackets password set password is equal to use State okay now let's input this in here name type ID value is equal to password and okay value is equal to username great let's try this now great and then we need to make it so it sets that so we say on change equals this be here set password and then what is this e okay I think that's what you do and let's do this onchange set user username okay let's see if that works okay nice okay password great uh and let's just change username to say email username email nice okay great all right let's see what chat's saying take a quick uh quick look here press control plus space after the name of modular component to import it oh that's kind of cool so the nightbot is working that's good haven't used nightbot before yeah I know it's already been an hour and I feel like I I've done nothing Tim the screen is blurry I'm looking at my preview right now screen doesn't look too blurry to me look look looks good um npm or MPX yeah could you store the input form an object set email oh I need to the password very good see look at you guys nice catch go rename set email nice okay so now we want a function for what happens when you press the submit button so we'll just say on submit uh is that going to be problematic maybe let's say submit pressed there you go and then we want to get the value of email and password and if those values are yeah cuz we want to tell them like hey you got to type in an email and password if it's not correct okay so let's inside of here for now let's just console.log the email and console. log the password okay why is this not working set press equals that there you go okay now where is the submit button okay I'm going to is it on pressed or is it on submit I think it's on pressed is equal to submit pressed uh submit press is not defined submit press not defined submit press not defin come on work uh submit press password is not defined what have I done wrong here uh we got another Super Chat here hello from Romania here's a coffee a small token of appreciation really appreciate that thank you very much thank you for the Super Chat I'll definitely I'll go make myself a coffee shortly uh just because of that on click ah thank you guys on click not unpressed unclick see if that does anything submit pressed is not defined why am I swear you just do it like this no is this is this not proper do I can I not just so can I not just make it like a function like is this why is this invalid expected a semicolon submit pressed here let me see what I did did in here async see like this worked why can I oh that's in a class that's why okay you typed submit there is an extra s submit pressed do I actually have to Define this with a const I actually have to say const no that that's definitely not that that's definitely not correct respected the semicolon I'm so confused why this isn't working add cons before cons submit button guys I I don't think the cons works I feel like the way that everyone does it is is like this no isn't that right const Funk name oh there you go okay now that should work right okay pass oh I did like five s's okay no contr F where's that ah there you go so it was working before without the const wasn't it compiled successfully oh thank God okay refresh nice login question mark email equals % okay just go Tim sign in inspect okay that's interesting I also don't want it to refresh the page Tim worked okay Tim and test perfect okay that is working um let's just go back here I want to make it so that it doesn't uh actually go anywhere when I do that forget password is fine sign in uh classes. submit unclick button why is it uh why is the submit button actually submitting is it cuz it's type submit ah that's why just make a type button okay and then link forgot password oh damn it am I going to need one of these probably okay let's just go password reset I'll build one of those I don't have an account slash sign up okay all right so I think that's that's good for the login page now let's go and build the sign up page I guess I can just copy all of this and do it for the sign up page um okay sign up and email okay so we'll do email password password name email username password name yeah okay that that sounds good to me let's do one more let's go username set username password this will be password one this will be password two set password one set password two nice uh I guess I don't really need anything else submit press email okay this would be username and then password one and password two okay now we need another one of these email password no username no auto complete my mouse is lagging okay username value username can you guys see my mouse lagging what the heck's going on here e. Target up value set username okay and then we need a confirmation for the password okay so we'll just make that password 2 set password 2 ID password 2 label password confirmation password two name password one password one and password one okay let's see what you guys are saying here it's submit pressed not submit pressed I think everything's working right now um have you ever used air flow no I've not used airf flow ID equal username did I not do that ah nice catch and this is why live stream code well 831 people I can't believe 830 of you want to watch me sit here and and write code but I appreciate it okay sub submit pressed and down here okay forgot password no we won't need that uh don't have an account or already have an account sign in actually we're going to do login okay and then this will go to slash login classes. submit okay I think that's good uh look at the line number 105 let's see 105 submit pressed yes I think that's good oh are you guys saying you guys are saying I uh I spelled it incorrectly ah okay boom got you yeah see stuff like that's actually really hard to see that could be an error that I could run into for like an ER uh for like an hour and not notice um because I typed it wrong twice okay let's go here submit nice there you go am I using Redux no this is I only have 12 hours so like a lot of this stuff is me uh genuinely just trying to like get something done like it's not going to look good this is not going to be professional code uh it's not going to be the best styled website you've ever seen in the world but it will work hopefully that's the goal import sign up from slof slash sign up JS okay let's do another one here loging not to find sign up not to find what do you mean login is not to finded oh that's why sign up. JS oh I didn't that would be why boom there we go got it okay email username password password confirmation sweet got to change that button so it doesn't say sign in uh what is it where is that does it did it really Define the text here button button ah sign up and then let's go to login and I don't know why I'm going from sign in to login but it's okay make it unique nice now if we go back here so what is this other thing it's like go live confirmation okay email username password password why do I do this okay already have an account log in brings me here forgot password let's make the password reset page new file password reset. JS okay let's see what everyone's saying here can I get unbanned in the twt Discord server depends what you did sign up with Google yeah I'm not going to do the Google um that's like really annoying to do uh any more people let's someone asked what my stack here is I'm doing uh react flask and like that's about it I'll be using like sockets and stuff Tim change it to link uh change it to link href 2 href is for a tags where's where is href where did I use hre that I shouldn't use href that you're saying should change this to be link you should stop reload by e. prevent default what um what do you mean reload like when I press log in it's not reloading I think it's fine no the reason it's reloading again is cuz I'm uh using the use effect thing I think and it's changing the state maybe no no it's not that that shouldn't happen Okay log in good password reset uh I guess we'll just Define this here um you can say function password reset okay and then let's just copy the login actually I should have just done this password reset okay I guess the only thing we really need here is actually email cuz it we'll send them an email that will then let them uh reset their password so can go here delete password say send email uh no we don't need that already have an account sign login okay then this will go to login nice send uh reset email then we want now this is going to say password reset we need a little thing here too typography body body a email enter your email to reset your password you will be sent a link to reset it nice okay password reset email send reset email export default password reset nice I think that's working this is good what else do we need now I remember in login I need to change this to say login and then in sign up need to change to say sign up sign up nice ah someone helped me said change H ref to two that is correct that's what I should be doing let me go to uh sign up and Link this is to thank you very much log in I believe oh my speakers turned off I have these uh like Amplified speakers and for some reason they just like automatically turn off um after like an hour even when music's being played through them which is really annoying okay let's go to nighta let's see which one of you has uh has chatted the most in here ready our our top chat can I show this page I don't know if I can show this page uh I'm going to put the name of the top chatter in our chat I'm not encouraging spam but I'm just uh just going to say who it is you are the top chat according to nightbot and the top use command is Discord I think I can show this page I think this is fine how many we have 5,000 messages 32 commands 25 timeouts let's refresh 5,9 messages damn okay all right so I think I fixed that to that looks good sign up page now we need a link on app here that goes to the signup page so let's go here exact path slash or password hyphen reset and we'll show that so once I press control space and that will import it if that works it'll be impressed control space okay that that wasn't working import password reset from do SLO slash password reset okay nice let's go here forgot password enter your email to reset your password you'll be sent a link to reset it oh I see what you guys are saying when I'm going it's refreshing when it it shouldn't refresh validate Dom nesting cannot appear as a child of div body body body oh oops I think I did something wrong here I did the uh yeah this is in the reset password this can't be body this needs to be p I think that will work now please change your music guys why don't you like the music what's wrong with the music I'll turn down a little bit e prevent default where do I put e. prevent default someone uh someone tell me where to put the eot prevent default and then I will put it there cuz I don't know where that's supposed to go I guys I like the music it's just lowkey I want something that's uh you know chill in the form oh is it cuz it's a form is it inside of a form ah no validate um class name in the okay do I but where like where though like do I do like uh e. prevent default is that when you press the button it's cuz well it's type button onclick in the use effect I think it's here right you guys saying to do this like take e and do that maybe at the beginning of the submit function I think that's correct but I also need to change this button so it doesn't I just type button okay that's good let's go here and then take e okay and then e e yes okay it seems like I've done it correctly let's see see but it's still it's still refreshing should it refresh though when I go to a different page shouldn't it do that warning failed prop type invalid prop variant of value body okay let's go here uh let's see thing is it's inside a form I don't want the form to submit um I don't know why it's submitting cuz I changed the button type so it's not even submit anymore maybe I need to refresh this also why is it going to API login so much oh it's cuz I have that damn where's the use effect thing I think that's why it's refreshing actually CU I have this use effect I don't need this right so it shouldn't be refreshing I don't know why it's refreshing don't have an account sign up and sign up's not working either need to fix that can't even press that don't have an account sign up that would be here why isn't this working why is and why did I need this is that a thing why do I need that in there variant body 2 Link to sign up you forgot the JS do I even need the JS where did I forget the JS password reset e. prevent default this should work why isn't not working link see I have two and then if I go here ah there you go see like this isn't for some reason this doesn't work failed property invalid variant of type P maybe that's why maybe it's cuz the typography thing's wrong let's change this to be body body 2 or something okay variant body to refresh why why is it not work it's a sign up you have a typo change href to and Link I've done that it's a correct link but it's not clicking see I can't click on it send reset email okay can I go to slome okay let's go to slash sign up okay when I press sign up it doesn't refresh okay that's good but when I go to a different page it refreshes I think that makes sense but this isn't working I swear the HF thing is correct um inspect element and check inspect a 2 equals log in see cuz I I think it needs an href because it worked with the href you guys are saying change it to two but I think it's h because is link imported see it's from Material UI core it's not from react router that's why okay we found the problem guys react router Dom there you go now they'll work if I change these all does not contain a default export what oh I gota do this okay let's go here come on there now it works boom and it doesn't refresh perfect okay fail prop type two in link but it's never defined what file is that uh I guess we can just do this two equals wait no that should work is it cuz I have the link wrong sign up react router Dom these should all work so it's on this page let's see no want move the console up how do I make this damn console bigger come on scroll up there you go okay refresh oh okay now it's working wait now this one's saying it's not working link and maybe have another link oh it's cuz I have two that I didn't change that's why okay so log in yeah that's why see this needs to be two there you go all right let's see what everyone's saying uh is there GitHub repo there is not currently GitHub repo for this project not right now um it's so funny the I figure out the issue but and then you guys I look in the chat and you've already told me what it is I could have just looked there although there is like a slight bit of latency okay let's test this okay boom golden okay now I want like a nice um like nav that shows like log in sign up all that and then I also want it to give like an error message if you try to submit without a password or without an email um I think I can do that if I remove the no validate thing I remember doing this at some point um having like a having something that would give you like a problem where's the form okay no validate let's see H okay let's see here material UI validate form no come on just just give me the not example just form form control I swear I did this in here go to create room okay why is it sh this all weird Okay container okay I think I did it manually with this like alert structure I'm going to copy this what is that imported from collapse tii core all right I should have put this in all these Pages before container CSS Baseline div paper want it to be in the div below this yeah okay now let's import collapse yeah Port collapse from at Material UI core all right that was the music app that was uh do you guys really not like the music that much I'll turn it down um in in case it's it's bugging you guys because you can always turn it on yourself but let's see give the form a required field I'm pretty sure that they all say required on them um see required but it doesn't I don't think it like the form is not validating them oh it's cuz I'm not using a material UI form that would be why probably yeah what is the form control thing material UI uh form control import form form control yeah that would be why uh actually I guess I could just put it in here okay put something in the chat if you'd like me to change the music or turn it off because we can always turn off too is the stream on 144p no the stream should be working fine change change change change I like I like off off off change change change music is good please change it change change okay we're going to turn it off for now if someone can find a um what is like copyright free music Source we'll use that uh you forgot yeah someone keeps telling me I forgot something it doesn't matter it's fine uh Loi if guys if you find a um copyright free music Source let me know because I just really don't trust any like music mus because I've used it previously in streams and I've got over 2500 copyright strikes on one of my videos uh like no joke literally thousands of copyright strikes um there's a channel for copyright free music uh I will uh I'll ask my Discord admins and staff don't open on the main monitor Discord okay good uh to send me um copyright free music if you guys send it to me on Discord I I'll use it actually can I do a poll I I can do a poll can't I can I run a pole through like nightbot or something isn't that possible I'm going to do a poll and just to see um for the music right regulars okay surely I can do a poll is that possible nightbot pull whatever music I do play needs to be uh no audio like I can't listen to uh what is it people playing so I'm just checking a few messages here take a break guys it's only been an hour and a half no breaks yet only break every four hours now I'm totally kidding um but I want to get like a good chunk of the UI done just so we have some some good progress because I'm only going to have 12 more hours or sorry 10 more hours soon okay that's working you can open class schol music I think I can I feel like I can do some from streamlabs when I do take a break which I'll do shortly um maybe in like half an hour or something 20 minutes probably at around 1 uh 1 p.m. EST then I will uh I'll look at it okay for now I'll just leave it off though because you guys didn't like it I really want to do a poll though I want to figure that out giveaways custom let's just look it up oh I think I can do one let's see I found the command p oh come on really it didn't work are you joking you guys just G to see my message in there it just doesn't work okay um this isn't why is this not working split by vertical bar oh I forgot the title I think I forgot maybe I think I forgot some syntax uh let's just see if this works no okay see that doesn't work either all right I don't think the poll is going to work uh surely there's a command default enabled docks maybe they changed see pole using straw pole oh I'll just send you guys um no because it's going to like okay let's see here all right ready guys I'm going to send something in the chat go vote all right everyone go vote on the poll okay we're g to here let me bring it up we'll we'll wait and see what we get here I'll give it uh till 1237 can I pin this can someone pin my thing is that possible the chat's L moving so fast I can't even press the damn dots on my uh my screen to pin this there you go pin okay should be pinned you guys should be able to see it okay we got a lot of yeses okay I'm I'm going to look for new music while you guys keep voting you have another like one or two minutes uh looks like a lot of people want the music changed uh okay okay looks like you guys want to change um let me know if you can hear this is this fine good bad what do you think Low Five music this is low five music okay all right seems like you guys like it okay okay okay solid is it too loud too quiet what what do you guys think let me know let's let's fix this right now before we go any further nice good NCS is it bad I don't even know what NCS stands for slow mode would be guys I know oh my God I'm so upset I really want the slow mode to work but I just don't know how to do it just doesn't work where where's Chat thing oh NTS is no copyright music yeah yeah I know this is no copyright uh you can do louder you guys think it should be louder it's hitting 28 DB so it should be a fine it should be fine okay right now it's at 28 DB so if you guys want it louder than that then then then put it at what you want um okay it's going to stay attive 28 I just try to get this figured out before we go any further um okay let's go I think you guys are saying it's fine I trust you all right let's let's continue um see now I've now I've lost my uh my train of thought I I removed the link um negative2 DB would be way too loud what was I doing I wanted to do a um napb bar because now I have the sign up the login the password reset although to be honest I don't even know if I'm going to implement a password reset if you lose your password you just you're going to be screwed uh okay so let's go material UI and then um material UI I I wanted to validate the form that's what I want to do good reminder okay so I imported the form control and then this uh we will mess with this in a minute it I don't want a success I just want an error here state. success severity on close Okay collapse there we go okay we will look at that in second is collapse and alert both imported okay this needs to be form control slash form control nice nice okay compiling let's see cannot resolve material UI core there you go no not at types just at okay compiling come on come on fail to compile alert is not exported where is alert from I'm going to have to find it here ah it's from Lab okay cannot import that cannot resolve what the heck this should work oh it's cuz I I probably need to install that yarn install at Material ui/ laap hydrate guys I'm drinking water I got you what id excuse me what IDE am I using I am using visual studio code okay I think this is going to work now form control provides context such as filled Focus error uh required for form inputs form okay slash login come on I wanted to highlight red when I oh maybe it's cuz I did it what page I did un sign up that would be why all right canot read property State oh yeah I forgot about that we'll just go for now collapse in false and this isn't going to work work just say okay now see it's not giving me the damn red outlines I want it to give me I don't want it to let me like press this button unless it's there uh maybe what can I do to fix this let's see form control h okay you know what that's a problem for later we don't really need to fix that right now uh I can make it flash an error message if we if we get an error message um and I'm going to do that actually okay where do I have the alert let's Implement a State here with an error message so let's say const error set error equals use State okay and here on state does not equal empty quotes Okay and then on close set error to that okay and then the alert this is going to be whatever the error message is what am why why am I typing State should be air okay okay so let's just make it and see if this works let's say set error is that in sign up this is an error message perfect okay that works I want it to be a little bit below the sign up but for now I can live with that error message and let's Implement that on the other one so collapse nice just going to go and log in we go underneath this this would be form control 2 let's copy these Imports and we need the state too okay state state and alert and alert password reset nice okay let's see what chat's saying here set required equals true in form control props let's try that I need to change this one too oops okay okay that's not working it's fine I don't I don't need the uh the thing to highlight red right now I think I can figure that out later that that's something that's like hopefully easy to do so we'll leave that for later when I'm like tired and uh and don't know what to do here okay where else did I put required equals true because I want to remove that I think I put it here okay so now we have login page sign up page we can navigate between them great what we want to do now is make it so you can actually sign in so this is where it gets a little bit tough I have this uh kind of blog post thing that I found that I think is going to help us do this and involves installing a few things let's just move this over to the side here and let's now try to write the back end so we can actually stop that we can stop that and we're going to add these to our requirements so let's go requirements and I already added that one want this one okay oops want to stop that okay so what I want to do is authenticate my front end with my back end so that the front end can send the information to the back end we can create like a user account and then uh we can like return information back to the front end saying yes this user was signed and no this user wasn't signed in and then once I have this authentication done stuff gets a lot easier the authentication is like the most pain in the ass to do to be honest um yeah so I'm going to just literally copy a lot of the stuff that's here get the O working and then once the O is working we're we're good we can start actually working on the sockets and then making it so two people get kept paired together and all of that fun stuff some people are asking what a typing racer clone is what I'm doing is making code racer so there's going to be a block of code and then there's going to be two people facing off against each other and whoever types the block of code first is going to win that's the idea and it's going to track your like WM and everything uh while you're typing and that's kind of the uh the goal and then ideally we'll have like scores right so we'll have like you know this person won this many races this person's average wpm is this we have like a leaderboard uh I can add like a ton of stuff to it so we just want to get the core functionality working first okay so I have all the requirements installed now let's see what this is okay man this guy just put a ton of code in one file okay so we need to Define that okay so let's close this API a nit okay we have these two variables my database is working I already have that set up okay nice and guard. AIT okay that's the thing I need I need guard and I need cores so let's import those okay flask I need guard and course and I gu actually let's just do this say from flask that import PR there you go okay and then from flas cores import CRS all cap is that I think that's going to work hopefully let's see so then I should be able to initialize it like this and stay nice and consistent uh why are you using flask instead of Jango because this is like a really simple back end I don't need a lot of stuff so I'd rather just use flask than mess around with d Jango which is actually just going to take longer to do uh python is for people who are scared of curly braces very very true hi Tim hope you're doing well yes I am doing well thank you for uh joining the live stream still have 667 of you here very impressive that this many of you are still watching going for about 2 hours now I am still alive but I have 10 hours left to go have not had any caffeine yet have not had anything to eat since uh breakfast we'll probably have lunch kind of soon what are you doing at the end of this ideally I'm going to host the site and then hopefully I could race against you guys but I don't um I don't know if we're going to get that far I I think we are like I'm optimistic that we'll be able to finish this uh but I just haven't been moving as fast as I was expecting to go just because there's a lot of stuff I don't know how to do yet so once I learn how to do all of these things then there'll be less that I need to learn how to do and so we can move it quicker let me move this over a bit okay so we need to define a generic user model just going to copy that and put that in my models okay it needs to import DB so from do import DB is that going to give me a circular import I don't think that will give me a circular import I think that'll be fine um and yes and then from Models import user okay nice guard. AIT app I need that too init.py okay db. AIT app uh and then course. AIT app okay and this can go above here okay nice and oh I need to define the user model before I do that that's fine say from Models import user here from Models import user H is that going to work I let's see here I actually don't think that's going to work I think I need to initialize the database before for so initialize database Define user Define all this stuff then initialize guard but I need to have the user defined first and the user's importing that H okay this is kind of annoying actually um I might just bite the bolt and not put this in a separate file and save us some time okay let's do this no we don't have to worry about that okay I think that'll be fine do import DB yeah I think that should be fine um let's see what everyone's saying here Tim you need a nightbot I have a nightbot I using flask yeah uh I'm building a code racer so two people have to uh type the same code as fast as possible right now we're just handling the authentication getting the users it's what you would do for like any website really uh and then we can actually start working on the UI for that ideally we're just going to start by throwing two people in a room together showing a block of code and then whoever types it first and then I'll add all of the uh other stuff related to that so like word words per minute and all that kind of crap okay so app. config yes I've configured the database already that's good db. anit app so I guess I init what is this I think I'm just trying to figure out the order to do this in I don't know if it matters the order in which I initialize all these things so guard happens first okay and then database and then CRS okay and then add an example user add some Roots okay log in and that's good we'll actually use a lot of these refresh token I will copy that okay nice so save that views let's say at views. root refresh an existing JWT by creating one let copy the old one example okay that's fine can leave that print refresh request old token e request. getet data guard. fres JWT so this needs access to guard I'm going to say from uh do import guard is that what it's called guard DB cores okay actually going to delete everything in here and then nit this no longer needs to yep that's good use. root okay let's see what they're doing here for this take that is that log in yeah okay request equals FL reest est. getjson we can just say request. getjson because we already have request imported username password okay user equals guard. authenticate username guard access token sweet that looks pretty good to me if that works nice okay refresh and then we would do need to sign up but I'll write that one myself okay and then protected okay we'll look at that after all right so let's actually do this and create this sample user in a net okay with app. context db. create all db. session. query let's make mine okay so say Tim password Tim is great rolls admin username Tim okay user is Def find nice what's chat saying here I do know how to solve a Rubik's Cube actually maybe I'll do that on stream maybe during a break I'll try to solve one I haven't solved it in like a long time but I do have a Speed Cube um I'm not that good at it but maybe I will do that that that would be fun that would be like a noninterruptive thing um I hope you guys play this game all day once it works there is an API to find code Snippets it picks them up from GitHub Tim what's your stack I'm using react and flask those are kind of the two main Frameworks right now hey Tim will there be a bot tracer on code racer what if I use selenium and Pi Auto goey to speed type it sh don't don't tell anyone that okay just guys don't don't try to hack my website you will probably be able to okay uh let's actually delete this database and let's go um yarn API let's see how many errors we get no errors it's impressive I I am surprised I'm very surprised okay so now I want to actually use this let's should I curl something to the login or should I just try to hook it up we'll try to hook it up okay let's go components off log in and we'll send a fetch to that now submit pressed okay so prevent default yes and then we say fetch and sorry that's not the way it is it's going to be Fetch and then and it's going to be API SL API slash login and then we need to make this I guess actually is this a post request request. getjson yeah I guess we would post to the log in is this accepting what what type is this yeah the login is a post okay so let's just make this just a post okay and let post two and so now I got to go copy my my things here to send the fetch request okay let's go to log in did my music stop what's going on here oh my speakers turned off again that's why are you going to keep it up with ads and stuff no probably not like I'll leave it up if I get this hosted I'll I'll leave the site up but I'm not going to put ads on or anything this is I'm not doing this to make money I'm just doing this cuz fun um okay let's do that application Json body json.stringify and then we'll stringify email email password password nice okay and then I do need to send the token as well with this um oh no this will return a token to me when I send this okay so that should work let's try this request options do then and I'll explain what I'm doing in just a second guys once this is somewhat working request options should be response response. Json okay and then do then and this will be data and and we'll just console.log data okay so what I'm doing now is I'm trying to set up authentication between my front end and my back end so what's going to happen is the front end is going to send a request that contains the username and password to the back end the back end is going to authenticate that data and then it's going to send what's known as a JWT token to the front end that token is going to be kind of like hey I'm signed in I have permission to use all these other endpoints so anytime another request is sent to the back end that JWT token needs to be a part of that request and so that's how the back end knows that the front end is authenticated is by using this JWT token um and so that's kind of what I'm trying to set up right now is uh there's this thing called my mouse is lagging like crazy Jesus if you uh look at these two libraries right here those are what's kind of doing that for you so you could make your own JWT token authentication system but it's really a pain so I'm just importing these two libraries and kind of just copying some code that sets it up for me okay um let's see here I'm going to take a break in one second I just want to test if this is working so that going and yarn start yeah I don't know why my mouse is lagging so much maybe it's because it's wireless mouse not sure only 10 more hours yep only 10 more hours guys let's see what people are saying here I'm still surprised by how many of you guys want to uh to watch this chat also I'm not ignoring anyone I see some of you guys like mad I'm not responding to you it's just genuinely the chat's moving so fast I uh I never like I just don't see a lot of the messages okay so let's try this respect to that okay so that did happen to API login but then there was an error the server responded with the status of 401 unauthorized we got an object authorization this username and our password are incorrect okay that's good that's a very good sign that that that's working actually well not working but working well enough okay let's go to nitop P oh see this is a problem is this problem what did I make it username Tim password Tim is great didn't I make Tim is great log in that should have that should have worked though filter by username Tim Okay db. session. add should have a user with name Tim with app. context okay may I I bet I did this in the wrong order that's probably why okay so after everything is set up and initialized that's when this happens so I guess I have to do this once the app is is running no that wouldn't be the case now I got to remember how to query the Dame the damn uh D Jango database you forked material UI by mistake oh I didn't mean to do that what is this project supposed to be it's a code racer uh we're going to build an application allows users to uh race typing out a block of code and users I don't know why that didn't work maybe the user is there H okay we're going to say SQL that's not what I want um how can I select okay SQL query user. query. filter by that's what I'm looking for okay so let's print uh from dot import user print user. query. filterby and this is going to be username equals tim. first our username equals username okay let's see if that works now none okay so there is no user with username of um Tim I guess unless it's giving me the wrong username let's print the username maybe that's why maybe the username is none log in ah that would be why so I guess did I'm not oh it's I probably passing it incorrectly here let's see ah it's I'm passing email not username that would be why stupid I should check that okay so that now that's working so that actually says gives us our access token now sweet okay so the auth is working now we just got to create an account okay I'm going to go to the washroom and grab like a coffee I think and I will be right back ready you get to see a cool transition screen here boom be right back for all right I'm back you guys need a react tutorial guess what I'm working working on a react tutorial right now actually like it's like in progress and I don't have a series on react but I have a series where I like go through an entire project that uses react so like I don't know I'm a bit confused is react like a library that you could import already made elements from uh react is like a frontend framework it's kind of hard to describe like quick if you've never seen it before but uh I don't think you're importing like prebuilt stuff necessarily it just like a way of writing a front end uh did you get a fulltime job offer from Microsoft I don't know if I can disclose that or not they offer me to come back as an intern again but I am not returning to Microsoft at least not right now Rubik's Cube video maybe I'll have to do that I have to set up like a I don't have a scene on um on OBS to like show my working surface but I just made of coffee I have my nice uh reheatable mug I'm not sure if you guys have ever seen those before but this mug will like keep my coffee warm it has like a battery in it it's actually pretty cool 10minute code I'm sorry for ignoring you Rubik's Cube stream um where am I going to host I'm not sure yet probably Len node uh react makes it easy to make Elements which you can easily import to other files correct yep you're looking so cute man I appreciate it thank you very much you should make a website for courses you've uploaded on YouTube yeah that wouldn't be a bad idea actually why are you using react cuz react is like the only front end framework I know I suck at front end development guys I'm like really not good at it um that so I've just picked the stuff that I know how to use okay so refresh that's good login works that gives the authentication token so let's try that protected route I'm really surprised this is working usually this takes way longer okay let's try this okay that do off required so I need to import that here too okay let's import this actually let's import both of these so this would be Oh no I got to import the thing okay flask I don't think anyone's good at front end yeah that's probably true my face looks bloated maybe it's the camera zoom can make it even more if you want are you using python as an API yes correct I am doing that are you familiar with python decorators yes I have built python decorators um 10minute code you got to stop spamming that otherwise I'm just going to ban you uh because you just keep spamming in the chat H our viewership has dropped I guess I was not exciting enough for everyone that's all right let's see here what was our our Peak viewers at is it going to show me 957 wow it's a lot all right 32,000 people have played back this stream it always blows my mind when I do this stuff live how many people are actually watching this ASMR yeah do you guys like that this is a this is a coffee I'm drinking the delay on the stream is not actually bad um I'm looking at my preview and let's see it's maybe about 10 seconds so not horrible I could make it better but then the uh the quality would be worse of the stream and I think this quality is good from what you guys are saying on your last stream your Peak viewers was like 300 yeah exactly my last stream the peak viewers was like 300 and I think my average views was maybe like 100 right now it looks like we're averaging like 600 so like it I obviously it doesn't really matter to me to be honest it's just cool to talk to any amount of people but neat how many people are watching the stream okay so protected endpoint and then I have the login we will do the sign up after access token R nice okay so let's try to hit a protected endpoint if this works with that token so let's make some State here and let's say const off actually I guess we'll do JWT token set token or we could just make it token I guess that's fine equals use State okay and then here we will say need the curly braces okay so if data or if where is the return here oh it's going to crash what was what's the return type that's access token okay if access token in data then set token data at accessor token okay and and then what we'll do after that is we will internal server error what okay that's weird we will send to that protect end points we'll say fetch I always forget that that's not how the fetch Works SL API SL protected do then response and this will be response. Json do then data data and we'll console log okay so let's just walk through what I've done here for a second just in case anyone's a little bit confused we've created the backend API we now have it so that we can log in I created a sample user username Tim password Tim is great and when you send that data here it will authenticate that user if the user in the database password and username is correct it will return an access token for you then that access token is what you need to use to be able to actually access uh all of these different endpoints that are protected and a protected endpoint is one in which uh has this at flask uh whatever you say for this off required and so you need to send a token in the form of uh the bearer so authorization Bearer and then your token and when you send that then it will allow you to access these end points so all the end points relating to like joining a room or like updating score or anything like that uh will be related or will be protected by by the authentication and it's like your settings and stuff you want to change your username uh which I think I'll allow people to do okay so I need to go to login API protected but then in here this needs to have new request options so I'm going to say const options equals then this will be just copy all that content type application Json and then Au rization Bearer and then this will be plus token that should work no plus token oh that's cuz it's like this okay there you go bear is that what it looks like I think so yeah bear your token okay cuz that's a header nice and then for the body doesn't need any body so that's fine and then this will be options fetch what's my issue const options that was a problem okay could not proxy request oh that's fine could not proxy could not proxy see expect it does not equal equal where's that login.js expected not equal to that's fine error could not proxy request Babel parser index that's fine fresh okay nice Tim Tim is great oh my API failed what name app is not defined oh I'm an idiot okay this needs to be at views nice okay yarn API the stream has been going for 2 hours and 25 minutes so far I'm not sure if it Autos saves on YouTube right now like I don't know if you can rewind um but yeah let's see what other people are saying log in uncaught promise uh API protected attaching 405 okay uncut promise again H so we be in here okay let's see this that would be why why is it removing my quotation marks on authorization why is it doing that should it not is this not the way it should be no can I how do I save without formatting there you go okay let's try that unexpected token okay let's just look at the response then maybe I didn't oh I didn't jsonify it maybe that's the reason let's see cuz previously the turn H I don't know why this isn't okay let me just print how do I look at the headers of a request um look at headers request. headers all right print request. headers could at least print the headers to restart this maybe hm 405 why is it not printing this though I don't know why it's not printing that authorization maybe I'm just spelling authorization wrong how possible is that let's see no it looks like I was doing it right plus token maybe the token is uh is not working no the token should be working H let's see here unexpected token okay 405 method not that would be why method not allowed I'm sending a post it needs to be a g if only I read the error messages what the heck log in connection closed okay let's just restart this is this not refresh okay Tim Tim is great 401 unauthorized okay so at least it's not uh crashing now it's just giving us unauthorized guess the token is wrong quest. headers so now it's not printing the request. headers I guess there was no headers to print H login API protected options response. Json 401 unauthorized bear token authorization bear I don't maybe I don't need that maybe that's what's causing the problem there you go that looks like that worked yeah that did work okay that actually just worked somehow uh let's go in here and let's return the response now then data me close this oh that's better okay let's run now boom protected endpoint allowed user Tim let's go can we get some claps in the chat we uh we have now done the authentication other than creating an account but that's great we now have uh the user like set up and working only thing is I need to make it now so that just need to clean up a little bit of stuff here cuz obviously this is kind of a mess we need to clean this up uh the protected Endo we don't want to fetch like this thank you guys I'm looking in the chat now everyone's clapping appreciate it appreciate it thank you very much thank you very much I know okay let's actually I should probably just save this because like we're going to use that later okay now get rid of that and if data then why is this why am I getting this okay good um question should I make Yes actually I know the answer to this question I'm going to make a separate folder or separate file that just has uh like utils so .js and inside of here I'm going to Define some functions function we'll say send login credentials okay uh or actually um we'll say send authorized request and then this will take an endpoint take query actually it take pram string and then it will take a body okay so we'll say headers say body colon body is it body or is it data I don't remember and then endpoint method okay so this will be method and then okay I'm going to have to figure I'm going to have to remember this now okay end point then it will return this thoughts on the GPU Market good question it's actually insane and it's not going to get any better anytime soon um unfortunately I wish I could give you some see this isn't going to work now because I need to send so much stuff to here I think it's probably better to just yeah this isn't going to this isn't going to be helpful I'm going to delete this I don't need this um let's answer a few questions here do you ever work on electron not really um Rubik's time to solve it uh also a Rubes Cube shortly or I will try to solve Rubes Cube shortly I got I have a webcam I think I can use to uh to like show you my hands as I try to solve it okay for now though I'm um I'm happy that this somewhat working I want to be able to create an account though and then log in and I want it to redirect on login on successful login so if access token in data okay response. Json we got to make sure the response is okay first we're going to say if it should be like that say if uh response. okay then we will return the response. Json so return response. Json else we will uh set an error so set error of response do is response. error actually going to give me the error message I guess we'll see if that if that works um okay so this log in and then otherwise if access token and data set token else set error no access token received from server okay you have to sleep in 10 minutes please solve it I'll solve it soon don't worry before you go to bed I will uh I will I will solve the Rue for you will you be joining Microsoft in the future potentially haven't uh haven't really thought about it too much right now to be honest with you okay so on successful then we need to take props here what I want to do is redirect say forget how you successfully redirect props do history. push slash okay let's do that you're going to go to the homepage here um I spell received wrong oops yeah only only 10 and uh 10 and a half hours left guys almost done canot re property push of undefine props do history what is it it's not profit history I got to open up a uh another window here yeah I hope you guys are appreciating the uh the ASMR here this mic is great for it okay website so I'm looking at something else right now I just got to figure something out I can't show you this uh repository unfortunately it's a private repo Source app no it wouldn't be in that I'm trying to figure out how to redirect I remember that it's yeah what why is that why is that not working oh I remember why I got to do this like complicated thing here okay guys don't like the music again you guys oh you guys just complain about the music all the time I'm not even really listening to it there you go I may put a new song on see if you like that one better okay root I think I remember why this I have to say render equals and then put this here I think that will do that okay and then because this will push through props I think or no is that what it is I forget essentially there's this prop that will get past um called history but I forget how to pass the history prop um I'm going to look here there's a way to do it but I just don't remember let's see app.js Ah that's what it is okay and yes I am going to upload a recording of this whole thing after definitely okay I'm going to say component equals and then sign up ah perfect there you go then component equals password reset and then we can end that and then we can end that and then component equals login all right and yes nice did be a little Auto completion for me there okay now if I go to login and I go props history but push slash that should actually work um access token is undefined set data if access token what how is how are you going to tell me it's undefined when I've just checked if it's in it canot use in search for Access token in undefined in data oh I didn't idiot okay return return okay let's just do this return so response is not okay I think I just need to refresh this canot read property push of undefined why is that undefined shouldn't be undefined component login it should allow me to have that uh what is this maybe it's something else I'm missing here components yeah what the heck Define history use history do I have to do that use with router does the redirect just redirect cuz I want to like from code redirect you forgot something on log in now that should be fine that should be fine it should be pushing through a prop maybe it's CU I need to save this oh it's cuz I didn't go to the homepage first that's probably why wait let's go here okay let's go slash no no slash login history why is history wrong this should be this should be passing through a history prop history is a hook you get propped by doing history equals use history okay let me try this then uh okay where's the hook from is use history from react okay let's say like like that is that what you're saying use histories from react router uh react hooks must be called the react function hm like is it like use history I don't react router is where history is from this is fake he's not even Googling stuff A lot of times I prefer to not Google stuff immediately and try to figure it out myself let's see here history propped reactor router no I've done this before I don't know why it's not working though use router history create history history history. push like let me show you uh actually I can't show you I want to show you the code but I can't show it to you unfortunately um history history history I had it passed through as a prop but I don't why is this not working opponents import use history let history equals use history okay let's let's try I'm going to go with this up here move this do I already have a react rodom here yeah I do okay okay and then he's saying cons his let history equally use history okay okay and then here access token and data say history no way this works Tim is great wow okay thank you whoever who said that who told me that I want to appreciate you ant ant win ant winus ant winus P thank you thank you okay yeah I could print props too that would work but I guess like nothing's being passed through for props and I'm not wait I'm not using token yeah I am I'm using token right oh no I'm not using token okay um I want to now pass this authorization token so now here's the problem I need to store this off token now I could store this in uh like react props in fact I actually will do it in props but I I feel like it's better to put it in like local storage and then I can pull it out from anywhere so I got to figure out how to do that and how to create an account I think we'll handle create account first although I want to do the Rubik's Cube uh let me see if I can find the Rubik's Cube first um okay where would I put my Rubik Cube let me look not quite sure where it is all right got it okay I'm going to try to set up a yeah the theme is uh man or mon or whatever it is um I'm going to try to get my uh other thing here one sec Go video capture device add new source and this should be this okay done okay turn that down there okay can you guys see this I think so I'll make it bigger but let me just here me do that that should be better right good you guys see okay great uh let's move this over bit okay so let's just scramble her up a bit oh this this camera is so bad compared to the other one okay all right I haven't solved Rubik's Cube in genuinely like months so let's uh let's see if we can do it okay let me just make let's make sure everyone can see this everything everything's good okay um all right so I need to I remember I need to solve the cross I'm not going to be doing this very fast by the way uh so you you guys can see there I'm going to try to solve the Red Cross first and I probably shouldn't like walk you guys through this because it's going to take a really long time okay so there we go Blue corner and yellow Corner let to go H go that's red that's blue and where's my last one that's green okay we now have a cross a Red Cross and we will continue from here now I need to do the corners um okay so remember it's like that okay and where's the other one okay we now have one side done we can see our little T's here first layer complete I'm doing it the slow Noob way okay now this is where I kind of forget what to do I have to align the edges so you see these edges here uh let me see if I can show this okay this is the top and then see how like there's a blue edge here and there's a yellow edge here I need to get these edges correct okay okay so let's see if I can remember how to do this I feel like you have to hold it upside down for this part or maybe no maybe you don't there was there was a way to do this okay let's see if any edges are aligned properly now are you going to tell me all of them are not aligned properly okay how do I align the edge properly okay let's see if that did anything nice nice nice okay I did um H I genuinely forget how to do the edges does anyone know how to do the edges second layer second layer cube with Tim upside down I do hold it upside down yeah because these things need to go in but I forget how to put them in it's like do I line them up here I remember lining them up here and doing something with them uh okay let's try this oh boom got one there we go okay uh I know you guys can't really see much but I think I'm figuring it out now uh where's another Edge green okay there we go now I got it muscle memory is coming back boom and yellow no blue no that's not the right one green there you go nice okay and last egg looking for something doesn't have orange on it okay that one's inverted nice okay we're almost done the second layer just need one more Edge which is right here then it's time for the algorithms which I totally don't remember okay let's see boom just this left okay let's see what you guys are saying Tim you on Tik Tok no I'm not on Tik Tok I refuse to use Tik Tok Tik Tok is just even though it's like probably beneficial in terms of like you know my brand or whatever I just I hate Tik Tok I don't want to use Tik Tok oh my god I've remembered the algorithm I uh we're we're we're going to do well here I think if I continue to remember the algorithm okay nice okay so now I've created a cross on the bottom you can see most is done cross on the bottom now I need to do the next the next steps here um okay let's go here now I need to align my cross nice okay so now you can see that all of these see this and this they're all they're all lined so all that's left now is the corners the four corners now I could cheat and just just pull the cube and and turn them but uh I might do that under the desk who knows okay um now I have to remember how to do the corners um this is where I like always mess this up just remember I got this far guys okay remember that I made it to this point so that uh you know I I I I did well okay let's see here I'm not I'm not going to cheat I'm just saying I know it's like right left up left whatever but I have to like align the corners first uh left up right up left up right down okay um nice almost there okay so now all of the corners have the correct colors on them so they're all like yeah yeah all of them have the correct sides but they are not in the correct orientation so now I have to do the the crazy one the one that I always mess up um does someone know what what the last final algorithm is to do to place the corners the right way it's like RR something um R okay RP Prime D Prime R Prime D um cuz I actually completely forget this I want to I want to practice it on a cube that's not partly solved um it's like R let's see oh see I've I've messed it up I've messed it up oh no okay uh going to have to just insert the correct edge here and then I think I will be okay damn it we were we were so close oh no we're back we're back at the beginning now guys okay um oh no okay we're we're going to have to yeah we're going to have to to go from the beginning cuz I well not from the very beginning but from close enough to the beginning that it's going to be annoying CU I've I've messed it up okay um no that one's no good this one is though okay okay and okay see I'm going a bit faster now cuz now I know these ones okay um we did we did pretty well I've got all of them except three corners now um so you can see that's all good I genuinely don't know the last algorithm that's going to be I'm going to keep doing this so many times um will Kobe post on GitHub yeah yeah after I'll put everything on GitHub the auto correct what what's wrong with the auto correct IO it's this one R Prime D Prime RP Prime R RP Prime D Prime r d hm actually ready I'm I'm going to bring a a guest on stream that that's going to solve it for me okay ready yeah I'll be back in one sec I'm going to leave the screen open okay I've got a guest on the stream here this is my brother he'll introduce himself hey guys how's it going I'm Noah Tim's brother I hear you need some help solving the cube this the camera by the way that's the one that's doing like okay okay jeez they can see it right yeah yeah they can see it okay and there you go Tada there you go guys how how'd you like that where's the Cat fresa come here yeah no problem yeah no yeah people I uh mistake us as like twins we're actually not twins okay let me turn this off there you go my my cat may be coming in the room we'll see though the cat is smarter than Tim yeah probably is she here oh you have food come here she's she can't jump that high come here come here come here can you guys see the cat let's see uh let me turn on the other the other camera there you go sorry it's looking down no I know it's it's on purpose there you go that that's Fresco for you is your brother El a pro in coding no he knows how to code but he's not a pro there you are fresa I gave her uh some food that's why she came yeah I get hair over my desk all the time it's it's okay I'm used to it Nowa what are you doing there you go she's gone now she just wanted the food or is she going to hang out on my desk we'll see you guys will see her tail flying around in the background who's the older brother I'm the older brother uh okay that we get back to Cody now that was a good break that was that was entertaining I feel like let fresa do some ASMR I guess you guys didn't hear her um what do you call it uh like purring or whatever I literally see a brother come in sit down pick up the Cube and then I look down and get some chicken and look back and he's done yeah my brother is like a speed cuber he used to do competitions um he's like really good at at Rubik Cube it's like super impressive he did like the Triangular ones the like hexagonal ones the like 5x5 6x6 I don't know what his record time is I think it was like 15 seconds for the 3X3 maybe even shorter um but yeah she is smart she knows what she want yeah exactly frus is smart all right okay hopefully hopefully you guys enjoyed that that entertainment there I'll definitely I'll try to time stamp that on the recording of the stream oh excuse me okay what was I doing um it's making it redirect back home okay so let's go slash login nice it takes a long time to load you know what that's fine um see what everyone else is saying when do you expect to finish coding at 1100 p.m. EST tonight collab with Ben Awad yeah I would be down to do that go go spam Ben and tell him to do a collab with me this mug is called Ember it's a reheatable coffee mug it's really cool I don't know actually I it was given to me as a gift I actually don't know um where to go yeah same thing with kale if you guys want me to collab with these guys just uh like spam them and tell them to to email me or something I mean I could email them too I guess but uh you should create a GitHub repo and use read me stats I don't know what that is history error doesn't look like I'm getting a history error um have you seen Ben's newest project projects I've seen a few of the thing I've just like I don't watch his videos but I've seen the like headlines of them they're doing really well he has uh what something to do with like Dogecoin or something or Doge Doge house or something like that um damn okay I want to keep answering chat but I also need to do um some coding here presco you here you guys can't see her but she's on the ground oh look catch is coming back up on the desk special treat ground equals best bed yeah for cats pretty much oh and here she is she's definitely going to obstruct my uh what do you call it we can turn on the cat cam I'll make it small if I uh unlock get your tail out of my face okay we'll put it there for when she comes okay boom all right um I keep forgetting what I'm going to do this is the problem with streaming right it's cuz like you get distracted so easily and then like all of your train of thought like you can't get into the flow state right um okay so let's make it so we can sign it so I want to go to My Views and to sign up and here I want to do very similar thing to this so sign up can actually call sign in to get the token or we could just create the token hey there you go you guys can see her now um okay so distracted sign up username password that's good uh we want email as well email equals uh request.get email none comma none and then I want password one password 2al request.get password 2 and none okay and what else do we want here authenticate user password we can't do that right now we can't do that right now need to check if this account exists so if H we'll say filter by usern no filter by email uh user uncore email exist okay and then we'll do actually just do this filter by and then username oh this should be email equals email and username equals username do exist okay and then oops and then we will say if email underscore exists then we're going to return a response here and this will say what is this response access to this will say error emails already in use okay and then Response Code what's the response to that 400 bad request yeah we do 400 that's fine watch hey watch okay if username exists say username is taken please try another and 400 okay and then we'll check the passwords we'll say if password one does not equal password 2 then what we want to do is return error and we'll say passwords do not match this needs to be a colon sponse code I know 400 is probably the wrong one but we with now we'll go for that um let's see what you guys are saying here keyboard sounds awesome appreciate that uh exists spelling wrong username is taken email is already in use uh exists I think I'm sing exists correctly oh looks like the cat is gone she has left us I'll turn off the cat cam or she's going to hang out on the stool we'll see okay uh email exists username exists password so if the passwords are correct the email doesn't exist and uh the username doesn't exist then we're good we can actually create the account so I'm going to say user equals user and then we need to modify the user model actually uh so we have username password we need email as well say email equals db. colum db. text un equals true yep so username email password ID is active Okay and we'll say user username equals username email equals email password equals password one okay and then how do I actually add this to the database oh I'm like slightly allergic to the cat I think every time she comes by I get like a little itchy whenever I'm patting her and then I touch my face or my eyes or whatever it's okay it's worth it I'll survive uh how do we do this here db. create all with app.app context do I need the app context maybe CU then I need to import app from I won't be able to use app context I think I can do it just like this I don't think I need the app context I I don't usually use the app context okay let's go here db. create db. session no I don't need that ah I do need this though okay crap db. session. add and then this will be user db. session. commit nice and then user equals guard. authenticate username password think that should be good and then we can do that okay nice and then this will be 2011 because we created a new account now let's see though cuz they're going to get an issue here if I go to views log in see this need to say email email and then this would be email ah damn it I'm going to have to change the authentication field to be email rather than user H say email okay in it will that work yeah no see this okay this is what I do change this to email there you go and then AIT app user app user views app filter by not username email email Tim atgmailcom Tim is great okay nice okay I am just going to run to the washroom quickly I will be back in uh in one second all right I'm back I know you guys are calling me out for taking breaks but like what I meant by no breaks was that the stream wasn't going to end a little bit of a a marketing play there um okay let's see what's everyone saying in chat still 500 people watching we're 3 hours in it's impressive if you guys are still watching I'm very impressed okay what was I doing I was setting up the creation okay so I need to delete this cuz now I want to do it based on email not based on uh on uh username okay email password email password user okay user okay I think that should be good okay save that you guys saying I typed something wrong someone said I typed something wrong what did I type wrong oh exists there you go got it what what's wrong oh I didn't Ah that's why I didn't give it a value okay I go H TV let's @gmail.com email username password why is that not working that should work unique constraint failed oh it's cuz it's already in there uh let me delete this let me delete all that let's rerun that don't crash good got got it okay refresh Tim gmail.com and Tim is great no access to access token received from server what crashed there name email is not found uh okay oh I think I know what the problem is it's be here see that's why it's be email okay let's try this now okay 401 unauthorized um it's a different reason oh I think that's why uh email trust now trust now unauthorized could not proxy request API login oh it's cuz it was down okay views email password email ah I bet I'm not sending email I'm bet I sending it as username yeah that's why email there you go all right fingers crossed boom got it working okay sweet now let's see if we can create an account um I am using material UI yeah the PC build on my website is very outdated yeah I I should change it how do you have that colors on the lines my theme is uh man or whatever if you go here Go theme um see this is the theme okay so set error that's good nice okay so let's let's actually try this uh let's try to get an error so if we go tim1 gmail.com no access token received from server uh find Dom mode that's fine okay I don't I want what actually is returned though from data so let's go to log in and sign up log in where are we calling this ex token else okay if error in data then set error data error else this okay l in come on Save log in what is what is going to be in data I want to print data okay console.log data okay just nothing just gives me nothing okay let's do this and say R 200 login H access token access token won't be in there okay I'm going say if R I guess when it authenticates it sends H okay no access token received from server rather than that let's just say invalid login and then if there is an error we'll display the error but I don't think we'll get that invalid login okay that's fine invalid login please try again okay let's work on the signup page now that's kind of all that's like working enough it's working well enough for me let's go to sign up okay default request email username username password one password one come on password 2 password two application Json API sign up sponsor error okay uh and data if access token in data set token access okay good history to push hump nice okay otherwise cons data if eron data set ER oh I think this is L the exact same thing I think this is I think this is all I need for the uh create account uh oh I need the the use history hook okay let's go here oh and token H okay we're going to figure out where to store the token after this and then use histories from react router okay nice okay sign up inval login internal server error oh okay I thought exists gave me the variable name has an error in it email exists store tokens and cookies in local storage anyone can change yeah I know but um sort an httv only cookie so you won't have to mess with it in JavaScript okay that's a good idea actually um I'm not like super concerned about the security of this application because I'm not like a security expert I just want it to work and then I can like deal with security after okay so that was on the back end we're getting an error there and we still get that invalid login um so that's cuzz I guess no error was returned yeah okay that's fine so let me just change this go quickly uh an error urage okay well we'll just do that okay log in now View find if user let's see this db. session. query I could have warn there was really that works use that create a filter okay let's just try this Boolean of this Clause is not defined what why should be defined top answer is saying this works is not none okay let's just try that oh okay that's good um email yeah that's very good okay good it's working now okay sign up bad request uh an error curb please try again H what was the issue here user command email password add user email password cuz I didn't add rolles maybe let's see here go to init okay let's see if this actually created one and try to sign into it inval login internal server error hash what's it say here hash could not be identified what the heck is going on oh jeez okay um oh do I need to store like let's see this that's why I didn't hash the password that makes sense okay I got it now so let's Go pass word okay let's run this okay I'm going to have to clear this database delete what's everyone saying stream has been live for three and a half hours only about eight and a half hours left to go so funny when I say that because it's already felt like a long time to be honest with you unauthorized okay that's fine um inval login okay let's go don't have an account sign up actually actually let's just see if this worked with my other account Tim gmail.com and Tim is great boom okay so that does work so the login the login is working I just the sign up Timothy gmail.com Tim is great Tim and Tim good let's go that worked uh just create an account okay let's see if I can sign in to it though uh okay let's go to slash plugin and Timothy at gmail.com Tim boom got it all right guys claps in the chat please please give me some support here that was painful we we now have the authentication working um and the protected endpoint should be good too and go to SL protected oh well if I just Manu go to SL protect that won't work actually wait yeah see it won't well oh it doesn't matter cuz the it's protected on the back end not on the uh the front end thank you thank you everyone thanks for the collaps appreciate it appreciate it um okay nice that's all working got the cat is lurking outside my door just debating if she should come in or not uh okay the refresh token thing oh we're going to have to implement that too oh God that's going to be annoying okay so now we got to figure out where we want to store the token how how we're going to refresh the token and all that fun stuff okay first though we can make the homepage we can make it see if we can get like the user's name or something right um yeah let's do that let let's make an endpoint we don't need this like test protected one anymore we can call this um get user data or something yeah get user data and then this will be uh get user data and then we will send the authorization token okay we don't need this and what we will do is return something that looks like this let's go full screen here we're going to say data and then yeah uh do current user do username what else would this have this would have email as well so we'll we'll pass that and email we'll say data and then this will be a dictionary and then this will be uh username and then this will be email okay let's make this look a little bit nicer actually that's going to go like that okay nice okay uh I definitely messed that up but let's try that now get user data now what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to for now store the token in my app component so yeah use effect we want we also want use state I'm going to say con token set token I'm going to do this with a call back you guys going to see this is probably really bad to do but it'll work for now okay set token and then comma set token and we're going to say use effect check token yeah okay wait no it's not where I want this okay component render here H okay I got to look at something I want the token here this is what I can do though I could say const let's see here how do I want to do this okay um I need to look at some code here where's my Sublime Text homepage this is what I want to do so these Pages don't yeah know these Pages do need the call back actually let's see here this is going to be log in set token there we go okay and let's be set token okay what I'm doing is passing a call back um and what this call back will do is allow me to set the token in here from the uh the login page and then I will pass the token to any uh page I'm rendering that requires it okay this is good good good very good okay render then sign up then react path component okay uh this won't need password reset that can stay the way it is right now uh sign up sign up token okay very good log in now when we set token we're going to say Pro pops. set token we don't need to store it here okay great and then same thing here this is going to be props on set token this needs to take props and then we can remove the token State okay uh what are you guys saying please don't destroy it it's okay after you write code you have to rewrite it my speakers keep turning off at the sign up page already have an account sign in oh is it did I like type it wrong or something is that what you're saying uh let's see oh yeah nice good catch there on the typo okay set state is not defined why do I keep using set State keep I'm so used to that it's that in that's an appjs set State use State there you go could not proxy request that's fine I think it did compile though yeah it did compile good what what is wrong okay there you go slash login okay and then Tim gmail.com inval login oh it's cuz the API is not working did I mess something up let's let's see oh great okay slash login okay nice now we're going to use an effect on the homepage which we're now going to do next okay so new folder we're going to say not off we'll call this main UI and then in here new file call this homepage. JS okay let's copy all that let's go to homepage we don't need any of this okay and then we're going to assume a token is passed to us props let's call this home page okay and then we will say use effect Fetch and then we will fetch what's it going to be get user data yeah yeah SL API SLG get user data do then do then okay so I can get messaged here all right what's everyone saying here okay uh what I'm doing is I'm now creating a homepage so what uh let's let's run through what I've done here uh I have the signup page and the login page working good functioning awesome and what's happening is they are setting the authentication token right here and there setting it on app Dodge ass now by doing that that allows me to pass that token to every other component so now what I can do is render homepage pass that token through and then that homepage can use the token to send an authenticated uh request and if you don't sign in uh then you won't be able to send a request or you will but it will fail and so you'll see what I mean in a second uh but the first thing I want to do is try to get uh the users's data now I made an endpoint in views here I said get user dat data and this is going to return the user's data if you're authenticated and so I want to test that so I'm doing that homepage so I'm saying API get user data however I need to go here copy this and go like that remove the body I don't need this header I just need authorization and this will be get request and then this will be eror plus props do token token's not in there yet but it will be and then this is going to be request options and that needs to end there okay then it will say response response. Json okay do then data console.log data come on auto format for me give me the nice formation okay format document with prettier why is it not formatting should be formatting there you go and there you go oh it's cuz I'm not returning anything that's why okay and then we're going to return a div and this div is just going to say um it's going to say con username set username equals use State and then this going be like that going to say cont email set email equals use State empty okay and then here we're going to set say cly braces if email in data assuming we get data yeah okay have to say no well get a bit ahead of myself here that's fine do this if response. okay else return error um okay you go uh if email in data then set email data at email we'll say actually I don't need this just do that okay and then if username in data set username data at username and then we will say if if I can get this typ in correctly if error in data then we're going to set error so we'll say const error set error equals use State and we'll say set error data at error okay um looking good now what I want to do is show the email and the username but I can't show them this way so we'll show them inside of typography do I have that imported unfortunately not also I don't need any of that I don't need any of that but I do need typog grae where is that okay what are you guys saying you have a spelling mistake yeah I make a lot of spelling mistakes I'll fix them after don't need that either okay typography component equals H1 variant equals h11 SL typography and then copy username okay uh an error curred please try signing in again okay and then we want the error too let's show that this homepage show an error at the top and then this is what we want here all right we're moving much faster now guys getting good progress what are you guys saying all right nothing interesting in the chat right now what is better for starting JavaScript or python I'm trying to make games JavaScript would probably be better although you can make games in Python too if you're just starting it's not really a big deal uh they're they're fairly similar I know I would recommend python but I'm biased I like python I use Python for a lot of stuff but JavaScript really cool too like you can't do what I'm doing here in Python uh this UI uh well you could but it just would be like a lot more difficult okay typography just doing a quick check here I think that's good now we need to render homepage say import homepage from dot SL homepage although this is in main UI main ui/ homepage and then we're going to have a route yes there you go this is what I want to do we're going to say render equals props and then this is going to be do I need to return no I I think I can just do this homepage and then props and token equals token okay and then this could say return after we do that what I mess up here render why isn't that working that should work props hm what I do wrong I genu closing tag for homepage don't oh smart nice thank you guys and this is why we have chat uh okay app is not defined oh wait that's why expert default homepage homepage okay homepage this is used what is it talking about I do use homepage it is red it's lying to me okay home page okay so notice how it's not showing anything did this work no why didn't not oh cuz I went to SL home not not slash an error Cur please try sign again okay that's good actually um the reason that's good is cuz we tried to send a request and we were unauthorized see so it didn't let us but now watch this when I try to sign in SL login Tim gmail.com I don't know if this is working or not God um can you guys see me let me know let me know let me know no and it's back yo literally my entire room just shut off like everything just turned off I don't know if you guys can hear me or not um the camera is lagging H okay yeah I keeps lagging let's see it's just going to take a second to reconnect I think uh you guys can hear me I don't think my face Cam's working um let me know what's wrong with the stream there's going to be stuff like glitching uh the okay the face Cam's back face cam was glitching um oh my God man of course I got to deal with that like just just power surge in the middle of my stream uh what's using so much memory Google Chrome why is it using so much memory what okay it's like one moment works next everything's freezing camera sucks Audio Only face cam dead I think the face Cam's back I think I should be good yeah the camera keeps freezing let me restart the camera um okay okay sorry guys give me give me a second this is hilarious um I know the face Cam's dead I know the face Cam's dead I'm going to fix the face cam uh it just uh what is I want to start I want to stop it for one second because I think it's glitching cuz it's uh actually I don't know to be honest with you I just know it's glitching but you guys can hear me so that's good uh I will turn the face cam I actually have a backup face cam if that one stops working um did you guys all did you guys all leave me no no you didn't okay good you're all still here um let's see no signal I know no signal um M I have like a ridiculous computer this should not be happening I have I have 64 gigs of RAM 12 core processor this this should this should not be happening right now um okay I know you guys can't see my camera but I'm just I'm just letting it cool down for a second and I'm going to restart it cuz it's like a uh what do you call it a dlsr camera okay see if this works I love it was working flawlessly before it's still lagging oh no okay guys watch the camera for me let me know if it keeps lagging if it's lagging too damn it it keeps lagging I don't know why it's lagging so much I'm going to just delete the source and read it um remove it's oh the thing is it's it's it's lagging in what is it lagging in it's it's lag lagging in uh streamlabs okay let me just add a new one add new source video capture device add Source okay whoa It's bit bit bit large for me let's go there I've lost my uh my border which is kind of annoying but we can live with this the reason I lost the border is cuz it's on my server and the servers I guess it's IP address changed um why does this keep lagging why is this camera lagging it's it's something in in um in streamlabs I'm going to go to my backup camera I think it's going to be annoying though CU I like this camera okay go in there let's see if I close everything in Google close that I don't need this anymore okay I'm going to I want to I want this camera not to freeze I I just want this to to not freeze um no I can't restart my router if I restart my router everything's going to go down is it still low audio is everything okay let's see screen freeze is it the screen yeah it's the entire screen it's not just the camera H I think I need to restart streamlabs but I don't know if I end the stream on here if it's going to end it completely I really don't want to um let's see here um open widget ER YouTube is not receiving enough I just need to restart this one second just quit Chrome I don't want to okay let's close everything see if it's working task manager I think I can get it working I just maybe the process was and that and that task I bet you that was doing it I bet you it was um it's still lagging H okay one sec guys Cam's not working everything's frozen everything's frozen it's it's uh streamlabs but the thing is I really I don't want to stop the stream because if I stop it I think it's going to um it's going to end the stream entirely and I don't I can't end this because if I end this it's not going to be 12 hours and then I like I'm recording on my computer but I don't want to have to like render 12 12 hours of footage after uh how do I go to the like stuff here go live I don't think it's the camera that's lagging everything out I know it's lagging I need to restart it but I just I I really don't want it to end the stream and I I I don't know if when I press end stream if it's going to end the stream can I stop yeah keep freezing damn it like why does this have to happen see everything was working so well everything was perfect it's not okay the camera keeps freezing uh can I pause the stream see if this works test test yep I know you guys are fine with the cam but I want a camera um I don't think it's the camera that's freezing I think it's the entire screen uh so yeah see CU be right even this is is freezing without the camera I need to stop this and then restart it uh okay let's just press this if I end the stream on streamlabs it shouldn't end e for okay I know you guys can hear me I'm I'm uh what is it I'm trying to figure this out I just want to make sure that if I end the stream on streamlabs it won't I can reconnect to it uh I'm going to just like re I want to make sure I don't accidentally end it um too too prematurely here um although I did disconnect and I was able to reconnect but I just I I fear I'm going to press stop stream here and then it's going to um it's going to freeze so let's see here stream YouTube output all right hello test okay let's see this I ended and restarted um we'll see if it's going to freeze or not right now it's looking okay um I'm not confident though okay okay am I back no one knows uh yeah okay back back I started I restarted streamlabs um I think that's going to fix it again I'm so sorry guys man I literally was sitting in the Stream and all of a sudden just boom I hear pop and literally every piece of electronics I have just turns off and like I have a lot of electronics in here fortunately my computer is on a uh uh what do you call it what is it like a battery backup uh UPS so all of my data was saved I didn't lose anything the stream stopped because the internet stopped but the UPS kept running my PC it just all the monitors turned off but the PC was still running so I think I fixed it I think it was just streamlabs was bugging out um and now I got my border back and I'm just going to keep talking really low res the res should fix itself that it should get better like as you go through um so yeah but UPS to the rescue if I didn't have the UPS I wouldn't have been back for another like 10 15 minutes and you guys probably would have all left although we only have 305 people everyone thought it ended damn it it's too bad but that's that's fine um let everyone know stream's still back okay let's let's see no re is fine res is fine okay good good good 10 10 Nice Nice okay can we get some thumbs up in the chat if everything's working if everything's good thumbs up in the chat thumbs up if we're good okay it looks like some people are returning they realize the stream is back okay where did I learn react uh I just like I just read like The react documentation that's usually what I do 10 AP 10 AP 10 AP okay let me just fix this this face cam a little bit go 90d Mo over a little bit there you go that's better okay no more camera lagging thumbs up in the chat thank you very much if you guys are still here thank you Jesus man that was stressful I'm sitting here like is everyone going to leave is this the end of the 12 hour stream at the the three hour mark or whatever we'll see what the recording of this looks like after you're going to see all of a sudden just a flash of of the screen done all right uh what chair do you have I'm using a Herman Miller Aeron classic edition chair nice okay I'm just I'm just going to take a a quick quick twominute break here just uh relax for a second cuz that was stressful yeah we're at the 4 Hour Mark I still got a lot to do but a lot of the hard stuff is done now it's just going to be like I can just kind of Speed code a lot of the stuff because that stuff I didn't know how to do excuse me and now I know uh how it works also uh not to bribe anyone here but if you want to test my alert box on my stream if you donate even like 10 cents it will prob show up your name all right 500 people all right we're back guys we're back we got 492 confr concurrent viewers awesome thank you all for staying here what is a typing racer clone it's called code racer you are going to uh code against other people like it's not a problem it's like you'll be given a block of code you got to type it as fast as you can Tim tell me yeah my girlfriend messaged me and my entire office exploded stream stopped and I couldn't do anything until I responded um yeah that that's what happened fire went up and blazed and then uh the sprinkler system went on yeah um all right let's see I think I think we're good I think we're good that doesn't count as a brick trust me I was not on brick when that was happening okay I think we're good uh all right all right yep yep looks good okay sorry we're back all right what was I doing I honestly don't remember remember uh I was testing the sign up log in so I do need to verify that the email people are typing in is correct so I would like to do that like I want to verify that the email is actually an email um but I don't really want them to have to like verify their email you know I would prefer to just like be able to make an account so let's do this um email validator python okay uh how to check for valid email address okay update here's how you could use a regx okay let's just see if there's an easy way to do an email verification because I think I need to do that email verification flask you have a typo on passwords um okay we'll look at that after real python this good website this guy does really good work update the current APP confirmed oh that's what you have to do okay registered confirmed I actually should probably do registered on too that would be a good field to have okay so confirmed manage command conf confirmed generate confirmation token the email confirmation should contain a unique URL that a user simply needs to click in order to confirm his account ideally the URL should look something like the key here is the ID you're going to encode the user email along with a timestamp in the ID using its dangerous package create a file called project token. piy let just see what we're going to do here so in the generate confirmation token function we use your all safe timed serializer generate token okay uh user blueprint. root okay form. validate token generate confirmation token handle email confirmation surely it's got to be an easier way to do this okay uh use it confirmed you've confirmed your account when you go to that route okay okay okay okay create the email template okay I think I can do this it's going to be a pain to be honest with you but we got to do it so let's do it okay so good if they try to sign in and they are not uh verified we need to send them something to say please verify your email okay so we'll say actually let's modify the user model first is my music not going oh the music's not going sorry about that guys let me get that working okay um let me find the music there was one wondering where that went okay lowfy music should start playing soon sweet turn that down a bit okay why doesn't Tim know how to set slow mode it's a good question I have no idea I should know how to do that man I just uh I can't for some reason it's just not just not working just doesn't let me do it there's like no button to set the slow mode thing which is weird okay send email man this is a lot of work to send the email okay we've done registration but I do want all of that so let's go to AIT and registered on confirmed on AC okay good I don't need that a nit that's fine notice how file defaults to false manage command okay so when we add this guy going to go like that and delete this database let's actually delete okay I think this is is this showing me how to do it in Django I think it is but I don't think it makes a difference actually no no it's floss what am I Ty that okay that's good so now when I create let's go here should have a default right default equals false registered on can I make that auto insert yeah that should Auto insert confirmed on okay see import day time okay now where's create user we're going to say user confirmed equals false generate confirmation token okay so far we've done literally nothing related to uh to the actual code racer thing we've literally just been trying to set up authentication because I ideally want this to work properly okay so there you go be sure to add security password to your apps config um where is it saying security password so app.config okay let's do that um security password salt equals random thing you'll never guess okay um what else does we need no that's it register confirmed token okay fuse and user turn access token no see we can't return the access token because they're not confirmed yet so what should we do here after that's successful we'll say success yeah okay actually let me fix this I'm going to say return we'll just return empty response to A1 let's say data oh we need to return the link that's what we need to do okay uh from project. token import from. token import generate confirmation token okay okay now I actually need a rout yeah okay this is going to be kind of complicated so at views. root confirm email slash token okay Define confirm unor email token guess I can authenticate H this is where it's tough here so I need to confirm the email before I let a user sign in okay generate confirmation token so I guess we can check if the user is signed in before we do this okay so I'm going to say user equals oh there you go it does work thank you for helping me test that out appreciate the uh the 20 rupees there uh thank you very much Super Chat okay okay uh user equals user. query. filterby and then we'll filter by username or email equals email do first now we'll say if user is none return um I guess we can just return empty 401 that's fine if user dots confirmed not user. confirmed then we'll return an error and say please verify your email address 401 okay otherwise we're good okay um okay so that's fine we just won't we won't verify them until they verify their email address okay confirm email and this will take the token we're going to say what this has uh if use it. confirmed 200 we'll say data confirmed okay uh use cretive field to email equal first 44 okay nice um the confirmation link is invalid has expired okay I'm going say return error 401 okay data another Super Chat appreciate the 20 rupees thank you very much that is from yeah guys I'm so sorry I feel like I almost shouldn't even try to pronounce your names because I'm just going to mess it up uh what is this nagar yeah I I can't do it I'm sorry guys okay and then here that's fine so actually we can just do this another Super wow you guys are just rolling it in here 29 rupees by cash Yap thank you very much $10 by future flash thank you for these 12hour streams I'm so glad I finally got the chance to

template okay oh this is not going to this is not going to work the way I want it to work oh maybe actually I think I can do this okay API API API we can say templates and new file email. HTML okay uh welcome thank for signing up please follow this link to URL to activate your account cheers nice okay now let's make a new file here excuse me um let's see what are they saying here how much is rupes US dollar that's a very good question I have no idea that's why when I see 100 rupees I'm like I don't know what that actually equates to but I appreciate whatever the amount just doesn't matter $1 is with 70 rce okay got it makes sense all right send email message email HTML templat sender app. config mail. default sender oh I'm going to have to send up set up like an email oh no that's gonna be annoying and you guys are gonna hack my email on stream that's gonna be even more annoying okay update the register form token confirm URL HTML subject flash okay let's do that let's go to views go here your email okay great um no I don't don't want to log you in send email racer uh okay render templates okay token confirm url url for user. confirm email wait what URL for this should be views okay that works token token external true okay HTML render template confirm URL okay subject okay say from email import send email okay you wrote your twice where' I do that nice catch okay remve this actually let me grab that oh I need the damn it that's annoying uh I guess I can do this and just not return the access token see now this is where it gets annoying user equals guard authenticate email password when they click that link though okay we'll see here I'm going to leave this here for now okay um yeah there you go okay oh I should have done it this way that would have been way easier did they did did he did they explain how to set that up um there's this like base config thing uh let me try to do it this way actually new file fig. py equals true okay gmail authentication app mail username I'm GNA have to set that okay uh from can I mail accounts mail default sender going to have to set up an email that's annoying forgot I have to do all this stuff okay and then I have to export that okay let's go to this actually I'll just take these here uh flask app config from object from object okay analis config dot base config okay let's go to config these in here guess actually don't need all these quotation X too okay all right chances that's going to work probably not very high someone donate should I donate to myself just so YouTube can take uh a percentage of my money okay oh you could add config.js too okay I think that's fine um does his work here I have to I have to make an email H okay I'll do that after confirm email user s. filter email confirmed on okay import date time no bad words what's wrong with no what did I say a bad word or something okay send okay so what's going to happen is when you sign up it's going to send the email and then you're going to have to verify the Emil the thing is you got to verify the email by going to react front and endpoint not a flask back and endpoint so I need to set up that verify email on react okay let's do that I guess this be under off say uh confirm email oops. JS be the same as the password reset okay confirm email damn why is there so much stuff here no I can use air that's fine um we don't really need anything we don't need a form to say p now please sign in and then we'll say link 2 equals slash log in slash link okay uh can I make the button I want the alert to actually let's go log in here let's take this okay confirm email and say class error okay this is going to be error equals oh actually we need to State here const confirmed set confirmed equals use State false okay okay and then it's going to take props this is going to be called confirm email we don't need that do we have don't need these don't need actually we'll keep typography don't need form control we do need use effect though okay see use effect and then in here we're going to send okay so fetch do then do then okay this is going to go to SL API SL confirm hyphen email SL Plus and then this will be props do email token yeah that should be good uh actually props do match. pr. token see why we need that in a minute and then response uh response. Json and data data okay if error in data come on don't need semic there okay if error in data then what I'm going to do is say set error and this will be data at error okay where is my music see you guys if you guys are going see you thanks for coming to the stream oh oops good good catch on that see be that um yep if you guys are leaving see you later I guess it's uh night time in Indy and now or I guess it was already night time but it's like late now uh vs code good yes vs code very good okay set error date error data error and then we just say else if data and actually if there's no error then that's fine then we will here go return otherwise we'll say const history equals use history and then we will say from um where is this that's what we want okay confirm email link use history history equals use history we'll say history. push slash okay uh and then we will set confirmed equal to True set confirmed um we don't want to do that actually second confirmed true okay error equals say confirmed question mark if so then we will show a div this div will say in typography and this will be variant equals body 2 and component equals P so thank you for verifying your email and then we'll say please sign in it will show a button actually just going to say login okay please log in what's wrong what I do wrong affirmative oh otherwise excuse me uh we will show nothing no that should be good okay uh temporary variant button now how I make button a link let's see do I surround the button in a link I think so let's try uh okay no h see oh okay looks like that is actually how you do it slash link nice and then this is to slash login and API confirm youil props match PRS token okay now we need to set up that rout am I exporting confirm email okay go to homepage page app go and make a route here say firm email actually this needs to be like this Fromm email slash confirm email slash token is that how you do that is it like this what's the like Dynamic roots in react just forget let's see um yeah that is right okay good come say token yeah token's fine and we'll set token okay confirm email token props rout nice uh yeah say exact that's fine we don't need that .js that's fine home page that's fine password reset so no we don't care about that one don't care about that I don't know if this going to work let's see here you guys don't like the music guys everyone has different preferences on the music so uh I uh I'm just GNA leave the way it is right now because I think it's fine let's see confirm emails not to find yes I need to import that we're almost at the fun part guys setting up the sockets almost there let's let's try this yarn API how many errors we going to get here config not found no module named config false there's a module named config okay where is this a nit and do config empty module name no module named do config H should work right beside here this is weird I don't know why the config is not working okay let's say flask from config I actually think I did this in a previous project that I have on GitHub let's see um chat web app okay website app yeah see look look at this config.py okay and application a nit oh that's why I know why now slash API there you go now it'll work fingers crossed damn it API config not found is it do SL API where did I put my GitHub thing I think if I do this oh it's cuz run API run API outside of that folder move I think it'll work now let's see oh I got to change the rout though uh okay nit nit change that to be config what do you guys saying here OS not not defined that's fine I can fix that now that's good though it's loading the config okay let's see Port OS no module named Oso policy what the heck is that oh what the heck what what the heck did I import okay that was weird work come on damn it oh okay it's cuz this isn't defined that's fine so if I Define that then it'll work I just have to export the variables all right okay we're we're on our way here just trying to get this config thing to work app mail username app mail password I need to Define that um on Google but I don't want to give you guys my username and password okay um I will be right back I'm just going to go to the washroom quickly so see you all soon all right no that's the wrong one that's the right one okay all right I'm just going to have a quick uh snack here what do you guys think of uh oh Henry bars not sponsored also while we're here I can remind you about our sponsor of the stream which is algo expert you guys can see the overlay check them out I'm an instructor on algo expert I'll go there right now actually let's see here content you can see go to coding interview questions 155 coding interview questions if you sort by instructor and go look for my beautiful face here you can see all of the questions that I've created so just uh little plug there make sure to check them out all right wash your hands Tim I did wash my hands thank you very much here like my mom actually I'm going to go code only while I eat you guys can have the ASMR do I want watch sports I like watching sports I don't like follow Sports really but like if there's a championship or something I would watch it you use streamlabs yeah I am using streamlabs right now Tim says washroom and Oh Henry he's Canadian yes I'm very Canadian from Ontario how do you have so much stamina for coding I don't I'm just Faking It guys did I watch Marvel Iron Man um no I don't think so I'm not a big like you would think I would be right but I'm not a big like Comic Book Guy or anime or anything I'm not really into that I should get a custom keyboard where should I get a custom keyboard from I'd be down to spend money on a custom keyboard but I don't really know where to get one from 20 rectors I'm a big fan thank you very much appreciate it my face can will be back in one second I'm just eating I don't really like um I don't I don't need you guys to watch me like Munch down on a no Henry bar do I play Minecraft yes not very often but I do play Minecraft I like Minecraft best university Ontario for CS probably uh University of watero or um UFT how is the whole Co situation in Canada um I don't know I won really get into that all all can say is I'm not legally allowed to leave my house right now I can leave for essential purposes yeah I did actually stream on Twitch I was like messing around with it just to see if it was going to work I'm planning on potentially streaming on Twitch in the future um like video games and stuff if you guys like these streams I'm down to do them more I just like am not you know like familiar with streaming I don't do very often as you guys can tell from this mess here at the beginning at least yeah would you guys watch me if I uh live stream games even if I'm not good at video games like I'm good enough that I'm like I know how to play the games obviously and I could like maybe get a few kills in Call of Duty or something but I'm definitely not like a good video game player okay going to put the face cam back on nice you watch me even if I stream a blank wall I appreciate the support man I appreciate it I've played fortnite before I actually used to be decent at fortnite back when it was like really popular and everyone was playing it but no I haven't played fortnite I don't even have an installed I haven't played it in probably like a year and a half two years right now I've been playing a lot of Chess I know it's not really like a I guess you call it a video game but I like chess chess is really fun okay I want to set up this damn email thing uh also my light I want to reset my lights here I have an app that does my lights and I think it got messed up when the uh the power searched oh no it's okay let me just turn the brightness down a bit oh that's a bit better a little less light for me I would stream uh chess for sure and I could do more coding live streams too um yeah I don't know why took me so long to do another one I just was procrastinating doing it uh okay email where where even was I here okay let's go back to confirm email so in here what's going to happen is we're going to send a thing here I don't need history anymore actually excuse me I don't need classes so I'm not even using them so that can go um use history can go save okay second firm true and then it would show that can go there token. py okay email. P okay email. HTML okay use. P okay okay let's try this just want to change something here to handle some more messages uh okay con not error this is going to be success set success equals use State okay we're going to say oops Yeah if data in data then set data data data no what the heck don't no don't do that set data okay uh this can be on the same line and then here go alert if success success set success and success okay probably a better way to do that but that's fine see you guys if you're leaving the stream thank you for uh for coming on hanging out yeah when I stream video games and stuff I'm going to uh what do you call it I'm going to stream on Twitch so if you guys want to follow me on Twitch I'll like throw my thing up but I haven't uh I haven't really done anything on that that's why I haven't uh what do you call it like shuted myself out or whatever oh of course yeah that's fine work twitch uh actually let's go twitch.com there you go Twitch TV Che with him see 11 followers come on guys go follow me on Twitch I'll put a link would appreciate it I don't think you can even subscribe to me I don't think that's a a thing right now I think I have to like stream a certain amount of time or something but there you go it's in the chat yeah I'll do more uh more coding live streams too also if you follow me on Twitch I have like a an animation thing that will show up on the screen but it's going to be so annoying if I run it let's just run it it's going be funny okay let's do this follows okay ready you're going to start seeing spam probably on the screen in a second here come on show up alert box work maybe it's subscribers oh that's why it's follows done why can't I get it to work follows okay done oh it's cuz it's locked that's why follows done it keeps unticking this what the heck why okay unfortunately I can't get the alert box to work with uh with follows so that's fine anyways I appreciate the follows because I can see it all on my screen a ton of you have followed me already how many followers do I now have on Twitch probably like 30 or something let's see twitch tvtim uh yeah 38 damn thank you guys appreciate it appreciate the follows um yeah wow lots you fun nice okay so now this should work when you go to the confirm email what's what's the issue here um oh I imported link twice okay fail to compile failed to compile already been declared and confirm email set data is not defined why do I keep messing this up as be set success okay that's good now let's see if I can actually get it to send an email I got to make an email okay I'm going to make one on my other screen so you guys can't see uh what's what are you guys saying change music or skip it why do you guys like this just just calm relaxing music okay let's go h okay one sec guys sir I just need to make sure I'm not going to get copyright stried for my music um I got to add like credits in the description or something uh okay oh actually I can edit it here okay so annoying to modify this edit description okay I think I'm good now um did I accept the offer from Shopify no I did not do you watch Mr Beast not really I've seen like a few of his videos just because he's super popular right but I haven't uh haven't watched a ton why do you use V code inste py charm um why do I use vs code inste py charm honestly I just stopped using py charm after a while like I started using vs code a lot when I worked at Microsoft and then I learned it and then I was like you know just more comfortable using vs code so I kept using it uh am I on study break yeah I'm still not in school right now um I don't know if I'm going back it's looking like I probably won't but uh I may you know I'm not ruling it out okay let's now create an email make new email Gmail and let's hope you guys don't hack me create an account call this code racer do I actually need a phone number oh my God that's so annoying okay everything requires a phone number now what if you don't have a phone number I need another phone to put all this spam authentication stuff on okay sorry guys just making an email right now that we're going to test with okay email has been created now need to expert this environment variable and I can't show you guys what it is so I'll be doing more interesting stuff in one second can't even remember the name of the email I just created where is my thing H wait how do you export an environment variable in in Windows oh no do I need to do a Power shell or something export is not working is it set it is set okay thanks guys what the heck my command prompt so is all messed up right now there you go that worked thank you whoever told me that there's actually a ton of you who told me that don't need that okay nope it is done now I guarantee it's not going to work but we'll see come on what I exported the variable damn it okay we're going to go back to drawing board here okay let's man this is so annoying because I can't show you guys the password so I have to like hide it there someone in here will go and be annoying okay this was inside okay yes I know you guys are all going to hack me that's why I have to do it this way okay get En EnV get EnV I can at least I can tell you what the email is but I can't tell you code racer I'll just put the password in environment variable okay now if I ever open this EnV file have to make a completely new email actually it will probably block you guys from signing it it'll probably give you like a two Factor thing okay don't open the EnV file don't open the EnV file uh yeah if you you guys can send emails to if you want me I don't care I'm not going to answer them I just want to use it to test so this should work now hopefully we'll see though it's uh famous last words okay close that so much crap open right now use square brackets oh smart man was wondering why I wasn't getting the syntax highlighting okay let's try this now come on come on no module name project okay that's fine I know why that happened I think what was happening in Project nit views what oh token up high do I need app oh I do damn it okay this can just be H how do I get the app without running the function damn it this is not good um hm okay let's see here all right belal thanks for thanks for spamming man I see you just just uh abusing me in the chat here okay um how do I want to do this where is this token thing token in needs all this crap I could just import it from config no say import config okay I'm going to say from config import based config okay this going to be this config dot secret key okay and then base config do security password salt okay and then base config do security key okay expiration is equal to that okay all right yeah just destroying Bal in the chat for uh for calling me out there while it's okay no adderal I'm not on any adal I promise you I'm not you would you would be able to tell if I was um okay let's continue this is just how I am man that's how I am okay token I feel like we're we're so close we're so close come on nit wait views okay where's views that would be why come on give it oh I got to install that maybe yeah I probably missed that actually oh I just realized I didn't install any of the modules that the dude told me to install or that this tutorial said to install so probably need to do that here just do this pip there you go where's requirements oh wow okay um copy all that okay already have that I don't need that don't need that don't need that okay and new pip install hyph r no not read me damn it requirements.txt all right what are people saying here all right how far are we we're five hours in right now almost at the halfway mark still got a lot to go okay so hopefully this is going to work now come on no module named fl. EXT maybe I missed the one that I needed to let me just take all his crap and put it in here now we I know I don't need this and I know I don't need this and I know I don't need this and let's get rid of the versions okay is flash. EXT deprecated or something I feel like that is you're unable to set up simple email functionality you uh I doubt you how you got into Microsoft well I mean you don't have to believe me if you don't want to doesn't really matter to me that just you know believe it or not they don't they don't test you you can set up a flask email server at Microsoft when you're never going to have to do that flask doxt is flask EXT deprecated I feel like that's deprecated let me look this up EXT yeah there you go it's been deprecated H so this is out of date that's annoying so from flask that doesn't work H is it going to say here a damn it okay I just I don't know where this comes from now from fext token email there you go let's try this okay email up p okay good that worked sender I don't need that mail from do config import base config okay now we just need to do male um where is male defined for this guy where does he initialize mail this is really annoying this dude did not a lot of the code is not here to go to the GitHub there you go see from floss mail import mail okay let's go to nit okay mail there you go male equals male do I need to like initialize male don't think so that should work now okay let's see app is not defined oh no that's so annoying okay say what you say mail was none none well this this isn't even going to change it is it okay don't do this what I'm doing don't do okay just never do this sh sh don't do it and yes someone is pointing out an issue that I have set there you go thank you okay no modu api. config there is one though oh it's not an API let's try this o okay not no constraint failed uh okay we're getting there flask SQL uh auto fill in dates okay I think I'm going to do this uh what's happening is there's I'm creating an entry in the database and it wasn't filling in one of the fields it needs to if I go to a knit AIT AIT AIT AIT you go confirmed on oh no that's not no oops that's not what I want to do not there I want to do it here no not confirmed on oops that should be unregistered on server default it might just be default not server default oh no server default looks like it's correct okay um okay let's try this ah come on here not n constraint failed on registered on shouldn't be just do this why is that happening delete this it's a pie cach issue there we go okay it's working um Jesus oh man that was so painful okay let's let's let's let's try stuff um guess we'll leave that open that's fine okay slash login okay that's good bro the homepage logged in fine let's go create now slash sign up okay email address tothy oh I need to actually type in a real email okay I'll do the one that's public on my channel um actually can't I do like a no mail email or something or what what are those temporary email things called um temp email nice okay why why bad request what's wrong okay let's go to email let's go to surely there's an error here it's just not telling me what it is go to views sign up I've not added a Min password length thing now 400 b Quest this is one of these but it didn't tell me what the error was let me fix that ah see if response is not okay we should still have a response see I don't want to just set error I still want to return the response at Json because I think I can still let's just try this that should work okay email is already in use so it did make an account okay let's just try with a different email um I guess can I check if this is how do I check this email fresh didn't send anything to it oh that makes sense okay change is that not the same one it just gave me me we can check yeah literally the exact same email that was not helpful give me a new one I don't like this email service can I just pick anything mailinator that's good that's the name of the one that I like very good Tim oh okay well that's fine we can just use Tim miller.com uh let's try this unexpected token URL 4 is not to finded oh okay there you go so we're getting we're getting places here guys we're getting getting somewhere okay let's define URL 4 okay we're GNA have to make another new account though okay tim1 what's now template not found okay let's go find this guy's thing see where he put his project templates mean where's the damn email template this isn't even the same project as the other one okay okay manage back back back H let's see what you guys are saying yeah this is really tedious this is so annoying uh I'm almost there I'm almost there um Dennis nothing much what's going on with you just uh just working on doing an uh authentication here with sending an email have not done this before so it's uh very tedious let's see here what's the problem it's saying template not found oh it's oh my God I'm such an idiot where is it loading template from uh I I should just read the error message first because like that would solve a lot of problems here we can find this pretty easily user slash there you go see that's why got to name the template the right thing it's going to be firm be email. HTML okay let's try this now internal server error name mail is not defined that's in email forgot to import mail okay let's try again okay authentication error username and password not accepted should be working okay let's see we're getting very close we are we are actually very close I think there's something I need to do on Gmail uh to make it work like I think there's like a Gmail thing that like it like blocks your app from using it uh let's see here use Gmail to send email python um there's something you have to do 100% yes okay you do have to do something here first you want to allow less secure apps to your account details on do this you should check out this page how do you do this um okay let me try this manage your Google account critical security issue found you guys you guys try trying to uh attack me here yeah I don't know how to allow the L secure apps so I'm trying can I search allow less allow less secure apps um Google might block less scabs can make it easy it doesn't tell me how to do this so update they don't make it easy to do this there we go allow L secure Ops on great let's try this now this is torture I agree as torturous for you as me okay a verification email has been sent nice sweet again error it looks like it worked now how do I check that it was Tim four okay let's go success success email has been sent okay let's open that you have confirmed your account success absolute success let's go boom all right claps in the chat guy claps in the chat the sweetness of success yes agree 100% that was only slightly painful and when I oh damn it I've given you guys my password oh no okay quickly quickly reset the password please guys please please don't do it to me please don't do it to me please just just please please don't I pray someone's going to sign in all right reset password oh no take action more activity continue to your Google account how do I change my password security password change okay uh all right I've done it I beat you guys you're not going to get me now boom password changed all right that that was quick good job I have a little bit of delay on the stream oh man see like if I wasn't streaming this would be going so much better that's okay all right close the damn EnV file okay ah yeah I bet you guys were trying to do it man I bet you guys were were there racing me okay so my email is confirmed but I want it to go to a different uh thing codes his own email authentication then 5 seconds later how to change my password yeah the thing is I know how to do it but it's just like trying to find where the page is is annoying okay so let's go to mail email this is email oh it's in the email. no it's in someone with a donation 20 rupees appreciate it thank you very much um where's the here it is confirm URL that's what I need to do I need to change the confirm URL uh confirm URL confirm URL that would be in views now if I go to token confirm URL where is the dam confirm URL I think it's probably in sign up it is okay ah it's going to be frustrating okay we're just going to have to manually do this because the thing is I don't want oh we can do this is annoying um CU I want to redirect to my uh front end not my back end so when you press that link the URL needs to be different exteral equals true token equals token URL 4 okay I think I can just hardcode this um I'm going to go this is really bad but for now this will work 5,000 slash confirm hyphen email slash plus token okay I think that should be fine actually uh and it's not 5,000 3,000 okay but anyways that that was good that was good we we did well we've done very well now let's see if I can sign in invel login I actually think that's working internal oh server's not running boom let's go okay let's go sign up um okay it's telling me an error this isn't this isn't the case I'm going to fix that after uh okay but let's go log in and let's try to log in before we validated invalid login please try again unauthorized okay that's fine I want to get a I want better error messages though but that's for now that's fine um it's not working but now if I verify go to mailinator and try it there we go um I just got this right 1632 yep let's click it boom thank you for very your email please log in you have confirmed your account thanks log in and now let's try it let's go okay email verification is up and running now there's obviously some bugs but we we'll fix those um yeah now we have the full authentication scope here there's nothing really more I need to do for off now we can actually start building the app now we have people signed in now I'm going to need to make some models to store like games and like all kinds of other stuff but like this is good this is very very good um uh yeah if you if you guys donate enough money for me to order some dinner that'd be great no I'm just kidding um okay sign up that's done I don't need so the sign up thing actually was the thing is the errors I'm getting are all like weird cuz it's not showing me the right thing um log in oh that's why so it's only if yeah okay that's fine I don't expect have to have internal server errors so okay that should be fixed now go to sign up okay if set success okay I got to fix this here data at data else okay nice nice nice this should be in else if and now we need success so let's say con success okay let's go do the collapse and let's make this a success let's change this to say success set success and success okay nice that should be good now uh what are you guys saying good night 430 p.m. the LSU set doesn't work um um yeah it's been how long has it been it's 430 I started at 11 5 and a half hours I'm not even tired to be honest with you which is very good okay so now it's all working nice let's try this now boom okay Works five bucks 20 Timbits for you Tim thank you very much Jonathan appreciate that come on show up on my uh on my screen here see uh streamlabs has not registered your donation yet hopefully it will do it in a second regardless I appreciate it even if it doesn't show up on streamlabs uh okay let's go back to login um let's make a new account Tim five there going to be so many Tim accounts there you go there's the donation okay email already in use oh okay let's try this verification link has been sent to your email beautiful okay let's go to mail nater okay confirm user already confirm oh that's probably showing up because it's like okay that's fine log in good works oh no that's not what I want okay nice uh happy with that now get user data is not doing anything though we need to fix that okay so let's go now to the homepage all right we're in uh we've just finished excuse me a lot of the very difficult stuff here if we go to main UI homepage this isn't working email and username are not working can't I do like this no that's going to be an infinite Loop Lo return error Cur data I guess it's an error and it's if error it should be uh jeez like that maybe no that should work fat JPI response okay let's try this maybe the response isn't okay maybe the why it's not working uh not sure okay an error occurred please try signing in okay I do need to fix that so we're storing the token in um in local storage but we can do that after an error occurred okay please try signing in again let me go to slash login and we go oh my mouse man what is happening it's lagging everywhere okay log in data email oh it's because I'm doing I need to do data data that's why okay if Ah that's okay data in data then email dat data data uh oh this actually yeah that's fine we can do that okay this could be an else if this should work now there you go see boom got it oh they're huge oh my God okay uh make this like an H4 H4 H4 H4 nice boom okay now let's go and get an ID too so let's go to views uh this is what it is let's say ID call in say user equals this okay let's try this an error Cur it's because we're not storing token in local storage okay how to store token in local storage window. local storage boom easy that we're going with that okay go to homepage go to appjs use effect and I want this to only update when token changes okay token say do do oops what am I doing this is the the tired mind coming into effect effect oh nice someone said I I have an error with email nice catch very nice catch thank you very much um okay knit up where was I I was app this this should work right what do you guys think of this let me know I think this should work window. storage set am token I will pass token through the I guess I don't really need to pass token through the props then um like this I don't need to do let's do that uh Steven thank you for the $5 Super Chat hi again one of your mods helped me with the cloud fair with Len Noe problem I asked about earlier t i some well I'm glad I'm happy that they were able to help you out uh I'm literally just starting with web dev and the amount of work this s fire is hella demotivating uh don't be demotivated by this I'm just doing um what do you call it like complicated stuff like you don't have to know how to do this to do web div so so don't don't be demotivated please um okay oh the snippets on Google I think I have this thing called Greer yeah it's called grepper it's actually sweet I love this thing it does it helps so much it just automatically searches for your problem um yeah I think that's what it's called yeah grapper grapper that's the name of it it's an extension for Chrome um okay local storage nice now if we go to homepage we should be able to grab from local storage right so use effect okay I will put token in here then I guess const of actually I don't need token in the state I can just grab it from local storage when I need it so I'm going to say cons token equals windows. local storage. getet token plus token yeah let's see if that works okay well that's not going to work obviously um another Dono towards the official get Tim lunch fundraiser thank you man appreciate it stevenh thank you very much thank you very much okay let's log in here let's go Tim's this damn it okay Tim what I don't even know what I made the thing now Tim 6 at mailinator.com so internal server error ohel syntax Ed up High Line 93 oh I fixed it now okay please verify your email address uh back to inbox 10 six go why that not work I guess I didn't get sent an email for that one that's fine we can do Tim five unexpected could not proxy request why is it not sending it there you go okay that's working all right so now if I refresh this it should still work yeah it does still work okay great we're good wait an error occurred what 401 unauthorized what is local storage how does local storage work cuz that didn't like grab the token out of it uh let's go to nothing yeah but shouldn't the shouldn't it not clear the storage wait let me go to app maybe it's cuz I did this it's CU maybe the state gets reset okay we can do this we can say if window. local storage I need to look this up I forget how this works that sets the local storage and then I guess it would reset the local storage when the state refreshed oh that makes sense okay um okay we can do this that's fine if uh window. local storage dot get it token right now I'm trying to store the token in local storage and um once that's done like all the off stuff's done there's nothing more to do um if you take that long I'd take a century yeah I don't know I just also like start I'm trying to do something like pretty complicated right uh or if it does equal that then we'll do that otherwise return I think that's fine okay what oh Gmail okay refresh refresh fresh refresh nice slash lugin okay go back to slome boom got it let's go now the question is how do I clear the token from local storage when they sign out I guess we're going to have to do that through react on the front end uh we could do a back end as well we we will do two um okay I'm going to be back guys I'm just going to go the washroom quickly and maybe grab some food um yeah be back soon all right I'm back let's go here oh I want to grab a Red Bull okay well I'll just leave this on I'll be back in one sec forgot a Red Bull all right we back I'm 20 years old guys almost going to be 21 in like two months no problem love making the content thank you guys for watching man I forgot how bad these things taste and this is even a flavored one too tropical some fluff on my shoulder okay all right what was I doing want to make the sign out sign up should be pretty easy uh again we're not too focused on The Styling drinking agent can is 19 uh yeah in some state or some provinces 18 um most is 19 okay what age I start coding so around 12 maybe a little bit earlier than that I it's really hard to remember to be honest but probably yeah around like 12 so actually what I'm going to do is make a sign out and all the sign out's going to do is send request sign out on the back end then redirect to the login page that'll be pretty easy uh let's do that now okay reset did I even use the Styles in here classes yeah I did okay log out reset leave typography yeah nice okay actually no we don't we don't need any content this page can literally return an empty says let's just say signing out okay signing out and then don't need that don't need that uh we can keep the Styles I guess so we don't need these excuse me okay just going to say use effect this is going to be called sign out I mean theoretically I could just call function I guess to do this it's fine we'll do it this way okay and then here we want to fetch do then then uh I guess we can have an alert here actually yeah let's go back no no no no uh y okay don't need that that that that this is what I want I want a alert for signing in okay log out okay get rid of email get rid of that get rid rid of that just in case there's an error logging out you know okay use effect uh like this do I have use effect no I don't okay use effect going to fetch do then dot then okay we're going to fetch SL API SL log out and then with the options where's this this Tim sing a song no that will not be happening the react State management system I'm using is local storage not uh not ideal how much time have you been streaming for I've been going for just about six hours now got another six to go we're about halfway through we've gotten most of the hard part done uh we're almost done options. then response response. Json doben data if error in data set error data error and return okay otherwise this is I need to use history uh don't need that need this though okay and then here nice thank you banck appreciate it 400 of you guys are still watching could I get uh something in the chat if you guys have been here the whole time be very impressed if any of you have actually been here the entire time be very very impressed yeah this is not easy um I'm also not doing it properly but doesn't doesn't mean it's still not easy uh okay let's go now to the back end and let's make our sign out at views. root sign out uh yes you do need to be authenticated to do this Define signore out sorry log out is what I want SL log out and then log out he guys you've been here for two hours damn entire time fan thank you very much since 400 a.m. dry gour MVP been here listening in the background musty appreciate it why don't use fast API yeah I probably should have used that to be honest don't overexert yourself take care man I appreciate that but I only do these like once in a while so it's okay we can we can go crazy um so logging out I don't actually think there's anything we need to do on the back end to log out now that I think about it cuz it's just a token I don't think we need to like log the user out yeah I genuinely don't think we need a back end for this I think we can just do on the R cuz we just removed the token yeah that sounds about right I don't need all this I can just remove the token from local storage and then literally push the login page yeah let's do that okay how do you remove from local storage uh delete from local storage JavaScript remove item oh I'm getting a a phone call okay one sec guys I'll be right back all right I'm coming back sorry I was told that uh I was able to go buy an Xbox now I put myself on a weit list like 2 months ago to buy a new Xbox just cuz like I might as well just put myself on I don't have to buy it if I don't want to and they said hey we have one available so I was like okay that's like I don't even know what it's called the series X or something whatever the new one is but yeah that's what they told me okay are you ever going to make a python Advanced tutorial and teach us about packages probably I have mentioned packages in a tutorial before client side logging out sounds sketch the thing is it's like you need a token to send to the back end so all I'm doing when I'm logging out is just removing the token from local storage so it's not like you're like cashed in the back end as if you're logged in just anytime a request is sent you have to be you have to have that token for the request to like work right now once we get to sockets that's going to be interesting uh that's could be very interesting because like hm yeah I guess actually it won't really matter because oh this will be great but now the way it's going to work is you will be able to play as a guest or signed in and if you're playing as a guest that just means you won't be able to like have your score saved and everything you'll just you'll be able to play but you won't have to like save your score uh whereas if you are logged in yeah I'm using JWT um yeah okay this actually this will work this will work okay so all we're going to do is just remove this from local storage if we're in local storage got to make sure we check that so I'm going to say will this work if it's not in local storage like does it handle that or will it crash I mean I guess I can just check if it's in local storage we'll we'll try it for now I think that's fine um and then it should this should just log you out so let's is this called No this be called log yet okay export default log out okay and just just to clarify here I not at all recommending you guys do what I'm doing here this is me like figuring stuff out as we go just trying to make something work this is more just for fun like this is not to like this is not a tutorial please please don't take this as a tutorial otherwise uh yeah that's just that's going to be bad okay let's go log out and then we will rout slash log out and log out although I will no actually I think this is fine I think we'll be okay okay see if this works so I'm signed in right now if my API is running should be signed in there you go so now if I go to slash sign out or slash log out notice it logs me out boom brings me back to login page all right now if I go to home see error occurred please try sign again awesome okay so now we can actually start creating the application now we can sign in and sign out and do all of that annoying stuff and so we can remove all this we can start working on the actual user interface this is like actually kind of perfect exactly halfway all the hard stuff's done now I'm not saying the new stuff we're doing is not going to be difficult but it will be a lot easier and I'm going to rename this file off just because uh that handles all the off roots and now I'm going to go to a nit CU I got to change my other my other views here uh this is going to be off off off fuse come on you're not going to rename there you go okay that should still work now good got it nice all right refresh get user data so this needs to go into a different file go new sub UI now we go to nit and use uh SL API yeah this can still be SL API that's fine uh okay now off take that go to fuse paste off don't think I need that don't think I need that don't think I need that don't need that might need that okay nice now this will be views this will be views this will be views nice okay now it's working please try signing in I want to make a link for that those are small things we'll do those later slash login what oh I always do the wrong email okay why error occurred oh no unauthorized h should do this actually it's not if it's blank set the token it actually needs to set the token no matter what if the token's not blank that's what it is if token no oh this is hard this is going to be annoying um token token change to set token if because if the token is blank don't set it okay if token equals equals don't do that does not equal this do that okay there you go that's fine I think this should work now there you go don't even ask me how I did that cuz I don't know okay slash um slash login okay wait go back here okay slash log out okay slash home nice okay slash login okay tim5 gmail.com going to keep typing Gmail nice nice very nice very nice okay sweet um oh yeah I'm a little bit tired but we got the Red Bull Angus hey Angus I remember you Angus Henderson you were on a bunch of my other streams I remember you man hey Tim been watching since 10,000 Subs in your first live streams thank you for all the tutorials and inspiration I'm 17 of my first offer congratulations man seriously congratulations I'm glad I could be of some help and thank you for supporting the channel means a lot thank you very much um nice sweet that's that's awesome to hear when was the last time you ate yeah I should probably eat something to be honest uh the caffeine's been keeping me not very hungry I'll order dinner at some point um yeah I'm just waiting for the donation so I can get some food guys come on best thing is when you fix something and not sure why and how yep exactly I love it I did not end up using typescript now okay so app.js is good rendering homepage now we got to make the homepage look half decent right and I want to add a um this here might have to move so that we can have a nice like like the router fine here actually let's do this um render uh cons to router equals this what's up Tim I'm learning python I'm following along with your touch projects I really enjoy the passion you have for coding you're an inspiration for me ke the gr thank you very much for the uh the live chat banic thank you for the five dollar man all right get some food right now okay I'm gonna get some soon I do need to take a quick break though someone's calling me uh I'm sorry guys too popular all right we're back okay I'll um I'll order some food just cuz you guys uh what do you call it you guys are asking me to um what do I want what should I eat is the question sorry I was getting a phone call there that's why I uh that's why I stopped the stream for a sec okay oh do I want uh see this is a problem I don't know what I should get oh I'm feeling Thai food yeah it's been decided already okay this place near me is really good what do I usually get okay fry fine egg noodles with Chinese vegetables water chestnut barbecued pork chicken and shrimp sounds good to me let's go with the chowman add to order VI order check out boom bust out the python Pizza ordering script that would be hilarious if I ordered it from there from Domino's I don't think I have a Domino's close to me though that would be so funny uh is there some reason you use Windows instead of Linux um honestly the reason I use Windows just because most people use Windows and it's easier to uh to use an operating system than most people are using right like 90% of people that are watching my tutorials are on windows so it just makes s or Mac but it like I'm not going to use Mac just cuz I can't build my own Mac or I could but like I can't get the kind of power I want in a Mac and so I use Windows and then I have a Mac you guys can actually you can't see it cuz I cut my webcam off but it's over there um anyways I have a dual boot into a buntu I just I don't know like video gaming like all that kind of stuff like it just doesn't work that well on a bun to like development sure but it's not that much better so okay my food is uh is being ordered right now I was going to use typescript with a setup which just too annoying so I figured just I'm not going to use it okay let me take take all this and let me return this and then we're going to return the function called to render router uh inside of a div that should work right good okay I need a nav bar um an M1 Mac is not more powerful than my PC I having an M1 Mac I can guarantee you uh that the my my PC is is more powerful you can't shove a 3090 into an M1 Mac okay I'm liking liking this one I don't want to search I want like a user I want this this one looks good okay boom got it yeah if you guys want my PC specs I'm always happy to flex on people with with my with my PC specs have a 3090 uh a ryzen 9 3900x UM 64 gigs of RAM and what else I don't know I have two two terab mvme ssds like the PCI 4 ones all water cooled I've got like 12 fans or something stupid um yeah and some like ridiculous motherboard too cuz when I was buying my PC was like just before all the opponent shortages but motherboards especially x570 boards were really out of stock so I literally spent ,000 on a uh Godlike motherboard MSI Godlike because that was the only one I could get that was better than like a $200 motherboard all the other ones that were like $300 $400 that I wanted to spend were out of stock so I had to go with that I didn't have to I could have waited but I didn't want to wait okay app bar nice control someone someone told me how to import this but I don't know and I got to find all the Imports now okay let's view the source code no show the full there you go that's what I wanted to see okay already have typography classes is not defined all right we can just uh copy their Styles that's that's fine too to okay oh did I not import make Styles there you go Control Plus space auto complete then select what you want control plus space isn't doing anything it's not working like control play oh wait loading yeah but it I don't know anyways didn't look like it was working make Styles oh I need the that variable oops there you go see this is what a pro professional programmer looks like copying and pasting and uh just just hoping stuff works look at this beautifulness look at this we've got the nav bar this doesn't do anything that's great we got news we got log in oh baby all right now obviously I don't want to say new I'm going to say code raser okay log in button need to surround this in a link where' my thing go no not homepage app now this needs to change based on if you're signed in or not slash I ordered food by the way guys it's on the way um I need something that tells me if I'm logged in that'll be token yeah that works none no because token could be okay I actually need to do something here thought process okay so I need to determine if the user's logged in now I could naively just check the token but that's not really going to work because if the token is wrong um then that means the user is not logged in so I need to check if the token is valid by sending an HTTP request so let's do that um okay so Con loged in equals no con log logged in set logged in equals use State false okay and then we're going to say if we're going to fetch say fetch to no that's not how you do it fetch to SL API slash validate token do then do then okay and then we want the options let's go here here here lock in no sign up nope homepage here okay options h then we'll say logged in actually we'll say if logged in no don't need those nice okay uh now we need an end point I guess that would be an off end point yeah would be okay this is pretty easy do this we can literally just do this at o. root validate token SL validate token at what's this damn thing this okay now it just won't even work if uh if you don't send the right token it's good okay and then Define validate undor token okay and then we will return logged in true 200 okay nice um now here views no here get yep get user note wrong page app this is options what are you guys saying psycho light a mystery man no one knows who psychite is I won't expose him make the website dark themed yeah I probably will I can change the styling after I really don't care about the styling if you haveen if you haven't been able to tell we've got five and a half hours left uh you can fetch the user data to check if the token is valid or not you will need that data later anyways that's true that is true but I would like to have a separate endpoint that just doesn't return anything just tells me if I'm logged in well it is very true what he was saying um okay you revealed password on world password day yeah oops okay now let's go to logged in question mark call in this Mark that sign up sign up wait no what am I doing uh sign out is what I want log out that should work now invariant failed you should not use Link outside a router oh damn it um really what I can't use Link outside a router oh that's why okay that's fine here that should work now nice oh it's all ugly uh okay let's log in nice log out boom let's go sign up guys look how look how amazing this website is have you ever seen anything like this I don't think so this thing doesn't do anything I'm going to have to remove that I keep doing this nice okay okay so that's all working that's that's pretty good I just need to make it so that this link doesn't look so ugly how do you no that's why actually is that going to make a difference looks a little better still kind of bad though and how do you make it so it doesn't I just want it to it I want it to be a button I want it to actually I want to actually see the button maybe I can do it the other way no then it will cut the text let's see let me try this made zero difference okay yeah literally zero difference okay let's go back to the other one all right how do you fast forward a live stream yeah funny one log out button doesn't change if the user logs out this should say log out right now too this is wrong it should say log out um H says long Lo in we are logged in okay let's log off there you go that works what do I refresh H interesting I don't think I need to run this every time I don't think I need to put token in here I think I can do this I think this will fix it unauthorized what oh it's because the state token's different than this token H token this going to get changed okay and then let's try this this is so bad I don't know what I don't know what I'm doing here it's too much thinking okay store token set token start token token then if token does not equal none okay should be fine error occurred what I guess I logged out or something oh okay male in nature log out refresh okay nice nice good got it sweet okay it's working now let me just pray it's not refreshing like a million times I don't think it is okay nice so now we have that let me move this stupid button that doesn't do anything on the toolbar uh icon button I I don't think this does anything delete that there you go yeah good that doesn't yeah it didn't do anything although that should expand something right like you go here menu icon button start can I put links here or something if I put something here let's see what icon button does toolbar because I want some links here okay so let's see how we do that let's see what you guys are saying you can't set State and use effect think you can I'm pretty sure okay let's see here set state in use effect looks like you can I think it's fine um yeah I think that's fine uh you guys ask some questions here when will you finish your degree uh that's undefined at the moment um y when let's see what you guys are saying wishing you good luck thank you thank you how much red bull this is the first Red Bull I've drank today okay H I always forget what I want to do excuse me got something stuck in my throat feels like at least um okay I think that's fine I want oh I want to put the links on there that's what I want to do why does this button not do anything like I don't get it why are you showing me this button if it literally doesn't work like what it's that got to be icon button right let's see icon button material UI show me images I don't want to read like this is useless okay let's see how we got this link here how are they floating this over to the right side just see what happens if I add another link it adds on that side honestly I think that's fine though I feel like it's okay if I have it on on this side I'll make them look better after so home does bring you home oh but what the heck oh when you go to slome is not defined that's why okay let's go just to slash okay then I want to show the user's name too in like a little profile thing okay guys I'm just going to go the washroom I'll be back okay for all right I'm back my food is wrapped there we are let's see here got a fortune cookie it's always nice okay I need some napkins one sec all right I will attempt to show you guys what I got damn they packed this to the brim we not be able to eat all this let's see can you guys I'm oh I'm it's I don't even know if I can pick this up uh oh this is time for camera number two can you guys see that perfect there you go now you can see the food I'm not going to leave this camera on but uh that is what I got uh how would I have leaked my address I don't think there's anything that says my address on it let's close that yeah the uh the thing doesn't show um what do you call it it doesn't show my on it so we good all right I don't know what we should do you guys can ask me questions if you want I'll answer them while I eat actually I'm going to turn the camera off uh I see that you're doing tech reviews uh um like the M1 Mac Mini how does the YouTube algorithm react to and are you planning on doing more of those I might do more of them I'm not really good like reviewer like I don't do reviews um so I kind of have to like learn how to do them right and even like the videography for them is like really hard so and YouTube algorithm man I don't know it's just if you do a review for something people are searching for then they'll find it but yeah I it's hard to ask anything else or say anything else about that are you ever going to make anything Mini Max based yes I actually I am planning on making like a chest some something with Mini Max Minimax is a cool algorithm I'll probably cover that um you have an an app on App make a okay I can't read that good night Tim good night thank you for tuning in make a new channel and call it Tim kbd I don't want to get sued so no thanks Tim I want to talk to you on Discord all right well whenever I'm on Discord maybe we'll chat um have you ever used Java FX I have actually what is you what is uh better for Android development Java versus cotlin and what's your opinion on Dart I like Dart dart's cool I used it when I did the uh the flutter tutorial uh I don't know what what is better Java or cin I think it's just like there there's pros and cons in both uh you still on break Tim I'm not necessarily on I'm just eating right now so I mean I'm not going to call it a break otherwise you're going to be like you said no breaks um because the stream's still running so I'm I'm saying it's not a break do you know how to SL want to learn rust I don't know rust but I would like to learn it might do a tutorial series on the future what do you think about Julia have you ever used it I've not used Julia are you still on break from uni yes I am have you done iOS appd and I I have never with Swift I did with Objective C but when I was really young when I was like 14 I made an IOS app it was it wasn't anything that like was on the App Store I just used it for myself if I rent a server can I host multiple websites on it yes yes you can cyber Dash says you have such amazing commitment it's incredible I'd stop after 10 a.m. well I appreciate that if I said I'm going to do 12 hour stream I'm going to do a 12hour stream that's way it works will I receive Xbox for free working on Microsoft no probably not you think goang is worthwhile learning definitely what music do you prefer honestly I just listen like top 50 recently I've been uh listening to like a lot of classic rock kind of getting uh I I just realized how much better music was back in the day than it is now I don't dislike the music now but like the old music is just so much better uh at least in my opinion hey Tim how can I be a good Dev like you any tips always keep learning never assume you know anything everyone you talk to has uh something they can teach you uh what's your words per minute I think with 100% accuracy maybe like 60 or 70 can you network with HTML I don't know what you mean by that motivation tips uh I would say just set goals like at least for me I kind of have goals that I want to work towards right and everything I do I kind of evaluate against those goals and say is this helping me achieve the goal right and you can come up with your own reasons for if it is or if it isn't helping you achieve it but that's a really good way to determine if you're spending your time wisely is if what you're doing is helping you achieve the things you actually want to achieve right how are you I'm doing good when can you consider yourself a good programmer whenever you want I mean everything's subjective relative um like you could be a good programmer at some things not at other things some people wouldn't even call me a good programmer right so it's completely it's really hard to answer that question I I have no idea why is in the chat I see no breaks in the description marketing scheme guys I I fooled you man this is so much food oh my God what if I finish Coating in the 10 hour mark I can tell you right now that's not going to happen webcam will be back soon I'm just eating a little bit right now um and then I'll turn it back on um what are you guys saying no worries Mi High um do a PHP tutorial never I'm just kidding maybe I will no I'm not live on Twitch I'll give you the uh the food cam here see food it's chowman Chia chain thank you Nathan appreciate that hi Tim I just want to say thank you for all your videos your tutorials were probably the biggest factor in me getting a job as Junior developer keep it up appreciate that congratulations on your job prologue tutorial oh my God man what year we do you have any tips for growing a smaller coding YouTube channel consistency and search engine optimization post a video every day if you're really serious about uh growing a YouTube channel literally you got to do kind of what I did it's harder now I'm not going toh say it's easy to do but it was easier when I started doing it like 3 or four years ago ago but I posted a video every day sometimes posting two videos a day for like a year in a row before I even had like 10,000 subscribers you can also go look at like more popular YouTubers or YouTubers that are like maybe have like 5K subscribers or 10K subscribers and see like what's doing well for them and then see if you can kind of do your own version of that that's what I do a lot of times the music's Linked In the description watch I'm going to get copyright strike if I get copyright strike I'm be so upset man it's probably going to happen do a 30 hour live stream yeah maybe one day that would be insane if I did a 30 hour live stream I don't even know what I would do there's no way I could code for 30 hours long how much are you getting working on Alo expert cannot disclose that but but obviously it's enough that I'm happy to work there I want to eat all this but it's just so much food it's also not easy to eat they pack so much stuff in this little box guess that's good though it's pretty cheap it's like 12 bucks do you need a computer science degree to get a real job absolutely not I've going offered so many jobs I don't have a computer science degree food rating give it a give it an eight it's pretty good not really a big food guy but tastes good I'm not still working on Microsoft no guys got five hours left in the Stream just about do I go to the gym uh sometimes not as much as I should I have a gym in my basement not like a huge one but enough to work out okay I'm going to take uh one more bite here and get back into it maybe I'll take a quick uh few minute break play a quick game of chess and then we'll continue I apologize that I've uh misled you with the no breaks but what I meant by that is the stream will not end unless my power goes out which happened okay let's one second I'm coming back I just I just don't want to leak uh my like chess credentials if I'm signing in I think I'm good all right okay I'm definitely starting to feel the wear of s hours now especially on stream it's one thing to work for 7 hours straight it's another thing to do it while talking on stream all right just going to recline the chair back a little bit you know relax a bit more move the microphone a little bit Red Bull Okay who wants to play me you guys can add me as friend anyone rated under 1300 I'll play I'm not going to play anyone that's higher than that I'll get destroyed I'm probably going to get destroyed anyways I'm so tired or not so tired but I'm tired okay if you guys drop your uh chest username in here I'll uh I'll pick someone you have to be rated um under 1300 and above let's say like 800 I'm not going to play anyone higher than 1300 I'm going to get destroyed if I play someone higher than 1300 my rating is just about 1,200 right now 1263 that could be a good game you want to play 32 I was going to play like a f minute game um I'm going to add someone okay drop if you guys are not R under 1300 I'm not going to play all right Jaden might be your lucky day here I'm gonna add you as a friend okay let me know if you get my friend request I'm going to give you about a minute a lot of you guys are adding me oh my God okay Jaden I'm talking to you where is he I lost him connect friends he did not add me back yet okay I'm going to go with someone else right uh aness add you friends oh okay he's online he's oh he's a thousand in bullet oh God okay let's play five minutes all right oh I forgot my Blitz rating is is way lower than my rapid rating okay that's fine gonna go with the English opening it's not my move I'm waiting for him to join that's why come on man you were selected smike sword's going to get a game here soon there you go okay we're going to go with the got the Pierz defense this is the annoying thing he could be stream sniping me he probably is stream sniping me so I can't really draw like arrows and stuff because the delay is not enough but he already messed up he already blundered unless he's playing some weird Gambit yeah he there's no way he knows what that is oh he's done he's taking way too long uh okay that's true he can see my preo I should be very careful not to preo I've got to play here but uh I think he might see it what do I look like a robot maybe I am who knows it's a f minute game this guy's taking way too long it's not even my move right now what is he G to do okay oh sneaky guy that's fine okay okay I'm going to beat him on time call on it right now this is annoying because I actually want to talk about the game and like what I want to do but I can't interesting on okay I don't like that there nice okay okay let's do that oh it's a blunder no it's not just kidding I can take that okay what does he have he can go here he can go here he wants to go there because then that's there could push that look like a decent move although that looks better by the way I'm I hope you don't think I'm good at chess because I'm really not that good man this guy's King is asking to be checked what what is going to happen if I go here oh I could go then I could go there too because you can't block that looks decent could also go for that I think that's a blunder because now I have that defended yeah he's going to lose okay that's fine just take that too okay nice now coming in for the kill he doesn't have any checks he's going to defend can he even defend if I go here he goes here no I can't do that I go here he goes here I go here no if I go here he can he can't he can take with Queen no can't go Pawn if I go here he can take I can capture um oh this decent move he's pinned someone said H to D1 yeah I probably should have put the uh sorry the a pawn or the a rook instead of the D Rook he's kind of screwed now he can't really move this yeah see what okay there you go this will work you go there I go there see I even have this Defender too yeah see okay there you go and now he's going to lose GG man good game it's fun I'll play another one at some point I solid okay that's enough chess that fun I can play chess all day man that's why I got to stop if I if I play another one I'm just going to keep playing all right gg gg good game man I didn't realize you were uh I I totally forgot about the difference between Blitz rating and Rapid rating it was a good game though nice all right uh let's keep coding now I'm distracted I'll play uh like if the stream ends or if I take another break I'll play someone else in chess I think a FIV minute game is fine because that's 10 minutes in total uh and I moved pretty fast in that game oh I'll definitely stream rocket League I've been playing rocket League a fair amount I'm not very good at Rocket league but I like it it's a fun game okay we do need to do this I I want to make something more than just like this you know we got to do something so that I can actually have something to show at the end of the stream okay home works log out Works go back to home erer please try signing in okay but then it shows log out but the log out brought me to log in I go to home I think that's cuz it's not refreshing H okay let's see be here if the token doesn't change but the token should change um where's log out okay we going to go to log out this is annoying oh this is what I could do set token and we got to pass it through the props though set it set it to empty okay nice and then go to up S and pass through set token boom see I did okay great oh no that's confirm email okay should work now see there you go now it works boom got it all right okay now the fun stuff let's make something let's let's go homepage and on the homepage let's show a button that says join race start coding race or something or like we'll do a description of what the app is and then I will um uh what do you call it have some button that says like join race and then it will bring you to a room the room will use sockets um okay all right what do you guys saying here okay not much 373 people still watching very very impressed okay we're going to do some hard coding here for a few minutes um before I just keep testing stuff so let's have a button button will join room yeah let's do that do I have button no I don't have button okay let's import button uh where's where's button button button where would be one be log in button okay actually first before I do that I want to show the user's name and stuff um okay let's just grab this button want to display the user's name on the Navar I can't do that from the homepage though which is where I have the data log in I want to show their wpm and everything um okay let's go to app yes I guess theoretically this could get the user's data which someone else was saying rather than going logged in just get the user data and if that works that works okay excuse me uh so if they're logged in yeah that would make sense to do wouldn't it well we can do both we can check if their token is valid and then we can call it's kind of redundant but it's fine we're going to do that we're going to say con get user data because then we can pass that through to the homepage okay yeah that works um okay let's just stop and think for a second so I want the user's data I want to displayed on the nav bar the only way to display on nav bar the way I've done this so far is to display it um here through app however however if I'm getting it from the homepage then I can't display it here unless I use a call back I don't want to use a call back so I should get the data here and pass it to the homepage yeah and then the homepage can display it if it hasn't and that way I don't have to store it in the state of the homepage I would uh simply store it in the props that would be better so let's change that and then there and then here I don't have to do all this crap I can do it in the other one and then I can just check if they um have a username or email and I can show the error if they don't that makes sense okay so let's do that let's take this and then let's just check simply here if props do username does not equal equal or does equal equal empty and props actually it would be undefined I guess if I didn't pass it right or no it just yeah empty string okay and then props do email equals equals empty and we're going to say set air please log in to view this page okay nice uh okay solid then go back to app token window look storage okay get I don't want to show this though there set error actually don't care to show the err oh no I should show the a okay that's fine and then we'll go here we'll say get user data okay what's the problem oh that's what it is compiling set emails not defined oh I forgot the to put the state here um okay alss say con sh I don't need ID that's fine email username okay probably H token okay this is where it's getting tough here um hm let's see problem is I know I'm going to need the ID of the user actually let me check this can I identify a user by their token I think I can let me go to fuse yeah current user oh easy okay yeah light so I don't I just need the token I don't need anything else that's fine okay app username email and then that's fine set username set email do I have error I don't have an error here I need to put an error here error in the main yeah okay error app making progress guys I'm happy with the progress so far so underneath the app bar where we'll put that and then okay set errors not defined yeah we'll do that in here say const error set error equals you state okay um should be okay now unexpected token name classes isn't defined name submit press is not defined where wait what it's in homepage. JS homepage what did I have this button for oh I haven't that's why it's nothing ex used and yeah that's why classes okay everything else I think is fine unexpected token I think I fixed that validate token was not validated that's fine whoa what oh that's the button okay that's fine I'll I'll change that after if you go to home why isn't it showing anything log in home log in home should show me the error message email username oh return that's why else here just do this turn response. Json oh no I needed that okay say error I think the music stopped it did get to restart okay let's go here to where do we put that button that would be in homepage CH this to join a race nice okay ums what's wrong here El return oh it's cuz I forgot the if okay that's good now okay nice fresh home home why is it not showing me the thing oh it's cuz I'm not calling that that's why okay no get user data I am calling that user data data oh maybe it's cuz I am logged in h let's see here no not slog out log out see like it should be showing me this this thing here homepage there's no error in the homepage makes sense should be an or there you go please log in to view this page nice okay got it uh that's why it was undefined okay now let's go to app.js and what are we showing homepage props email equals email username equals username nice all right 360 people still watching thank you guys for hanging around okay nice nice nice now what did I want to do H okay I pass that through let's log in now nice nice join race obviously doesn't do anything let go to home still works log out boom nice don't have an account sign up already have an account log in get password okay nice uh sweet so that that is all working now I want to show the username to the right of that with little icon uh okay let's see here components button let's see here terial UI person icon nice how do I get my logo uh I paid someone to make it on Fiverr I'm not doing a phone game I'm doing a code racer so if you've heard of typing racing before type type racer before I'm making that but with code so you're going to race the type at a block of code we've got math four and a half hours left I don't think I'm going to finish this but I'm trying to be optimistic because I still have to do sockets although four and a half hours to do sockets and live updates it shouldn't be that hard a lot of it's like small tweaks now that I'm doing uh once I start writing all of that that's like all new code so I can get a lot done pretty quick what did I want to do though here one and two on this on is this where this is is yeah to the right of this I wanted to show this okay icon button matal UI man this thing just I want an example I just want to Dam example okay surely they've got it somewhere here icon I don't want the API I want the actual thing um probably under button button okay yeah there you go boom sweet that's exactly what I want okay I didn't want to do that I just want to view it okay button okay don't need that not save icon it's going to be person icon and this is going to be username uh yeah that's perfect okay sweet we replace this okay and oh other way around oops lock out and then when you click this button I want it to display more stuff okay so let's remove this link I need slash button nice yeah why is that not working oh except that okay let's try this now there you go got it then when you click that I want it to show the um I'm going to make it a different color I want it to show like log out and settings okay great uh now make that an expandable button you have any of those like something like that right um let's see here material UI drop down button react menu oh amazing okay let's just copy all that what I do wrong oh okay now change this button to that and then go look at this that's what this is right open menu okay oh crap I just wanted that nice okay uh area controls going to say person menu person menu uh handle click handle close I don't have these okay yeah we don't need to do anything with this right now wow can you guys hear that car damn someone's driving super fast down my street that's like 50 kilometers an hour it's the speed limit I need to import this see what you guys are saying don't you think you're focusing too much on UI rather than typing racer yes but I just want to make like the basic stuff work here while it's easy to do this and then I will fix uh stuff after uh anchor eel what is that oh I guess I guess I need that okay uh God okay uh let's set this set itow here handle menu okay now I got to find all this again okay click okay okay handle menu and then handle whenu click okay nice Uh something's wrong react is not defined really okay boom work work there you go boom profile my account log out let's go that's exactly what we wanted we'll uh just make the log out button work and then we're good to go okay so now where was that here handle menu close e value inspect just zero I guess it doesn't tell me what I clicked e. Target maybe let's see if that gives me anything it does okay I want I need a value for them so I know which one is clicked um ah I can do this click uh with say profile ah this this is perfect this is the end point to go to great and then here make this end point do I have history no I don't have history is history and then boom okay now we need to just import history that's from react Dom okay got it sweet use history should be defined save Fresh canot re property push him on to find straight to push end point that should work H what am I doing wrong history use history close that okay don't know why that's not working use history should work oh is it because it's in the no that's that shouldn't be the problem how is history undefined I don't understand why that's undefined like what this should work I'm so confused this works in all the other ones why can I not use it in this function H history is undefined why don't I just do this no way it's going to be undefined now react component names must start with an uppercase letter damn it so I can't do that why why don't you work can I repr property push of undefined I don't think endpoint has a problem with it shouldn't just this is confusing though cuz that works in other places like if I go log at boom cons history equals use history just works then I push it right there the same thing um what if we do this it's not the Endo this problem guys it's that history is undefined but I don't know why history is undefined cuz I've defined it right like what shouldn't be undefined see it's saying history's undefined but I don't know why let's look it up H oh I think I know why that's why it's because I initialized this before I initialize the first render for the uh the router um so I have to say let history equal null and then oh will this even let me do this though let's see here here history equals uh use history that should work I can't use it there can I okay how do I just like redirect then or something um without history h i could just make it so when you press those buttons you yeah why don't we just cuz I guess I can do this and then I can also redirect them okay let's just do this like we can do multiple things we can do this okay redirect react think I can just unclick run the function you can render a redirect component does that do it let's see what do you guys saying react router I can return a redirect he straight up push yes or that's what I'm trying to do it's not working CU I don't have access to history H I could do window.location but that's not good yeah I could I can use windows. replace but I don't want to do that because then it's not going to um pass fill the props so let's just do that's like a yeah that's a sketchy way to do it so I'm going to do I'm just going to do a link inside of here hoping it doesn't mess my styling up and then we can remove this that we don't need to okay link okay oh what the heck okay my count to count what's wrong here what am I what have I done wrong why is this not working oh it's F to log out and L out okay I hate how these look um but for now they're fine we we can fix styling after okay so now this should work if I go here press log in out yeah it does work if I go oh and then I yeah and then I'm not logged in so I can't press that awesome okay great okay let's let's do the code racing thing now uh so Tim 5 at mailinator.com 123 log in nice okay I don't want to log out when I press join erase we're going to have to use sockets so now time to learn flask sockets flask sockets okay into flash socket documentation I actually think this is pretty easy to use I remember this being pretty easy to use oh oops it already had it for me pip install floss socket let's go to requirements okay now we have to initialize sockets I run it in socod Oh okay that's fine okay let's just try this what oh sweet got it okay um so why did it recreate the database I don't think I deleted the database anyways that's fine for now okay so now this is how I connect to the socket in JavaScript socket. emit my event I am connected okay let's make a new component main UI new file going to be racer. Js we'll say racing room or we'll say room room. JS yeah that's good uh room rename JS now the fun begins yes guys I'm tired it's been almost eight hours as soon as we hit 7.m so 10 minutes going to be eight hours we have four hours left but we got to keep going there's no stopping uh let's go want this we don't need like a lot of this okay don't need that don't need that don't need that it's probably just faster to type this out now I'm thinking about it but that's fine okay good uh we're going to call this room say this is room okay div we do want the room code we're going to say cons room code is equal to props match. prams do room code okay it's going to be props let's go to app let's now make another route okay exact this is going to be room colon room code uh we don't need a set token no we don't and this will be a room like that okay we're going to say from Port room from slash main UI slash room do slash okay room export default room show the room code okay room. JS oh it needs to be in capitals okay compiling nice let's go to slash room slash test nice shows me the room code test one two 3 test one two3 sweet okay so now that's how we can join a room now what we want to do is when you press that button it will uh put you into a room so here we go look at this the application must serve a page to the client that loads the socket.io library and establish connection okay let's take this put this in our index uh script should go at the bottom I think okay it's fine and then whoa so that looks like it's working let's go into our room let's go use effect go IO how the heck is it going to get IO I can Define use effect first IO not defined um how do how am I going to do that uh use sockets react okay can I just do this it has a it has a socket thing no that's different no iio Doon how do I get IO socket.io client nice okay thank you uh Muhammad let let's go new CD I already have a socket see thing I want to connect to a socket create a file socket. JS okay let's try this oh call this new file or new folder context man people just drive their cars so loud okay uh use socket contacts and provide value can I so I have to wrap everything in this okay JS oh someone subscribed what why is it showing me that oh no it's going to spam one sec let me fix this done okay I think I think that fixed it progress we're get we're getting there I'm working on sockets right now once I have the sockets working then we just have to Define kind of the protocol and then um we will see we'll be able to actually like render a block of code and then have uh the live progress back and forth it'll be cool we're actually getting we're made we made really good progress we have four hours left and I had probably about an hour during the stream of just dead time cuz like breakes plus um crashed cuz cuz I had my power go out plus the beginning was just really hectic okay I need to wrap all this though in this and then I need to end socket provider need to import this import child why do I wait what is that just like a oh okay that was just that's just like boiler plate I don't need that see if this works be impressed if this works should probably be do SL context error resource busy fail to compile can't resolve oh it's cuz I'm in app right now app is in components oh I didn't realize I put app in components be dot dot slash there you go should work you look like you're dead inside yeah that's funny can't resolve config what what did I do here oh it's cuz I don't have one of those socket URL um this was saying what okay I did this before I'm just going to look at my chat web app oh why didn't I do this it's in here totally forgot that I had this this working in here uh application you up high I have some socket thing oh I didn't do it here I did it in here that's where I did it um okay socket.io socket.io Doon okay and then for the JavaScript being static here you go plus 5,000 nice all right let's try this io's not fine react's not fine from react okay and a where did I put that room yeah I don't need this okay nice nice okay looks like that's working but the question is is it actually going to work okay so now now you can use socket and any child component okay this looks like a really good good template I'm just going to steal this okay yeah we can override this why do I room code twice not what I wanted oh I deleted this socket thing damn it it's not what I wanted to do there you go that's what I wanted to do okay okay where's user ID um I don't need that this will be token um room code well let's think about thiso this is tough okay room URL out them in the room should be connected okay I'm kind of doing this a bit backwards um yeah four more hours left guys going to have another caffeine dose soon okay boom okay it's saying use W there okay great that's great or cookie if token oh perfect okay guys I'm going to take a quick break just going to go wash him I'll be right back all right we back okay I'm working on sockets yeah sockets are um not particularly easy easy here I'm going to go back to what I had before this is fine what I'm going to do is join the socket from the uh room page where are you joining the socket when you go to the room you should already be okay this is going to be tough what I'm trying to figure out is how do I connect users in some type of room I need users to kind of get filtered to some room that has some ID they need to be then redirected to that room and they need to join the socket so the thing is do I connect them to the socket once they join the room or do I connect them to the socket then have them join the room H so let's think here rooms user join they get assigned to a room then they should get redirected to that room connect them to the socket return the room send the room I don't know okay let's just see if we can connect them to the socket first of all we're going to go to homepage we're going to set up something here okay here we'll connect to the socket saying this is as easy as it is okay context okay okay we'll do that and then okay do this so on join room is when I want to do this actually oops want to admit user online want to then on join request accepted handle invite accepted set join true and then here let's just pop something up that says if we're joined or not go rather than this we'll say oh the way we can know is if we're joined then we can go to a room yo Nick white what's up welcome to the stream yes sir Saka J I have no idea how to uh to do this but we're we're figuring out as we go here verified person yeah wow big deal first one of the Stream okay so once oh I need to use call back hook okay um we'll just do something that says if they're joined or not we won't worry about redirecting right now I'll just say joined is that my State's called yeah it is okay so to AIT handle join chat send join request handle invite accepted M handle invite accepted handle invite accepted join room okay should be good which playlist are you listening to I'll uh I'll link it here uh send it in the chat there you go okay Violet summer sorry sir you're gonna have to get banned can uh Muhammad can you take care of that for me Violet summer thank you very much Nick white for the $5 Super Chat appreciate that with the helpful uh coding here sock. on key press broadcast opponent key press very nice very nice that's funny okay let's continue There You Go look I even have the fancy animation showing up okay yeah if you can't tell eight hours it's it's taking the toll now okay let's just say joined question mark colon and let's see if anything actually happens failed to compile can't resolve contact socket in main UI oh that's why because I'm in main UI dot dot slash that should work now can't resolve so main UI context is back One Directory level two three that's fine let's try fingers crossed H socket context so I'm in components manui I need to import this socket. JS although can I use it through the props or something use context okay socket context if I go to context socket you know what would make everything a lot easier if I just just put it in components let's just do that okay delete and now let's go and fix all our uh all our Imports here docket that should work from app yeah that would work but from homepage should be dot dot slash no am I doing the pathing wrong it's very possible I'm writing the path here wrong can I resolve dot dot socket context oh it's cuz yeah that's why user ID is not defined boom that's working now where do I have user ID we're just going to send the token here um okay let's get the token say cons token equals where's do my starring the token window. local storage okay and then we'll pass the token here nice okay that looks like that's working now when I press the button I'm expecting it to crash is anything happening access has been blocked by course policy no control access origin headers present on the requested resources okay whoa what the heck the problem is that for some reason I can't access I don't even know what this means it's been blocked by course policy let's just look this up okay ah damn it okay this is annoying um I did get flas cores what's actually happening is it's saying that I can't send I can't connect to a socket that's not the same origin because I have a different front end different back end and I want to connect to a back end socket not front socket um can I just Define let's see someone sent me a link site let's try that socket. server oh I probably did that in Python that would be here Su at server this is different than what I have though I think maybe this is passible let's see restarting that looks like that worked can refresh this no way okay that actually did fix the problem thank you very much Muhammad you are you're being a big help today really appreciate it okay um so that did work now obviously nothing's happening but join should I should be getting something it's showing nothing uh that's homepage there you go okay nice now we need to set it up on the back end for now I'm going to do it in a bad way in here do this okay um now going to set up the emit event should not have closed that code base I had actually I can't do this on here okay let's do this okay this event is going to be what do we have minut we're getting somewh guys decent progress internal server error oh because server's not running okay always mess this up login wait refresh that did something something happened why is it pulling I don't know why it's pulling the actual game has not been implemented we're at we're at the point where I can now do that join a race um it looks like it's doing something let's um run not working open this back okay okay so it is running just not doing anything it's admitting that is user online the one that I did yeah user online H so it should be uh they should be getting it though it's not though doit have you eaten yes I have eaten I bet I'm sending it to the wrong place let's go to context do domain should work is the port 5000 yeah it is right H how do do I just connect to this I don't really have any idea what's going on this is uh the emit is not working Sako polling join a racee um okay run API let's maybe this isn't saved that's possible it's not working I have an idea let me go here I don't think I need that h maybe I need to like connect did I do this value equals socket I think so H this is so annoying the damn socket I don't know why it's not connecting socket. emit um okay let me just see if I can do it in the more vanilla way first going to do in vanilla Jaz and see if I can get it to work let me look at something here you guys can't even see what I'm looking at let's go here website response I know but I just want to see if I can get it to work um oops okay um where is this okay because I could write this in here like IO how the heck do I get IO how to get access to IO that's the question um to iio I can do this right can't resolve oh maybe this is what I need to install maybe it's just socod uh no let's see once I get sockets working then we're rolling hopefully the actual like typing racer part shouldn't be that hard it's just uh trying to get these damn sockets to work come on work work maybe I know I should only connect to it one time but I uh I don't want to connect until they log in and I just want to see if unexpected use of location damn 8 hours in already Elsa just realized it's past midnight for me I'm a dip good luck with the project Take Care thank you Steven appreciate that um homepage 25 yeah okay that would be why where's where is location oh that's why io. connect is not function I will use the uh the real thing I just want to see if I can get this to work wait IO why can't I even Define the the port to connect to io. listm Port once you've done that you also need to tell s start listening for clients oh that's defining the server how do I connect on the client this is what I want looks like I can do this let's get rid of all this okay let's go socket H okay man this depressing don't need that I just want to connect to the damn socket it shouldn't be this hard socket like the socket's not doing anything is the problem um if I go here Local Host 5,000 okay great I back exported it it's saying this is all you got to do okay flask socket server with react client try uninstall socket IO client and reinstall no way if that works I'm be so upset is this what it was no it was the other way around right so client socket.io it's not it's Local Host 5,000 yeah I'm definitely tired guys let's see if this one works like when it connects to the socket I should get something no something should happen why don't you use WSL uh I mean that doesn't really matter right now yeah my Tic Tac to toad tutorial used uh sockets and it worked no way guys it was really the version of socket iio look it actually just worked it just connected and I got the run here in the server oh my God these are the kind of problems in programming where you just want to shoot yourself after it's like really like you did everything you could and it turns out it's the version of the thing that you installed that just doesn't work oh my God man okay well it's working now so I'm not as crazy as I thought I was cuz now it's working yay damn damn it man freaking stack Overflow that had two likes I got to give I got to donate to that guy whoever whoever helped me do that oh my God standard programming problems okay let's take a quick breather here and just uh appreciate that yeah that was T tag party yeah claps in the chat claps in the chat please 320 people left yeah I want to show you guys the damn graph of people watching this makes sense it's about my uh mental health State too kind of follows it this is why you write your own sockets nah no no no no no no it's just that's yeah I don't want to do that um okay all right so at least the communication is now working which is very very good so uh development server is disconnected boom connects okay so once we connect that's very good so I want to connect when you press that button and then I want to redirect uh so once I'm connected I have that context so I can just use it somewhere else which is great um let's redirect though let's go I need history history. push and then I want to push to the room which is going to be returned from this socket here uh it's going to say join room or something that's okay great we've got progress now um so what I want to do is use history okay import use history from react router Dom say cons history equals use history that's good okay and then we're going to go to slash room slash Plus Code cons code equals that for now okay um yeah then we'll redirect to room okay so push that button it's going to say soccer.on handle invite need go and handle invite okay join true cons code history. push room code and then we need to get the code so this a used call back but they should get some stuff I know super descriptive should get some stuff it's not what I want I want to that's dangerous game opening up history I'm going to do it over here okay history although to be fair everything I've been looking up is just code but let's see here course errors recently closed where's this guy's article that that was really good I need to find it history is this it yeah boom I think this is it nope not it okay um this is it found it Tim can we get a data science or machine learning without a college degree um yes I think so okay good idea to do that he's doing that use effect he's doing the use effect how do I receive data here though I'm going to imagine it's in the prams use call back Json console.log Json okay because right now I'm just sending messages I want to go to this this socket. admit go data test okay let's go here tell me I have this open two times the thing I was looking for I literally have open okay oh man okay um let's see if that works boom got it sweet oh yeah re redirected room I didn't want to do that so I need okay I needed to give me a room now um I guess I can thr the rooms in memory because if the server crashes then it's fine you can just the the rooms can crash oh man this thing is going to break so easily I am not going to be able to host this probably it's just going to be too insecure um okay I want to St in session so okay so here's the problem guys let's create rooms with two people people actually there's something in socer to make rooms we're going to look at that first let's just go to flly socker almost at 9 hours in guys GM got it okay as Anno as bad as it is I'm going to do all the socket stuff in here we can refactor later but I want to get something working this is such a mess I'm going to look at this tomorrow and it's just going to be crazy my cat's here fra what's up you going to come on the desk unfortunately I can't show her to you guys on the ground Tim did you have dinner yes I did eat I didn't eat that much but I I ate enough I I find when I'm on like a ton of caffeine which I am right now uh it's hard to eat but these are these are uh you know once in a while I don't do these very of often so I appreciate the concern guys but I'll be all right fine un I'm going to have a nice sleep tonight okay no the cat's gone she left me okay join room room send um join room okay okay data room leave room send room send username has left room okay so now I need a way to send what room that they should join um oh Sak D joins nice catch there thank you chat um okay so I need a way to determine what room user to joinan do it in session no I can't do it in session um to create a room and then allow someone to join it I think that I can do it in memory it's probably really bad to do it in memory but I'm going to do it in memory set rooms equals this oh actually say next underscore room equals one okay now when you join next room inore roomal zero is this going to work no way this is going to work could store it in the database rooms find a room that only is one person H do you ever have coffee yeah I have coffee sometimes but it's kind of like I don't know right now it just feels late for coffee okay I actually need to put these somewhere else now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to do a bit of refactoring here no I'm not I'm not uh I'm not almost done okay I want to set up all the socket iio stuff in a I think I can run API cuz I need access to the database and a bunch of other stuff too create app okay you know what because this is going to be hard to do right now I'm just going to say room code equals one and we're just gonna have everyone join room one for right now um okay yeah and I don't really care what they send me here oh they're sending me a token I have to validate their token actually um to make sure that's right because if they send me an invalid token I can't let them join so I need this just going to go in run API can I do this is this going to work no it's not H validate token token um confirm token okay think I can do this okay let's just let's close everything let's start from the beginning for a second so that I can focus on what I need to focus on okay let's go here let's say from API import app okay from api. token import confirm token okay now let's take the token and make sure that's confirmed before we emit anything back so we actually don't let them join unless the token is confirmed okay so I'm going to say if actually we'll say if token is in Json man I'm typing in JavaScript now oh my God uh then we'll say token is equal to json. get token none uh actually no we just do this Jon token else socket. emit no token received okay and return say if token else socket. emit token invalid and there you go okay let's see if this works we'll do the same thing here so this this could be a decorator no I don't think so actually I can just do this can I let's see token can I apply decorator to see and then here if not okay oh my God I'm get so many messages okay join same thing here okay okay so then the room do we need username yeah we'll pass username and room okay let's go to homepage handle invite accepted okay then we're going to say the same thing here socket. ammit join pass the token joinan request accepted what are we going to emit here I guess we're just waiting for something um send it's going to send this to what's connected how do I make it oh that joins the user in the room and then he will accept anything okay I should have done the sockets first how do I listen for like an event how do I listen for anything so I'm joined the room and then I want to just accept anything okay let's see so once I'm connected to the socket how do I like accept anything thing that's the question um socket. on but I'm not waiting for like a specific event I'm waiting for anything you know what I mean I've been going for nine hours by the way um so I've join the room that's good and then it's going to send something so code is not defined where is that homepage. JS handle invite accepted let's see here join request accepted okay and then say we could I I can just do it a different way I'm going to send see because this is it's sending to anyone in the room but I don't know how to just accept anything this is the problem here I know how to listen for an event but I don't know how to listen for just anything right and it's not admitting it's admitting just a message cuz this isn't show really return okay that's fine could I say socket. listen or something let's see socket iio client react listen to all events on any okay let's try that um reest handle handle invite accepted on and need join this needs to give me room I'm going to join with the token okay this going to say token colon token room colon room room colon Json room okay event name where do I have code see what are you guys saying yeah that might work okay log in oh this isn't running shouldn't this melor no it's not working what come on work was working before maybe it's cuz this is running no maybe it's cuz the token's not valid that's probably why let's try that I bet that's the case name oh like what am I doing guys oh my God wrong language yeah I'm a little bit stuck right now not valid Ah that's the case it tell me my token's not valid why is my token not valid my token should be valid how do I check if the damn token is valid gave me something in here okay let me go to confirm token me see what this is equal to maybe it's not even making that far maybe it's cuz I'm not sending the token oh that's probably why yeah I know why uh CU I'm just sending it like that I'm not sending it like this that's probably why okay let's try now socket is not find socod false not valid H okay we're getting we're getting somewhere just need to make sure the token is valid um this question is do we need to validate the token I don't think we need to validate the token to be honest with you I'm going to go without validating it for now just get rid of this cuz now that I'm thinking of it I don't you don't really need to be validated cuz you can play as a guest it's not going to matter join a race true socket. on any is not a function damn it why is that why homepage give me some auto complete come on what even is this um where's the typo line 14 where listen for any socket event socket client react this wasn't helpful no way anything's going to work I don't believe it I want to just listen for anything asteris no way I'm going to try that I don't think it's going to work let's try it that's fine console.log okay that worked it didn't emit anything back though user name is not valid that's why okay oops I don't have username oh be props data room a past room maybe it's looking for it on this one let's see let's just pass room okay we're looking for a room to join on join so let's save go here use online send token join request accepted handle invite Json Json room join sock down on data constant log data okay let's see here refresh join in true send is not defined assume we need this too yes send there you go that's why okay let's try this progress okay I'm joined let's see if this works join okay dope that worked okay I'm going to take a quick break guys just going to run to the washroom I'll be right back caffeine's really get me go here we back got a chocolate bar too I'm doing a typing racer clone called code racer okay join so I did join the room going to say this is the event name let's see what this send thing does it sends the same event back okay this could be good this could be very good let's see joining room let's try this true okay that didn't seem to work how many keyboards have I broken not enough okay socket Doon maybe I need to use this used call back thing I just want it to return something to me I just want I just want to get something back maybe if I Adit it that'll work let see once I figure this out we're golden Adit my response okay let's try this oh what the heck I'm doing in the wrong thing oops boom let's go that worked okay that's how you do it so I it is you have to an event I have to admit not send now if someone else joined the stre that should happen too let's actually see if this okay now we can really test this um let's open this again a new browser oh am I even going to be able to test this I'm going have to do it in Incognito I think let's go to oh it shows I'm log in um let's make an account Tim test app mailinator.com test test test sign up verification link has been sent to your email okay let's go to do I I think I have mailat open actually oh my God this is going to have so many emails at it uh there you go okay confirm boom confirmed log in okay got it sweet um wait wait oh my God I signed in on the wrong thing it's okay do this okay now inspect inspect let's see this data okay boom sent it awesome let's go I don't know why it sent so many times though like oh my god look how many times is sending it what why is it sending it so many times um maybe I've joined the room like 12 times uh let's see what it's like compounding like every time I do it it's sending more oh it's cuz I'm joining the room multiple times that actually is why because when I press join it's joining again um if I'm already joined it shouldn't join again um yeah that would be why um okay so I need to redirect once I join makes perfect sense okay that's good um so rather than just console. logging this will return wait join room on the join event I don't actually need to do anything there I want to admit joinan I want to join let's see if it says joinan then the thing is when I get that response back means I joined successfully so let's see um unjoin data no I think I just redirect to the room cuz now I'm joined this should work if I'm not not I think I just redirect to the room I don't think I need to wait for a response for that I think I just admit hey let me join I'm already connected the socket and it should allow me to join um that's going to there's going to be a problem with that but it's fine we'll use it for now history. push slash plus just un room okay let's do it um that should work then and then in the room oh we're moving now guys let's go to room take this homage what I want socket then here we'll set up an event handler yes say socket. on joyan handle user joint say const user join equals this log user joined take some Json in here okay handle user joined on there and then need to remove that okay uh use context okay Rim code that's good okay homepage should work um hey bro you good I'm all right we've been going yeah like someone said 9 hours 18 minutes almost at 12 refresh okay refresh join a race boom user joined join a race that didn't get the event though they're both in room one um user joined event was accepted should have said it in the other one though or should it have should have I'm admitting to join event should have happened in the other one do I need to use that damn call back thing maybe I'll just use it cuz I used it here and it seemed like it worked um uh okay Hamza thank you appreciate that I don't think that's going to make a difference so now I'm not connected to the socket which is the only problem if you go to a room and you're not connected I should actually yeah that's going to be a problem uh okay let's just go home go home join race join race should have got that message handle user joins when I redirect them do they get disconnected from the socket kind of confused uh why is that happening because it was working before okay let's just go here maybe we don't need to do it in a separate page we could just do it here set joint equals true and then if they joined don't have them join again actually this should happen after oh Nick white quit algo expert damn that's unfortunate man going to miss you ah yeah come work for me and help me set up sockets Nick okay home let's not redirect set join true leave this though M join then we'll do the on join where are you connecting SL defining the socket I'm using the context just remove this for now us joined okay user joined whoa why is it happening so many times I don't want to admit this if I've joined I'm setting it to be joined maybe because there's all these like things still going on um maybe because there's like seven call backs attached to it or something stupid it like keeps adding oh that's why it adds this Handler like a 100 times oh my God that's why that makes sense I have to do it in the uh in the use effect there you go now it should work fresh fresh join join boom happened once got it join join join yeah it's going to keep joining I don't know why it keeps joining though it shouldn't be joining multiple times cuz join is equal to True why is it setting again when I press it why is it is it setting joining the use effect is rendering again maybe I'm say if not join okay why is it happening so many times it's because of the event handlers 100% that's got to be what it is handle invite accepted I probably I can admit it in here that's fine AIT joined but I'm already joined why is this not working yeah I'm setting up socket rooms right now it's like kind of working but like not really um it just keeps calling this thing so many times I don't get it handle user joined join Rim maybe it's cuz this doesn't use the call back thing cuz it's submitting and then saying on this probably shouldn't be in here oh it's admitting user online I'm in I'm such an idiot oh my God I don't need to do this a 100 times these can all get set up in here they don't need to be set up 25 times okay um there you go now it should work probably not though let see I've done this exact thing what you should maybe do is have a custom URL for each room yeah that's actually exactly what I'm doing I am having custom URL for each Tri I'm just trying to connect to the socket first user joined but now it's not working on the other one H okay uh on join handle us join maybe maybe you could local storage a check maybe disable once the user joined yeah I think I found the the root of the problem here um if not joyan allow joyan says joyan that should omit or emit back um user online okay so it's we'll send the user online and then onjoin Quest handle invite accepted if not joined it lets you join this is what's not working um we're getting close here we're getting very close what do you mean maybe I can disable once the user joins I I have a I'm doing I've actually gotten like a decent progress right now but for some reason when the user joins it's admitting um it's not sending to the other one that is joined handle invite accepted handle user joined like let's just try this refresh okay join oh on join that was connected to the socket wait refresh so these are connected to the socket they haven't disconnected oh I need to send the disconnect it socket dot that's why oh my God okay socket. Amit what's the server look like I'll show you in a second Nick socket. Amit leave that's all I need to actually send there okay so if I refresh this it should leave right it should unbind me leave leave okay join see it's saying this guy joined which is good that that's supposed to happen um if I refresh this join is false boom there you go now it worked but watch this they both go to join true if I press this they both go to true but that's not that's not true okay if I go to homepage because I'm setting joined no matter what it needs to only be if I haven't joined already so it's set joined and then it receives the join request because it's admitting it back to everyone in the room handle user join should just do that join room if not join socket. admit okay um TR I'm going to restart the server and I think I can get it to work but this should leave handle use joined let's close this okay I'll sign in ready they both go to true cuz they're both getting the join request accepted handle invite accepted handle invite accepted set join true so they're both receiving that well how is it how are they both oh cuz when I press join room one of them joins user online joins but why is the other one are they the same thing is this not Incognito or something these need to be separate let's do this maybe they're the same freaking thing no these are different accounts this is not joined spe there you go now it worked fresh not joined join I guess that kind of makes sense but if I go if they're both here though like let's log out uh oh when I log out I got to leave the server too for sure yeah definitely although it should leave let's just do that in in there quickly though um socket where's my log out page okay fresh see it's saying it's not joined but it's still connected to the socket I think um I want actually an event for when I leave the thing so it tells me when I when I leave um when you click the button the event gets propagated by the server to all users all clients will handle it yes um I know that okay set join invite accept set join if not join set join yeah I mean it doesn't matter we can do that anyways I have eaten yep I have eaten guys don't worry I oh I'm still got to finish my chocolate bar here oh do I need to pass the yeah okay let's go you sound fun oh oh the room damn it that's not going to work how do I leave a room if I don't know what room I'm in oh this is so confusing and you just send events to the server right from the room let's see the leaving and joining should be handled on the server yes it is handled on the server um but it's just like it is handle on the server this is just telling me when someone else leaves or someone else joins get room ID okay ignore that for a second is there like a socket like hard disconnect or something where's Json not to find homepage yeah because I don't have the room so it joins me in a room but I need to know the room it's okay for now can I just when I'm on the room page I'll the room thing um oh you can use socket. leave oh dope all right socket. leave it is I don't think that's going to work on my flask back end to be honest with you I think it's going to glitch when I do that but hopefully that will work FSE okay us it joined but this guy joined too why does that keep happening it's cuz he must have already been in the for him to for this guy to accept that he has to already be a part of the room so let me try to log out what's this and see if it actually leaves log out socket. leave is not a function oh I can store the room in sessions flask I don't need to store it here socket doit I can just admit leave okay that's what we're going to do uh actually socket iio sessions let's see yeah okay let's see here uh socket flask socket session okay let's say flask sessions I can just literally use session right okay just do this I think this is what I used to this is definitely what I did previously when I did this I need to have something working by the end of this something needs to work some people need to be able to type against each other otherwise this is just a somewhat fail I mean I could continue this in another stream uh but ideally I would like to get something okay so onjoin room equals data room okay see like I don't need to be sending the room back this should just join when you do this um like it should just join the room on that oh man my brain is just malfunctioning here okay so we'll join room and then we'll say session uh room equals room okay and we'll say if room in session then room equals session room get rid of that leave room else return okay let's try this Tim five why let's just stop this make sure these guys aren't connected right now okay log in why is that happening does this auto connect like it's like this is already connected it needs to leave I'm going to make a button that says leave and just and just trigger it manually and see you should check if the user joins is the same user I'm I'm I'm reading your message but that's not going to help because the thing is there's no way that the other one should be getting that message right unless it's connected so it must already be connected which is the problem so let me try to fix that let's make a button should have done this a long time ago leave okay why does it already connect in the context should I do I have to restart the server or something for that that to work okay let me try but the context is not is not for every single person is it the context is like individual apps because of using git I doubt that okay at least the leave room thing should work now okay leave room doesn't do anything missing one require positional argument data uh let's go here okay it's the problem should be working us your left but that didn't get user left oh it's cuz I'm not setting join false okay let's try that socket connects when the user opens the page yes but they don't connect to the room so why are they getting sent cuz they're already in the room this is painful I'm sure everyone watching this is like what the heck uh this is hard I'm just too if this was at the beginning of the stream I'm sure this would be pretty easy join okay Jo join join okay leave see but it's only showing me user left here which I don't get why doesn't it show me user left here why doesn't it work over here right do you know what I mean like why would that not emit over oh what because that should work on leave handle user leave should be doing that I'm just confused how when I leave on one it doesn't send it to the other one maybe it's returning let me just print this what's what is this problem objects not Jon un serializable this is happening the room is not in the session session room that should be doing it though yeah maybe I do need to restart the server going have to sign in again you should have completed back in first well I can't like I'm trying to complete the backend but I need to need to test okay these guys are still signed in somehow oh because they have the tokens that's why oops don't open that okay uh join race user joined leave race problem maybe this is just not the way to check if something's in the session that's probably why that's really why that so the return either way is not going to work um I don't think I should have a return I think I should just not do anything session I get room so it's not in the session then like what why is it not in the session though don't understand why can I print the session objective type set is it printing anything room room room why I can't figure out where this is coming from oh oh my God guys I'm such an idiot it's going to work now so it is there it's just not admitting to the other people which I don't get I don't know why that's happening oh it's cuz when you leave you're not going to get it right but okay let's see join user joined leave user left leave user left but the thing is it doesn't tell me when the other user leaves it should be the other way around that's showing it to me only one room is being added to the session on the client all rooms are handling the join making all show true but only one is actually join serers side why how is why is that the case yeah this isn't just JavaScript that's why I'm the room is in the session uh when you join Ed room session it then adits the join event to all rooms setting the front has joined to True makes it look like all rooms have joined the thing is I thought I thought there's two separate connections like I thought that there was two different things being joined on so let's print the username and let's see if we're getting two different joint events um because also this is happening too right this this event here calling AIT leave after leave room print session print username on jooan okay let's do this okay so they're now connected to the socket no username I don't know guys this is so confusing this is frustrating the reason only one client is getting the leave event is that the if no that doesn't make sense let's just do this I don't know why that's happening when I press leave the other one should see it okay so the invite accepted things working let's just look at this here my mouse is lagging out join a room good needs because it needs to get the room to join um here I can let's do this maybe it's cuz it's emitting Leaf H my mouse is just lagging oh my God what the heck okay let's just go to room where API let's get rid of this say man my damn Mouse man I'm already doing that okay we're going to go simpler here l in what okay there you go five at why is this happening internal server error uncaught in promise validate token what should not be getting an internal server error name room is not defined oh it's not working right now it's 900 p.m. yeah why is this so annoying why is it not working it should be working just do this let's get rid of all this joined crap why why are they not doing it like this was working before it just is liter it's not even responding anymore it's not getting anything so.it Joan okay M to room should join yeah the server is getting the event I believe actually let's make sure oops join data see that's happening join and see that's happening join they're both joining and they both leave but they just don't transmit back to each other which I don't know why um because it should be it's listen it's clearly listening for the event it's it's emitting it back it's just not emitting it to the right room are they in different rooms how's that even possible oh do need to be a string or something maybe that's why no it's not why okay let's hardcode this room they should both be in the same room maybe I need to admit this before I leave no yes maybe before I leave the room I need to admit it they're both Jo joining they're just not admitting back to each other why I don't get it how how could the room IDs not be matching wait I literally hardcoded them as room they should all be joining the exact same room like I don't I really don't understand how this is the case join the room emits this other one joins the room oh thanks man appreciate it Nick yeah yeah I'm uh very happy with the new office shouldn't emit when a user joins shouldn't on leave print leave not join yeah it should joinan leave like I'm listening for the event and I'm not getting it join change join and leave our names where let's try this it like I literally had this working I've gone backwards says check the network tab let's see how would I even see this would it be here oh what okay let's see this no see it's not getting anything it's not sending it that's why that's the issue it's just not sending it to the correct thing wait nothing's happening okay something's happening here now no it's not getting the message though or is it just coming in really late okay let's try this let's try this without the rooms can we just join the socket and admit to like everyone cuz like I'm down to do that now um it's the server is not emitting it properly that's the issue let's try this okay enough of this this join room crap submit send room what is send room that might be something okay someone's knocking on my door be back in one sec all right yeah dude I don't know either I don't know why this isn't working 10 hours um should I just copy this again and try it like okay refresh this okay now it's working I'm just broadcasting them to everyone use your left use your left okay okay nice okay uh how do you how do you just how do you disconnect them I've just done it so there 's no rooms now it's just like it's going to everyone so you can have like One race at a time like we we'll try to fix it after I guess but I don't know how to connect like how do I close the socket how do I actually disconnect it like I I don't want it to be a part of it anymore uh I guess I just removed the listeners I swear it should have its own thing for disconnection but it's not working handle user leave I mean if I do these it will stop listening for those events but how do I just get it to like fully disconnect socket. disconnect doesn't work I've tried it okay react socket disconnect client like I just don't know how to disconnect it this is annoying this is the problem using all these complicated Stacks okay user joined user joined leave room leave room like when you leave it should actually leave right um I guess we can just disconnect the event listeners when you leave I mean that'll work but not ideally okay let's try this join leave join okay yeah so now it doesn't show up on the other one but then this one doesn't show up either what are these guys are these the same things connected this makes no sense I don't understand since it's in the context is it like Global to the application is it because I'm on the same let me go on my phone maybe CU I'm on the same uh computer uh what's my IP address um is it going to say here do stop it's not a function okay I want to restart this oh smart Mark coming in clutch thank you very much Mark smart man very smart man extremely smart man okay that's why so it's it needs to be when only this client leaves but how do I check if it's just this um okay how do I check if it's just this client Json okay that's good now that I know that that that helps a lot okay let's go to run API let's try rooms again that's that's very good that's helpful that's very helpful okay um use a different event handler different event handler when I press leave oh nice yeah very very that's that makes perfect sense don't do it in the leave do it in leave room and then when they leave perfect oh my God see this is the problem with coding for 10 hours your brain just shuts off and these silly things like I should have been able to figure that out uh it's just not working okay leave room use a left and then leave room see it didn't disconnect why is that not unbinding it I have lost all my brain cells Gary yes I have no this is not why you add comments to code this is comments would not help me at all here um Ms leave make separate room ideas okay we're going to just try this again we're going to pull together all my brain power and restart this cuz I don't think this is helpful where where I'm at right now the committing of the join is fine the handling the user leave is fine the handling the user join is fine I think that's fine um that should be fine I don't think it's the JavaScript I think it's this okay now I do have water here let me have some water okay so let's just send room and username send room and username I think this should work pray okay oops okay guys got to we got to go for 12 hours even if I don't complete this it's not looking like I'm going to right now cuz the brain is just is just too destroyed um we will we we'll try onl leave missing one require positional argument how's that awesome how's how's that happening okay let's try this could have sworn I was sending room I am oh what the heck room let got one okay now nothing's happening your eyes are turning red better get some sleep I will uh I'll sleep soon guys don't worry socer admit join why is this not guys don't worry it's fine um room username now it's now nothing's happening what the heck key error room I don't see any key error when you click join it's supposed to no I'm not printing anything here movies cuz the send m m like I don't know what the difference between Emit and send is okay let's just see if this even is being called print data and print data see not even work okay leave room Works join room doesn't work why is join not working homepage join room socket. admit joinan why would that not work I have the event join this should work there you go now it's working I don't know why it wasn't working before okay it was oh that was just console l okay that's fine so now that is working the server is receiving my stuff just not sending it back or maybe this is just not receiving it let's emit oh that's why oh oops this is Le join okay I think this is going to work now actually have zero confidence unhashable type oh Always Get What Lang I'm writing in here oh that's why okay use a joined user joined leave like it's only sending to the same person I don't get it is the send in AIT only do they not so they not supposed to send to the all of them oh my God guys I'm such an idiot I'm such oh my God oh my God I should just read honestly I should have just read this was an hour and a half long problem all I had to do was that to be fair none of you found it either so it's not just me joyan leave there we go joyan leave joyan leave okay nice that works now if this guy leaves and this guy joins it still says user join so it's working but it's not like leaving and joining the room though which I don't really get like join says join leave join shouldn't join for this one too leave cuz it should be it should be gone it should be out of the room I don't know why it's not leaving the room though that's what that's really confusing me well if they aren't joined then it shouldn't say I agree I agree it shouldn't say I don't know why they're joined they shouldn't be joined because they're not leaving is the problem um unless for some reason it's joining back somehow I don't know handle user leave that's all that's happening when it's user leave it says on leave message user left on joinan message user join so why do they start off joined I don't know connects to the socket he shouldn't be in the room by default let's just see what happens if I change the room well I can I can't because it's going to be that's true good idea go for a walk might help um what are you guys saying okay quest. Sid let's print this and request okay no they do have different IDs someone subscribed oh that's on Twitch okay or is this going to spam oh no that's when oh no I got to turn that off done okay user left okay flask okay Tim let's try that out this is so sad I just can't get the damn sockets to work okay but I want it to just leave the room man I don't want it to still be in the room this should work work it should just leave I think for some reason it's like joining back automatically like it's leaving but it's it's not like it's still it just Auto joins back or something I have no idea I don't know why it's still in the room it shouldn't still be in the room like it should be out of the room something's going on here in react and I don't know what's what's up with it is it this yeah it's not leaving it's not leaving the room I don't know why it's not leaving the room it doesn't make any sense to me why it's not leaving the room join room the leave room button is is pressing leave room yeah maybe I can do that does that work cannot import name room h No I don't want want all rooms I want all the people in the room no one's answered this oh my God uh H check what room a user is in flask you can get a list of rooms of specific users in using rooms okay let's just try this failed print room the room object local variable room reference for assignment what what where oh here this is wrong okay Tim I see you I'm going to I think I'm using that right now user joined user joined okay now let's press leave room leave room and it's still in the room it's not leaving the room ready look not leaving not leaving not leaving this is the room they're in different rooms but they're seeing the same thing what that makes no sense that really that makes no sense that they're they're in different rooms dude I can't get the rooms this makes no I'm genuinely so confused I've used this before too which is the funny thing and it doesn't work like what is going on i' I've got the The Flash docks man it's just not very helpful because leave room doesn't seem to work I'll print it before and after and see if this literally does nothing I also have no idea how they would even be in different rooms see before and after they're in the same thing it doesn't leave where do leave room even come from try an if Loop let's just just go here and let no is there some way that it would be like Auto joining the room or something like I just don't get it I'm genuinely so confused I think it leaves in the leave room function right before your top print statement let's see oh true good call oh they're in two rooms how is it in like a default room so it is leaving that room it is leaving the room but it's in a default room how is it in that room oh it's in its own room is the broadcast true okay so that's working the default room is unique for you choose yeah it's in the room so it should be getting it when I leave the room it's still sending it's got to be this damn emit thing it must just not be working properly oh my God let's just try using send maybe AIT doesn't work for this s takes one positional argument maybe that's possible I want like the actual like full docks per send when a message is sent with the broadcast option enabled all clients connected to the name space receive it including the sender when name spaces are not used the clients connected to the global Nam space receive the message in all examples shown until this point the server responds to an event sent by the client for some applications the server needs to originate a message okay the socket. send and socket. methods can be used to to broadcast to all connected clients note that sock. send and so.it are not the same functions as the context where send and emit for many applications necessary to group users into subsets that can be add addressed together the best example is chat application with multiple rooms where users receive messages from the rooms or room room or rooms they in but not from other rooms okay the join and emit functions are optional except an optional argument that caused the message to be sent to All clients are in the given room all clients are assigned so I don't think broadcast equals true is the right thing here and I think this would be okay comma joinan okay joinan okay leave okay leave okay nothing's happening here H this is the problem I don't I think it's listening for a certain event and it's not getting the event that you need that it needs I think that like I need to admit a certain event cuz I don't know what the difference between send and amid is um h user joined user joined leave leave it's not sending it to the things in the room I don't understand why it's not working m adits a custom event okay that's what I want let's try this try using socket. on leave instead of off no the off is to unbind it let's try this if this makes a difference I swear to God no way oh my God it's literally I was using the wrong damn I'm going to hurt someone that this was like what why is that the problem it it's now working it's literally now working oh my God just those two damn methods see doesn't show it now I join boom shows me user joined I leave shows me user left user left I leave doesn't show me user left oh my God okay this is man this is so frustrating guys just cuz you I'm sorry if you suggested that this is uh my mind is is destroyed right now stupid crap like this is the most annoying oh my God like these are the errors I've ran into all day so so so frustrating oh my god um yeah you guys are concerned over my health maybe you should be what's the difference I have no idea what the difference is one works and one doesn't that's all I care about right now okay well it's working so now we're going to redirect to the room page once we join so once we join and we get the user joined uh what we want to do is emit redirect and then we don't need these call backs right now um delete those delete those delete those delete those um this consist okay now get a nice nap after the stream I'm going to get a nice sleep okay now we're going to say history dot push slash room SL1 okay then when we go into room we're going to say socket Dot on joyan and we're gonna say um handle join andle join yeah yeah I think that's fine console.log leave and then this is leave by the way thank you to everyone who's helping out here I might not be appreciating your work as much as you uh as you hope um I'm just trying to stay a bit sane here so okay join leave andle leave okay and then return or turn and then this is what I wanted okay off oh well we can send that too actually cuz that's that's good to send to disconnect and then we'll say socket. off joyan handle joinan off leave handle leave okay and then these need to be with use call back how do I how do I do the use call back I think that's what it is okay good it's like this boom got it okay um nice let's try this now oh it's cuz it breaks okay I got it don't I don't want this join join nice okay now we going to go here did I actually use algo exer for my Shopify micr interviews yes absolutely that's L the reason why I was able to uh to get a job there I made videos about it before I was working there uh oh okay that's what I want okay we're we're flowing we're going stupid like I can't that took an error to an error an hour to solve probably more than that actually uh username not defined oh props that username probably isn't defined I probably didn't pass it um okay redirect push room oh that might be a problem how do I pass the props to that history don't push react are these props which one is the prop I need to pass in state okay State and then uh and email okay let's see if that works really oh props do what is I think that's it home home join H oh what am I jesus okay say the other one I need to do that okay this is props do location. state boom got it sweet okay I'm going to take a quick break I'll be right back I'm just going to go for a walk we back okay goal here what I would like to do is I would just like to make it so that we can see two people people typing on the screen at the same time and lifetime that's a goal if we can do that I'm going to be happy continue the stream another day because yeah I'm 50 minutes and this brand power is not enough to finish this um kind of unfortunate but uh you know some stupid errors that's what happens when you write code that's usually why you don't write code for 12 hours straight all right let's get it okay stretch out let's have some more water what will we do next stream no idea but it won't be tomorrow I tell you that for sure maybe on uh no not Sunday uh Sunday is like the day Sunday's Mother's Day so probably not on Sunday have a good night thank you thank you to the 241 people here thank you very much thank you for staying with me believing in me okay so I also have an idea for the room I'm thinking I can make one I can make a button that generates a room and then a button to join a room and when you join the room you can pick the room to join um and you just type in the room you want to join and it will bring you there and then um I'm thinking that I can do create room and it will just randomly generate a uyu ID which is like guaranteed to be unique don't know how they do that but I think I think we'll just go with that uh and then yeah so rather than like it automatically handling the the room thing thing yeah that's that's what I'm thinking but let's just see if we can get something working we can handle the rims after I want to get live chat I want two code Windows one on the left one on the right someone can type in the left someone can type in the right going to do this in the most inefficient way possible and yeah let's go for it all right okay so material UI text field we're going to keep it simple um okay just woke up yeah I've just been honestly I forgot I should just drink a ton of water I thought the Red Bull was going to be helpful but the water's actually way more helpful I want like a large text field how do I get a large like big text input you you like text box maybe text area that's what it's called no not text field Hy input actually I think I can use this dope got it okay Rose Max Infinity nice okay so let's go here Port F UI slore okay line Rose Max equals Infinity placeholder can you guys hear my cat crying uh she was crying okay let's go here see con um okay and go equals ponent type and user type so let's do this grid okay and grid container okay and CR item okay Direction equals row okay accs equal 6 equals 6 okay um yeah no I'm I'm not going to be able to complete it in in the next hour but I'll get like hopefully something that works okay um let see type type ponent type ponent type okay I'm trying to think how I want to send over the text Data h i could do it one character at a time but that's going to be really hard so I'm just going to do what ever is in the text field on change I'm going to send so let's say on change equals okay and no this doesn't need that this needs this Mr colon where did mron okay onchange equals send updated code okay admit code okay and then send update code Type okay now let's go const handle actually it's going to be equal to data code okay now socket. on want update okay put update code fine data um code in data okay um yeah I am a zombie don't worry I'm just trying to go kind of fast it's I'm trying to focus so that I can actually get something done so that this works um yeah okay uh anyways let's see here if code in data then code equals data at code and then we're going to say socket out. admit leave um to room okay we're going to say session room room okay and we're going to say session. getet room okay we're going to pass that code data so now I want to admit to everyone but not the same client um actually this will be fine this will still work the way it is yeah this should actually still work um I think maybe we'll see okay actually we can just do this data okay so now let's just go print data okay so here we're going to emit our updated code okay let's just run this see if anything Works don't need that opponent typing start typing yeah I figured that wasn't going to work name socket is not defined socket iio okay um let's change this internal server error oh that's why okay fresh H oh it's probably not connected that's why oh yeah that's why this guy is okay log in uh Tim five oh excuse me join race okay joined great brush okay join race join didn't say join is this guy not connected why are you not connected home join a race join leave race leave race home join a race yeah okay that worked um hello why is that not sending on change send updated code send updated code Where Are You sock admit updated code why is that not working Ah that's why there you go look at that super inefficient but it works okay and leave is printing out whenever I type anything okay it's working though um oh it's cuz I'm emitting leave okay man socks are fast wow okay okay working this is getting the leave event still oh refresh refresh okay code boom okay I can't type an opponent typing good that's actually good that you can't do that okay nice um all right so now that's working but it's not picking up that event so that's why okay okay nice okay so that's actually working but the problem is that it's updating um same thing okay kind of working man my mouse is just lagging oh my God okay I don't need those anymore uh okay it's working but we just need to handle update code only send back let's see here flask only send um include self false dope hopefully that works uh have to reconnect oh leave leave uh that should breed too okay um is your mouse running low on battery um I don't think so just like it is it is Bluetooth though that makes sense um okay what I want to do here history when you press do I have history here man just passed history as a prop okay import use history from at react router Dom okay and then history dot push slash okay help if I spell react correctly load there you go okay good boom baby let's go nice uh you missed one wait what the state must be off or something it must be like one behind yeah it's got to be one behind let's see um so I don't need this uh and I don't need these either okay um what unchange ah can't perform react State update on unmounted component it's a no op okay when I press leave I got to disconnect um okay room still connected you want me to solve the rubye again no chance okay so the Le's just not working properly I'm looking at the chat I'm looking at the chat good morning everyone okay okay use call back leave um do I have an error here no I don't why is leave not working don't know why leave is not working okay join race okay oh that makes sense that makes makes a lot of sense actually okay go here to homepage it admits joinan I don't think I'm cleaning up my events properly let's get rid of that so it's always one character behind it's interesting wait let's see if I can figure out why this is the case I think that's it there you go boom let's go leave didn't trigger the leave event and here I don't think is it is it getting let's print something here left okay don't need that uh let's go here for some reason it doesn't look like it's emitting the leave event that worked oh there you go okay nice okay so let's now throw in an error if their opponent leaves gu don't need that let's say an error so if they leave if handle leave then set error opponent is left you one uh should that be error maybe that should be info set info and then info set info then info info wait actually is info one yeah I think info is one set info info okay oh that's sweet and then when they join I can do the same thing too okay um handle joyan nice okay okay join the race wait what oh it's cuz it's it doesn't know if it's itself or not makes sense okay let's do the thing so it only sends back to itself okay includes self or doesn't send back to itself okay nice okay boom go opponent has joined no that that shouldn't happen Okay Go Back le race leave race join race join the race didn't work that should update h maybe this doesn't work in a use call back cuz I think it log join left no oh that that's why I have an issue on the API oh my God what am I doing that's why I was like what the heck's going on how do I break everything okay now it's good that's that's not correct H room handle leave why is it not working let's go home home fresh fresh join a race join a race there you go good great that worked okay leave race opponent has left you won okay I just had to refresh it's all working nice now I want to move that down lower um sweet also need to render a code block they need to start typing so once both people are in needs to show a code block um are you using any python framework I'm using flask okay let's think about this okay it is it is here let's just try this again join race join the race your opponent has joined get ready um and then that should show if he's joining a room where his opponent's already joined um so if it gets this message it should broadcast something to this guy yeah that makes sense we can do that oh we'll do like a starting message that would work okay broadcast start run API so can I check how many people are in a room um flask check how many users in room socket io. rooms is that going to work let's try this do don't join and then your room and then this will be room okay let's just look at this uh leave room leave room okay join race has no attribute rooms H really it's not work April what see if that import fails guys we only got 20 minutes left not taking a break function objects not subscrip toal okay okay okay rooms room let's try this that work okay nice did work just not get it's not really giving me anything super valid but what was this what did this say at the top rooms see this was an annoying thing rooms worked but room didn't last time see if that import fails can import room but I can import rooms what is rooms that gives me a list what if I just do rims yeah it's not helpful it's just give me the rooms the users in I want the room I want all of the users in a room I need to know that that was in 2015 okay get room client rooms socket ID get room client what is that where is connected users I don't it doesn't look like this is possible H okay let's see here okay I'm trying to figure out the number of users that are in a room and apparently that's not an easy thing to do because I want to like start well let's see here the user that creates the room I mean theoretically it can start the race I guess but I don't really like starting the race from the front end I'd prefer to start from the back end uh I could keep track of room and then try to use a database or something to determine how many are there that's seems like a pain though um H could insert the room into the database when a user connects I could insert them and then that would tell me how many people I have okay we can try that um models I forgot about this let's say ID equals db. column now let's go here to this okay how do I make a list in the database text okay hey Mouse stop okay that doesn't work the thing you're saying do rooms doesn't work I don't care about the number of rooms the client's in I want to know the number of clients in the room no oh no I believe the command is uh exclamation white Discord can you do this this is not helpful um declaring models okay uh foreign key ql alchemy One to many one room many users child referencing the parent correct that's what I want okay child oops no this needs to go on user this will be. ID okay uh yeah okay room let's see here this ISS relationship where do I where do I import relationship look I I hate when it doesn't give me the Imports it's so frustrating when it doesn't do that uh I'm going to assume it's from it's a DB type db. relationship is that correct yeah okay good that looks good users okay user and then this is going be room okay so then oh man this is going to be too hard I would like to import relationships into my own life as well oh man this is going to take too long okay I'm going to I'm going to change track I'm going to do something else because this I I have eight minutes I want to see if I can get multiple rooms working quickly um okay where would I even go for this um homepage make one join a race make one that says create a race okay let's let's import grid here um so you I core slash grid okay we're going to go no wait what what I just do oh that's what I did slash grid and then we want create a room in here I want a text field how do I do that in here update room okay yeah update room code D Rose Max don't think I need this text field okay where's core okay here it is we're almost done guys stopping in six minutes okay we go set room is that what I mean it update room okay um button button button button join room create room okay equals um there you go join room M room equals room okay nice nice nice nice four minutes we're getting close Okay I need to take a break and just look at this for one second username room slash plus room okay okay should be good if I create the room do that update room code update room okay and then join room you're going to just join whatever room you insert you know what I can just make one button yeah just do one button don't need this don't need that no don't need this okay create room no just call this join room so if the room doesn't already exist it will create it create slash jooin aace okay and then room my mouse oh my God this is the most annoying thing using join room yeah join room okay room no join room why do I have two of these only need one sock D join token room username room plus room okay let's let's look at this oops okay now let's try this uh oh do I need to log in tim5 at melor column is not find oh damn it let's go to models I don't need that uh DB wait it's not there is it it's in a n yeah integer is not toin oh my God oh my God okay just enough get rid of this good working nice okay fresh fresh boom okay uh Home Room ID 23 create okay room ID 23
