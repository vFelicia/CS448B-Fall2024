so the new m1 apple processors have been getting a ton of hype there's been a lot of great reviews for them and so i decided to pick up a new apple m1 mac mini now i've been using this machine for about three weeks i have some thoughts on it and hopefully in this short video i can summarize all of the great things and not so great things about this device and give my personal recommendation on whether or not i think you should buy one in 2021 with that said let's dive in so i picked up a new m1 mac mini about three weeks ago the configuration i went with had 16 gigabytes of ram and one terabyte of ssd storage it ran me about 1650 canadian dollars now comparing that to the base model the base model has eight gigabytes of ram 256 gigabytes of ssd storage and starts at 900 canadian dollars so these machines are pretty affordable especially if you're comparing them to their pc counterparts and the level of performance that you're getting here for this price is actually very very good at kind of first glance if i'm giving you my initial impressions from using this machine i would recommend it to about 80 to 90 percent of people unless you have some specific use cases which i'll discuss in this video so to really summarize this machine i kind of have three words fast new and silent now when i say this machine is fast what i really mean is it's extremely responsive when you are using this device it feels just like using an iphone or using an ipad when you open an app it opens instantly when you close an app it closes instantly when you're dragging things around when you're doing some kind of light work everything is just happening super fast genuinely faster than what's even happening on my like 10 000 big gaming pc that i have here that i'm recording this video on so this computer feels super fast and for anyone who's doing just kind of average work on your computer maybe you're in an excel spreadsheet maybe you're doing some word processing maybe you're reading email or on safari this is gonna feel like the fastest computer you've ever used especially if you haven't used an m1 mac mini before now when it comes to sheer processing power doing things like rendering and other performance heavy applications i haven't tested this machine too much it seems to be about on par with my old macbook pro 16 inch which had an i7 6 core processor in it so it's not like you're getting crazy crazy performance out of this processor here it's just that when you're doing the light work and you're doing kind of your average daytoday tasks on this machine it's super fast super responsive and just feels great it's just really nice to work on really satisfying and really the best way i can kind of explain it is just to compare it to the experience you get when you use something like an iphone or an ipad again i can't talk too much about the sheer performance when you get into applications where you're doing video editing rendering audio processing and all of that but from my experience it's been about on par with the last generation 2016 macbook pro again that had that i7 processor in it but that computer is about two times the price of this one right here and so the next point that i had here is that this machine is silent now when i say that i mean that literally i have yet to hear this device it makes such a low sound that i quite literally cannot hear anything unless i stick my ear right to the back of the i o and even then i can hardly hear any sound whatsoever now one of the reasons why this device is able to run so quietly to the point where i'm literally calling it silent is because it draws so little power i think the tdp of this entire machine is about 35 to 40 watts now to put that in comparison a computer with disk processing power that was a pc say you were to build this yourself would probably be drawing at minimum 200 watts under load this device under full load is not drawing more than 35 to 40 watts at least according to apple and that's one of the reasons it's able to stay so quiet is it just taking in way less energy so it's producing way less heat and that way the fan can stay at a very consistent low level and it doesn't rev up i haven't heard it and this is one of the number one assets for me because i'm in kind of a studio environment here my old mac that i used to use to process all of my audio would rev the fan up really loud it was really annoying and it would kind of be picked up on my microphone as background noise and so this thing is great and one of the reasons why i bought it was because i heard about the volume of it and i was like i need to try this i want something silent and well it has not disappoint so that's something to note completely silent device that's just one of the biggest factors for me and why i'm mentioning it and i think probably one of the most underrated factors or things mentioned about these m1 processors not to mention the extremely low power draw so now moving on to the last point which is new now at the beginning of the video when i said new doesn't necessarily mean a good thing i meant that and the reason for that is that these chips are just so so new if you're unaware these m1 processors are running a brand new architecture this is an arm architecture that's similar to what's running on your iphone or your ipad there's a ton of benefits in this architecture like you can run ios apps or ipad apps natively now on your mac operating system if you're an ios developer this is probably going to be really big deal for you and these machines are going to be great but if you're working with a lot of software that's maybe older software that's intel based it doesn't get updated that frequently or that has not yet been optimized for the m1 mac you are going to see a performance penalty and you may actually see some things that don't work at all with this m1 processor so the reason for this is whenever you design software you kind of have to design it based on a certain architecture and while most of the software out there for mac is designed for an intel architecture and has not yet been updated and that means if you want to run this software on your mac you need to install something called rosetta now in all credit to mac or to apple i guess they make it super simple to install this rosetta software it's literally a one click thing the first time you try to open an intel application it prompts you to install rosetta in anyways what rosetta will do is take this intelbased software and translate it into something that your m1 ship can understand however this does cost you as i said about 50 performance penalty now that's a rough estimate it's going to change based on the application that you're using but if you are using an application that is not built natively for m1 expect it not to perform to the same level as anything that obviously has been optimized for that chip now as i said this also means there's a lot of stuff that just doesn't work on m1 processors for example i have a ton of plugins for my audio recording in logic pro which is like an audio software on mac and a bunch of those plugins just do not work at all i had to go through a ton of crazy work arounds it took me about five hours the first time i got this machine to get this working because they just were not compatible with the new m1 architecture so one thing you guys really need to make sure you look out for if you're buying this computer is that the software you use and you rely on is actually going to operate on it so make sure you do some research make sure you look into if this software actually works properly on the m1 and if you can live with that kind of performance penalty that you're gonna get because of the fact that this is just so new and that companies have not yet had time to kind of transfer all of their software over to this new m1 architecture so really that's going to wrap up my thoughts on this new m1 processor obviously this is not a full review i could talk about this for hours i just want to give you guys a quick summary and hopefully hit on some of the key points some of the selling points and drawbacks of this device to give you a quick summary here this is fast super responsive speedy and in my opinion probably one of the best value computers of 2021 especially if you're someone who's just an average user does some light work like i said you're using you know excel word mail google whatever but you do have to be wary that a lot of software does not run on this computer it's going to cause you a lot of headaches or if it does run it's gonna run at a performance penalty due to the fact it needs to be translated to the new m1 architecture lastly the power draw of this computer is ridiculously low it is absolutely silent one of my favorite parts about the machine with that said i'm going to wrap up the video here so if you guys enjoyed
