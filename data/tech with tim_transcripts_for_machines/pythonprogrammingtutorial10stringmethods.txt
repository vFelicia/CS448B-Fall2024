hey guys welcome back today we're going to be doing the 10th video in my Python Programming series and today we're going to be talking about string Methods um so method is simply something you can call on a string by using the delimiter of a period followed by whatever the method is and then brackets like this now sometimes we have to put some things inside of the brackets um but most of the time we can just leave them with empty brackets okay so let's get right into an example we're going to start by talking about the dot dot strip method um now what this one does is it pretty much removes all of the leading and trailing white spaces from a word or from a string sorry so we'll start by just making a variable and we'll make it equal to the input from the console and we'll just say input something like that and then we're just going to print out our input so oops print out text. strip okay so again what strip does is just going to remove all the white spaces before and after the word and it's best to show you with an example um so you can see if we type a few spaces so 1 2 3 4 and then I type hello and then a few more spaces and I click enter it simply gives us hello that's because it had removed all of the spaces from the string while as if I don't have the dot strip here so if I get rid of that and we run it and I do some spaces again and I type hello and some more spaces it's going to give us those spaces as a part of the string and most of the times when we have a string we want to remove these spaces so that's why we use dot strip did I spell that right strip yeah just like that okay um all right so that one's pretty straightforward just removes these spaces now you may want to do this if you're checking um if a string is equal to a certain thing and you're getting a user input and they may have accidentally typed the space before before or after the word right okay so now we'll move on to the Len um so this one is actually not a method because you don't call it using a DOT um using a period followed by the word it's actually known as a function which I'll get into later so this just means that it takes something inside of the brackets um so this stands for length Len and pretty much what it does is Returns the length of a string or of a list so right now we're going to use a string and we're going to put text in here and I'll show you again what it does um 1 2 3 4 5 remember although this is a number since I'm typing it in the console it actually gives me a string value so this will work and it says that the length of this is five again uh that one's pretty useful I used it in the last video um to determine how many times we had to iterate through a list because we got the length of the list all right now for lower so pretty much what lower does um is it turns everything into lower cases in our word um so again it's best to just show using an example if I type something like this uh with a few lower cases a few capitals and I click enter you see we get everything in lowercase letters all right and now for Dot Upper you can probably guess what this one's going to do it's the exact same thing except in this case everything is going to uppercase so like this and you see we get all uppercase letters all right um and now for the last string method that I'm going to talk about although there is tons of different string Methods um there's probably over 40 or 50 I'm going to leave the link down below to all of the string Methods on the python website so you can go check them out if you'd like to see some more um so this one is called dos spit now this one I'd say is probably one of the most useful methods that I um that I use all the time and what it does is it actually creates a list out of of the string that you give it um so inside of these brackets you're going to put what's called a delimiter and what a delimiter is is pretty much what you want to split by so for example I'm going to put a period in here just so we can get an example so we have text dosit and inside of the brackets for dos spit we have a period so it's best to just show an example oh invalid syntax I think I have one too many brackets there yes I do okay so run it so I input something I'm going to type hello. tim. by. High just a few random words and you can see they're all separated by a period or by a DOT now when I click enter you see we actually get a list with all of the words and you notice that we don't actually have a period in this list that's because the way that dot split works is it gets rid of the delimiter so since the delimiter was a period it's not going to include the period in this list now this may be kind of confusing um we'll do a few more examples so hope hopefully you can understand so usually what you do um is you would you you would leave these uh brackets blank so you wouldn't put anything in them and by default Python's going to say okay well I guess you want to eliminate by a space um so the way that we can do this again um what'll happen is if I type a sentence like my name is Tim um and I click enter here you see it separates by spaces and we have no spaces in our list because it removes those spaces now you could also diiminate by anything you like so I could do an a for example um now if click F5 and we just type a bunch of letters and I put an A and then another a you see we get um the letters and again there's a space at the end because I typed a space right um so yeah okay so that's how dot split works now dos split's very useful um if you want to do certain things with a list we're going to talk a bit more about it later on um but those are just some basic string Methods that we talked about today again there are tons more on the python website which I will link down below um if you like the video please like And subscribe and I will see you again later
