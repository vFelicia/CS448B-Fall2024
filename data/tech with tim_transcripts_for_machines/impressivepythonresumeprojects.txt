in this video i'll share with you some impressive python projects that look great on a resume and that really showcase your ability as a programmer and your skill with python these projects will be in different categories like web development machine learning artificial intelligence data analysis and all the other things that python is really good at so with that said let's dive into the video so i'm going to start listing a ton of different projects but i do want to mention that you need to have a really strong foundation in programming and in python before you can start working on anything this complicated now if you don't already have that you can check out my course programming expert dot io this is designed to make you a software engineer as quickly as possible and has all of the stuff you need to get really good at python and just programming in general so it has object oriented programming advanced programming software design software engineering tools five completely guided programming projects that you can work on as well as over 250 coding questions and assessments for each section so that you actually know that you understand all of the content that you're learning from over the 100 videos anyways you guys can check it out from the link in the description and use code tim for a discount with that said though let's start getting into these resume projects now the first kind of category of projects i have here is artificial intelligence now in my opinion these are the most fun to work on and they also stand out a lot on a resume because even though they might not take a ton of time they're just really cool they sound impressive and that's kind of what you're going for with these type of projects so the first idea i have here is to make an artificial intelligence that can play a game so you can start with something really simple like pong make a neural network that can play the game of pop not the easiest thing in the world but definitely doable and you could 100 put that on a resume especially for a more junior position you can make an ai that plays tetris that automatically rotates the shapes and moves it in the correct direction maybe you have ais play against each other in the game of tetris there's a ton of stuff you can do next you can make an ai that plays flappy bird i actually have an entire tutorial series on this channel that shows you how to do that if you're looking for some concrete steps here on how you would accomplish something like this you can use a module in python called me now neats is a neural evolution of augmented topologies this is a really cool algorithm that actually takes a bunch of neural networks runs them all through your game and then takes the best of those neural networks and breeds them together and then continues this for generations until you eventually get a neural network that can say beat the game or is really good at completing it now of course there's a ton of other stuff that you can do with ai you can make an ai chat bot you can make an ai that trades stocks for you you do all kinds of stuff but i really like the game idea because you can actually build the game yourself in something like pie game and then design an ai in whatever way you like to actually play the game for you so moving on now to the web development section now i will note that there is an unlimited number of websites that you can make python is very flexible when it comes to web development but i'm gonna recommend here that you make something like a social media clone so something like instagram twitter facebook youtube maybe you get creative and do something like codegram where people post code instead of posting regular photos whatever you can get as creative as you want and of course you're going to build a slimmed down version you're not going to build a full instagram app or a full twitter you're going to build kind of the core features where users can sign in and sign up they can post something maybe they can search for different users and look at a profile they can like and they can comment that alone is a ton of different features and even if you just build a really bare bones version it's pretty impressive now the reason it's impressive is because if you're making something like this you need to make not only a front end buddy back end as well now personally for me when i build front ends for these websites i go really really simple i just use something like bootstrap which is a css framework i'll do plain javascript and html you don't need to get into anything too complicated like react unless you already know that but the core here is going to be the back end and how you're handling data story security and then the database integration that you have so that's why it's a good resume project because there's a lot of stuff going on there's a lot of different components that need to be connected together and there's a lot that you can learn when you're making this and that you can talk about in an interview about this project so again in terms of some concrete recommendations here if you're building a website you're going to use flask or django or you're going to build a separate front end and a separate back end and you're going to have an api on the back end using something like fast api or uh django rest framework or flask rest right there's all different kinds of stuff that you can do here i'm assuming if you guys are at this level in terms of building projects you already know what i'm talking about you're gonna have some type of back end some type of front end some type of database to store this information you're gonna have to learn a lot to make this and it's gonna look really good on a resume all right so continuing i have another web developmentish idea and this is to build a live chat application so something like telegram something like facebook messenger something like whatsapp where you have the ability to maybe add a contact or add a user and then you can chat with them in a chat room of some sort using sockets now sockets is kind of a live messaging system it's an ability for you to actually send information through the web without having to say upload it to a database and then pull the information from the database it's a really quick way to transmit messages specifically or different commands or kind of events that have occurred so this is definitely a really impressive thing to put on a resume especially if you implement a smooth and polished chat application this is actually something that i did to get a job at shopify now i didn't end up working at shopify but the project i submitted to them and that i kind of walked them through was a live chat application where i implemented it with sockets and then i built the user interface of this using uh what do you call it html css and javascript just a plain you know html website with a really simple ui but the whole core of the project was the fact that users could communicate in live time with very little delay it's like when you go on your messenger on your iphone or on your android and you see the little three dots pop up the reason they can do that is using something similar to sockets where in live time you're actually communicating with each other again you're not adding stuff to a database pulling it from the database and doing stuff in a really slow and sluggish way so i think this is a cool project i'll leave you guys to come up with more details related to that but if you want some concrete steps here on how you would do this you can use regular python sockets or you can use flask sockets which is kind of like a plugin for flask or django sockets i believe they have a specific kind of plugin or framework uh with django if you're going to be building this on the web now you don't have to build this on the web you could build an interface in pygame you could build an interface in kivy or in pi qt5 there's a ton of different kind of user interface libraries or modules in python pick whatever you want but you're going to need some way for users to type something in and then to see kind of the message log and maybe communicate with different people all right so now we're moving on to some data science and data analysis projects now this is a very popular application of python and really i think any project is good here so long as you're pulling a large piece of data and actually drawing some meaningful conclusions from it so as long as your project is actually doing something useful it's not just displaying data then i think you're going to have a good project now to give you a few ideas of what i'm thinking maybe you pull a million tweets and you look at all those tweets and you analyze the sentiment of them so you see if the tweets are happy or sad in terms of the general mood and then maybe you graph that against the time when twitter users are tweeting and you try to figure out what time of day twitter users are the happiest right that's a project i could think of of course you could do something with coronavirus data i think that's not very original especially because so many people have done that now but that's a good you know classic example of data analysis you could do something like graph your own data maybe you graph your spending habits and try to figure out the days you spend the most money what you spend the most money on maybe events that cause you to spend all of that type of stuff there's lots of information that you can pull and again so long as you're doing something that's actually useful i think you're going to have a good project so stay away from anything where you're just you know graphing data or kind of displaying stuff that you've pulled you want to be analyzing the data and actually pulling out some type of meaningful conclusion and there's all kinds of python modules that help you do this for example you could be using something like pandas you could be using something like numpy like matplotlib if you did want to visualize maybe the conclusions that you drew there's all kinds of artificial intelligence packages you have natural language processing like the nlp module you could import something like scikitlearn you could import and use tensorflow if you want to make a basic machine learning model i'm just rattling off random ideas at this point i'm trying to give you some inspiration for a meaningful data science project and hopefully i did that all right so my final project idea here is to build a data structure and algorithm visualizer now i know you guys have heard this many times in the past this is a very very popular idea however i'm still going to recommend it because i think it's a really good resume project and i'm going to tell you here to get more creative and unique in what you're visualizing as opposed to just a generic sorting algorithm or a data structure like a binary tree or a heap or something like that in my opinion those ones are kind of kind of boring i have done them in the past because a lot of people like those types of projects but i would recommend you visualize something that's not traditionally visualized for example maybe you make a game of chess i've done this on the channel and you make kind of a very basic ai that plays chess maybe you visualize how the ai makes decisions on what piece is going to move next even if it's moving a piece that makes no sense and it's not the best ai you're still visualizing something cool and not only have you made the visualization but you had to make the game to be able to do that i've also done on this channel visualizing sudoku so that game actually i built it out first you could just play the game and then i built a visualization tool which showed you how the i guess ai solves the board using something called a back tracking algorithm so get creative pick algorithms for projects that aren't traditionally visualized and then this gives you kind of a two in one you build out a game and you build out a project and then you show how your ai or whatever it's going to be actually solves that right i think that's cool i think that goes with data structure and algorithm visualization and you can visualize multiple things at the same time maybe you visualize the data structure as well as the algorithm that's running and then again you kind of get a two in one so that's my final idea here to summarize i had ai plays a video game i had to build a social media clone at a live messaging app i had some type of data science and data analysis project specifically analyzing tweets or analyzing coronavirus data pretty much any data right and then i had build a data structure and algorithm visualizer but to get more unique and creative and pick something that's not traditionally visualized all right so with that said that is going to wrap up this video if you guys have any project ideas please do share them down below if you like these type of videos leave a like subscribe to the channel don't forget to check out programmingexpert.io from the link in the
