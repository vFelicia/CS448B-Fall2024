foreign I'll be sharing with you the best projects that you can work on if you want to become a web 3 or blockchain developer these projects all look great on a resume they will teach you a ton about blockchain development and they're also fun and enjoyable to build I've built almost all of them on this list I really looked forward to going back the next day and kind of adding to the front end and making the contract better and I think you guys will as well now with that said before I get into the first project I will mention that almost all of these projects are included in my new course blockchain expert we just released this course you can check it out from the link in the description it's a great resource to learn blockchain development whether you have experience or not and we walk you through five fully guided projects and two more are coming that use chain link which I think a lot of you will find some value anyways check it out in the link in the description now let me share with you the projects that you can work on to become a better blockchain developer foreign to project number one now I've kind of put these in order of difficulty so easiest projects first and the most difficult at the end but some of them are kind of hard to rank and it's just a different skill set that you need to have to complete the project so project one is kind of the traditional project that I like to recommend to everyone when you're just starting out and this is a bank account now I know this is a little bit boring people create these all the time you can find all kinds of projects online that do this but it's really critical to understand as you become a blockchain developer how to send and receive ethereum in a safe way to a Smart contract how to maintain user balances and if you wanted to get crazy you could do stuff like having an interest rate on funds that were sent into uh the bank account right so if you're holding funds in the bank account you get a very small interest rate like you would in a normal Bank you could additionally be charging a monthly fee you could have a deposit fee for too small of deposits or lower balances and you can kind of extend this and make it more complicated in a more fun project now whenever you're building projects like these especially anything you're actually going to deploy on a main Network and let people use you want to make sure that not only are you writing a smart contract but you're writing automated tests for it now in my course blockchain expert we teach you how to do this and we test our contracts along the way to make sure they are secure and working properly but I just want to make that clear all of these projects you should have a smart contract as well as automated tests now once you've written a contract that you're confident in and it's working the next thing you're going to want to do is write a deployment script that allows you to automatically deploy this contract to either a test Network which is probably what you're going to do first or to a main Network where you'll have real users and accounts utilizing the contract now once you do that what you want to build is some kind of front end or user interface so users can interact with the contract sure it's great to be able to test it and remix and kind of press some buttons and send some transactions but ideally you want someone who knows nothing about the smart contract to be able to use this like it was a regular just you know nondecentralized application so ideally you go to some web page you connect with metamask and then you can just start depositing withdrawing uh checking your balance Etc like you would on any other kind of bank account so that would be my goal for this first project create a bank account contract test it deploy it write a basic frontend to interact with it and now you've learned how to send and receive ethereum properly and kind of the life cycle of a blockchain application and blockchain development alright so once you have finished your bank account then the next project I'm going to recommend is creating a decentralized exchange now obviously this is going to be a more basic version the ones like pancake swap or other very popular ones you may have used before but ideally you want to learn here how to interact with erc20 tokens how to get approvals from users to kind of transfer their erc20 tokens and how to receive tokens within a contract so you can create something very basic where say one user submits a custom erc20 token to a decentralized exchange contract then someone can buy that token or tokens at a specified price that would be the most basic version of doing this the next way would be to create something like a liquidity pool now if you were to create a liquidity pool what you would need to do is have an erc20 token which is your LP token your liquidity pool token and you would give that token to users for providing liquidity in your pool now the liquidity aspect of the pool is different erc20 tokens or ether or whatever it is that you're providing as an asset now that LP token should be gaining interest which means that when you go to redeem your LP token later on you're going to be get paid whatever you deposited plus the interest amount now to do this you would have to learn more about decentralized exchanges and exactly how this works but this is a really great project it's not overly complicated if you do kind of a simplistic version of a liquidity pool and you can learn again how to exchange and transfer tokens how to actually do like a trade if someone wants to trade their ether for a specific token or a token for ether Etc alright so once you have learned about erc20 tokens and implemented some kind of decentralized exchange what I would work on is creating an nft auction now the reason you want to do something like this is not just because nfts are great and everyone should go sell pieces of art but it's because you want to learn about ERC 721 tokens and specifically ipfs which is your interplanetary file system now in blockchain expert I tell you all about this I show you how to use ipfs and how to Mint new tokens check it out in the description but this is something a lot of people are not familiar with and don't actually understand how to interact with so when you're creating an nft auction obviously Step One is create some kind of nft this is actually fairly simple but what gets a little more complicated is when you have to store data on ipfs you have to kind of learn about how ipfs Works how you store data there in a decentralized manner and then how you retrieve that data later on when you're trying to display an nft the nft attributes the image associated with an nft Etc now once you've created an nft contract and you've tested that nft contract the next thing you need to do is make an auction contract and this contract should be able to auction any nft just like something like open C does right so by doing this you're going to learn about how to actually accept nfts or ERC 721 tokens into a smart contract how to have a timed auction how to have different bid amounts how to select who won the auction how to transfer that nft back to them and then of course you're gonna have to create some kind of front end that shows you the auction going on so you're going to want to log the different events when people are bidding you're going to want to update users that they've been L bid you're going to want to have the actual nft image on the website you want to show the statistics of the nft and then you're going to want to show expired auctions history sale prices all of that kind of stuff so you can go crazy with this auction project or you can create a more basic version this is a really good one to work on and personally when I created this project I found it quite interesting to learn about ipfs learn more about nfts and get some insight into how popular kind of platforms like openc actually operate all right so once you've created your nft auction the next project I would work on is a decentralized voting protocol now this is where you're going to take your knowledge of ipfs and implement it into a decentralized protocol or kind of a decentralized organization almost where users are able to vote on different polls or vote for things to happen within you know a dow or within some kind of org or whatever you want to call it so what I did for this specific project is I made it so that users kind of had to be a part of a group or an organization they either had to pay to get in that group or be whitelisted to be like a part of the group and then if they were in the group they could create a poll and that poll would have you know whatever you're voting on so like a description and then a bunch of options that people could vote on now this data since it was so large and maybe there was an image associated with it I needed to store on ipfs so I need to store the description of the poll and then all of the individual options so I did that and then I had users be able to vote on all of the different options so this meant I had to grab my ipfs data display this on a front end and then allow users that haven't already voted for this to well vote on a poll I had an expiry date on the poll and this was a way of again creating some decentralized voting and kind of like a democratic system in a sense so again I'm kind of oversimplifying it here but I would create something along those lines where you have an organization of people who can vote on different topics or vote on different polls and maybe those polls affect some kind of cryptocurrency or they affect a token or they change some property of a smart contract you can do kind of whatever you want with that or maybe you just have a boat and you can just kind of track the vote in a decentralized manner that is what I would do here if you want to learn more about that of course check out blockchain expert all right so once you have created those kind of projects the next projects I would work on would be a bit larger and more complicated but really show you what's possible to do with the blockchain so obviously what I just showed you is great those are awesome projects but what I would work on after this are larger projects related to chain link and using oracles or related to kind of layer 2 Solutions and games on the blockchain which are more complicated to implement so starting with the chain link projects first of all chain link provides a Oracle Network now what an oracle is is a way of taking offchain data say like the result in a World Cup game and bringing that on change that you can then verify that in a smart contract and do something based on that result so if you wanted to create a decentralized gambling platform or betting platform you would need offchain data like the result in a hockey game or the result in a baseball game or whatever it is so that you can actually determine who won a specific bet so this you would use chain link to do I can't really explain it much more than this in the short video you could of course check out blockchain expert wherever about to have a chain link project that does something similar to that but this is a really cool thing and shows you again how to take that offchain data Bring It On chain and utilize that in a decentralized manner alright so once you have created your sports betting or gambling app or whatever it is that you want to create I probably shouldn't be promoting that but you know what I mean right take off chain data do something with it on the blockchain just the best example is some kind of gambling stuff after you've done that what I would do is work on some kind of gate now the game that I would choose is something like poker or Blackjack the gambling games just make a lot of sense on the blockchain because you're actually dealing with money and sending money but you could even do something like rock paper scissors right you can do something whatever type of game you want do it on the blockchain however since the blockchain is fairly slow and transactions take a very long time this kind of does not allow you to have a synchronous game you have to have an asynchronous game where people are constantly clicking buttons and it's a really bad user experience so instead of doing that I would use a layer 2 solution like RollUps now roll ups allow you to bundle a lot of transactions on layer two and then take them into essentially one bundle and submit them to layer one for validation and verification so this lets you have kind of a live game where you're are having all kinds of micro transactions occurring all of those transactions get bundled then submitted to layer 1 and that allows you to do things very fast and actually have like a live game going on like you would do in a traditional kind of centralized manner with a central server now I actually have a video that goes more in depth about how RollUps work in other layer 2 solutions to allow you to do this very fast transaction processing so I'll throw that on the screen and put it in the description but I would consider getting into this kind of stuff because that's really what the future of the blockchain and web3 is going to look like trying to replicate what we currently have in a centralized fashion decentralized and with the previous projects you can't really have any live updating stuff just because of the delay and latency with the blockchain when you use a layer 2 solution you can have very fast and live updating data that allows you to create some very cool and flexible games if you want to learn more about blockchain development and become a blockchain engineer then check out blockchain expert from the link in the description it really is the best resource on the internet to become a web and blockchain developer we have spent a ton of time working on it and has a massive amount of content and after you go through that I guarantee you'll be confident to create smart contracts and have some real practical projects under your belt with that said let me end it here I hope you enjoyed and I look forward to seeing you in another YouTube video
