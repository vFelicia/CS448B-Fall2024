so the first term I have for you here is the server side slash the back end this really refers to the programs or operations that are running on the server or the remote machine so if I have say the back end of my website that's running on a remote server and this is responsible for handling HTTP requests which is the web request you send when you want to get the HTML of the page and so I hit the server it sends me the HTML and then my browser actually renders the HTML so the rendering of the HTML is happening on the front end or the client side but actually retrieving the HTML from the page while I'm getting that from the server that's running my website
