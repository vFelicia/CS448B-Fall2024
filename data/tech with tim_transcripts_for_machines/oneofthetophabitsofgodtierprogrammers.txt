you should get in the habit as early as possible of writing clean and quality code no matter what you're coding now that's what I've noticed with these kind of god tier really experienced programmers they always have the same code quality because they're so used to writing high quality clean code that they do it no matter what it's like second nature so I think you need to ask yourself here do I always write the best quality code that I can am I sometimes rushed am I sometimes skipping out on variable names or functions and if you are you might just want to consider kind of the repercussions of doing that that you're not building that habit of consistently writing quality code once you get in the habit of just always doing that it doesn't become difficult anymore becomes simple you're just always writing code in a quality way
