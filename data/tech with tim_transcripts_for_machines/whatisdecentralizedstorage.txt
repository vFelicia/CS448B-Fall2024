we all know that in today's world data is King it's the new oil the new currency and companies like Google Facebook and Amazon have built Empires on it using data to drive recommendations advertisements and more but this central control of data brings its share of problems these centralized entities not only gate your access to data deciding who sees what and when but they also profit from it they monetize your data by targeting ads based on your behavior profiting from your activity and rarely sharing these rewards with you now let's consider a personal example as a YouTube content creator all the data related to your channel your videos your views your likes it's all centrally controlled by YouTube you rely on their platform for accurate reporting but even more than that you're at their Mercy when it comes to policy changes and enforcement imagine receiving a copyright claim on one of your videos even though it's entirely your original content now this is a real problem that many creators face and even I myself have faced in the past a mistaken copyright claim can lead to your video being taken down cutting off your viewership and AD revenue and even if it's an error the process to resolve this can be long and tedious during which your content is lost in the void and so is your income this level of control can put your livelihood at risk it's for reasons like these that many are looking to decentralize storage this technology seeks to put the control of data back into the hands of users democratizing the digital landscape so now let's imagine a world where data is not stored in a single location but spread out across numerous devices worldwide this is the concept behind decentralized storage in traditional storage systems data is kept in one place such as a server or data center these centralized systems are vulnerable to hacks censorship and failures now enter decentralized storage a new method of storing data that eliminates these issues instead of storing all data in one place it is divided encrypted and spread across a network of computers or notes each node Only Stores a tiny piece of the overall data making it virtually impossible for any single point point of failure or attack when you want to retrieve your file the network finds the pieces across multiple nodes decrypts them and reassembles them into their original file this process offers enhanced security privacy and robustness against data loss in a nutshell that's how decentralized storage works now in the Quest for better data Management Solutions like ipfs and filecoin have emerged pioneering the space of decentralized storage they've made great progress but we're still just scratching the surface of this Technology's potential however exciting news is on the horizon BNB known for their Solutions like binance smart chain has just released a new and Superior alternative for decentralized storage known as BNB Greenfield now this project promises to further revolutionize how we think about data storage offering robustness privacy and control like we haven't had before in a web 3 ecosystem now I'm thrilled to share that BNB has sponsored this video and I've teamed up with them to bring you a HandsOn guide to their new decentralized storage ecosystem this is a brand new platform but today I'm I'm going to show you how you can interact with it and learn more about it completely for free alright so throughout the rest of the video I'm going to share with you more about how BNB Greenfield works and I'm going to show you a quick demo of how you can test it out using their test Network which is out right now before I do that I just want to say this is a sponsored video so everything I say you should take with a grain of salt you definitely should be skeptical but I want to put your mind kind of at ease a little bit and just say that I get all kinds of offers literally hundreds of offers from web3 and crypto related companies and I turn all of them down even if they're offering me tens of thousands and like massive amounts of money to promote them on this channel I would never tell you guys to go buy any type of cryptocurrency investment I would never even promote that or talk about that on this channel the reason I'm actually allowing BNB to sponsor this video is because this is strictly a developer technology right this is for people that want to build web3 applications they want to get access to this new kind of use case of decentralized storage and I thought a lot of you would be interested in this especially because it's free you can mess around with it and I know myself personally being being someone who's more into web3 I have an entire blockchain course as soon as I heard of this I thought that this really had a ton of cool use cases and allowed me to build some more web 3 apps that before I didn't know how I would go about building that would be fully decentralized so let me just kind of walk you through how this platform works and really what it is and then you'll see some of the use cases that become available with this type of tool again this is not any type of investment thing I'm not telling you to go buy any BNB I'm showing you this strictly from a developer perspective because of the dapps that this enables you to build I know a lot of you will find it interesting alright so let me just talk about what BNB Greenfield is well really this is a decentralized storage Network so it's a separate chain right now it's a test Network and it has a cross Chain Bridge with the binance smart chain so what that means is when you want to start using this you can buy BNB or you can get on the test Network in this case and you can transfer that directly over to BNB Greenfield so the currency that's used here is BNB and that's what you use when you're going to be paying for storage so just like you would pay for for some type of Amazon storage bucket that's the exact same thing here in BNB Greenfield now the way this works is you have a blockchain network which is BNB Greenfield you then have a network of decentralized storage providers now these decentralized storage providers are just nodes like in any other blockchain so they could be provided by a company say like Amazon web services who's providing a bunch of them for the test Network or they could be an individual like me who has a big server in my basement these storage providers put up some kind of stake this stake is their collateral so if they behave maliciously or they delete your data or they don't process your request then part of that stake will get slashed so just like how any other blockchain network works that's proof of stake that's how BNB Greenfield works so we have the Greenfield Network which is storing The Ledger of all of the metadata of the storage then the storage providers which are connected to that Network and then are processing your different requests allowing you to upload and download data in a decentralized manner I know this can be a little bit confusing the architecture is obviously more complicated than what I just described but we have the blockchain Network itself we have the storage providers and then they kind of bridge together so if you're actually going to be uploading data you're essentially picking what storage provider you want to go to You're agreeing to all of the different fees and billing which cannot change right because we're in a decentralized network here and then you're paying those fees and being able to upload download your data just like you would in any type of centralized storage Network so with that said let's have a look at some of the use cases here of BNB Greenfield so storage flexibility data configuration we kind of understand that but native smart contract ecosystem so the really cool thing here is that unlike some other type of storage we have like ipfs filecoin whatever with uh BNB Greenfield you can actually control your storage containers and upload download or access data using different smart contracts that are ethereum compatible or that are running on the binance smart chain so that means you as a developer you can build a Dap connected to binance and then you can actually give people access to say a video or a text file or a PDF or a set of exercises data that you're selling from BNB Greenfield so this was what was really cool to me because we have the ability to have permissions on data for viewership and access so if I want to sell you some type of course in a decentralized manner what I can do is actually give you access to a decentralized video that you know exists and that is sitting there and that's not going to be removed based on the logic that exists inside of the smart contract that owns that video so you pay some fee you get access to the video whereas if I was making a course and selling it centralized I could sell it to you and the next day I could shut it down and I could rip all of those videos off my central provider or alternatively my central provider like Amazon Google whatever could just turn off my storage they could delete all of my videos and all of a sudden you my paying customers have nothing to access so hopefully you kind of get the idea here but this gives you the ability to control your own data and monetize it in whatever way you see fit by writing custom logic and controlling whatever payment method you want it to be so actually as I move down here we can talk with some of the use cases so number one website hosting this is actually pretty powerful because you might have seen during covid and during a lot of other times websites can just get ripped down or taken down by storage providers let's say I have some kind of controversial website or I'm talking about something that Amazon doesn't like and I use Amazon web services well they can just delete my account and they can just get rid of my website where they can refuse me service they're fully in their legal right to do that if you're using a decentralized network that doesn't happen you can't have this censorship that we've seen happen quite often right personal cloud storage let's say you want to back up your files you want to make sure they're not going to get lost you don't want to store them with one or another provider obviously you can do that blockchain data storage so as we've seen with networks like ethereum it can be extremely expensive to store data on the blockchain with something like Greenfield that's going to be a much more affordable and just better way to do that publishing data post whatever social media token curated Registries and personal data market now there's a ton of other use cases and I'm sure you guys can probably use your imagination and come up with more but that's kind of what this net work is promising all right so with all that said let me give you a super quick demo on how you can start using this if you want and you can literally go on the test net in the next like 10 minutes and actually upload some data and View kind of all the permissions and how everything works all right so to start working with this technology what you need to do first of all is have metamask set up on your computer now I've already got the installed I'll imagine most of you do as well next what you're going to do is go to this BNB chain list and you're going to add the different test networks that you need so you can actually start working with BNB Greenfield now this link that I have right here is just a quick start guide I'll link that in the description if you want to click through this but if I click on this link here you can see it says bnbchainless.org this shows you all of the different chains that are here so what I can do is I can connect my wallet okay so I'm connected right now and then I can select the different networks that I want so the network that I need here is the Greenfield Mekong test net or however you pronounce that so I can click on that and click add to metamask and then we'll add it here now I am already on that Network so it's not going to add it for me you can just automatically add that to metamask then you also want the BNB smart chain testnet the reason you need that one is because you need to transfer assets from BNB smart chain to the BNB Greenfield Network okay so add both of those to metamask once you have those on metamask we're going to go access a faucet the faucet is going to give us some BNB we then can transfer that BNB into the BNB Greenfield token and then we can actually just start working with the decentralized storage so to access some BNB we need to go to the BNB Discord so click this link it will give you a invite to the Discord the URL here is if I can go here BNB chain so discord.com invite slash BNB chain let me open this up here okay and now that you're in here what you need to do is kind of accept the rules or whatever you're going to go to start here I think you need to like click on something like I accept the rules go to rules click on any of the roles here I just selected all of them then you're gonna go to the testnet faucet now from the test net faucet Channel you just type slash faucet and then your BNB address so the way you can get that address if you're not familiar is you can go back to Chrome here you can go to metamask make sure you're on the correct Network so you're going to be on the BNB smart chain testnet just going to click this button right here which will copy the account address and then if you go back to Discord you can just paste that in and hit enter when you do that it's going to send you some BNB you'll see for me if I can get down to present that is going to tell me I can't make another request because I just did one this morning but that will give you 0.1 BNB which will be enough to kind of interact with the test Network you can run this command every 24 hours so that's how you access the faucet from the faucet or once you access the faucet you'll get sent that BNB and then you can interact with Greenfield so there's this software right here called the seller now D Cellar is a user interface it's a website that you can go to and it acts just like almost Google Drive where you can just upload files uh delete files Etc so that's what I'm going to show you how to use there's also a ton of different commands you can run here from the command line I won't walk you through that because I'm sure many of you will kind of mess with that on your own if you're interested in that okay so I'm going to go here to deseller now from deseller we need to connect our wallet so I'm just going to disconnect this so that I can kind of show you the process again so I'm going to click on connect wallet I'm going to go to metamask then I'm just going to choose the account here once this finish is loading all right so let's get a popup metamask it's asking me to switch networks to the Green Field Network so I'm going to go ahead and do that and then it's going to ask me to sign this now this signature here is essentially allowing the DAP kind of access to my account such that I can upload delete files all of that because really what we're using on this website right it's just adapt and the DAP is what's kind of controlling the Green Field Network so I'm just going to go ahead and sign this it asks you to sign a few things okay so that's fine we'll assign this sign and then it brings up here don't worry about this error everything is fine and from here we can create storage buckets and do what we need to however for some of you you're not going to have access to enough BNB tokens right like you haven't done the transfer yet so what you'll need to do is go here to where it says wallet let me make this full screen and you're going to transfer tokens from the BNB smart chain using this kind of link that they have this bridge to BNB Greenfield now you'll see that I already have tokens so these are the tokens I have available in my Green Field balance because I already transfer them but for you what you'll need to do is transfer in so you're going to switch networks so what I need to do is switch to BNB smart chain okay so let's go ahead and do that and then I have the ability to type in any BNB that I have so like zero points whatever that I want to transfer and then I can transfer that across to BNB Greenfield now I can also switch this around and then I can transfer from BNB Greenfield to binance Smart chain so you can see I have a few tokens so I can do 0.05 like that and I can transfer that off okay so let me go ahead and sign this and we'll do that confirmation and you'll see that I will now transfer out all right so that transfer finished I was just trying to show you that this does work now what we can do is go to buckets and we can create a storage bucket if we have enough tokens right I showed you already have some tokens for you guys you'll need to transfer to get them so I'm going to go to new bucket I can name this bucket whatever I want so long as it follows some of the rules so let's go with Tim's bucket like that uh only lowercase letters okay so Tim's buckets not nuggets bucket okay looks like that's fine uh gas fee is this okay so let's go ahead and create that and we can also choose the storage provider that we want to use now right now Amazon web services is providing some of these uh providers or some of these storage buckets here I'm just going to go ahead and use that one it doesn't really matter okay so I have to sign this transaction and pay that small gas fee to go ahead and create the bucket once the bucket is created I can then go ahead and upload files alright so Tim's bucket has been created if I click into here we can go ahead and make a file so I can upload something up to 256 megabytes that's during the test net phase eventually that'll be much larger so let me go pick a file to upload and we'll see how that works alright so I'm just uploading a file here called blockchainexpert.png that's the course I have for web3 development so you can see here that we have this prelock storage fee now depending on the size of your file this will be different if it's larger it's going to be more but this is essentially to make sure that you're always going to be able to access this asset because anytime you download and upload this kind of costs a certain amount of money so what this is saying here is okay we're going to put this file here but depending on the amount of times that someone downloads it we're going to need to charge a certain amount for that so we're going to lock this fee just to ensure that we can always allow someone to download this file now in this case it's literally less than a cent you can see it's like a micro BNB uh anyways there's more information about this on the website but it has to do with kind of downloading uploading and accessing that file all right so I'm going to upload this file let's give this a second to complete and then let's see what we can do from there alright so you can see this file has been uploaded now inside of my bucket which I can view I can go here and I can decide to delete it or I can view the metadata of this which is stored on the blockchain so here you can see this is private to me meaning no one else can access this it's only my wallet that currently has permission now I can go and change some of those permissions if I want but for now you can see when we uploaded it the prime primary sorry storage provider address and their seal address as well as the object hash which you don't really need to know and then I can download this if I like okay now what else can we do here if I press on this it says there's some quota to download I'll go ahead and click confirm and you'll see that it will download this file for me and now I get the image appearing that did cost me a tiny tiny amount but again a fraction of a BNB to do that okay so let me get out of this now and then let's continue alright so I think with that said that's pretty much everything I wanted to cover I will mention that if you want to do the permissions or more advanced logic obviously you got to write that into adapt or you can go to the command line tool and you can start giving different addresses permissions to different files right now this is completely private again meaning only you can access and view this no one else on the network has access you'd have to give them permission to do that anyways I think this is a really cool technology hopefully you guys got some value from this video and you're going to mess around with BNB Greenfield it's completely free I'll leave all the links you need in the description down below and I'd love if you let me know what you think of it in the comments with that said I'll wrap it up I hope you enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe the channel and I will see you in the next one thank you
