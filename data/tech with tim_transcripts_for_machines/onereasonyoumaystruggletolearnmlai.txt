if you want to get good at machine learning this is not something you're going to do overnight you're not going to learn it in a month or a week or something like that this is going to take time a lot of practice and can definitely be very frustrating and intimidating as you're getting into it at the start I see a lot of people on my channel you'll want to go and build Ai and that's great I definitely encourage them to try to do that but you will reach a point where your lack of math understanding May hold you back and then you're gonna have to spend time winning some fairly advanced math concepts like linear algebra calculus gradient descent for example and unlike programming you do actually need to have a decent math background to really make good use and understand what is going on in machine learning
