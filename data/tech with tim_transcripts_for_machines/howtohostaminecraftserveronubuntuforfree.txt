hello everyone and welcome back so in this video what I'm redoing is showing you how to host a minecraft server on a bun to Linux and specifically for free for at least your first four months now that's thank to thanks to the node for sponsoring this video they're giving us a free $20 credit towards our servers whenever we sign up here so you guys will actually be able to run this for 4 months for free using those basic plan on the node now I know you're like well how am I gonna run a massive minecraft server what I would recommend you guys do is just get your minecraft server set up on the cheapest plan get everything working and then you can always transfer over the world the plugins and everything else to a different server once you've done that so if you just want to mess with it and you know kind of do some administrative stuff this is a good way to do that to start so you can sign up there's a link below or you can also just use this code twt 19 and that will give you $20 off on the node now let's kind of go through the steps here that we're gonna need to take but before I do that I just need to make a really quick announcement I am thinking about hosting a minecraft server for the tech with Tim community you guys are interested in that please let me know in the comments down below I'm only gonna do it if I have enough interest I also don't know what gamemode to make it so you know if you have an idea like factions creative whatever that is leave a comment ok so the first step that we need to do is on our host computer so not actually the one that we're gonna be running the minecraft server on we need to download this minecraft server jar now I would say just download this on a bun you can do that if you have a web browser on your bunting machine and you can get to this minecraft page and I'll again there'll be a link down below but this is just a minecraft server jar it's from The Minecraft website you need to I believe actually I don't think you need to be logged in to do this because I'm not logged in right now but anyways download that jar and we're gonna transfer it over to our server once we get to that point now the next thing we need to do is download putty now this is an SSH client there actually is a builtin SSH client for the node but it is kind of buggy and this just works a bit better so that's why we're gonna use this so you know we can download putty by clicking this already a bit downloaded again link in the description we also need win SCP although you don't need to use this specific woman you just need some kind of file transfer software like FileZilla where you can transfer things to your server so download this there's link in the description okay so now that we've done that we need to setup our server so if you have your own a bunch of machine your going hosting this you know like you have access to that machine like the physical device then you don't need to follow this specific step but if you don't then follow along with me what I'm gonna do is create a new lanoline DUP here click that link and what I'm gonna do is choose my distribution as a bun to 18 point 0.4 um I would recommend you do anything at this level or above it to guarantee this tutorial is gonna work for you and then for my plan onla note you can pick between all of these and if you want to run a four gig server for one month for free you have that $20 credits you can do that but I'm just gonna pick this nano twitch is the cheapest one it's $5 a month and then what I'm gonna do here is give a name to my server and I'm gonna call it tutorial now I also need to pick the region which is up here I'm gonna pick Toronto Ontario is that's what I'm closest to the you guys can pick through here these are just the different regions the note has now what I'm gonna do is actually enter a root password here this is how we're gonna login to our server so make sure this this is secure and you remember the password and then other than that I think we're actually good to go now I will show you quickly here that this is actually really cool the node has a one click option for minecraft servers so if you click one click up here you can actually just click minecraft latest and if you do this it'll select you can go through all these settings and select and create a minecraft server the only issue with this is it creates a completely vanilla minecraft server and you can't what do you call it like modify it from the console it's just really difficult to work with but all you want is like a vanilla minecraft server then just do the oneclick minecraft and that'll do it for you ok so I realize clicking that that cleared my thing anyways I just filled this back in now what we're gonna do is click create to once we're done this will take a second to boot up the node and get started if you chose the oneclick option this is gonna take you probably like five to ten minutes because that's to actually create the minecraft server for you but once this is done we'll be right back and we'll move on with the next steps alright so now that we've booted up here we're ready to grab the IP address of the server and connect to it so to do that what we're gonna do is go to networking tab here we're gonna look for this ipv4 tab and then this address right here so mine is one 72.1 oh five to one dot one to nine now don't give this to people unless they're gonna be connecting to your minecraft server but anyways I'm gonna be deleting this after so it's not really a huge deal so anyways that's our address we need that I'm gonna copy that address onto my clipboard and I'll show you quickly that if you want to SSH into the server really quickly what you can use is just this launch console tab here specifically from Berlin ode and it will bring up this right here so you can see it's actually just running through some server commands but this is the SSH that it has again I'm not gonna be using that just because putty is a little bit easier to work with and it's nice to learn how to use it because you can use that for any server so what I'm gonna do is open putty now I'm assuming you guys have downloaded this I'll zoom in here so you guys can see but what I'm gonna do is connect to the server so I have that address here so I'm gonna put that as the host name or IP address I'm gonna leave this port as 22 and what I'm gonna do is actually save a new session in putty so that I don't have to type this IP address in every time so what I'm gonna do is just save this as minecraft server tutorial you can see I have a few things up here already and I'm gonna click Save now when I do that it's gonna save this profile so it's gonna save this port name and this host IP into putty and I'm just gonna do one more thing because I want to make it the font a little bit bigger here so you guys can read it I'm gonna change my font size to 26 and I'm gonna go back to logging now our session sorry and just save one more time to minecraft server tutorial so now every time I run this my font size will be 26 and we'll be able to see that from the console so once we do that we're gonna click open you can see it's gonna bring up this kind of message just click yes everything's fine there when we log in we're gonna log in as the root user on a bun too and we're gonna put the password as whatever that root password is that you guys typed in when you created your server now this will take a second but once we get in here we should see this kind of screen popping up and now we're actually gonna get to starting to work on the minecraft server so what I'm gonna do is just change directory back into the home directory so I'm gonna CD dot dot on a hit LS here and now what I can do is choose where I want to put my minecraft server so I can put it in the root directory or the home directory it doesn't really matter but what I'm gonna do is change directories into my home directory so CD home and when I do that it'll bring me into home and now what I'm going to do is create a new folder so I'm gonna say m'kay der which stands for make directory and I'm gonna call this minecraft this is where I'm gonna store all of the Minecraft files that I need so now what I'm gonna do is CD into minecraft like that and just I can type LS and you can see there's nothing in this directory okay so now that we've done that what we need to do is transfer over the minecraft server jar to this and put it inside of that folder and this is where when SCP comes in so I'm gonna open win SCP here and this is just a file transfer client right so you guys can you know use whatever one you want but this is the one for this tutorial and what I'm gonna do where it says new site is I'm gonna put in the host name of our server which is just simply the IP address on port number 22 I'm gonna put the user name as root and the password as that password and I believe this blocks it out so I can type it in okay now we will hit save and we can save this as just the IP address or you can call it you know minecraft server or whatever you want I'll just save it as the IP address and then go ahead and click login it'll probably give you this message just click yes and then you can type in that root password one more time should be able to gain access to the server and now we can just kind of look through the file structure of our bond to server so you can see it starts us in the root directory but we can go back by just clicking up here you know we have all these directories and we can go into home now home is where we have this minecraft folder so we go there we have minecraft and now what we're gonna do is find that minecraft server jar from our computer and drag it on to here so mine is in downloads I'm just gonna find it on my other screen here cuz I have a few things so I'm gonna take this server file I'm not sure if you can see my mouse button and just drag it in here so I had it in my download so I just took it and just dragged it in and we're good to go now now this will take a second to transfer over once this is done I'll continue with the tutorial we'll keep going okay so now we have this server jar file on our minecraft server and we are actually good to just close this win SCP because we don't need this anymore now I will quickly say though the reason I got you guys to download this as well is well obviously to transfer this over but you can use this to back up your world so if you want to make backups of your Minecraft world what you can do is just log in here take that world file in the world directory and just drag it on to your home computer and then that way you have a backup on another computer in case anything happens with your server okay so I'm gonna close this and now we should still be logged in in this root panel now so if I click LS now in here you should see we have this server jar file so now what we need to do is actually create a script to run the server jar file now this is on the minecraft website they actually have the exact script to run here so I'm just gonna take this and copy this so it's Java xmx 1,024 what I would or whatever whatever and it says minecraft server 1.1 point for jar no GUI but we're gonna need to change that to just say server jar because that's the name of the server we downloaded so I'll show you anyways how this works what we're gonna do is make a script that we can simply just run that will run the minecraft server so if we ever turn it off we don't need to type that in it can just run it for us so what I'm gonna do is type in Nano and I'm gonna type Nano start underscore server dot Sh so we're gonna do Nano start underscore server sh now that we have that it should bring up this text editor what I'm gonna do is copy in that command that I copied so I copied that from my home computer and to copy it in here what I did is just right clicked on my mouse you can't hit control V that's not gonna work now what we need to do here is modify this a bit depending on what you're using so I'm gonna tell you what these arguments mean here so X MX and SMS stands for how much RAM you're allocating to your server and allocating just means like how much you're lettin it use now right now this is saying 1024 megabytes of RAM is the minimum amount of RAM we'll use because that's X m/s and 1024 megabytes of RAM is the maximum amount we'll use so what you can do is if you have a server that has more than one gig of ram change this and bump this number up so if you have two gigs of ram then you would change this number to be 2048 and you can change the bottom half as well here to be 2048 now since we only have one gig of ram we can just give it all of that so 1024 1024 and then when it says minecraft server love of allah jar we just need to change this name to be whatever that server is that we dragged in now in our case our jar file is literally just called server jar so we'll do that and we should be good to go now so to save what we can do is simply hit ctrl X it will ask you if you want to save you can hit Y to save and then hit enter to save it as start underscore server SH okay so now that we've done that what we're gonna do is just run a quick update on our machine before we do anything else so just sudo apt get update now that's just gonna update the machine for us and make sure we have the most recent version of everything you need and this could take a while depending on how old the server is that you're using so run that it'll take a second I'll be back when that's done alright so the next step is to make sure we have a Java installed now I think you can literally just type Java and you can see if you have it but this shows you the commands to install it so apt install open JDK 8 JRE headless so once you run the the installer which I'm going to show you in a second if for some reason that says like you don't have Java installed or that doesn't work you can run these commands so sudo apt install open JDK 8 JRE headless now what the headless means is if you don't have a monitor and keyboard physically attached to the machine that's the one you usually install so in this case we would install this one and then we should be good to go okay so small realisation I don't have Java on this machine I thought I did so if you type Java it tells you the exact command you need to install it so I'm just gonna copy this apt install so now that I've done that apt install open JDK 8 JRE headless it's gonna install Java it's gonna ask me if I want to install this I'll click Y free yes we'll go through the install and then once this is done I'll be back and we should have Java and be ready to go so now what I'm gonna do is actually run and make that file that we just created an executable so if we do LS we see we have two files now so start server SH and this is what we're gonna do to run the server so to make this an executable what I actually need to do is do chmod plus X and then do start server SH and hit enter okay my bad there so there's no so there's no space are there is a space in between chmod and + X I just didn't have there so I was confused anyway so chmod space plus X is H this will make this file an executable for us now for some reason it says like you don't permission to do this just type sudo before the command so chmod plus X and then start serve it on Sh and the reason how I'm getting that is I'm just hitting tab once I do st and it fills it in for me and what I will try to do is now run that executable file so LS again it's called start server dot SH so to run this we do dot slash start server dot SH and hit enter now if you don't get any output immediately just give it a second it takes a minute to load so here let's see what we actually just got now so this worked this ran I know it says failed to load properties from file server at our properties failed to load you load text you need to agree to the EULA in order around the server so what does this mean well a lot of people get stuck on this but what this does is just me you have to agree to like the terms and conditions before it lets you run this so if we hit LS now to list all the things you see we have some new files now we have server dot properties we have logs and we have ulla text or ever you say that so what we're gonna do is edit this EULA text again I'm butchering how you say that but we'll do Nano you got dot txt now what we're gonna do is literally just come in here and change this to say true so we say true and then ctrl X do you want to modify yes we hit Y hit enter okay now that we've done that what we can do is run the server again and now it should start generating the world and actually creating the spawn area now this will take a few minutes so I'm gonna fastforward through it but once this is finished running I'll show you what it looks like alright so now the server is up and running we're actually in like the main console so the first thing I would ask tell you has to probably do is just op yourself so you're gonna op your username so just literally type in your user name mr. hippo 9 I know interesting minecraft username anyways we'll do that op your user and then that way when you go on the server you can actually you know be an OP and do stuff so you might get these things so I can't keep up the server overloading it's running this may ticks behind that's just because we only have one gig of ram on the server it's fine to run like 1 or 2 people on the server at once you're gonna be running like a lot of people you need to have more RAM on your minecraft server but anyways for now that's fine okay so now our minecraft server is actually running which means we can connect to it so I'm gonna log into minecraft I'm gonna show you how we can connect but it's pretty much as simple as literally just taking this IPO so whatever one our server is and typing that in like the Direct Connect of Minecraft and just joining now make sure obviously when you launch minecraft you're in the right minecraft version but it'll tell you that if it's not working so I'm gonna launch minecraft log in and then show you guys I'll be right back alright so I'm here in minecraft now I'm in the direct connect window what I'm gonna do is just you know join the server now and show you that this does indeed work umm alright let's see here okay I am in the server and we can see that everything is working that's actually an interesting spawn point why I never I haven't played minecraft in a while there's a lot of new stuff I'm looking like in the sea here but anyways I'm a nob so that means I can do like /tp I can do slash op I can do all these commands I can do everything right so that is how that works and there we go we are in the minecraft server so I mean that's all good and nice I'm just gonna show you guys a few more things because I want to show you what happens if I close this so the way that we're running the minecraft server right now is this kind of the way that the way that we're running it is connected to our display which means that if I close this window the minecraft server will actually turn off so I'm going to show you how we can run this without turning the minecraft server off so first to quit the server I think I can just do quit or can I do like stop yes stop so to stop the server from here I'll do stop we'll give that a second it'll save the chunks all of that now if I want to run the server continuously regardless of if I have this computer on or not what I need to do is use something called screen so start by typing screen and seeing if that works for you most computers should come with screen but if for some reason you don't have it what you can do is to do sudo apt get install screen and then that should install it for you so again I'll read through do all this and yeah anyways so what we're gonna do is just type screen and then we're gonna do dot slash start server SH so by running screen before this it will detach this process from our display which means that the minecraft server will run continuously and we'll just be able to connect to whatever so let's hit enter and you can see that it kind of gives us a little bit of a different look here now it gets rid of all that console stuff the we'll start running it will go the minecraft server will boot up and we will be good to go so that is kind of it for creating the minecraft server again I want to thank you say thank you to Lou node for sponsoring this video definitely take advantage of this $20 credits the note is awesome they have a lot of support if you guys have any troubles with some of the stuff and setting some things up you can always contact the know they have a 24 hour support team and they will probably be able to help you at least guide you in the right direction on what to do now last thing here is well on low note is actually opening a new data center by the end of 2019 in Australia so if you guys are from Australia that's actually pretty exciting because typically they don't have like hosting companies and servers that have anything in Australia so that's a good way to take advantage of this and use it so anyways that has been it for how to create a Minecraft so if you guys enjoy please make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and let me know what type of minecraft server I should run for you guys in the future
