hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to be sharing with you an exciting new feature that's coming to python version 3.10 which is structural pattern matching now this is very similar to a switch statement if you've seen that in other programming languages except this is much more powerful and you can do way more than you can do with most switch statements in most programming languages in fact the keyword for this is not switch it is match and you'll see why it's called that in a second as i kind of go through and give you a mini tutorial on this feature now before we dive into that i need to mention that python 3.10 is currently in beta so i'm filming this video on august 6th 2021 when i'm filming this it's in beta i don't know the beta version exactly but anyways if you want to download the beta you can do that from the link in the description from the python website i'm running it on my computer right now seems relatively stable but things could change when this feature is released now there's also a lot of other new features coming in python version 3.10 i mean the main one is structural pattern matching but you also have parenthesized context managers you have a few other random things like this that i don't care about mostly related to syntax errors but i will leave this document in the description in case you guys care to look at it alright so let's go ahead and dive into this new feature but first i need to talk to you about something that is not new which is the sponsor of this video before we get started i

clicking the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform all right so as promised i'm going to show you structural pattern matching so let's just go ahead and dive in i will show you the syntax for a match statement so in other programming languages you may see something like this you may see switch then you have some variable here so let's say we have x equals hello and then maybe you switch on x and then what you do is something like case and maybe you do hello here as the case and then you write something like print it is hello and then you usually see this break keyword now the python syntax for the match statement is very similar but the difference here is that the switch statement only allows you to directly check if this value here is equal to x so you can have a bunch of different cases and it just checks if x is equal to these things with the match statement you can actually do pattern matching hence why it's called the match statement not just the switch statement okay anyways let me comment all of that out and let me show you the match statement so the match statement looks like this very similar syntax you match on some variable then you define some case in this case i will say hello you do a colon and then in python obviously everything is indented so we indent one block and then we can do whatever it is that we want if this is the case for x so here if i print i don't know it is hello we'll keep that same case and i will just add another case and show you how this actually works so obviously you can add as many cases as you want uh i will go with high and i'll just say it is high all right so if i run this here x is equal to hello we should see that we get it is hello printing out so it just checks the value of x against all of these cases checks the first case first obviously if that is the case no pun intended it prints this and skips the rest of the cases okay so let's go here and make this high if i run this notice you get it is hot so that's the most basic example you can check if some value is a bunch of other values and some people argue this is more readable than doing like an if or lf statement because this example right here you can replicate using if alif or just multiple if statements right okay nice so that is basic but now what i need to show you is what's known as the default case so notice here if i just have an empty string for example nothing's going to print out because there is no case for the empty string however if i want to have a default case a case that is kind of like the else for my switch saving here a match statement what i do is the following i do case underscore underscore i don't think it's i believe it's called the wild card character i'm not sure exactly what this is uh but essentially when you do an underscore that will match with anything so in this case if i go print and then i just go not a case like that and i run this you're going to see that we get not a case didn't mean to open that new file so that is how you do it the default case now this seems interesting this is cool but this is just like any other switch statement at this point in time now i'm going to show you some cool examples so let me remove this here in fact let me get rid of all of this i'm gonna bring in an example that i have on my other screen here uh it's called example two really this should be example one but you get the idea so this is something that you can actually do with the match statement it looks a little bit overwhelming but i'll walk you through it right here so i have a function called example two and notice we're matching on chords now chords is meant to be coordinates and we're meant to accept a tuple now what i can actually do here is i can check if this tuple is equal to zero zero that's pretty much the same thing i showed you before if that's the case i print origin however what i also can do is check parts of this tuple so i can say okay is the first element zero and is the second element anything that's kind of what this is saying right here i'm saying let's check if the first element is zero and then the second element will represent by y and all we care about is the fact that y exists that we have some second element and if that's the case we have zero as the first element and we have some second element that second element will actually get assigned to the variable one so to show you a really simple example here let's just zoom out a little bit if i go example underscore two and then i pass a zero and a one notice you're going to see we get vertical line at y equals one so it prints out the value of the second element in my tuple now same thing works here we have x zero so we check if we have some value for x and then we have a zero so let's swap this around let's go one zero notice we get horizontal line at x equals one now where it starts to get a little bit more advanced is right here at this case so for this case i have x comma y if x equals equals y now this is formally called a guard and what this means is we're going to check this condition before we get into this case so we're saying do we have a tuple that has two elements if we do assign the first element x assign the second element to y sorry and then if x is equal equal to y print x equals y so let's test that and let's go 1 1 like that notice that we get x equals y all right now we also can do this one right here so x y if the abs of x is equal to the abs of y so in this case i go negative 1 1 you're gonna see that we get the absolute value of x equals the absolute value of y and then notice here i've used two wild cards so what this is saying is do i have two elements in a tuple if i do we just print okay these are valid coordinates so let's do something that's not the case there so negative two and one and we get valid chords and then of course we have our default case right here so if i just do you know some random value let's just go with the string like a uh we get invalid coordinates because this again matches with anything so there you go that is the second example kind of showing you the power of the match case here right we can check parts of for in this example a tuple but we also could check just like more advanced patterns in general these are relatively simple patterns but i'm going to show you how we can do some even more complicated ones so let me remove this and let me bring in my example three and this example has some more advanced stuff that uses an interval which is a list although a top was an iterable as well but hopefully you get the idea all right so let's just have a look at this right here so what we can actually do is we can check if we have an element in our list now that's similar to what we did with the tuples but this just checks if we have at least one element doesn't care what the element is if we have sorry not at least if we have exactly one element then we print one element now here same thing two elements right if we have exactly two elements we print two elements now here i'm checking if i have three elements but i'm assigning their values to x y and z printing out those three values and here is where it gets a little bit interesting right i have x y comma z asterisk a now if you haven't seen uh star args and star star quarks before essentially what this allows you to do is accept unlimited arguments coming after this so really as this says right here this is going to be three or more elements so you have to have at least three elements but we can accept any more than three elements here and then we'll match that case so if you have at least three elements and then any other number of elements it could be zero elements it could be 25 more elements they'll all get stored in a and in fact i can print out a here and show you how that works in a second and then lastly here we go to uh this one so x y z underscore comma a so now what this one is saying is okay you must have four elements we're going to store the first three elements in x y and z and then we'll accept any number of elements after that in the list okay and then finally we have our default case so if we don't match any of these we will automatically match with this one and of course you don't need the default case okay so let me show you uh this case right here so if i go to example three and i pass a list that's one two three four five six like that see that we end up getting here three elements or more and then it shows us the three last elements that gets stored in value a or in variable a now notice here that this case didn't get matched even though we had four elements and then we had two more elements coming after the reason this case didn't get matched is because this one is always going to be matched before this case so if we want this case to exist we need to actually move it above this case here because this will always uh sorry this will always match anything that this case matches hopefully that kind of makes sense but this is saying three elements or more this is four elements or more so if we have four elements or more we'll always match with the case three elements or or more sorry so now if i move this case up here like that and i run this we get four elements or more there you go now there's some more stuff that you can do with this but i'm going to let you guys explore that for yourself but this is kind of all i wanted to show you in this video how this match statement works this is a very powerful thing you can write some really interesting code with this and i just think it makes it way more readable too when you're trying to check specifically one variable and see what value it is or check you know more advanced stuff like this like how many elements it has you get the idea anyways i hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel i will see you in another one you
