let's talk about computer science degrees in 2024 do you need one is it worth it and can you actually become a selftaught developer in today's market now I'm in a unique position to make this video because I actually completed five out of eight semesters of my computer science degree so I know what the degree is like I know the type of things that you learn but then at the same time I dropped out and I was able to land software development positions afterwards I know a lot of people that have gone through the degree both successfully and unsuccessfully and at the same time I teach programming here on YouTube I have paid courses I have free courses and I get emails every single day from people telling me that they've landed a software development position yes even today in 2024 with or without the degree because of the type of things they've learned from me or other resources online for example I just had a student come out of one of my paid courses the one with course careers he landed a job in four months without a computer science degree and that's obviously going to be a bit rare not everyone's going to be able to do that but you can do this with or without a degree and in this video I genuinely just want to give you all the information so that you can make the best decision that's right for you some of you should get a degree some of you should not get a degree but you need to know what's involved before you make a very major decision that is going to impact the rest of your life so with that said let's get into it so let's get right into it by discussing what a computer science degree is not it is not a gateway to a really high income it is not a guarantee that you're going to have job stability or a bunch of money and it is definitely not something that teaches you everything you need to land a job and today in 2024 it's actually not a requirement for a lot of the different jobs that you might be applying for yes a lot of jobs will say computer science degree required but if you have the other requirements a lot of times they will look past that just to give you an example I have worked for a lot of companies where they do list computer science degre required but when they see my credentials they don't care and they still hire me the truth is people want to know that you are a good fit for the job as much as a computer science degree can help be an indicator of that if you can prove yourself in other ways often times you can get past that requirement I know a lot of you don't believe me but I see this every single day if you're overqualified or more qualified than someone that has a computer science degree you will still have a chance for a job even if it does list that as a requirement now with that in mind what is a computer science degree well computer science degree is a recognized credential it's accredited it looks good on your resume and there is a lot of jobs in other sectors that require some kind of 4year degree even if you're not going to be working as a computer science now it's also gateway to working in Academia if you want to be a professor if you want to do a master's if you want to do anything very theoretical you will need a computer science degree another thing that a lot of people don't think about is that this is actually a requirement for a lot of visas if you want to go work overseas a lot of times you do need to have a bachelor's degree if you want to move to a country like Singapore there's actually a big list of requirements and a degree can significantly help you qualify for some of the different visas there an issue that I'm having right now maybe I want to move to Singapore in a few years it's going to be a lot more difficult to do that because I don't have have this degree obviously it's also required if you want to do anything in the math field if you want to do things like machine learning there is some specific disciplines within programming where it is pretty much mandatory to have this fouryear degree because of the type of work that you're doing and the things that you're learning in a computer science degree you actually need to use in those fields now another thing that we can't forget a computer science degree is extremely expensive and that's what I'm going to be getting into in this video What It Is What It Isn't and where you actually get the value because for some of you it will be Roi positive but for a lot of you it will not so now let's get into some very important things that you need to understand about this industry whether you have a degree or you do not have a degree most of what you will actually be doing on the job and the skills that you need you will need to learn on your own you will learn those from online sources you'll probably learn from a lot of different sources whether it be a course a boot camp free educational material textbooks doesn't matter most of what you actually need to know the requirements that will be listed in a job posting you are not going to learn from a computer science degree now this is really unfortunate but computer science degrees are fairly out ofd in the degree that I did I would say about 25% of the material that I learned was actually effective and something that I needed on the job and considering how much you're paying considering how much time you're putting into it that's a pretty low percentage and obviously this does depend on the school and the type of program you go to I was in a very midlevel average computer science program probably familiar or similar to what a lot of you would end up doing or currently doing right now so what you you really need to understand here is that if you do decide to go get a degree that's fine but you're going to need to do a significant amount of work outside of the degree you're going to have to be working on projects you're going to have to be learning Frameworks you're probably going to have to go through other paid courses or material as well as the degree because truthfully most of the things that it teaches are not what you actually need to know to land a software engineering job a computer science degree is extremely theoretical it teaches you a lot of math it teaches you a ton of theory and you learn about a lot of topics that do increase your comprehension and your understanding but they don't directly translate over into the job so yes you may have a better fundamental understanding of why certain algorithms work the way that they do but you still need to learn a lot of other things that aren't taught in that program many degrees are going to require understanding of Frameworks understanding of different languages practical projects or actual experience building software and unfortunately in the computer science degree you really don't learn a lot of that in fact in my computer science degree again only about 20% of what we actually did was coding most of it was math you actually have to take a lot of other courses as well in my case was a ton of electives I had to do that had nothing to do with computer science and yes you do get some value from these topics but we do need to relate that back to the cost which we're going to talk about in a second now another very important thing I want you to understand is that the best developers are going to be the best developers whether they have a degree or not there's certain personality traits that lend themselves really well to being a pro programmer and there is kind of a bare minimum intelligence that you have to have if you really want to be successful in this field now I don't like to say that because generally I do want to encourage everyone to try this if they're interested in it but truthfully there's some people that are never going to be good programmers if you really struggle using a computer if you already struggle with basic math or this logical uh thinking reasoning is already a difficult skill for you truthfully computer science is probably not a path you want to go down and whether you have a computer science degree or not you're probably not going to be very successfully in the industry whereas if we look at the other end of the scale someone who's very intelligent naturally who's really good at logical thinking critical thinking reasoning they're going to be a good developer if they put the work in whether they have a degree or not they don't need one to be successful maybe it will make it a bit faster for them truthfully it probably wouldn't it probably be faster to go through the selftaught route but they'll be good regardless and we see that with some of the smartest people that have become very successful through the tech field Bill Gates Elon Musk Mark Zuckerberg all of these guys were already really good at programming before they got into their degrees or at least during the degrees and that degree is not the reason why they ended up being very successful obviously I'm using outliers here but I'm just trying to illustrate that the degree really is not an indication of how good of a programmer you're going to be there's certain personality traits certain intelligence levels and a lot of other character traits that will indicate that a lot more than Simply Having a piece of paper or going through some kind of program so now we get into costs now obviously we have two costs here financial and time on the financial side pretty obvious this costs a significant amount of money on the very very lowend side maybe we're paying $10,000 a year for tuition plus where we're living plus our food plus textbooks plus other miscellaneous expenses at University and on the highend side or probably the average side if we go to school in the United States we're paying maybe $50,000 per year if we go to a highend or topend School regardless of where you go you're racking up tens of thousands of dollars in expenses through these four years for most of us it's going to be a minimum of 4 your $50,000 and realistically probably closer to $100,000 and again in the US probably closer to $200,000 that is a lot of money that we could spend in another place if we actually even had the money and for most of us we don't have enough to pay for that our parents are not financing it for us and that means that we are going to have a ton of debt debt is just a nightmare you don't want to start your life with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt especially when you don't actually have a job or you have absolutely no guarantee I know a lot of you know that but even if you do have all of the money we still need to consider time spending four years of your life at University is a huge commitment and what happens to a lot of people is they spend two or three years there like I did and then they drop out and they don't actually even get the achievement that's something you need to consider if you decide to commit to a degree like this you need to finish it if you spend 2 and a half years 3 years four years and you don't have prospects outside of the degree and you just simply don't want to do it or you're not capable of doing it you've just wasted a ton of money and time that you're never getting back so think about that how many people don't actually complete a computer science degree a significant portion I can tell you almost 50% of the first year class I had didn't end up finishing the degree or switched into a different program beyond that a lot of people aren't able to finish in four years takes the five years or six years because it's too difficult and they need to extend the lifespan by only doing say four courses per semester or three courses per semester it's difficult and now maybe you decide to add on Coop maybe you take a semester Gap because you need a break whatever all the things that could happen in four years that you can't possibly predict and you're extending this even more and you're not making your first bit of money until you're 23 or 24 years old now that's the time commitment and you have to ask yourself what else could I do with four or five years how far could I get in my career whether it be in computer science or any other field if I didn't actually go through a computer science degree if I gave you four years and I said hey here's $10,000 in 4 years become a selftaught developer I think you're going to have a lot of success in that time frame compared to just going to University and like I said the issue is once you finish this fouryear degree now you still need to learn a bunch of extra stuff to actually qualify for a job you have to do all the leak code you have to prepare for interviews you have to learn all of these different topics that weren't actually taught in the computer science degree unless you were learning it while you were doing that and you're equally as unprepared to get a job as someone who's a complete Junior just starting out you might know a little bit more but generally speaking you're nonexpert level programmer you don't actually understand software design you haven't built a lot of real world projects and that's just like a lot of the other Junior Engineers so my point here is that if you do want to do a computer science degree it does have some benefits but you better be able to pay for it you better be knowing that this is the best use of your 4 years and while you're in the computer science degree you have to grind a lot to learn additional topics if you actually want the chance of Landing a job when you come out now with that in mind if you have a really clear goal on why you're getting this degree and you know that this actually is a requirement for what you want to do maybe you want to do Master's maybe you want to be a professor sure that probably is the best use of your four years and potentially the best use of your money the point is you really need to factor this and compare it to what else you could be doing with both the money and the time and really genuinely use some logical thinking here and ask yourself is this what I should be doing so with that in mind let's get into my recommendation on if you should or shouldn't get a computer science degree because some people should some people should not so now it's time for my overall recommendation starting for people that should get the degree now if you're someone who's not from a Western Country Like Us Canada UK or there's not a lot of job opportunities in your country that you actually want or that are attainable without a degree I'd recommend getting one specifically for immigration purposes I know for example if you want to work in the US a lot of other countries as well a degree is required or it's actually very beneficial to being able to get a position there so you may actually need one and that may be a legitimate reason to get a degree you need to do the research on that but if you are potentially thinking of immigrating to another place you probably will need one or it will help your chances beyond that if you're someone who wants to get into Academia if you want to be a professor if you want to do a PhD even in an unrelated field or a Ms obviously you're going to need a degree if you want to go into a very theoretical field like machine learning even some data science related fields it will be helpful to have the degree if you're someone who knows you're not going to be successful on your own and you really need an extremely structured environment where you're really committed because you're financially and time committed then go and do the degree for example if you know if you're going to spend one year not doing anything if you were to take Gap year for example then maybe it's smarter for you to just directly go into the degree there's a huge time commitment huge financial commitment but if you know yourself and you need that environment to learn in then maybe that's the best use of your time there's a few other exceptions where you will need the degree but typically speaking the degree is not going to be a prerequisite for you Landing a job and if you are good enough and if you are commed you will be able to land jobs without a degree will it help you yes it will help you a little bit for certain jobs but again remember what you could be doing in those four years that would help you more than having a degree in a lot of cases other achievements that you have are going to carry far more weight than the degree yes it is helpful but again we need to put a value on that is it $200,000 helpful is it four years of your time helpful in a lot of cases I say no unless you fit those specific criteria of course some other exceptions as well as well if you go to a very very highend school if you have a scholarship if your parents are willing to pay for the entire degree for you then it's a lot easier to do that because then the cost goes down and the value you get goes significantly up if it's just four years of your time it's easier to get into the degree whereas if it's $100,000 or $25,000 of debt or whatever it ends up being it's significantly tougher to make that decision and justify the ROI Sur so now we get into my recommendation for people that should not get the degree if you're very early in life 17 18 19 first of all understand that you have a lot of time now I'm only 23 but 19 feels like it was so long ago for me and I really wish that I would have slowed down a little bit tried to understand myself a bit better and just made decisions over a longer period of time rather than really jumping into them quickly I know you want that momentum you want to go fast you want that first job but I'd highly recommend at least take one year as a gap spend that year really developing yourself learning a lot spend more time in that one year working than you would if you were doing a degree maybe get a job build up some savings and learn computer science and software engineering on the side in one year you can accomplish a ton especially when you're not distracted with something like a degree you can live with your parents and you can really set yourself up for life just in one or two years directly after high school this is the biggest opportunity you have young early in life and I would hate to see you waste it by immediately jumping into hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt and spending four years in a program that you might not finish or that's not going to be the best use of your time again if you're committed if you're motivated if you really want to improve yourself I think in one or two years of a gap you can really achieve a lot and a lot of you can land software development positions in that time you can make commitments in much less expensive courses for example the one that I have is $800 there's a lot of other great options out there but this isn't going to financially ruin you it's not this huge commitment for the next four or five years of your life and you can learn what you need to actually become a software developer and a lot of you can land jobs in that time now if you are someone who's already in a degree I would recommend just sticking it out but understanding that once you graduate you're not immediately going to get a job unfortunately for you you've made the commitment where yes you're now going to do this degree but you have to realize there's still a lot of other stuff that you need to learn and I'd recommend learning that at the same time yes I just added more work for you it sucks you thought going to University is going to teach you everything you need to know it's not you're going to have to do projects on the side you're going to have to learn additional stuff but if you want to be the best setup for when you graduate you need to do that while you're in the degree and hopefully before you even finish you're going to start having prospects because of how much stuff that you've learned so that's my overall opinion I think generally most people should not get the degree but if you have a really specific reason to get one then obviously go out there and get it I just hate seeing people making such a massive lifealtering decision so early in life before even trying out the thing that they're going to be doing and also realizing after they get to the end of the degree they haven't actually learned the things they need to be ready for a job so I really warn you take your time with this don't feel like you need to rush into this decision you can always go get a University degree you don't need to make a decision that financially ruins you at 18 years old it's really sad to see a lot of my friends are going through this right now in a lot of other um different degrees that aren't computer science and the issue is even if they make 60 70 $80,000 per year they're still paying such a massive amount of debt and they've started life with a negative net worth they're not even at the The Starting Line they're behind The Starting Line whereas if you decided to not get the degree even if you just did nothing you'd still be further ahead because you have less debt right and you're able to move forward you're not climbing out of a hole that you've dug yourself anyways that's what I think let me know what your comments are in the link in the description and I will see you in the next one
