if you really want to get good at programming make sure you nail the fundamentals so the common mistake that I see is people decide to jump into the deep end before they learn how to swim for example jumping into machine learning after learning coding for two weeks in my opinion it should take you a month to maybe three months to really nail if you're a brand new programmer the fundamentals of programming now that's my opinion but this is a huge mistake I see and what discourages a lot of people from getting into programs like you do so much fundamental programming solving really basic problems making sure you understand all these Concepts that are built into the standard language you're learning before you go ahead and start working with Frameworks and modules and more advanced things that assume you have this understanding
