hey guys and welcome back to the kibbeh tutorial so in today's video I want me to be going into creating a very simple and basic drawing application and all we're gonna do essentially so I'm just gonna have a square and I'm gonna have that square move and just follow my mouse around the screen and then if we press down like it'll print a square what not to the screen this just introduce you to kind of the graphic system and Kivi I don't want to go too far into this because it does get kind of complex but this is a brief introduction to show you guys what you are capable of doing with it and if you're interested in that let me know when I may make another video on this in the future but I will leave the docs in the description so you guys can read through them they're pretty selfexplanatory in terms of how to create different shapes and objects what I'm going to show you here will give you enough of a foundation to I don't know draw some basic shapes onto your screen or whatnot so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna import Q dot graphics okay and we need this just to be drawing obviously so from Q dot graphics are gonna import rectangle with capital and we're gonna do the same thing here so from Q dot graphics and we'll import what was it color so the way that drawing works in in Kibby is it kind of based off of something called opengl so if you guys have used opengl before you'd be very familiar with how this works if you haven't don't worry but essentially you have a canvas and that canvas contains drawing instructions and you can give instructions to the canvas obviously to draw different things and then you can update those positions it's a little bit different than how pygame works in terms of you just draw something it gets blended to the screen and then you have to draw over it if you want to get rid of it um this is not it doesn't work that way so essentially you don't have to draw over top your canvas each frame you can just update an instruction and we'll move that object accordingly and you guys will see how that works in a second that's what I'm going to do here and this is just based off of our last video as well is I've just cleared this KB file you don't need anything in here and all I'm gonna do is actually just define it on it and here because we need to do something here so when I say define a nips I will do the same thing that we've done before so we'll do Korg's here and then we're just gonna have to call the super constructor so super underscore underscore knit and then what was in here Korg's I believe and then here we have touch and self okay so there we go we have our initialization and what we're gonna do in here is we're going to draw a rectangle so the way that we draw anything and set up the initial drawing instruction as we say with and we say self dot canvas because this this widget inheriting from widget actually has a canvas property that we can use say with self duck canvas and then here what we're gonna do is we're gonna say rectangle so we'll say self thought record sorry equals rectangle and then we're gonna give some properties for this rectangle so I believe I have to actually look here cuz I forget how you do this oh yes okay so all we have to do is just give it a position which is a tuple and a size which is a tuple as well so for my size I'll get 50 50 and for my position we'll give an initial position of 0 0 so actually I'll form you go any further let's just run this and make sure everything's working okay so you can see that we have a nice little rectangle in the bottom left hand corner of our screen at 0 0 okay awesome stops working so how do we change the color of this rectangle so you might notice the only two things that we can give this rectangle is position and a size so how do we give it a color well it's actually kind of weird how you do this but essentially you have to change the drawing color of the entire canvas before you can change the color of an object so well that's why I imported color here so what we have to do is you have to you look at this color and then is that how you do it I think that's how you do it actually and we're gonna I'm just gonna copy this one in because I don't know what this color code is but I believe this is red so what you do here is you're gonna give it RG be a this is your alpha value and then obviously you can specify the mode so in this case it's mode RGB a so when we do this what we're gonna be doing is changing the color of this canvas drawing and then this rectangle should show up red so let's try that and there we go so now we can see we have a red rectangle instead so if you want to mess around with the different colors here you have to look up the codes because I don't know all the color codes for RGB a but that's the mode that we're gonna do and this is how you change the color so let's just mess around with drawing a few other rectangles just to see what happens and how we can change the color again and what not so let's change the color let's just make this one we'll copy this rectangle code and let's just change our position to zero 300 all right let's actually just go 200 300 see where that shows up and go size of 150 and let's around that okay so now you can see we're getting this kind of yellowish rectangle I'm showing up in that position and just notice if we resize here right how we will move down if we change and we will move to the left but if we go right nothing's gonna happen and that's because we're at a static position we're not dynamically placing this using like a root and whatnot okay so just something to keep in mind there all right so there we go we have those rectangles so now let's actually make it so that the rectangle follows our mouse around so that's why I've left this on touch down on touch move on touch up events actually we don't need this on touch up so we can get rid of that but what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to show you how we can change the the property of our rectangles when we're moving so I'm actually just gonna get rid of this rectangle because we only need this first one and the way we can do this actually very easy only if there is just a selftaught rect dot position equals and then we'll just say a touch dot pause and now you'll notice that that's little a all we have to do so that when we click the mouse it's going to go to that position now we're actually just gonna do the same thing in on touch move so that if we hold down the mouse and move our rectangle around it will follow our mouse as well so let's try this and we have the Red Square ready I can click here and it'll follow my mouse wherever I go now if I hold down you can see that it's following exactly where I go and obviously we're printing out all the mouse motion events so that's pretty straightforward how that works now obviously there's a lot more things you can do with this in terms of drawing you can draw lines so for example from Kibby duck graphics import and we'll import line there and if we want to draw a line to do that you simply do line and then I think you give it like a bunch of positions I have to look on this thing so I forget yeah so you say points like this points equals and then all we're going to do in here is just add a bunch of XY points so you just say like 20 30 400 500 6500 let's try that and just see what we get I have no idea what that's gonna draw for us so you can see now we have a line going from the points that we've specified and you guys can mess around with that and obviously if you wanted to change the color of this line same thing you'd have just have to redefine color up top let's get rid of that and let's add one here and see what we get for our line color and now we're getting a green line starting here going up like that okay so I think that's on the show for just simple drawing now that's how you can kind of move stuff around in the next video I'm gonna get into multiple windows so how we're gonna go back into kind of GUI stuff I just wanted to introduce you this drawing it's not something I want to touch on a lot and we're gonna get into building a multi what do you call it window GUI so we can go from window to window we can have our KB file and it shows like what's gonna be on each window so we can go do maybe a login form and then when you log in it'll show you what was I saying before like your secret notes or something like that okay so with that being said that'll be it for this video if you guys enjoyed please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
