in this video we're gonna be going over ifelse and L if statements in Java so quickly just I want to fix a really small mistake I'm in the last video so if you guys don't know I am like a Python programmer typically so I'm doing Java obviously but Python is like my first language so I'm used to being able to use two equal signs on pretty much anything because that's what you can do in Python but in the last video I showed you using two equal signs on strings now that's not incorrect to do that but it's not gonna work the way you think right now so if you want to compare if two strings are logically the same like the actual string values are the same way you should actually do is say you have a string so s in this case you have to do dot equals okay and then inside of this equals here you're gonna put the string that you want to compare it to or you're gonna put another variable which is a string so in this case if I want to say if like my scanner objects which I've just typed out before this video is equal to hello this is how I would do it with this dot equal sign not the two equal signs you the two equal signs isn't wrong but it's gonna give you a different answer and we will talk about that in future videos but it's too advanced to go into right now so just remember if you want to compare two strings use dot equals my apologies about that from the last video so what we want to do now is when we do it using if and else statements so pretty much if something happens do this otherwise do this and this is the basis of programming using conditions based on like user input or based on certain events that happen we're gonna do different things right so they're really important to understand so first of all what I'm doing here is I'm just getting I'm just setting up a new scanner object I'm just gonna get you input from the user we've already talked about this and what I want to do is I want to check that users input and based on what they type in I want to do something so the basic syntax are if and else is in Java is you simply type if you put brackets and inside of these brackets is going to be your condition and this is why I spend so much time talking about conditions in the last video the condition here is if this condition evaluates to true whatever's inside of what I'm going to show you here whatever's inside of these curly braces is gonna happen so let's start with the condition let's say if s dot equals not to equal signs and in this case I'm going to say Tim so if the user types in Tim when we're when we prompt them for input then I want to do something and what's gonna happen is inside of these curly braces and this denotes a block so this is known as like an if statement or an if block so this block simply goes the syntax if then we have this these brackets inside the brackets as a condition the condition can be as long as it wants as long as you want as long as you're going to get a true or false value back from it and then we have these curly braces so an open brace and a close brace and inside of these braces anything that I type in here is going to happen if this condition is true so let's just do a quick little test here in order to do system dot out dot println and in this case we'll just say you typed ten okay Wow types you types you typed Tim okay and let's run the program and see what happened so when I run this if it loads up that's odd okay mmm give me one second okay so we're back I accidentally closed my console and yeah we were running into some issues with that so I got that up and running now let me just restart this quickly okay Wow okay I don't know why that's white but anyways uh let's just type out what are we gonna say here let's type hello and see what we get well we get nothing because we didn't type Tim so let's run it again let's try it this time I type Tim and it says you typed Tim so there we go our basic if statement is working now I want you to put another system dot out over here so that we can see what happens when we have like just with this example guy I'm just going to print I'm literally gonna print print okay so now what I want to show what happens here is like what is the program gonna run so if we type Tim we're gonna get this you typed him but are we still gonna get this print out here are we not gonna get it well let's test this out and see okay so in this case I typed Tim so when I typed him it says you typed him and then it says print okay now the reason that happens is because this print is not within this if block right so we're just gonna execute simply after this if block happens so now same thing right if I type like hi it's still gonna print out print to the screen because right it didn't go through this if block but this is not inside of the if block or the if statement or whatever so that executes okay so that's pretty straightforward now I'm going to show you else and LCIF rest start with notes so else is very straightforward it can only come after an elseif or and if so like the start of the block has to be if and then this else you can't just have it like a loan it has to come after an if statement or an else if statement which we're gonna go into in a second okay there's different ways to format this some people like to put the else like this so it has the closing brace and then the open brace I personally like to do it like this some people like to do it like this it's however you want okay this just works fine just make sure that your curly brace doesn't look something like that all the way out there because that's kind of hard to read okay so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to put this print statement and I'm going to put it in my else statement alright now the way this else works is if this happens that's fine we're gonna go in here we're gonna print this out and then we'll move down to the end of the the block so we'll go to here as our next execution line now if this doesn't happen so other words or else then we print this so we're either printing you type Tim or print we're never printing both because one of them is if and one of them is else alright so let's test this out if I type Tim we you type Tim okay if I type anything else so like some random letters and I hit enter you get print so as else works is it's meant to do something if this condition is not true right okay so that's pretty straightforward I don't think I need to talk about that anymore the next one I'm gonna show you is else if now this is a way that we can add multiple if conditions in one kind of block okay so what I can do now is I can do like else if and now it's the exact same syntax as regular if statement except you just have this else before and obviously since this is an else it has to come after an initial if statement so you can have as many of these else ifs as you want now first I'll just put a condition in here so say s dodge equals and in this case let's just say hey like hello okay and then here we'll just do it system dot out dot println and we'll just say hi because we want to greet them back they said hello okay so again the way this is gonna work is we're gonna go through we're gonna check we're gonna get our scanner input we get s say okay what's s is s equal to Tim if it is we're gonna print this and then we're gonna move down after the last else statement we're not gonna even bother checking if it's something else because if it's equal to Tim then we know that we shouldn't bother looking at the else ifs right now if it's not equal to Tim what we're gonna do is we're gonna go through and we're gonna check we're gonna say okay else if that's our next block is it equal to hello if it's equal to hello we're gonna print hi we're gonna move on with our lives are gonna move down here we're not even gonna bother go into the else okay now if it's not equal to hello we're gonna go into the else statement and we're just simply gonna print print there's no condition it's just automatically gonna happen if you print anything other than hello or Tim we're going to print print okay so let's try this out and let's type hello and you can see we get hi all right now if I print type anything else in here so like some random letters we get print okay and that is how that works now I can show you I can add as many else ifs as I want so if I copy this and I simply paste it down here I can have another elseif and in here I could have hi and then here I could type hello and we could keep going and we could do as many else ifs as we want just know that whenever you have kind of a block that looks like this it has to start with an if statement and it does actually doesn't have to end with an else so in else just is should be the last thing so if you have any else ifs else will be your last thing like I couldn't do an Elif here and then try typing like that's that's not okay you can't do that but if I omit this else that's perfectly fine so now I have if we type Tim we type below or we type hi let's run this and let's type none of them let's let's type a bunch of letters we get nothing printed to the screen because we don't have that else statement now if I type hi you see we get hello because right we went through it wasn't equal to Tim it wasn't equal to hello so we printed hi now I want to show you this this is a bad example but it'll work if I put here and I put hello here which one are we gonna print so remember we're only gonna print one of these things we're not gonna print more than one so which one is it is it high or is it hello well let's test it out if I type hello in here we print high now the reason we're printing high is because this elseif is above this one and this is the first one that's gonna be looked at when we type something in just the way I kind of went through it's Akatsuki Lee so since we print high here we'll be like okay well that happens so there's no point in checking this and we just move on okay straightforward now again I can do more if statements down here you could keep typing like do a bunch of stuff just understand you can have as many else ifs as you want you don't need an elseif like we could just do an if and then else but every time you have kind of like an if statement or block starting it has to start with an if it can have as many Alice's as you want and the last thing has to be in else if you're adding the else you don't have to have that else there so anyways I think that's all I'm gonna show for if statements else ifs and else they're pretty straightforward any condition can go here so anything that I showed you before like you could have a really long chain conditional with ton of stuff same thing here you could have any condition like it doesn't matter anything that gives you a true or false value you could also literally just type true and like that would always happen okay so anyways that's been it for this video if you guys enjoyed and learned something please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
