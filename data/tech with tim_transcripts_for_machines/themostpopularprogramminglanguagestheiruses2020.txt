hello everybody and welcome back to another youtube video so in this video i'm going to share with you the 10 most popular programming languages and what they're used for now i've taken these rankings from github based on the most popular pull request languages in quarter 2 of 2020 so ideally this will give us the best idea of the current most popular programming languages but of course you can argue these rankings and i'm sure that the rankings of these languages will change as we go through the year anyways with that being said let's go ahead and get started as no surprise coming in at spot number one we have javascript now javascript is an extremely popular programming language that is used everywhere on the web now although javascript can be used as a serverside programming language with tools like node.js it is commonly run clientside within a web browser now this enables javascript to be one of the most versatile languages when it comes to building interactive frontend user interfaces any modern website you visit uses a ton of javascript to make the website interactive and any dialogue form or animation you see is likely being controlled by javascript and now with the popularity of frontend frameworks like vujs react and angular it is not surprising that javascript tops this list now as a final thought it's worth noting that javascript is dynamically typed and although it can be used for many other applications they're typically much better choices and at number 2 we have my personal favorite programming language which is python now python is a general purpose programming language meaning it has a much wider use case than something like javascript now it is heavily used in serverside applications ethical and i guess nonethical hacking data science machine learning artificial intelligence scientific computing and general scripting tasks now python is known to be easy to learn easy to read and easy to write so this makes it great for smaller projects and the tasks that i listed above but its main disadvantage comes from its lack of speed and the fact that it is dynamically typed now just like javascript this makes it difficult to maintain in large scale projects so python has also been used in millions of applications around the world some of them are instagram youtube dropbox it was actually used by nasa in their integrated planning system and was even responsible for the ai in the game civilization 4. so python is usually capable of accomplishing most programming tasks but oftentimes there are far better choices they may be less versatile but they will be better at that specific task and we will see that as we get through the rest of this list moving on to java so java is known for being a dying programming language but it's actually still quite widely used and comes into our list at number three now java is another general purpose language that is well suited for game and mobile app development enterprise level applications and also building web apps now java is a statically typed language it is compiled and although it may be frustrating to write in it provides many advantages in terms of structure and code maintainability that you won't get in say python and javascript now so in those popular applications that use java are of course minecraft the adobe creative suite and most general android applications now as i said java is the core for android mobile app development and although languages like kotlin now exists it is still used very heavily over 3 billion devices run java and it follows the wora principle which is right once run anywhere so once you've compiled your java code it can run on any device that runs java and to summarize all of this java actually is not that bad of a programming language and i would definitely recommend learning it now go otherwise known as golang is number four on this list and is a fairly new and widely used programming language goaling emerged as an alternative to c plus plus and java for the app developers at google and was actually created by two google employees and released in 2012. now go is a robust system level language typically used on the server side for largescale distributed systems go is designed around concurrency and is extremely performance heavy go is used across millions of google servers and is the back end of some popular websites like dropbox now golang also has python like syntax and has performance similar to c plus now this makes it its main advantage and how quickly you can develop with it while still maintaining high performance now i personally am a huge fan of go and would encourage anyone especially any of you that know python to look into it because it's a really interesting language and something to add to your tool belt and at number five we have c plus plus so c plus plus is the industry standard for aaa games and is used extensively to develop 3d applications operating systems browsers compilers and other countless performance dependent applications now c plus plus is extremely fast and has a somewhat unique ability to interface with the user's hardware giving it much more control on a lower level so imagine like talking to a graphics card now c plus plus is known for being a difficult language to learn and write in and is not recommended for beginners generally speaking you should have a good reason to use c plus plus when there are often easier and faster options to develop with now it's worth noting that c plus plus is also used on the web but typically you'll see it more in embedded systems and performance concerned applications like i've mentioned now some examples of c plus it's used in the apple os it's part of microsoft windows it's used in database software like mysql and of course almost all your aaa 3d games use c plus plus and moving on to number six we have typescript now typescript is another newish programming language that was actually developed at microsoft and happens to be a superset of javascript so this means almost everything you know about javascript is transferable to typescript with a few minor exceptions now typescript is as it reads a statically typed language that actually transpiles into native javascript so all your typescript code actually gets transpiled or compiled whatever you want to call it into javascript before it runs now the reason why it exists is actually to make developers lives easier by providing interfaces modules optional static typing better code navigation error detection and just a ton of other things that help with maintainability readability and all those things that i've mentioned now typescript is used in replacement or conjunction with javascript to provide a better development experience so while working at microsoft this summer i actually wrote a bunch of code for the python extension in vs code using solely typescript so i highly recommend all javascript developers check out typescript it won't take you long to learn and it's definitely worth it and number seven brings us to ruby now ruby is a general purpose programming language pretty similar to python is also dynamically typed object oriented it is a general purpose scripting language and it can be used for many different applications but obviously its most popular implementation is rails otherwise known as ruby on rails which is used to design web applications now ruby is considered to be more elegant than python in terms of web development and is used on popular sites like shopify github airbnb fiverr and many more it is fast adheres to very strict standards and those standards make it easier to learn and generally makes the code much more clear when you're reading through it and at number eight we have everybody's favorite programming language which is php now php is a general purpose scripting language that is especially well suited to serverside web development so it usually runs on a web server and php is known as an old dying language and there are many alternatives to it now that are typically recommended for new development that being said many developers still must know and be able to write in php and that is because it is used all over the web mostly in older code bases now to give you some examples facebook yahoo and wikipedia were originally developed in php and wordpress actually uses a ton of php today so there's a few specific cases where you may want to use php but personally i wouldn't recommend anyone learn it or even use it unless you have a very good reason to do so and at number nine we have c sharp now c sharp is extremely versatile and can be used to make pretty much anything that said it is particularly well suited for building windowsbased applications and games it is also commonly used to build web applications and recently has become more popular in mobile app development now i'm sure many of you are familiar with the game development engine called unity this uses csharp to design and create games so like other languages on this list csharp is maintained by microsoft and is continuing to grow year over year one of the core advantages of csharp is how massive its library is uh providing you with higher level functionality compared to languages say like java or cplus plus although this language is not as popular as some of the other languages on this list csharp is a great language to learn and is still demanded heavily in the programming industry now last but definitely not least we have c now c is by far the most important programming language on this list and is responsible for the existence of many of the tools and languages we use every single day now c is the core of almost all operating systems micro controllers embedded systems and a lot of enterprise level applications c is extremely flexible and versatile and allows control over lowlevel components and hardware that is not found in many higher level programming languages especially a lot of the other ones on this list now many experienced developers highly recommend learning c as it teaches you many fundamental programming concepts that will carry over to a lot of other programming languages c excels at memory management and fast and efficient execution of code and all that said c is extremely difficult to learn it is not necessary for many developers but it's definitely something that will be worth it if you can get into it and learn about a lot of the lower level concepts last thing i'll say here because i know you guys will ask about these languages rust came in at 13 on this list swift was at 14. kotlin was 15 dart was 16 and objective c was 17. i will link these resources down below so you can have a look but that has been it for the 10 most popular programming languages and what they're used for if you guys enjoyed please do make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and let me know down below what is your favorite programming language on this list
