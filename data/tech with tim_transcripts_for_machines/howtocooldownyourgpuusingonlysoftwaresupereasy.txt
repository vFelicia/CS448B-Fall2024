hey guys welcome back to another YouTube video in today's video I'm gonna be talking about how you can cool down your graphics card so a lot of people's graphics cards are on very hot there's a variety of different reasons why that may happen one may be just the case they're running and doesn't have enough intake not enough airflow in the case it could just be the card itself some cards do run very hot and depending on the cooler that comes with the card you're gonna get different temperatures on your card you can see my card here I have the AMD radon rx 480 and I'm running at 43 degrees Celsius which is pretty warm considering this is not idle temperatures and I have good airflow in my case so on any other card this should have been running cooler but I mean my card in general it runs very hot it also could be if you have an overclock applied on your card and it's overheating or it's running really hot there's tons of different reasons why your card could be overheating one last one is just the dust buildup so this one a lot of people overlook or they don't realize especially if they don't have a side panel in their case is that if you haven't opened up your computer in a year or you haven't looked inside or even cleaned it out there's gonna be a huge amount of dust building up inside of your components and inside of your case especially if you don't have positive airflow in your case so what you're gonna want to do is clean that dust out because if you have dust building up in the fans and in the cards and the components then that's obviously gonna create a lot more heat so to do that you can get an electronic duster they're like 10 bucks off Amazon where at Staples or whatever you want to get them from and just blow em out at your components to get rid of all the dust and that should definitely make them run cooler so say you've looked inside your case and there's no dust buildup you have good airflow well what can I do to make my card run cooler now this method here that I'm gonna show you is completely software related so you don't have to actually do anything inside your case all you're gonna have to do is download msi afterburner so that's the program I have open right now and you can do that by simply going to their website I'm gonna leave a link in the description below now once you've downloaded that you'll see the temperature on the side mine is that 43 right now should see all these little bars don't worry about those all we're gonna do is click on the Settings button right here now once we do that we're gonna click on fan now what we're actually going to do here is we're gonna move our fan up so that we're making it run faster so pretty much the faster we run our fan the cooler our card is going to be so we can see we have a little grid here with fan speed and temperature now you don't want to play with this too much but what we're gonna do is pretty much just move up all of these things so that our fan speed is running higher per temperature so you're just gonna move these bars up like so and you can just play around with them until it's at a speed that you're happy with and you can check the temperature while you're running games by just leaving this open and going to check that now once you've done that all you have to do it's pretty much click OK and you should start to hear the fan go louder in your computer especially if it is a louder fan and you can see here my fan just jumped from 36 to 45 now if you want to turn off this preset fan that you just changed all you have to do is click on this setting button here that's highlighting a red around the fan speed now if you click that you can see my fan speed drops all the way back to 19 and I should see my temperatures start to rise a little bit because the fan is gonna be running so much slower so you can see that's what we've just done is we made a custom fan profile so that we're actually changing how fast our fan runs per temperature on the card so if we go back to that we go to fan right here you can see we have the grid we have temperature and we have fan speed so for example here at a hundred degrees which is not safe for the card our fan will be running at a hundred percent to get all of that heat off the cart now if I go back and I change from custom here to default you can see that this profile has moved and that's just because of the way I changed it right now same thing here if you actually don't want to cool down your card but you want your fan to go slower say you're fine if your card is running hotter but you just don't want to hear the sound you can move all of these values down so that at thirty degrees here you're only running at 21% fan speed which you can't really hear so that's the way that you can change the fan settings on your card so by default they come with once you hit 30 degrees we're at 30% fan speed but if you change that by yourself then you can kind of control the temperature of your card and the volume of your cards to the acoustics which is a really nice thing to be able to do especially if you're running a really highend game and you see your cards running at 85 degrees Celsius maybe you want to cool that down you can just change the fan speed with that fan profile so you can also change the fan speed by simply unclicking this and unclicking auto and just setting it to whatever you want it to be so by dragging that bar but that's not good because then that means every single time that you want the to change the fan speed you have to go back and drag that bar so yeah that is pretty much how you can cool down your graphics card it's really simple way just using software just like clicking a little setting button here and just changing the fan profile so if you enjoyed please leave a like and subscribe and I'll see you again in another
