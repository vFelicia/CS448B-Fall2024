in this video we are gonna be kind of taking a step back and just going through everything that we've already learned summarizing that putting that into a program to make sure that you guys really understand all of that and we're also gonna be talking about nested statements so how you can kind of add things within other things like so if statements within other if statements variables and the way I'm gonna do this is just by creating a simple program and what its gonna do is it's gonna ask the user to input their age and then based on that age we're gonna do certain things with that we're gonna tell them like I don't know a good example is like on a roller coaster like if you're 13 or older you can ride otherwise you can so we're gonna do something like that okay so I'm gonna keep these scanners up here that I have because we want to get the users age but I'm first before I set up the scanner is I'm just gonna print a line to the screen here so I'm just gonna say system dot out dot print instead of println and in this case I will just say input your age simply okay so this way it should if I'm doing this correctly make it so that we just get the age right after this line okay you'll see when we do that in a second anyways what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna kind of start typing and we'll go through how this works out so I'm gonna say if and we're actually just gonna convert this to an int first I think string to an int yeah so using that parse into that I was talking about so say int age is equal to s dot R integer I always forgot how to do this integer dot parse int and then in here we need to type s so we're gonna convert whatever they type into an integer in this case so we're going to assume that they type in an integer so we'll say if age is greater than or equal to 13 then we will simply print system dot out dot print Ln you can write okay exclamation point now if they're not older than 13 that must mean that they are less than 13 or younger than 13 so in this case we will simply print that they cannot write system two out the print Ln and you cannot write exclamation point okay pretty basic program we kind of gone all this work so let's test it out input your age five you cannot ride okay let's try this now input your age do you 43 you can ride awesome okay so everything is working fine for right now now what I'm gonna do is I am going to add a elseif here and I'm gonna change kind of the problem that we're looking at so I'm gonna say now I want to classify the person based on their age is either an adult a teenager or just like younger than a teenager okay I don't know what do you call those whatever younger than teenager is okay so if we are greater than or equal to 18 I want to print you are an adult okay now otherwise so if they are not greater than 18 we want to check if they are less than 18 so or if they're actually well we'll do it in a in a cool way that's gonna make sense here in a second so else if age is not greater than or equal to 18 we know it's less than 18 so all we actually have to check is if they are older than 13 right or greater or older than or equal to 13 because that's what a teenager would be okay and the reason we don't have to check if they are what do you call it younger is or if they're older is because we already know that they're gonna be younger than 18 so know we're there int within that range sorry what should that explanation but that's okay so system dot out dot println and in this case we'll just say you are a teenager okay like that and then in this last case well we know they're not older than or equal to 18 we know they're not older than or equal to 13 that meaning they must be less than which is you are not a teenager or an adult okay like that so let's test our program out make sure everything is working so if we input an age of 14 we get you are a teenager awesome okay let's try it again we input an age of 19 get you're an adult and if we input an age of zero yet you are not a teenager we're an adult now I want to show you what happens if I input like a negative number like what if I do like negative 98 you are not a teenager or an adult because right we have this else statement and that's not greater than or equal to 13 it's not greater than or equal to 18 so we got you're not a teenager or an adult okay now that is pretty straightforward what I'm going to show you now is how we can ask like another question or how we can check something else so what I'm gonna do here is I want to say if they're 18 and only if they're 18 I want to ask them a question what should the question be I want to ask them what their favorite food is okay so I'm simply gonna do now exactly what I've done up here except just throw it inside of this if statement so if this happens we're gonna do this and this is gonna show you nesting okay so I'm gonna say SC or we'll say string I screen just do ins because we're gonna assume there are string I guess cuz any food yeah we'll say string food is equal to SC dot next line like this okay and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to print up here again what we're looking for so just copy this save me a second and in this case I'll say input your fav food okay now what I want to do is I want to check what their favorite food is so I want to say if their favorite food is pizza I'll say mine too otherwise I'll say that's not my favorite food or something like that okay we'll say if and we have our conditioning here we'll say if food dot equals and in this case we'll simply type pizza all right then we will system dot out dot print Ln and we'll say mine Wow inside of the coats hopefully say mine too and then otherwise so the else what we'll do is we'll simply type system dot out dot println and in this case we'll say not mine okay so this is showing you now it looks a bit more complicated but that we can actually put if statements and else statements we can do things with inside of the if statement and I'll show you that this works so if I type I'm nineteen it's gonna say input your fav food okay my favorite food let's try pizza it says mine too awesome that's working now if I type something else so I type like four it just tells me I'm not a teenager adult because we don't have anything else happening inside of this if statement or this else over here okay now that's really cool and that allows us to do some neat things and you can continually nest this is called nesting putting a statement inside of another statement you can continually do that as much as you want so I just want to show that to you because a lot of people think that that's not possible or they don't understand that you're able to do that because they haven't been shown that right so again if I want to ask another question I could do that inside of here and I could just keep going but anyways I think that that probably gives you guys a good explanation of how that works and shows you got I don't need to go any further so with that being said I'm gonna end the video here in the next video we're gonna be getting into looping which is some more advanced stuff some cooler stuff and we're continually moving through and we're to be getting more advanced now getting out to kind of the more basic stuff of Java that being said if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you leave
