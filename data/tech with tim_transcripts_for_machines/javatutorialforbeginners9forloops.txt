hello and welcome back so in this video I'm going to be talking about for loops now for loops our fundamental aspect of every programming language and they're very important to understand I can almost guarantee you that any program you write will use multiple for loops so pretty much where for loop is it allows us to kind of automate a task do something a set amount of times and typically when you use a for loop you're using that because you know how many times you want to do something or like a condition is gonna tell you how many times to do something as opposed to what we're gonna talk about in future videos which is a while loop well you're not really sure how long it's gonna go for so you do something based on a condition but we'll talk about that when we get to it so let's start and just do it an example of what if we're loop can really like solve for us for example okay so say this is a pretty simple example and you guys will see in a second I create an integer C into x equals zero and say that I want to add 1 and then I want to add 2 to it and then I want to add 3 to it and four and five and six and like an infinite amount of times I want to add to that variable well we could do like X plus equals one we could do X plus equals two like and keep going and adding things to X and we could just keep copying and pasting this down our program but obviously that's terribly inefficient in terms of a typing standpoint and what if we wanted to change this what if every time we were on the program we want to ask the user how many times they want to add like a pattern like this to X well then we would have to constantly keep changing the numbers here right so this is where for loop can kind of come in handy so the syntax for for I'm just gonna type it out and then we will talk about exactly what it does so it has these brackets here and in here we're gonna put three things typically okay so what you're gonna do is you're gonna first start off by declaring a variable so in this case I'm gonna say int X is equal to zero okay now this can be called whatever you want typically people call it I I like to use X but you know what let's just use I and then what you're gonna do for this next so you're gonna put a semicolon and then the next thing you're gonna do is you're gonna set a condition so I'm just gonna do this and then talk about it cuz it's hard to kind of do them stepbystep because they all work together less than equal to 10 and I plus plus okay so what I've just done here actually is I first started by declaring a variable I it's equal to zero and then I've said we're gonna do this while I is less than or equal to ten and we're gonna add one to I so pretty much the way this works is every time we execute what's in these little square brackets here I is gonna have one added to it so this is what's known as the increment and this comes at the end of your for loop so this is what you're adding to the variable I which you're declaring here every time you run the loop now this here is your condition and this is going to state how many times the loop is going to run so in our case we're gonna run the loop and while I is less than or equal to the value 10 meaning we're gonna start at the value 0 because I equals 0 we're gonna run this loop then we're gonna come back up here we're gonna say okay what are we doing we're adding 1 to I then we're gonna check this condition so I is not equal to 1 we're gonna say well as 1 less than or equal to 10 no it's not and then we're gonna loop through and we're gonna continue looping through until eventually we get to the point where we add 2 I it's equal to 11 11 well that's greater than 10 so we break out of this loop and you guys will see when I start printing stuff to the screen exactly how this works but I hope that was a decent explanation of the way to do this so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna print I here and I'm gonna tell you right now what's gonna happen right so we're starting I at 0 so the first loop here we're gonna come through I is equal to 0 we're gonna print 0 next loop we come up we add 1 2 I check the condition we're okay we can keep going we're at 1 and we're gonna print from 0 to 10 so watch when I run here we get 0 all the way up to 10 okay that's how the for loop works so we execute whatever is in between these little curly braces 10 times or 11 times in this case because a 0 to 10 is 11 alright now we can change this increment we can change this condition there's a lot of things that we can do in this for loop so here we say for int I equals 0 I could do for int I equals 5 and I can start at the value 5 and now we're gonna start we're gonna go from 5 to 10 looping 1 2 3 4 5 6 times right we're printing 6 different values ok so that's if you can do that if I try to do something like I equals 11 well watch what happens nothing prints to the screen and that's because 11 well that's greater than or equal to 10 so the loop doesn't even run one time right so let's go back and I'll start at zero and now let's show what we can do in terms of incrementing so to increment here we can do I plus equals and then any value you want so in this case if I do five we're going to start at zero we're gonna add five we're gonna add five again so we get zero five and ten and you can change this to whatever value that you want okay same thing here with the condition these cals will be variables I feel like I don't need to tell you that but if I do something like int x equals 5 then i can do i plus equals x right and we can add that integer to it we can add X as the bound here so less than or equal to this could be greater than this could be greater than or equal to so I'm just gonna quickly go over one thing that a lot of people get confused with for with for loops and it's when we're gonna stop and when we're gonna start so when we say less than or equal to 10 this means we're gonna start at this value and now assuming we're adding 1 okay we are going to stop but include 10 meaning that I will hit the value 10 we will print 10 to the screen now if I remove this equal sign this is only gonna happen while I is less than 10 which means that if I is 10 well 10 is not less than 10 so we are not going to print 10 so if I run this you can see we only get up to the value 9 now the reason I'm talking about this is because what we typically want to do with loops is we want to loop through something or look at some data and typically that data is in the form of an array so now and this is why I talked about arrays before I'm gonna create an array so an integer array let's call it a RR is equal to and let's just give it some values here so like 1 5 7 3 4 5 okay this is gonna be our integer array now what do I want to do if or how am I going to do this if I want to look through my array and look at look at these values and maybe checking the value is equal to 7 or value is equal to 5 or something like that well the way that I can do this and this is like a dynamic way to do it is I could count the length of the array I'd say 1 2 3 4 5 6 okay 6 elements so I would put I is less than 6 years but a more useful way to do this is to just get the length of the array and the way that I can do that is just to do a RR dot length or I actually don't need this bracket sorry so we'll just do this in this way say the user had typed in a bunch of elements we had put them in an array we don't know how many elements they type in per se so we're gonna use this length so that we can change this loop and this loop will never crash it will always work because we're just simply getting the length of the array now if I were to do equal here I hope you guys realize this would cause us an issue and that's because we have six elements in the array right but it's gonna allow us to get I to the value six cuz that's the length of the array now what happens if I try to do this arr six well we should know from the last video that that will actually crash our program and that's because when we start and we start at zero and our last element in the array is actually going to be index five right because we go zero all the way to the length minus one which is five so race six does not actually exist so what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna write a little program inside this for loop and I'm just gonna say if the value is equal to five we're gonna print it out so how do I do this I'm gonna say if ARR at index I is equal to the value five then we're simply gonna do system dot out dot print Ln I just realizes comma there all right semicolon and we're simply going to print the value so in this case we could print a RI which we know is gonna be five or we could just type five because we know that is there so in this case let's just do found a five exclamation point okay that's what we'll print to the screen so again the reason this is going to work is because we're looping through starting at zero and going to but not but not including the length of the array make sure you remove that equal sign otherwise you're gonna get a crash okay so that way we're gonna look at every single element in this array we're gonna check its value and then if we find a 5 we're gonna print it so let's see if this works found five and found a 5 now if I wanted to be more precise and say like where I found this 5 I could say found a 5 index and we'll just put a plus sign and we can put I and what this is gonna do is it's actually just gonna automatically convert this into a string for us and print it out with this index so we're gonna put a space here just so don't get too smushed together but it says found a 5 at index 1 found a 5 at index 5 and we know this is true index 1 is here index 5 is here and that's a really simple way that we can loop through a list and look for a certain value ok now in the next video I'm gonna talk about looping through a raise in a different way that is easier than this and it's called for each okay that'll be in the next video and then after that we're gonna go into while loops and then once we finish while loops will be going into collections like sets and stuff like that and then getting into all the object orientated program anyways if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
