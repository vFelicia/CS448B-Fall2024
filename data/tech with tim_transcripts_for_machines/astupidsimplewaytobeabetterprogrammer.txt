so step one on my list here to becoming a 10x developer and writing code much faster and just being much more productive is to really prioritize what it is that you're doing now to be able to prioritize you need to have some sort of a plan or at least a minimal idea of the things that you need to get done so what I like to do here is to kind of start each day or maybe each week whatever time increment you want to pick by just writing down a list of things that I need to do and then very quickly deciding on which ones actually need to get done right now and which ones can wait till later on you don't need to over plan you don't need to do anything crazy but list out all the tasks prioritize them put them in an order and then start doing those tasks
