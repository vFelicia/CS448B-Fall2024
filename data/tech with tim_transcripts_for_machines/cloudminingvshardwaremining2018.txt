I just wanted to give a little intro to this video before I start I realized that when I make my videos I do seem to talk a lot so if you guys just want the quick and short answer I'm gonna let you know right now that cloud mining is a better option in my opinion right now because of the factors I'm gonna state later in the video if you guys are interested in getting a cloud mining contract you can use the link down below in the description to go to genesis mining and select the option that's best for you other than that stick around for the rest of the video if you want to hear about the different factors and why cloud mining is better than regular mining I promise you it's worth your time and it's gonna give you some insight if you're really considering spending a lot of money investing into cryptocurrencies it's definitely worth it to listen to the whole video that being said I'll let the video play and if you guys enjoy please remember to leave a like answer guys and welcome back to another youtube video so today's video i'm gonna be talking about the difference between cloud mining and regular mining so using hardware and your own computer hardware to mine different cryptocurrency this video we're specifically gonna be talking about mining aetherium and doing comparison on that but this is gonna apply to the different mining here on genesis mining so Bitcoin litecoin Manero said cash etc the reason I'm not doing it on those is because you can see here it's all sold out like coin sold out Minot Manero sold out the only other one that's available and I was said cash and Bitcoin Oh Bitcoin sold it as well didn't even see that so it just makes sense for me to do this on aetherium as I have other videos on my channel about a theorem already and how to mine that currency so in this video I'm going to talk about three main factors that we need to consider before we can decide which is better and the first one is going to be price so that's how much our upfront cost is and how much it's gonna cost us to maintain this and to keep mining in the future the second one is gonna be profit so arguably the most important how much money are we really making on this and how long is going to take us to make our money back the third one is time now this isn't one that a lot of people look at but for me it's very important having experience building my own mining rig building your own mining rig can be extremely time consuming so we're gonna talk about some of the issues with that and then the fourth factor I'm going to talk about a smaller factor it's just gonna be maintenance so how you're fixing it issues you can run into and so on so let's get right into the video with number one price how much does cloud mining cost and how much does it cost to build our own mining rig so cloud mining is easy here you can see to mine at 40 mega hash per second it's gonna be costing us about $1,500 and this is gonna be the one that I'm start out looking I start looking at here on Genesis mining now this is gonna vary depending on what website you're on the reason I chose Genesis mining is because this is the most popular mining website so I figured I'd do it on this all right so that's easy fifteen hundred dollars about 440 mega hashes per second Mining aetherium over two years now something to note here is that if a theorem does go to proof of stake then it's gonna just start mining a different coin you can see here most profitable coin with the hardware that you've leased so you're not going to be losing out if all of a sudden aetherium changes the way that it is mined or it is confirmed or whatever alright now for the harder part building your own system so I'm just on PC part picker here now it's hard to do this on this website because a lot of the parts and things you want to buy are gonna be priced differently depending on where you get them from and availability is always a huge issue especially with graphics cards nowadays because it's very difficult to get them so we can start here I'm just the CPU I pick to use just very barebones it's a dual core intel celeron 53 bucks cheapest one I could find motherboard $120 we don't need to be able to overclock and I'm we're using seventh gen Intel here for 1151 this has six PCI lanes so up to six GPUs in the system four gigabytes of RAM cheapest Ram I could find it's still very expensive compared to what it used to be but that's when I found SSD 70 bucks is reliable SSD I didn't want to go with anything that was like thirty bucks because those aren't very reliable we don't want to use those and all this is gonna do is store our operating system and mining software all right GPU now this is gonna be just gonna vary depending on what GPU you pick the one that I picked you is just a 1066 gigabyte because I know this card gets about 18 to 19 mega hashes per second so two of these is gonna compare to our 40 mega hash for a second that we have on the mining which is what I'm trying to do um so it won't actually allow me to add a second one for some reason so we're gonna have to factor that into the price and then I went for a 1200 watt power supply I know this is very overkill but this is just for expansion and the Platinum is very important so that we're gonna be saving money on electricity all right so now we have nine hundred seventy six dollars this is before we add in the price of a second graphics card so now we're looking at about fourteen hundred dollars plus tax plus shipping etc so with all that we're probably looking at about fifteen hundred dollars to build our mining rig and that's also we need a PCI riser so $1500 is a very reasonable price you can see we're looking at almost the exact same price as our cloud binding over here which is I don't know good start now for the second factor profit now this again is arguably the most important factor as this is how much money we are gonna be making now as both of our rigs are mining at 40 mega hash per second you would think that means we are making the same amount of profit but that is incorrect that means we're gonna make the same amount of revenue with before fracturing our in our costs now with Genesis mining we have zero costs because we don't have to pay to maintain anything we don't pay for power we don't have to pay for any software or anything whereas with our own rig we are paying for power which is the main cost so mining at 40 mega hash per second with zero power consumption gives us about nine hundred forty dollars every year so if we multiply that by two that means we're now sitting out about eighteen hundred and eighty dollars I believe over the two years so that means we've made about three hundred dollars profit three hundred and what $60 profit which is not bad at all for an initial investment of fifteen hundred dollars especially with very low risk which I'm going to talk about in one of the next factors there so now we need to factor in power consumption now this is going depend on how much power your rig is consuming obviously but the rig over here that we have with two GPUs each GPU runs it up at hundred watts overclocked maybe 110 watts maybe 120 watts so we're gonna be hmm I don't know let's say it run said about 450 watts all right 450 watts for our system this might be low this might be high I don't really know what to tell you but depending on how many GPUs you have and how efficient your a system is then just put anywhere between like 400 and 600 watts it's not gonna make a huge difference that means we're gonna be making about six hundred and twentyfive dollars a year and that's if we're paying about eight cents per kilowatthour which is extremely low so that means if you live somewhere in the states probably where you're paying about eight cents per kilowatthour you're making six hundred twentyfive dollars off your initial investment of about fifteen hundred dollars so you can see that it is a you're not making your money back within two years it's gonna take longer than two years until you make your whole profit back are your whole investment back now if we even bump this up to about 0.12 here which is about what I pay for power in in Canada then you can see our profit continues to go down so already we're looking at cloud mining as being a better alternative to regular mining just for the profit alone now this was the small plan too right so if we had bumped up to the medium plan we're gonna be making more profit just because when you buy in bulk they're giving you a better deal on the mega hash per second so you can see I'll just show you if I put in a hundred twenty mega hash per second now you can see for paying zero power we're making about twenty eight hundred dollars a year which gives us about fifty six hundred dollars over two years after paying about forty four hundred dollars which gives us about a twelve hundred dollar profit which is very good for an initial investment of forty four hundred dollars now that's profit you can see clearly that our cloud mining is making us more money than mining with a system that we've built and we haven't even brought in the third factor yet which time so now it's time to talk about top so pretty much if you're building your own rig that means that you're gonna have to do a lot of research and spend a lot of time figuring out what parts you need to buy where you're gonna get them from how you can get them for the cheapest and how long they're gonna be working for because if you're running a GPU for 24/7 every single day of the year then eventually it's gonna be degrading and it's gonna either decrease in performance or just die eventually right so there's a lot of things you need to do you also need to be familiar with computer hardware meaning you have to know that the the processor that you buy is gonna fit in the motherboard that you buy which seems easy but is more difficult than it looks you have to make sure that all your parts are gonna work together you also have to build a case or you can buy a case but if you're buying a case that's another extra cost personally when I had my mining rig I just built a wooden case cost me like 10 bucks from the hardware store and it worked well for what I need it for but if you don't know how to do that again that's gonna take time and even more money and now you have to worry about issues you're gonna run into which kind of brings me into the fourth step as well these two kind of merge together when you're making your own mining rig there's a lot a ton of issues you're gonna run into now you you may have the issue where you can't even start mining a theory I'm alone so if you had if anyone had watched my video on how to mined etherium for beginner as you can see there's tons of comments of people saying this isn't working I'm having an issue with my GPU why is the fan so loud whatever just tons of different comments because people are running into issues and that's when they're only trying to mind with one GPU now imagine throwing in two or three GPUs and having them all working together using the PCI risers is not a not an easy task and personally when I build my own mining rig it took me about I'd say a month before I really had it running at full capacity now you're also dealing with overclocking you're dealing with issues with network maybe your Internet's cutting out there's lots of things you're gonna run into that you're not gonna run into if you're cloud mining so the moral of the story here is that cloud mining just a better alternative today maybe a few months ago it might have been cheaper to build your own rig and start mining with that but especially if you're a beginner and you don't know a lot about computer hardware it's gonna be a better idea to be cloud mining paying this money upfront you're gonna make a better profit and especially if we look at the price of aetherium here we're at an alltime low right now 860 we're not gonna see the price go much lower than this at least I hope we don't see it go much lower than this so if you hold on to your theorem and you wait and you ride it back up to $1200 or whatever it was before about $1300 then you're gonna be making even more profits either way that you're mining so I hope you guys enjoyed this video and you learned a little bit about cloud mining and actual mining I know everything that I did here is not perfect and that a lot of you are probably gonna say well oh there's other factors to look into but this is just trying to give people an idea if cloud mining is worth it because personally when I first started looking at cloud mining I was like well this is absolutely ridiculous but really it's almost a better deal or is a better deal in my opinion than building your own mining so if you guys like the video please leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
