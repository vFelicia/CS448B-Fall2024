hey guys and welcome back to another django tutorial now today's video is gonna be a bit shorter and i'm going to be doing is showing you guys how to use the Django admin dashboard this relates directly to databases and how you can see all of your different tables and entries and all of that I'm gonna be quickly showing you a few more things you can do with databases in terms of how to delete stuff and how to get like lists of entries so for example say you wanted to sort all of the entries or say you wanted to get all of the entries that started with a certain letter or something I'll show you how to do that this is known as querying and there's a ton of different commands for querying so I'm not gonna be showing you all of them but I'm sure you guys can look them up or we'll probably be using them throughout the series so you will learn them now I'm in my main directory right now by my site directory the first thing I'm gonna do is just quickly extend what I did in the last video and show you how you can get a list of different entries and add more than one because this will be good when we go in the admin dashboard to see more than one entry so I'm just gonna do Python manage PI and then shell and what I'm gonna do in here is again import what he called our models so from main up models imports and then here we'll do item and we'll do two to do list like that and now what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get all of the items in to do list and show you how we can kind of search for certain items so I'm just gonna say T equals todo list objects dot all like that or actually let's just do dot objects so now we don't have to keep typing that we can just type T when we want it say for example get all of the objects we can just do t dot all like that and then we get a query set that gives us all the objects but let's say we want to search for an object and before we knew how to get one using like the ID equal to one but what if we want to get all of the objects in our set that start with the letter T or that start with Tim or something like that well there's a way to do that and it's known as filtering so if we want to filter our query set and get all of the objects or all of the data that fits a specific criteria we can say t dot filter and then we can name the criteria so in this case I could say name and then I believe you can just do under underscore starts with equals and in this case Tim so there's a ton it like there's a ton of these double underscore things that you can use I don't know all of them you'd have to look them up to get them all but if I do this and I hit enter you can see that we get the same set because obviously this starts with Tim now if I do this again and I say like maybe Bob you see we get an empty query set and this is a way that you can check if a specific element you're looking for is in the set rather than trying to get it and raising an exception so for example if I want to get something that has ID equal to two and I filter that rather than getting an error we just get an empty query set because none of the IDs are equal to two right so that's how we can kind of check if what we're looking for actually exists in the database so that's how you get stuff now to delete stuff is pretty straightforward you just have to actually get that database object first so I'm gonna say del underscore object is equal to and in this case we'll say t get ID equals one now if I want to delete this very simple we'll just do del underscore object dot delete like that and if you hit enter we will delete this object so now if I type T again sorry T dot all you can see that we have an empty query set because we've obviously deleted the to do list that we've added so let's just create two more to do list really simply and we'll just say T or T 1 equals to do list like this I will just say name equals first list and then we'll do T 1 dot save and then we'll do the same thing here with witty codes T 2 and we'll just call it second list just so this way when I start doing the admin dashboard stuff which will be in one second then we'll be able to see more than one entry so we'll say second list and then T 2 dot say if like so won't bother any adding any items so that's actually it if you need to get out of this you can just type quit like that and there we go alright so now we've added some things into our database so let's go to our admin dashboard now so how do we do that well our first step to accessing the admin dashboard is to create a login account so right now if we actually run our server and we say python managed up i run server server will start running we can copy this domain here and we can go to it now remember we actually have this directory or link which is slash admin and when I do this it actually brings me to this Django admin dashboard the thing is though what username and what password should we use well we don't have any so we need to actually create one so I'm going to stop running this for a second and what I'm gonna do is create a login so I'm gonna say Python manage dot PI and then I believe it is create super user yadus so there we go create super user and then in this case what we'll do is just give a username email and password so I'm gonna put Tim as my username I'll say Tim at Tech with Tim dotnet and then for a password illustrate one two three four four now all right password is too short okay okay so I'll just use another password then what is it what is it saying here bypass password okay so it just said that's fine I can use that as a password anyways let's now try to sign in to our admin dashboard actually see what we're getting so let's say Tim and my password and click login and you oh well it would help if I ran the server my apologies on that let's run that and now let's refresh this continue and there we go we are now inside of our a band dashboard now we have these groups in this users database which is actually storing if I go to users and the users that we just created so Tim for example right and that's one database that's their same for groups this this is a bit different we don't need anything for that now the thing is where's our other database we created that database and we've been using it that has our todo list in it well we actually need to give the dashboard kind of access to that database this is really easy to do but I'm just gonna open up my sub line text again here and what we need to do to do this is go to when you call it our I believe it is admin dot PI inside of what he call it the main application folder here all right so we just have to start start by importing our models so from models import and in this case we can just import the model that we care about in this case which is to do lists because items are gonna be stored within a todo list and then we just do admin dot site dot register and then in this case we do to do list which means that now we will actually be able to see the todo list on our admin site so that's that's all we have to do for that so now this should actually automatically have updated but it may not have yeah it did not so let's just rerun our server quickly Oh everyone says reloading ok so now this should hopefully be updated if i refresh this work work work I guess not ok so let's just try this again slash admin ok so there we go sorry I've just I've been messed around so now I'm back slash admin and now you can see that under main which is our application main we have the database and model todo list so if I open this you can see that we have first list and second list now this is a quick way as well if you want to change elements or delete stuff you can go in here and obviously you can just click delete or you could save stuff you can see the history of it and all that kind of stuff so that's kind of how the admin dashboard works in terms of viewing your databases I figured I would just quickly show this to you guys because it's a really useful tool to make sure that what you're doing is actually working properly but remember if you create a new application or you're creating a new model you have to actually add that and register it from within your app and up I file inside of your application so if I wanted to add the items for example then I would have to do item the item model and I don't have to import item so let's just try that quickly and make sure I think's working with that wait for this to refresh here if I do this let's go fresh alright maybe we'll just end it and then reload oh and alright it says it reloaded so let's try this i go here and i refresh this now you can see we have items and I go to items obviously there's nothing because we don't have any items so anyways that's been the admin dashboard in the next video we're gonna go into templates which will be a much longer video on dynamically showing these kind of this information on our website
