Welcome to our digital City just like any city is composed of different buildings each with its specific function a software application too can be composed of different parts instead of a monolithic structure where one component handles every task imagine dividing these tasks among smaller specialized components each of these tiny selfcontained units is a microservice they handle one function do it well and communicate with others to create a complete software experience so how do we erect these specialized buildings well python with its versatile tools simplifies the process consider a building whose sole purpose is to greet newcomers using the flask framework in Python it might look something like this voila our greeter microservice Stands Tall and ready maybe we have another service that handles processing someone's documents and maybe one more for arranging leases and house rentals you can see that with microservices we create small simple and easy to understand components that work together to build an entire system this provides many different advantages now after we've made some microservices we typically use a server to deploy them now that's where the sponsor of this video occupy comes in occupies Cloud formerly called lenode cloud computing provides all of the cloud resources you need including high performance virtual private servers personally myself and my team use Akamai for everything from load balancers kubernetes clusters databases and storage volumes the best part is because I've been working with Akamai formed Lila node for over three years all of you can claim a free 100 credit by clicking the link in the description and signing up for a new account now as our city gains popularity it's as if flights from all over 1 to land here an airport efficiently directs planes to specific runways ensuring smooth operation and in our software context a load balancer acts just like this airport ensuring users requests are efficiently directed to the right microservice ensuring everyone gets timely service without overburdening a single component now we use a load balancer to direct traffic to different Services based on usage latency and a variety of other factors as we scale our system we create multiple instances of each microservice and a load balancer sits in front of them and manages the traffic across these instances but airports have challenges too what if a Runway undergoes repairs or a specific flight needs a specific gate similarly load balancers while efficient can face hiccups when Services change or require specific handling to handle the dynamic nature of our digital City we resort to Containers now in the software realm think of containers as specialized garages for our micro Services each garage or container ensures that the service it houses is uniform standardized and possesses all of the tools and configurations it needs to function optimally this isolation ensures our microservices run consistently regardless of where they're deployed but how do we craft these containers how do we ensure that each containerized service is built deployed and ran in a harmonized manner now that's where Docker comes in Docker is like the master architect and builder for these garages it provides the blueprint known as a Docker file to describe what goes into each container with Docker we create an image which is a template of our microservice complete with its dependencies libraries and configurations this image ensures that our service will run the same be it on a developer's laptop or a massive Cloud Server in essence Docker not only helps in creating these containerized services but ensures they are portable consistent and isolated making the development shipping and running of our microservices a truly seamless Affair if you want to learn more about Docker you can check out this video right here yet when we zoom out our city is just a part of a sprawling Metropolis at the Enterprise level scaling isn't just multiplying it's strategizing Services interconnect data consistency becomes Paramount and the city resilience is tested the true challenge lies in growing not just in size but in the efficiency and reliability of the different services that we have scaling our city involves making choices just as a city can grow upwards with taller skyscrapers or sprawl outwards covering more land our digital Metropolis can scale vertically or horizontally now vertical scaling often called scaling up is like adding more floors to an existing building in the digital world it means bolstering an existing system with more power be it Ram CPU storage gpus Etc it's a straightforward method but it has its ceiling there's a limit to how tall we can build or how much Hardware we can jam into one single machine on the other hand horizontal scaling or scaling out involves adding more buildings to our city each mirroring the other in our software City it means adding more instances of the same service to handle the increased load it's like creating a bridge between two parts of a city to distribute the traffic with horizontal scaling our city can expand almost indefinitely adapting to increased demands but it introduces complexities ensuring every service communicates efficiently data remains in consistent and the entire network functions as a cohesive unit so when our city grows from a local Hub to a sprawling Metropolis we're not just adding buildings we're strategizing ensuring traffic flows smoothly services are interconnected data is consistent and our digital dwellers enjoy uninterrupted Services it's an art and science of optimizing both size and efficiency our digital City's Journey from its micro services to its vast expanse mirrors the evolution of software and I hope that it helped you understand the basics of microservices if you want to learn more about scaling software and microservices make sure to check out some of the free guides that I've linked below from our video sponsor Akamai they are experts at providing the tools needed for Enterprise level software and you can check them out from the link in the description
