now the first kind of category of projects I have here is artificial intelligence now in my opinion these are the most fun to work on and they also stand out a lot on a resume because even though they might not take a ton of time they're just really cool they sound impressive and that's kind of what you're going for with these type of projects so the first idea I have here is to make an artificial intelligence that can play a game so you can start with something really simple like pop make a neural network that can play the game of Pop now of course there's a ton of other stuff that you can do with AI you can make an AI chatbot you can make an AI that trades stocks for you you can do all kinds of stuff but I really like the game idea because you can actually build the game yourself in something like pie game and then design an AI in whatever way you like to actually play the game for you
