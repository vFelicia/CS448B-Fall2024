so i'm going to keep this video short and to the point i'm working for a tech startup it's very early stage it's called velocity and we are hiring software engineers specifically game developers we have a significant amount of funding we're ready to hire people today and if you'd like to apply you can check out the link in the description now specifically we're looking for people that have experience with html5 and javascript game development if you know how to build games in the browser we want to hire you we will hire you as soon as we possibly can we will pay you well we'll make sure you can work whenever you want at any point in time completely remotely you will work alongside me as well as a few other guys that are kind of the business heads of the business i'm just the engineer here and this is a great opportunity from a very very fast growing company that has a ton of potential now i'm going to talk to you about the company what the idea is and all of that stuff but i just want to reiterate again if you're a game developer you're looking for some type of work parttime or fulltime please consider applying have a look in the description all right so what is this company as i said it is called velocity now what we're doing here is providing cognitive training for amateur athletes so this can be in many different formats but for now we're going to be building out a mobile application and this mobile app will have a ton of different games that train different cognitive functions so decision making anticipation spatial awareness etc those are a few examples of things that we would be training now this is going to be very specific for athletes this is not just these kind of general purpose brain training apps that you see we're really targeting the athletics market and the idea here is that good athletes train their bodies but great athletes train their minds it's kind of like weightlifting for your mind right all the pro athletes those guys go to million dollar simulators and facilities and they do cognitive training but if you're kind of an amateur athlete you play in house league or you play in rep or you're just not kind of at that level yet you don't have access to that training and we want to provide that that's really the goal of this company now of course there's a ton of other things that i could describe i'm not here to give you a sales pitch this is if you want a job if you want to invest that's a completely different story anyways that is kind of what the company is about so again going back to the role here we need people to build these games i am the engineer i am the one who's building the entire app and then within the app we're going to have a web view and that web view will actually run the different html5 games that will train cognitive functions now we can provide you with kind of templates of the games that we need to be built but we're looking for people that have experience with graphics with sound with animations that can build the game out add their own creative touches and spins and ideally do this at a relatively fast pace if you're someone who thinks you can do this there's a ton of opportunity at this company again it is very early stage right now we're about four employees but we are growing very quickly and we have a really strong team behind us again i want to be really careful how much i share here on youtube all i'll say is if you're interested please leave an application down below in the description i have a little form there that you can fill out provide some information about yourself and if i think you are a good fit i'm going to read through all the applications myself i will reach out to you we'll have a very short kind of informal interview and then we're ready to get started as soon as you are ready so the last thing i'll say here is that i am obviously highly invested in this company a lot of my time is going towards this i am a shareholder of this company i've invested my own money as well and the reason i'm doing that is because i really do see a potential here i think this is something that could be very massive and quite frankly make a lot of money if we execute this properly and i'm just sharing that with you because i could easily sit back continue filming youtube videos and spend the next few years just making hundreds of thousands of dollars per year with these videos instead what i'm doing is diverting my time taking a bit of a risk and really committing to this idea so i just want you to know i'm very invested in this if you decide to join this you'll be working alongside me there's a lot of potential to join as a fulltime employee potentially get some stock we're very openminded and we're really just looking to build the best team and get the best people if you think you can commit some time to this if you're willing to give it a shot please give a application in the description again i'm going to review all of them myself and reach out to anyone i think might be a fit hopefully you guys enjoyed this if you want some more updates on the startup let me know in the comments down below and i will see you in another youtube video
