hey guys welcome back to another video in today's video I'm just going to showing you some cool visual basic scripts that you can use to scare your friends or just to play around with and just to see some cool things that you can make your computer do so in this example I'm going to be showing you kind of like a fake virus kind of a script it's kind of cheesy kind of some of the stuff I made it a few years ago so don't judge it too hard but yeah and then I'm gonna be showing you pretty much how to code it really quickly just giving you some of the commands then you can play around with it at home and if you want to have this file I'm going to leave the text version of it in the description below so that you can just copy and paste it if you don't want to write it up by yourself and then I'll leave one other file down below which is another kind of virus one but I'm not going to show it in this one so the first thing we're going to do then right away is I'm just going to show you what this looks like and you see if you're interested in it or not so pretty much it pops up and you've just got a little window here and just kind of those warning you saying are you sure you want to open this file like it looks like it's like corrupted and then here it really doesn't matter which one you click it's always going to be the same thing and then again some more text boxes are going to pop up I'm just going to let it run through and you can just read it yourself so again all of this is just fake stuff right it's just like this are you scared yet and then it's going to put your username in there and then whatever again doesn't matter what you click it's still gonna just say the same thing here and then a bunch of more things are going to keep popping up yeah we got registry error here and then I just type in a few commands and the command prompt here opening that up and it looks somewhat real some of this I mean it's kind of cool if someone doesn't really know anything about computers and you want to try to kind of scare them a little bit this is a good way to do it and then that's all I've got there just goes to deleting C Drive I mean I could make it go on for a long time and do some more but that's just an example just to show you guys how to use a VBS a little bit of Visual Basic VBS same thing so yeah let's get into the code then so that's pretty much how the file works is a few popups message boxes some keys that are being typed out pretty basic thing so the first thing we need to do is you just need to open a text editor so in this case I'm going to open up notepad plus plus you can use notepad regular notepad whatever you want doesn't matter so this is the file that I was using I'll just scroll through it quickly and you can see it's pretty repetitive it's just the same things over and over again and then there's a few like message boxes and some variables and stuff but nothing too complex so we'll just create a new file and we'll start from scratch so a new file here first thing we need to do is need to save the file so let's just go file and then save as and we'll save it into this hacks folder share and let's say virus totally not a sketchy name so VBS now we need to go down here in the save type and we need to change it to a VBS file so go all the way down to the bottom when you see you Visual Basic so VB your VBS and we'll do that there we go and we'll just change this to s VBS like that and save it okay so now let's go ahead and let us start typing so the first line we need to type is as so you don't worry about what a lot of this means just type it out the works owsh shell is equal to and the capitals do matter in this i'll remind you again w script dot create object so this creating object is creating a new new task in our task vendor and then w script dot show just like that you know what i actually think we need double quotations here it may not matter but let's just make sure that we need to use the doubles all right and now i'm going to show you some of the commands that I used in my program to make that thing because you can make yours as unique as you want as long as you want as short as you want and yeah there's a lot of other cool VBS stuff and I'm going to make some more videos on some cool viruses too that you can kind of make okay so the first thing we'll do here is I'll show you how to run a program so we're just going to do W SH so what we've typed up above there and then shell oops my capitals are off there and then don't run like this and then in double quotations you should type the program you want to run in this case I want to do CMD so now if I actually run this program so by doing that I have to find my directory so I think it's in this little hacks folder I have here yep and then if I go virus VBS you'll see right now all it does is it just runs the command prompt like that for us so I've actually I've accidentally closed some of these things so I'll reopen them okay so it just runs the command prompt so that's pretty basic and now we'll talk about the how to get the keys in put it in there so if you saw before in mind it was like typing out words and had some words that popped up on the screen so this is how you do this it's just W SH and then shell so same thing we just typed and then dot send keys and then you're just going to type the key that you want to send so the key that you want types in this case I'll just do H and then after this we're going to want to pause the program for a few seconds so that it looks like it's being typed onto the screen so we'll just do this so lewd w oops sorry w script dot sleep and then the amount of time you want to sleep in milliseconds so 1000 milliseconds is one second we don't want to quite goes out long we'll do about 400 and then what I did in my program is since I want to type out a word so in this case we'll do hello I just kept copying this and then I just changed these letters so I'll change that to e change that to L change that's L make this oh look that pretty basic and then if you want to get a message box going after that through this is the way that you can do it there's two different ways and there's a lot of different types of message boxes I'm just going to be showing you the error message box today if you want to mess around with different types of message boxes and have like if you saw my first one I had a bunch of different keys like a board retry you can just look that up on find a different video or something on Macs I'm not going to show that today so all you have to do is just type message box like this and then where you're going to do for that is you're going to type in what you want to say so in this case I'll just say like err oops if I could spell err correctly then a comma oops I spelt it wrong again alright err like that a comma the type of message box so like the keys I'm pretty sure this one is so I'm going to do 48 and then we are going to do err so not in brackets were just gonna type air like that and you see how it highlights an orange so we know that's a key word right and now let's try to run this so if I go back to my directory wherever that is and we run it let's just see what happens so again you see we're typing a low just like that so we missed the H not sure quite why and then we get message box that pops up and it says air just like that so yeah that's pretty much how you can do some of the different message boxes and sending the keys now I'll show you one more how we type the what do you call it sorry how we like hit enter so if you want to go a new line then if we want to hit enter then we can do that so we'll just do the same thing here W sh sh l dot send keys and then this time same thing double quotations then we're going to use the curly brackets and we're going to type enter in here and then you'll see again if I run the program opening our directory then it will actually tab down one and the reason it's not typing hello is because we didn't do a delay after we ran the CMD so it did H before CMD was actually opened if that makes sense to you guys so yeah that's pretty much all you have to do to make a cool little virus thing I'm going to put the code from my original one in the description so if you just want to copy and paste that feel free and then this is just showing you how you guys can kind of customize a little bit by yourself and maybe scare your friends yeah so if you liked the video please like and subscribe and I'm going to be doing some more VBS stuff on my channel so yeah
