hey guys and welcome back to another video so I have to start off by just giving a massive thank you to everyone who's been subscribed to the channel and to everyone this helped me get to this point yesterday was officially the day that we hit 10,000 subscribers and I can't tell you guys how thrilled I am about done how long I've been waiting and trying to accomplish this goal so obviously a massive thank you to all of you guys I couldn't have done it without you and the amount of support that you guys showed me on this channel it's just unreal and it's the reason that I keep going and keep posting videos so before I get into this video I'm gonna be doing a Q&A I just want to talk about kind of what's going on for the next week or so so I'm gonna be really busy with school actually have three midterms coming up in a few days so it's unlikely that I'm gonna get to posting more than maybe one other video before those midterms on the weekend so I apologize in advance that there won't be many much tutorial content coming out but after that weekend I'm done with the busyness of school done midterm season or whatever you want to call it and then I'll be getting right back into regular uploads and we'll be getting right back on track so hopefully you guys can bear with me on that so starting this video I just want to say like you guys ask me a ton of questions and I get the same questions all the time so I'm gonna start responding to those ones and then I kind of go through some other questions that I get really commonly and just answer those for you so one of the first questions I get all the time it's really simple answer is how old are you now I could not tell you guys how many times I can almost a day I get this question at least once a day so the answer that is 18 and a bit more context 18 years old right and I'm in computer science first year at university because that's also another question that goes along with it are you in school are you doing this professionally what not so I'm by no means a professional programmer or computer scientist I am still learning just like you guys but I love to share my knowledge online and to help out people that were at some point in my position learning and getting better with computers and what okay so the next question is how many programming languages do you know and what is your favorite programming language now I used to know quite a few back when I was learning like when I was like 12 or 13 so I'll go through them quickly but right now the only ones I'm really comfortable programming in would be csharp Java and Python and then maybe a bit of Swift but essentially when I started I knew HTML CSS JavaScript PHP that was kind of like one stage of programming all the web development kind of stuff and then I moved into csharp where I just kind of did csharp for about a year and then I did Python and then a bit of Swift because I was working on some apps and then I did Python and now are sorry not Python Java which I'm doing for my computer science courses right now in school but Python is by far my favorite programming language it's super powerful and super simple and I can write scripts in Python faster than I can write them at anything else and in some cases they're even more effective and more efficient than other languages so that answers that question okay so another question that I get a amazing amount of times is how do I learn programming or I just started learning program and what are my next steps what should I do now I've said this a million times maybe not in the formal video of interesting comments but the number one thing to do is to program a lot of people get stuck up by trying to learn syntax and trying to learn like the formalities of a language before really working on any projects that is by no means what I did to learn programming I learned like the very basics just enough to the point where I was comfortable making my own project or my own program and then what I did is I just learned and you guys would see like on the stream for example that I did the 24 hour stream I didn't know how to do a lot of the stuff that I was doing I had some kind of an idea but what I was doing was I was looking it up I was asking for help going on the Internet and that's essentially the best way to learn is because when you're doing projects you're gonna find really quickly and things you understand and things you don't understand and then you're able to kind of look at the things that you're having trouble with learn those or you also run into issues that you never would have seen by simply reading let's say a book on programming or going to a website now if you're an absolute beginner obviously that can be kind of intimidating trying to just go work on a project so I definitely recommend you know checking out some YouTube videos or doing like maybe an online and just doing that for like a week or two in getting the basics of program understanding fundamentals and then start working on small projects maybe go back learn a bit more another small project and really project project project is all I have to say do your own thing code things that interest you because that is the best way to learn and that's what I've done and that's how I've gone to the point that I'm at right now okay so the next question this one isn't as commonly asked but I figured I answer because I think it's pretty interesting is what is the most difficult part of programming or of coding now obviously this is gonna vary depending on each person some people probably tell you to syntax I'm like really depends for me I would definitely say getting stuck on a problem and something especially that you think you should be able to do and I say this just because I recently did that 24hour live stream you guys can check that out on the channel but I was realizing pretty quickly that the most frustrating part was when you run into a problem that just stumps you and you can't get past it and especially for me I'm a little bit selfish and I don't want to just move on I want to try to fix the problem and when you keep looking at the same problem for so long without having a fresh perspective on it it can be really frustrating and that's one of the things that I was getting frustrated with as well on the stream was I wasn't really making any progress for about an hour I would just be stuck on the same problem and I wasn't moving anywhere I forgot two hours I essentially had done nothing except figured out why my code didn't work right so you could say that's something but I think that's maybe one of the hardest parts is going maybe days or hours without really getting anything done and just trying to figure things out and if you're not mentally strong I want to say um it is quite difficult to do and I mean I'm sure you guys probably ran into similar issues where you run into a bug that just really frustrates you and all you want to do is either fix it or just give up on it and that's one of the probably hardest parts of programming is dealing with running into issues where you think everything should be working but it's just not ok so now I'm just kind of taking questions from the live stream that I did a few days ago I just ask people like ask me a bunch of questions and I answered them on there but I'll answer them again here someone asked me what are my thoughts on my computer science classes are they difficult that's very hard to answer because it's going to depend some persons school school but for me personally my computer science classes are very straightforward they are getting a bit more complicated now like a few algorithms and data structures but nothing too advanced or that I'm not capable of handling I personally don't go to many computer science classes because I know most of the concepts they're teaching and I find it's a lot better for me when I'm practicing those concepts to just be at home and you know work on what I need to work on rather than listening to a prof. and maybe he's trying to teach it in a way where other people don't know the concepts already whereas I'm just kind of reinforcing my learning so I would say they're very straightforward at least for first year my introduction of computing class I had last semester was just Python super straightforward like videos on my channel are way more advanced and a lot of stuff they did on there and now the wouldn't call it computing 2 which is Java is a bit more advanced but nothing too complicated we're just moving into stacks right now so we did like Q based algorithms now we're doing stacks and I forget what else we're doing for the rest of the semester but pretty straightforward okay so next question and I'm kind of just formulating this in a general question that I get Ansel asked the lawn is are you software developer do you do this for a living is YouTube like a fulltime gig for you most of you should know this is not by any means a fulltime gig I'm by no means a software developer some of you might try to argue that but I don't consider myself a software developer or like a professional programmer it's just something I like to do and have a passion for YouTube is not a fulltime thing whatsoever I'm a fulltime student that is my priority but YouTube is something that I do as a hobby and I kind of consider like a part of my day now you know what I mean like when I wake up part of my day is slaughtered doing YouTube part of its to school part of its going to class so I just love doing YouTube videos I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't love it you guys know that this doesn't make me that much money and I don't do it obviously for the money that being said though if you guys would like to help me out and to support the channel you guys could go to my patreon link in the description and by simply just donating like a dollar a month that really shows me like a tremendous amount of support and if you guys can afford then you get a lot of value out of my content I would really appreciate that okay guys so I'm gonna start wrapping up the video now obviously I want to give another massive thank you to everyone that's helped me out everyone that subscribed to the channel that comments that likes it really does mean the world to me this is a massive accomplishment for me and I'm really excited to be at this number but I do have to say this is just the beginning of tech with Tim I have so many new plans so many things planned for the future and I'm really excited to see where the channel goes and I think you guys should be as well not being said quick kind of just what's gonna be going on in the future in some videos I'm gonna be trying I want to know your feedback on them essentially you might notice I'm actually recording with a brand new camera right now so yesterday right when I hit 10k I actually went over to the store and I decided to buy myself a brand new camera and lens I'll put like the specs for it in the description if you care to see what it is but essentially this means now that I have a high quality like recording thing that I like camera I can actually do videos where I'm recording more of myself so like face to face videos like this I can also do videos record like my PC setup or like physical things in real life like maybe a day in the life so let me know what you guys think about that and if there's any videos that you'd specifically like to see that maybe aren't tutorial content and maybe more about me or my life or whatnot I do want to try to do like maybe a video using this camera a week that's kind of the goal right now we'll see where it takes us and what it looks like with that being said I'm gonna wrap up the video here another massive thank you to everyone and I will see you guys again in the next video
