foreign I'll be walking you through a mini python project where we'll create a password generator this will be a relatively simple project beginner friendly and a quick way to practice some python skills and potentially learn some new stuff in the Python language with that said if you're looking to learn more about Python and become a software engineer check out my course programming expert I'll leave a link in the description if you're interested in web3 and blockchain development then check out my other course blockchain expert which again will be linked in the description with that said let's dive into it and create a password generator all right so let's dive into the project just as a quick brief here what we're going to do is create a password manager that allows us to generate passwords with a minimum length so maybe you pass a minimum length of seven that means any password you get will have well a minimum length of seven continuing we're also going to allow the user to set if they want the password to contain special characters and if they wanted to contain numbers this way it's slightly Dynamic and we can create some different types of path passwords sorry so that said let's get into the project so I'm here in Visual Studio code I assume that you have a python environment set up you can do this in really any version of python and we're going to start at the top of our program here by importing two modules that we're going to use so we're going to import random and we're going to import string now we're going to use string to just grab all of the lowercase and uppercase letters that exist and then all the special characters as well as all the numbers or digits kind of a cool thing that you may not have seen before now there's two different things that we need to do here the first first thing we need to do is ask the user what the minimum length is if they want numbers if they want special characters Etc and then we need to write a function which is actually going to generate the password we can do this in any order that we want for now I'm going to start by writing the function so I'm going to say Def and then I'm going to say generate underscore password and for the parameters of this function I'm going to pass the following which is the minimum length then I'm going to pass numbers is equal to true and then special underscore characters is equal to true and for now I'm just going to write pass here while I explain this so these are the parameters the things that you need to pass the function when you call it again we start with the minimum length which will be a number and then we have two optional parameters here where we can specify if we want the password to include numbers or if we wanted to include special characters the way you would call this function is like so so I would say generate password and if I passed just 10 then that would create a password for me that has minimum length of 10 and includes numbers and special characters if we passed say like 10 and then false that would mean we'd have a password of minimum like 10 would not include numbers but would include special characters so you can see that if I only pass one of the different arguments then I'm kind of substituting that here for this parameter obviously I could pass both of them as well if I wanted to do that so I could say false and false but by default if you don't pass them we're going to have that equal to true okay all right so now that we're here I just want to grab all of the potential characters so like numbers special characters letters Etc that we could be using so I'm going to say letters is equal to string dot ASCII underscore characters uh is it ASCII characters or ASCII letters I think it's ASCII letters then I'm going to say digits is equal to string Dot and then I think it's digits uh yes that's correct and then I'm going to say special underscore chars is equal to and then this is going to be actually let's make this special is equal to string dot punctuation I think I spelled that correctly okay now I'm just going to quickly print these out just so you can see what they look like and then we will continue so I'm going to say generate password and we'll just pass 10 for now just so that we can see what these are okay so when I call the function you can see that what we get printed here is all of the lowercase and uppercase English letters then we get all of the digits and then we get all of these special characters which are really just all the punctuation on our keyboard perfect so I just want all of those so that I can kind of create the set of characters that I'm going to select from when I generate this password so now we need to combine all of these into one kind of list or one large string that we're going to randomly choose from however that string that we're going to randomly choose from should only contain uh what we have specified here so for example if we're including numbers and we're including special characters then we want to be picking from all three of these variables so either a letter number or special character every single time we kind of generate a new character for the password if we're not using numbers and obviously it's just letters and special and then if we are using numbers but not special characters then it's just letters and our special characters so how do we do this well we're going to say the following we're going to say um should I do the selections now let's call this characters is equal to letters because we're always going to have letters no matter what then I'm going to say if numbers like this then characters plus equals and then digits so if this variable is true for including numbers I'm going to take all of my digits which by the way are inside of a string and I'm going to add those to the letter string so now they're combined and then I'm going to say if special characters like this then characters plus equal special like that so now if we have our special characters we add that to our characters which will allow us to select from those when we are generating the password perfect so now what we're going to do is start a loop and during every iteration of that loop we're going to generate a new character to add to our random password and we're going to continue that Loop until we meet the criteria so until we have for example a number a special character and we are at the minimum length so we need to set up a few variables here the first variable I'm going to create is PWD which stands for password and this is what will store the password the next variable is going to be called meet criteria and actually this will be meets criteria I'm going to make this equal to false now we're going to set this variable to True once the password meets the criteria and meeting the criteria will mean that it includes a number and a special character or it just includes a number or just includes a special character Etc and that's going to be based on what the input is to this function so we want to make sure that we have at least one special character and at least one number if you made these equal to True next we're going to have a variable that tells us if we do have a number in our password so we're going to say has number for right now that's going to be equal to false and then we're going to have has special and that's going to be equal to false as well okay so now that we have these variables we're going to create a while loop and we're going to say well not meets underscore criteria uh like that and actually not and or PWD the Len of PWD is less than the min length okay so this is the condition for our for Loop or for our while loop sorry so we're saying while we are not meeting the criteria so while we don't have a special character or don't have a number or whatever that criteria is or the length of our password is not yet equal to or greater than the minimum length we're going to continue doing this where we're going to continue adding characters to our password hopefully that makes a little bit of sense now I'm going to generate a random character that I want to add to my password add it and then if it's a number I'm going to set has number equal to true if it's a special character I'm going to set has special equal to true and then at the bottom of the while loop I'm going to adjust this meets criteria variable to tell me if the password currently meets the criteria based on these two parameters so we're going to say new underscore Char is equal to random dot Choice and then this is going to be from the characters uh kind of string here so we've built this character string which has all of our available characters we can pick from so we're going to randomly pick one using random.choice just picks a random element out of the string for us that's why we imported random and we're going to add that to our password so PWD plus equals and then the new underscore chart we're now going to say if the new character is in our digits so is in digits like that then has underscore number is equal to true and we're going to say l if the new Char is in our special characters then has special is equal to true so again this is telling us if this character exists inside of the digits which we have up here and it's telling us if it exists inside of our special characters which we have right here if it does then we're going to adjust these variables so we know now if we have a special character and if we have a number there's a few other ways to go about doing this but the way I'm coding this is one of the more efficient ways rather than rechecking the entire password every single time to see if it has a special character or see if it has a number okay so next what we need to do now is update this meets criteria variable so it's a little bit strange how I'm going to do this but I want to show you a kind of a more complicated way just as a bit of a learning experience here so I'm going to say meets criteria is equal to true now you're going to see this as a common pattern when you're programming that you actually start a variable equal to true and then you try to prove that the variable is false and then if that's the case you set it to false so I'm going to say meets criteria is equal to true then I'm going to check a few things and set it to false if it needs to be false okay that's how it's going to work and if I didn't set it to false that means well I've met the criteria so I'm going to say if numbers like this and remember numbers is telling me that I should include numbers in the um in the password so I'm going to say if numbers then meets criteria is equal to and in this case we can just say numbers or not numbers sorry has underscore uh number then we're going to say if special and did I just call it special no special characters then meets criteria is equal to meets criteria and in this case uh special has underscore special okay now the way this works is I'm starting by saying if we should include a number then we're going to set the meets criteria variable equal to if we have a number or not so if we do have a number this is going to be equal to true if we don't it's going to be equal to false then after that no matter what so whether this is true or false I'm going to do this other if statement where I say if we have special characters or if we should include special characters then meets criteria is going to be equal to meet criteria and has special now the reason I'm using this and here is because if has number was equal to false or if at this point meets criteria is equal to false then it doesn't meet the criteria right if we don't have a number but we're supposed to include a number we don't meet the criteria so it doesn't matter what has special is this should return false so that's why I'm putting beats criteria here then I'm checking that with has special so if we did have a number for example if this if statement was true then this is equal to true and if we have a special character then that's equal to true so meets criteria is equal to true if we didn't have a number but we do have a special character then this is equal to false hopefully you can kinda understand where I'm going here and how this works there's a bunch of other ways I could probably have written this a little more clear but I just wanted to show you an approach of kind of doing it in this format and using a what would you call it a chain conditional or a compound conditional here with the and keyword if you're not familiar with the and keyword this expression returns true only if both the left hand side and the right hand side are true so try if you don't understand to pause the video and kind of figure out what I'm doing here and how that works but this will now kind of finish our generate password function so from here I'm now going to return my password and at this point it's guaranteed that my password is going to have at least one number and at least one special character and be the minimum length assuming that this was true and this was true all right so let me zoom out here we'll run through the code quickly and then we can do our inputs so the user is going to tell us the minimum length if it should have a special character Etc and we'll kind of test the program out so we get our letters digits and special characters fairly straightforward we then create a string that contains all of the different characters we could be selecting from so we've already explained how that works then we say our password is empty we currently do not meet the criteria we do not have a number and we do not have a special character now we say while not meets criteria or the length of our password is less than the minimum length so if either of these two are true then we're going to continue then we generate a new character by randomly selecting from the characters we can pick from we add that to our password and then we determine if that new character was a number if it was we're going to say has numbers equal to true and if it was a special character we're going to say has specialist equally true then we're going to set meets criteria equal to true and if we have a number or if we should include a number sorry I keep mixing this up but if we should include a number but we don't have a number we're going to set meets criteria equal to false if we should include a number and we do have a number that meets criteria will stay true okay then we go here and we say if special characters then meets criteria is equal to meets criteria and has special which is what I just explained which will make sure that this is going to be equal to false if we don't have one of the two things that we need then when these conditions are false so when we are meeting the criteria and when the length of the password is at least the minimum length then we will return the password okay so let's just try calling generate password using some manual inputs then we can grab our user inputs I'm going to say PWD is equal to generate password and then I'm going to print PWD here and for now we're just going to generate it with 10 minimum characters and containing numbers and special characters okay notice that this is the password that we got we can run it again we'll get another password and we can keep running this as many times as we'd like so now the last step is to ask the user to give us the information that we pass to this function so we're going to say the Min underscore length is equal to input let me zoom in a little bit here so we can read this better and I'm going to say enter the minimum length Okay then we're going to convert this to an integer because we need this as a number value we're just going to assume they give us a valid integer if they don't it's going to crash the program but we don't need to handle that right now we're just going to assume they give us valid input then we are going to say uh has number is equal to and then input do you want to have a number or do you want to have numbers question mark and then we'll say that we're going to accept either y or no all right and then we're going to have has special we're going to say do you want to have special characters now for both of these inputs I'm going to convert them to lower cases so dot lower is just going to take whatever the user types in and convert it into lowercase so we're gonna do that here and then I'm going to check if this is equivalent to Y so if the lowercase thing that they typed in is equal to the lowercase letter Y then that means yes we should have a number and then same thing here check if this equal to lowercase y so they if they type anything other than y either uppercase or lowercase then we are not going to include the number we're not going to include the special character okay so this is going to return a Boolean for us giving us either true or false next I'm going to go down here to PWD and I'm going to pass all my parameters so I'm going to say Min length has number and has special and then I can print the generated password is and then whatever the password is all right so quickly run through this we asked them first what is the minimum length they want we convert that into an integer because we need a number value and by default whatever is entered in the input statement is going to be a string so we had to convert that to an INT then we ask them if they want to include a number we cast that or convert that to lowercase and then we check if it's equal to Y the double equal sign in Python checks for equivalence so we're checking if they're exactly the same if it is then this is true and we will include a number then we do the same thing for special characters we take all of our three values here that we've asked the user for pass that to our function and then print out with the generated password is so let's run this okay Enter the minimum length Let's Go with 25 do we want to include numbers yes do we want to include special characters let's go with no and there you go we get our password we can run this again minimum length let's go with 20 numbers no special characters yes and we actually got a small error here it says local variable meets criteria referenced before assignment let me have a look at why we're getting this we'll fix that error and then we'll be done alright so the issue is that I accidentally spelled this wrong so criteria has to have the i a and I only had a so it was saying I referenced it before assignment because I spelled the variable wrong so let's just run this again and test this one more time so 20 uh yes and no and there you go we're all good we generated our password alright so with that said I've just zoomed out so you can read all of the code here I'm going to start wrapping it up if you want
