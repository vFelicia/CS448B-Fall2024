hey guys and welcome to the third video in my Python turtle tutorial series you guys might notice it looks a bit different and this is being recorded like four months later that's because I honestly completely forgot about the series and only recently has it started getting a few more views so I decided I would continue it because a lot of you guys have been asking for that anyways I'm gonna be working in PyCharm today it's that's the editor that I'm using anything I do in here is will work more than fine and ideally there's nothing like fancy I'm gonna do in here that you can't do in Idol or any other editor so don't worry about that okay so in this tutorial like I mentioned before we're gonna be going over events and how you can draw things using like user input so not just drawing like a static shape every time you're on the program like the user gets to pick by hitting certain keys or hitting the mouse what they want to draw on the screen which is essentially what we wanted to get into right so first I'm going to import turtle I'm going to import random and I don't know if I have to do this but I'm just going to do it in case from turtle import star it just means import everything alright I'm gonna set up a turtle object we've already done this before say Tim equals well I can't type turtle thought turtle like that I'm just gonna give him a speed of 0 which is maximum speed so that when we hit a key it instantly moves we don't have to wait we don't get any delay I'm gonna give a width of 5 like that okay now I'm just gonna set up these colors I'm actually just gonna copy in a list the same one that I had in the last tutorial just because we're gonna do something with the colors as well and I don't really need to waste time typing those out ok so we've got some colors and now what the whole goal of this program is going to be used to allow the user to hit keys and based on what they hit the keys they're gonna move like left/right up/down and so on so what we need to do actually to do this we have to set up a few functions and these functions are gonna represent what happens when you hit the certain key so we need a function code up okay we need a function called down and then obviously left and right as well okay okay so we've got these functions now let's figure out what we're gonna actually do in here so in the up function here what I do is I want to set the heading of the turtle and I'll talk about what this does in a second because I can't remember if I talked to an earlier video 290 which means north which is upwards and then we're gonna go forward 100 so what this is gonna do essentially is it's gonna point our turtle upwards and then it's gonna go 100 so no matter what direction it was most recently in we go up and then we go hundred and these are similar for down left and right so except for down the heading is gonna be 270 because it's directly opposite of up and this is just like basic compass headings okay and then for left we're going to need a heading of 180 and forward again of 100 and then for right we need to change the heading simply to zero okay and though that's pretty much how we're gonna move the turtle this is really straight forward so now I'll go into the events that we're gonna need to use so in turtle there's these things called events and events is pretty much anything that the user does so any input from them so you moving your mouse around as an event hitting a key on like anything that you can do on the computer so like a keyboard and mouse is an event and it's gonna pick up on those events some things we just have to determine which events we want to listen to and react to so the first event or the first thing we need to do when we're gonna be listening for events is we have to type turtle dot listen and this is just gonna let the program know that we're now listening for events and we're able to do what I'm about to do now so there's these things called on key alright and this is what's gonna determine what key was hit so I'm just gonna type it out and I'll kind of talk about it as we go through so turtle dot on key okay and in here I'm gonna put up as the function and I'm gonna push string up like this okay so the way that this works is now that we're listening for events we're gonna see okay so if turtle on key we're gonna activate this function based on this key so pretty much what this is doing essentially is looking for the up key if it's been hit then we're gonna do whatever is in this up function and notice I don't need the brackets like that it's just gonna automatically call the up function so we don't need to do anything so I'm gonna copy this and I'm gonna put it four times so up and that we need down left and obviously right and then we're gonna have to change the function names as well okay right and down left and finally right okay so again what these are doing simply listening to see if this key is hit so keep up and up in this string represents your arrow key the up arrow key down left right same thing and then we're just gonna call these functions and do what we've done in here really straightforward that was only one more thing we need and it's this main loop thing okay so what this main loop does is simply is gonna keep continuing to look for all of these key presses until the program is closed by us meaning we hit the X button if we don't have this main loop what happens is the program is just gonna instantly close because well we're not drawing anything and it looks for events and if no event is hit like the second we open the program then it's just gonna close so we need to add this main loop and whatever you're putting main loop make sure you put it at the very bottom of your program okay and it can't be inside like actually I think it can be inside a function but for now we're gonna leave it in the main okay I'm gonna run the program and you can see now that we popped up with little turtle graphics and if I hit the left arrow key I'm left if I go up I go up left down and you can see that we can kind of draw around the screen and that's pretty cool that we were able to do that in like a few minutes by just hitting a few arrow keys okay and you guys can mess around with this change the color or whatever so now what I'm gonna show you is what happens when you click the mouse one so this is pretty boring I want to add some colors to my turtle like screen or whatever okay so the way I'm gonna do that is I'm gonna say if the user hits the left mouse button I want to change the color of the turtle to be a random color if they hit the left mouse button or the right mouse button sorry then I want something different to happen I want to like stamp the turtle and I think I talked to it stamp in the other videos okay so what I'm gonna do now here I'm gonna step another function cuz we're gonna have to check to see if the user hit the left or right mouse button so we need functions for them so what's gonna happen when you click them so I'm gonna say this one is click left okay and we actually need to type in two parameters in here and I'll talk about why we need to do that in just one second okay so if they click left what I want to do is I want to what do you call it change the color right okay so to do this we've done this before Tim color and is equal to random dot choice colors so I noticed someone commented in my other video this is a lot easier way to select a random item out of a list so all this does is just randomly pick an item out of our list and gives it in the color 4 so I'm just gonna do that and save us a bit of time okay so I'm just gonna copy this and make one called click right okay it does need this X&Y again so make sure that's in there that's important and when we click write what I want to do is I want to stamp D turtle down on the screen okay so now these ones are a bit different for mouse buttons alright when you're clicking Mouse buttons so there's two different types of clicks that you could actually do you can do a click on the actual turtle or you can do a click on the turtle screen now in our case I want to do it on the screen so they can click anywhere on on the actual title screen to change the color but if you wanted to do just on the turtle what you would do is I'll just type it out in case I don't you guys want to do this turtle duck sorry on click like this okay and then it's gonna be the same thing as here so what you do is say you wanted to say if you actually click the turtle object then you'd say click left and then you can either type 1 2 or 3 here now 1 stands for your left mouse button 2 stands for your middle mouse button and 3 stands for your right mouse button okay so if you wanted it to be a left mouse button you would obviously want to put 1 now the thing is we don't want to have it when they click on the turtle object we want to have it when they click anywhere on the screen so the way that we do this is just type on screen and click so it's pretty intuitive and same thing we're gonna click left when they're clicking the left mouse button now I'm gonna copy this paste it down here and simply change this to 3 and then change this to click right because like I mentioned 3 stands for right mouse button click right is what's happening let me click the right mouse button and let's test this out and make sure everything's working ok so I'm gonna start moving and if I click mouse button so my leftmost button you can see that we change colors and I can continue to click it as much as I want and we just keep randomly changing colors now what happens if I click my right mouse button you can see that actually stamped down that little arrow on wherever we're drawing like this okay and you guys can do whatever you want with your event so now that you know about events and you already know about a bunch of different turtle methods and stuff like that you could change this to be for example if you wanted to be the a key you would change it to a if you want to be spacebar I think you'd have to look it up for space folks I don't know it is but if you want to be like the six key you just put six and it's pretty intuitive in terms of the actual names that go in this string anyways I hope you guys learned a little bit that has been it for this tutorial on the turtle graphics I'm gonna do another tutorial where I talk about more stuff in terms of drawing with the actual mouse so you can move your mouse around and draw like different shapes and objects and yeah that'll be in the next video so make sure you guys leave a like and subscribe and I'll see you again in the next one
