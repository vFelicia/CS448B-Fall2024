hey guys and welcome back today's video is gonna be a bit different so since we're almost reaching about 5k now and I haven't really done one of these before I'm gonna be kind of giving you guys a general channel update and overview talking about what I have planned for the future and what's coming to the channel since we're almost hit that 5k milestone I figured it was about time and I just wanted to let all the subscribers know and all the people that all you guys that are watching right now that have helped me to grow to this point what's coming next and what you can expect so first of all I have to give a massive thank you to everyone who's watched any my videos who subscribe to the channel who's watching this video right now because obviously I couldn't do this without you guys and the amount of positive feedback that I get every day is really what motivates me to keep going I'm gonna post some little comments here here and there throughout the video it's just like a timelapse of some coding I do but really like every day when I wake up and I read these comments it just motivates me to go and make more videos and help people out and that's really the goal of this channel you guys know that it's small it doesn't make too much money but every time when I wake up and I see like these positive comments and people are saying keep it up man good work this video really helped me out well that means a lot to me and I'm really grateful that my content is able to help you guys out and help you learn programming because this is some of the stuff that I would have wanted to see when I was younger in trying to learn myself so in terms of what's coming next and what to expect from the channel I have massive plans so I know we're still small and we have to grow scalable but there's a lot of things that I'm planning on doing I don't want to release all of them yet cuz I want someone to be surprised but for now at least one of the good things that I've kind of been working on for the past week or so is a discord server so I have absolutely no experience with discord I use it to chat when I was at least a game like once in a while but that's about it so I created like kind of like a really like low level discord server and I invite you guys to join that pretty much what you can do on there is you can chat with me you can chat with other people in the community tech with Tim community and I can help you guys out with any problems you might have and that's kind of the main goal why I made it because a lot of people comment things on my videos and say like can you help me with this can you help me with this and I always try my best at respond to you guys and read your code but really difficult to do that throughout the comment section of a YouTube video especially if the codes really long so now on the discord server you guys can send me files I can have a look at them we can work on stuff together we can chat and that's really one of the main reasons that happen also on there I have like some different channels I'm so like video ideas just like general chat PI game he'll Python help and that's kind of the start of the way that I want to help you guys outside of just the YouTube channel in just the comment section now to go along with that I've also just started up a patreon page or your patreon account I think that's how you say it at least and this is to give you guys a chance if you want to support the channel and support myself to do so so I don't ask for any large donations I don't ask for any donations at all in fact if you don't want to the discord server is completely free but if you do donate I believe it's ten dollars a month then you're gonna have access to kind of like a donor what do you call it permission or like role I think it's called in discord yeah a rule where you you can just gonna have your name like highlighted and you'll have a few commands you can use you can join the voice chats there's a few like specific channels just to give you a bit of a perk for donating to the channel because I really do appreciate it but that's just a way if you guys want to help out and I'd really appreciate it any donations that that do come because you guys know this is a small Channel it doesn't make too much money okay in terms of what I'm gonna be posting in the future I know you guys really love the PI game stuff so recently I've been working on making a few different games now I'm not sure which one I want to do tutorial on first because I have them coded pretty much they are right now I have Simon done and I have Tetris done so let me know which one you guys want to see first the Simon one is more of a beginner level and the tetris one is pretty advanced so if you watched on my previous prime stuff you'd probably be able to do the tetris one but other than that it might be a little bit difficult for you also in the future some of you guys know I'm a first year computer science student so I'm just like all my own time doing some machine learning stuff and AI so once I get good at that and I feel confident enough with it I'm gonna start teaching that on the channel as well so that you guys can understand it it's actually not too difficult and I think a lot of you would like that so let me know in terms of other stuff I can always think of things to post like programming tutorials but I want to know what you guys want to see on the channel because this is really about you it's about community and I don't want to post stuff just because I think it'd be interesting I want to know what you guys want so that's why I want you to join the discord server to let me know some videos you want to see cuz I really am going to take that information seriously that you guys post on there and I also want you just leave a comment down below if you don't want to go join the discord server and just let me know what you want to see in the future like what do you want this channel to look like because I want to mold this towards what you guys want to see so anyways I think that's kind of it for a channel update I have something special planned for 5k I you guys will see that when we hit that number which should be in just a few days when this video comes out I'll you not leave a comment down below join the discord server if you want to donate go ahead and do that all the links are in the description below and again just a huge thank you to everyone and to everyone that's watching this video commenting subscribing I really do appreciate it more than you guys could ever know so anyways that's been it for this video I do have a coding video coming up tomorrow so stay tuned for that and yeah I'll leave a like and subscribe if you're not to see what's coming next on the channel
