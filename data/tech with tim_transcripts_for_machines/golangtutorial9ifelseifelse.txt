hello everybody and welcome back so in this video we're finally starting to get into some of the more interesting things I know other some of these other videos have been kind of boring just because they're teaching you the basics and the fundamentals but now we're into ifstatements which in my opinion is the first life pretty interesting thing in programming that you can do at least to make some somewhat interesting programs like you can do some cool things with them so I'm gonna be teaching you ifelse and Elif in this video these are known as conditional statements so essentially the way that you read it is like if this happened to do that otherwise do this if this happens do that if this doesn't happen check if this happens do that so it's a way to check you know using these conditions that we've just talked about previously if something happened and then executes a block of code after that so I'm gonna show you the basic syntax of an if statement and then we'll just get into an example so it looks like this if I'm gonna be typing this like I work in so many programming languages so I might make a few mistakes here but the idea is if we have if like that then we put some conditions so condition goes here and then whatever's inside of these squiggly brackets will happen only if this condition is true if this condition is false we will simply skip over this if statement so we'll go over to line 9 pass by it and then continue doing whatever else happens so I'll show you some examples so like fmt duh println will just print like before if so this will always happen before if will print in here after it and then in the middle will print if like inside if just so you guys can see all these things okay so the condition here is simply any of those boolean expressions or statements that I showed you in the previous videos so anything here that evaluates to true or false you can put so what I can do and I'll just make a variable here say Val colon equals like let's just say Tim actually let's make it name like that so we'll say name colon equals Tim and then here always say if name is equal to Tim then inside it right so this is the block that I've set up this is saying if this expression is true then do whatever is inside of these set of curly braces so in fact I could do something else in here too like I could print another line I could put another if statement if I wanted to we'll get into nested like stuff later on but that's the idea so let's run this and see how this looks go run tutorial dot we get in here now we get before if inside if after if now that's because this was true right name does equal Tim but what if I now go to name does not equal Tim so I change this this obviously now is gonna be false so we know that's false so we'll we print what's inside the if statement well based on my definition we shouldn't and let's have a look at this code and see if it does so no it does not we get before if and then after if so notice that what happened was we did this line we checked if this was true since it wasn't we skipped over line ten we just passed by it and then we continued on with the rest of the program and we printed after if now you'll notice that I'm doing some indented stuff here like I'm indenting it forward the standard kind of convention when you write these if statements is to anything that's happening inside the if to indent it in by one tab space or tab spaces that word I don't know one tab like that you don't have to you though so long as it's inside of these squiggly brackets it's totally fine and that's the idea behind that and also notice like inside this function we tabbed everything inside one that's just so that it's easier to read and you can kind of tell what's inside of what right okay so that's the if statement and that's pretty much how that works right you have a value you check some kind of expression in here I mean we could do this if we wanted to we could say name does not equal Tim or name equal stem now obviously this is always gonna be true but that's totally valid and if I go ahead and run this then we'll see that that if statement does run and we get before if inside if after if so that's the basics of it the if now there is another thing called the else and the else is pretty useful because sometimes what you want to say is if this condition is true do this otherwise do this right so I'm gonna make a better example now and I'm gonna put actually age so let's say age colon equals seventeen now the example I want to use is if you are older than eighteen you can ride the rollercoaster otherwise you can't ride it right that's something example just rented one that we'll use so the condition I should put here if I want to check if they're older than 18 should be age greater than or equal to 18 so I'm gonna say if they're 18 or older than 18 then what we'll print is you can ride okay like that but otherwise if they can't ride what I want to do is print you can't ride so most of you without knowing what an else statement is which I'm going to show you here would just do this you cannot ride right so you'd say okay so if they can ride will print this otherwise we'll print you cannot ride but can you think about what the issue is gonna be if I do this well what's gonna happen is that even if we can ride will print you can ride and then after the if statement will still print you cannot ride so in the situation where you are older than 18 it'll tell you can ride and then immediately it will tell you you can't we don't want that to happen so what we're gonna introduce and in fact let me just prove to you that's true so let's go go run tutorial don't go I prints you cannot ride just because we were seventeen but if we put 19 here and we run this then it says you can ride you cannot ride so the way we fixed this is by putting an else statement so an else is simply what happens if the condition above it is not true so if this is false do this that's all that means so no matter what one of these two statements every single time will be printed because if this isn't true and we don't run what's inside of that we will run what's inside of the else and the syntax of the else is you write else you don't need any condition here because it's just gonna happen no matter what so long as you know this isn't true and then you put these little braces and then you write whatever inside of the else that you want to run and actually in this case let's say you cannot ride say wait and I'm gonna do percent D years and then what I'm gonna do is actually say 18 age so I'll tell them how many years they need to wait until they can ride so 18 age okay so let's do that and let's put this down to seventeen now and let's run this now what is the issue that this is telling me okay what is the squiggly line has possible formatting directive set D I think that's fine okay so go run tutorial dot go wait two percent d ah sorry this is supposed to be print f not println I was like what the heck is happening there okay let me just run this one more time and have a look at this down here and we get you cannot ride wait one years right so wait one year before you can ride the roller coaster so that's how this works with the if else if this is not true do that if this is true don't do that so let's make this 19 and let's just show you what happens if we now are old enough go run tutorial go and we get you can ride so that's the the basics there okay now the last thing to show is something called else if so else if it kind of happens like consider the case where maybe if they're older than 18 they can ride if they're 18 they can ride with a parent or something I don't know like if they're under 18 they can ride with a parent but if they're younger than 14 they can't ride it also we have like three cases right if they're between 14 and 18 they can ride but they need a parent if they're older 18 then they can ride by themselves and if they're younger than 14 then they just can't ride how do we accommodate that case well I mean we could do like three if statements right like I could do this and I could say if age is greater than or equal to 18 print you can ride let's say alone and then here I could do if age is I'm greater than or equal to 14 and age is less than or equal to 18 so this way actually we'd have to say less than in that case so if they're between 14 and 18 but they're not 18 because if they were 18 they'd be able to ride then we'll print you can ride with a parent and then otherwise so in the situation where they're less than 14 so if age is less than 14 then print you cannot ride so this will work this is fine but the issue with this is I've kind of repeated a lot of logic like I've checked if they're older than 14 um like twice I've checked if they're younger than 18 twice there's actually a way easy way to write this and I'm gonna leave this down below just so we can compare to it after but there's a way that we can use something called else if so what I can do is say something like this if age is greater than or equal to 18 then what we can say is f of T dot print line you you can ride alone if I could type okay so you can ride alone and then otherwise so if they can't write alone what I can do is use an elseif now what else if does is essentially say if this isn't true check this so if this doesn't happen then check if this is true that's how this works so I'll say else if and I actually don't need the brackets there but I'll say else if age is greater than or equal to 14 then fmt dot print line and we'll just say you can ride actually we'll just copy all this okay so you can ride with a parent like that okay so now we have the if we have an else if and I mean we could do another else if but what we can actually do is add an else here and what the else will says in any other situation so if they're not older than 18 and if they're not older than 14 then what we can do is we can tell them I'll just copy this fmt down here that they cannot write so this is the equivalent to here and you can notice this a little bit neater it makes a little bit more sense and yeah that's kind of the idea behind this ifelse ifelse so again else if will work with any condition here and it will only check this if this isn't true then the else what this says is well if everything above me was not true then go ahead and execute the else now what's interesting is that we can put more than one else if if we want so I can do let me top that down here another else if and I could check say like else if age greater than or equal to ten and then we can add the else at the end but we don't even need the else if we don't want it so you just notice that all these things are optional we don't need it else we can have an else if we want we don't need else ifs we can have as many of them though if we do want them the only thing that you need to remember is that else cannot go in between else ifs because this is like the default case like if all else fails it's a good way a good punny way to put it almost if all of this fails then do else so I hope that's kind of making sense but I want to break down what I've written here a little bit more just to really clear this up so notice that here I had to check if age was greater than equal to 14 and less than 18 the reason for that is if they're 18 like let's say they're 18 right then we will print that you can ride alone now if I omitted this why I got rid of that and then it would also print you can ride with a parent which I mean is technically true but we don't want to show that right we only want to show them one of these print statements so because of that I had to add this extra condition that said let's make sure they're in that range so we don't accidentally print two statements and then same thing down here right I had to save ages less than 14 because if I just put on like an else statement for example then actually wouldn't else statement work I guess an else they wouldn't work if I did that here but anyways that's the idea that like this middle condition I had to check something extra whereas up here I don't have to check that the reason I don't have to check that is because if they're greater than 18 we'll print you can ride alone and then just skip down to line 15 after the else statement right so that's why this is oftentimes much better to use than this kind of structure with just three independent if statements because you obviously can write multiple if statements you can put ifs inside of else's else inside of ifs it starts getting pretty complex and interesting the further we go but let's test this and make sure that I'm not lying to you guys so go run tutorial dot go and we get you can ride alone when they're 19 so let's put them at 16 let's make sure that it works for that case and it says now you can ride with the parent okay and let's put them at 13 and see what we get and it says you cannot ride so that's the basics behind the ifelse ifelse quick recap the basic almost formula for writing this is let's get rid of that for a second is when you want to check if something happens and then do that you write if you write the condition you want to check this has to evaluate to true or false you put your brackets and then whatever you put inside of here and you can put multiple things as many things as you want that will happen if this condition is true then what you can do is you can add else ifs and else and those are optional you don't but you're allowed to add them so we can go back and we can add the else if the way the else/if works is if this doesn't happen then check this and if that's true do this but if this happens here this will not even be checked we won't even bother doing that comparison right now if we go back we add the else now the else is optional we don't need that and this says if all else fails everything above me go ahead and do this and we can have multiple else's of course if we want those so that has been this video and if else if and else I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did make sure they like subscribe and I will see you in the next goal Aang tutorial
