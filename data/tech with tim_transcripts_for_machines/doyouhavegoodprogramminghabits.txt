now this is something I think a lot of people Overlook but this can be a massive skill and Advantage if you build really strong and good habits early on when you're learning to code everyone has habits right like we operate on our habits and the people that are most successful in a lot of areas are really just the people who have built the best habits right that's the same here with programming and with building strong programming habits so to give you a few examples here a habit uh that I've recently kind of started picking up on in programming is giving really good variable names and always making sure I'm having a consistent styling when I'm writing code another habit could be like do you always write a test before you write your code are you always testing your code are you making a commit after every small feature are you separating logic out into different kind of functional units so I would challenge you guys think about what are your programming habits what do you always do good or bad and should you continue that or should you try to change that habit in kind of a more positive direction
