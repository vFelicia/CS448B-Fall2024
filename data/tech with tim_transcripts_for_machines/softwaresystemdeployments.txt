so moving on here I have deployment now this is concerned with how you're actually going to be serving your application or software so you've written it in a development environment maybe you have it on localhost or you're testing it on an emulator or something along those lines now how are you going to take this code and deploy it so that users can actually access it is this going to be on mobile is going to be on web how am I going to actually give this to my users how am I going to test that it's working properly how am I going to emulate my development environment in a deployment environment how am I going to scale this do I have multiple systems being deployed all at the same time I'm just trying to give you examples to think about here because deployment is very important and it's something a lot of people leave until the very last step then they realize I need to change the way I'm doing this because it doesn't work with how I'm going to deploy this code
