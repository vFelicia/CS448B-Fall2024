so now the third Pro I have for you when it comes to learning machine learning is that you get to be a part of a constantly evolving field that is genuinely changing the way in which humans live now some of you may argue that because you're not very good at machine learning or you're just getting started that you're not really a part of this constantly evolving and very exciting field but I would beg to differ because even just having that basic understanding allows you to really appreciate what is being created by the absolute Geniuses out there you know even something like Tesla chess AIS like stockfish or Alpha zero all of these really cool things that are coming out and personally I am super fascinated and just very interested in watching what people are able to create with this technology because I can actually go in and read a little bit of the research paper kind of understand what it is that they've done on a very very simple level and it's just a really really cool thing to be able to do
