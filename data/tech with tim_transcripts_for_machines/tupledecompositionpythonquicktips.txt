hello everyone and welcome back to another Python quick tip so in this video I'm gonna be showing you how we decompose a tuple now essentially what that means is taking the values of a tupple and assigning them individually into variables so for example if we wanted to get the value of 1 & 2 here let's treat this maybe as a coordinate so XY what I can do is do something like X comma y equals t1 now what that's gonna do is actually split up t1 into the variables x and y so X will be 1 and Y will be 2 and if I print that out I can show you that that is indeed true now this works for any number of elements inside the tupple so maybe we have a 3 coordinate here and I do that with t2 and now we can print out XY and Z and we can see we get 1 2 3 now this works the same for functions so a lot of people don't know that you can actually return things just separated by commas from a function so I'll show you if I print out for example func like this you'll see what we actually get here is a tuple and that means we can decompose the results from a tuples so let's say we return three different things from a function well if we want to decompose that what I can do is now say XY Z equals func like that and then again I can print out X Y Z like so and we get 1 2 3 so that is how you decompose a tupple it's very useful sometimes you just want to get the first and second element from a coordinate or something like that and you don't want to have to know go through the method of saying x equals t10 for something like that so news that has been how to decompose a double
