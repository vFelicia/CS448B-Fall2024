so why should you not Learn Python well there's many reasons here but most of them stem from the fact that python is a very general language so for example you can make a game with python but it's not going to be the best performing game and you'd probably be better off using something like csharp and unity but you can do let's say a mobile app with python but again you'd probably be better off using a native language like Swift you can do something like a website with python or a back end with python but you might be better off using something like go or rust so you see that although python can be used for so many different things if you're going to be a specialist in one specific area a lot of times employers are going to look for someone who knows the best language or the best Frameworks in that area
