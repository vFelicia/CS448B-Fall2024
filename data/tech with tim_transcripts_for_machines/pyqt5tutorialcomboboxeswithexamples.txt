hey guys and welcome back to the PI qt5 tutorial so in today's video we're gonna be talking about combo boxes which essentially are those little boxes that give you the options between multiple things and you can kind of select which one you want they're all over the place super useful that's what we're gonna be learning about today now before I continue if you're watching this video recently you may want to sign up for my new course the fundamentals of programming with Python right now to celebrate it's kind of new release it's 50% off you can get the discount code just by looking in the description now if you are a little bit later to this video you may still be able to get it discounted for 35% off that code will be down below as well and this is just teaching kind of the fundamentals of Python programming but anyways check that out if you guys are interested just feel like I'd let you know in case you want to take advantage of that discount all right so let's talk about combo boxes now so what I'm gonna do is drag in a combo box from the side here and I'm just gonna kind of set a size for it right now and make it nice and large now I'm gonna rename this to be combo X and I'm gonna change the size of the text to be much larger because obviously it's a bigger combo box now I'm just gonna copy this bad boy and paste it and rename this one instead of combo X to it'll be combo Y now what I'm gonna do with this kind of example is create an X or function using our combo boxes now an XOR function is really basic you've probably heard of it this is the truth table for XOR so essentially you have two inputs which are gonna be represented by our combo boxes there you can either choose between 0 or 1 so a binary input and then you get one binary output now you can see here if both of the inputs are 0 you get 0 if Y is 1 you get 1 if X is 1 you get 1 and if x and y and both are both 1 you get 0 so it stands for exclusive or pretty straightforward I'm sure most of you probably heard of that but anyways these are our combo boxes now if we want to add some different options to our combo boxes we can do this from the Qt designer by simply doubleclicking on the box and clicking this Add button now our items are gonna be what we can select from so in this case I'm just gonna put 0 and I'm going to put 1 now if I do that and I go OK you can see the zero shows up in the box here so I'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing here and go 0 and one now if we wanted to change which one was by default selected we can do that by simply moving the one up here above the zero just by hitting that up arrow key and now you can see that one is default selected now I'm gonna move that back for now but that's how you change which one is by default selected I'm going to show you this from code as well so now that we have that what I'm gonna do is actually add a button that we can use to kind of submit this and get the results to the function so to do that I'm going to find a button wherever those are I guess there's one right here we'll make this one a little bit bigger too and I'll just call this one submit now we can change the font size make that a little bit larger so we'll go 22 and just name this submit and the last thing I'm gonna do is just grab a label from down here I'm gonna make this again a little bit bigger and I'm just gonna say X X for y equals and then we'll put the result there and I'll make this font size a bit bigger too and what we're doing here is we're gonna say that this input is X and this input is Y so then we say X X or Y that'll give us the answer to you know that truth table that we just showed you so anyways I'm gonna save this I will just save it as test you I put that into our pie cutie tutorials which is right here and we'll just override that other one okay sweets we have that now in it now it's time to actually start working with the code so the first thing that we have to do like always is convert this UI file into an actual Python file so we can do that using pi UIC 5 X test UI oh and then test pi PI UIC well it's PI UIC 5 and now we will open up that file and start working so I'm just gonna open up a new sub line text window here so file new window and we'll open up that file quickly just give me one second here PI Q T test there we go all right so if we run this we can see this is what our kind of thing is right now so we're gonna start immediately by just showing how these combo boxes work and you can see that you've got to select between 0 or 1 and you can have one or the other as that option so now what we're gonna do is find out how we can get which one is selected and then obviously change the label when they hit submit to be you know the correct thing so the first thing I'm going to show you is actually how you change the or add items to the combo box now this is important because sometimes you want to change what's in the combo box from code so I'm going to show you how to do that quickly now this is actually really easy and all you have to do is just get the name of your combo box in this case mine is combo X and then just do dot add item so I've named my column box combo X I'm gonna do self combo X dot add item and say I want to add another item at the bottom called hello and go ahead and do that by just hitting hello are typing in hello and now you can see that we have another option which is hello so super straightforward if you want to add another item now if you want to change the default item that it's selected from code it's a little bit more complicated but I'm going to show you because it's something that you probably want to do sometimes and the way you do that is you're gonna say index equals this is this is two line code here that you have to use and actually have to find except forget exactly what it is but it is self dot combo X dot and this is find text and then in here we're gonna put the text that we want to find now this will be whatever is showing up in our combo box now if you put something here that doesn't actually that's not an item in your combo box so like one zero hello those are all items in our combo box but say I put something that's not there maybe negative 5 or negative one this is gonna return to you I believe negative one which means that that item was not found in the combo box anyway so let's look for zero right now or actually let's change it to hello and what I'm gonna do after this is put a comma and type this kind of ridiculous line but this is what we need to do so cutie poor cutie dot match fix string like that now what this is actually going to do here is return to us the index that that item is in our combo box and the way that we select what item we want to use in our combo box is we say set default item or whatever it is here and we give it an index and that index could be zero one two whatever it is where zero is the first item in our combo box and two would be the last one in our case so what I'm gonna do here you say self dot combo X dot set I believe it is current index and then here we're gonna put index now the reason I'm doing this in two lines is because sometimes you have a lot of items in your combo box and you don't want to have to count like which one it is or maybe it's gonna change position somehow so we're going to search for the text in our combo box we're gonna find what index that's at so some number value and then we're gonna set that index to be the current index of our combo box so watch now when I run this the default item is hello now I'll show you if I want to change the default item to be one what I can actually do here is put one not because that's the value of the item because that's the index of our item no I'll explain this in a second but you can see that zero is actually gonna be index zero because it's the first item one is gonna be index one and hello is gonna be index two so now again if I change this to be two and I mean I'll close these first and I run this again you can see that we have hello showing up as well as our current index so anyways I'm gonna get rid of that because we don't need that but I just wanted to show you how to do that now the next thing I'm gonna do is create a method here that's gonna actually change the label and find out what our combo box value is so I'm just gonna call this pressed and we'll take itself here and then inside of here I'm gonna show how we can figure out what item our combo box is on so to do that is pretty straightforward as well we can do self dot combo X maybe the one we want to look at dot current text and this will just give us what the current text of our item is or a combo box so I'll do the same thing for combo Y and all I'll do here is when we click that button I'll just print it out and then we'll talk about that XOR thing in a second so I'm just gonna link my button now to that method we've done this so many times we'll say self dot in this case submit dot clicked dot connect self dot press all right so let's give this a try here let's run this and you can see we now get zero zero printing out when I click that because we printed the current text of our combo box I can do one we can get one zero right pretty straightforward so now let's change that label so that it's equal to the actual answer to that XOR function alright so the first thing we need to do is a wait are xor function I'm gonna show you kind of a cool way to do this the first thing we're gonna do is actually stop by printing this and set these equal to their Intel use now this is because they by default come in as string to us but I want them as an integer so that I could actually use the or and Anne's in Python to evaluate the XOR function so XOR which I'm just going to say is this is actually equal to X or not Y and not X or Y or sorry not x and y what am I saying not or and just change these orders to and now I'm gonna put brackets around these to make sure everything is nice and clear I'm gonna explain kind of how this works but essentially the only time that this function is gonna be one is when is when one of them is on and one of them is off or 1 is 1 and 1 is 0 so the way this works we say if X and not Y or right here not x and y so that's gonna give us the result of our XOR so now if I want to change my label text to show that what I'm gonna say is self don't label dot set text and in here I'm actually gonna set it equal to the current label text so label dot text plus in this case will do space and then I'm gonna do the string of X or which will either be a 0 or a 1 now let's just try this and see if it works first of all so we'll submit that and you can see 0 + 0 gives us 0 1 + 0 actually gives us 0 true oh it's gonna keep going forward anyways and 1 1 will give us true and then if I go 0 it's not showing cuz it's cutting off so what I should probably do is set this equal to 2 actually rather than the current label text let's do X x or y equals like that anyway so let's try this now if we have 1 + 0 we get true if we have 1 + 1 we get false if we have 0 + 1 we get 1 sometimes you're getting one sometimes you're getting true which is kind of weird but anyways that is kind of how that works now this is just weird cuz it's returning true or false if we wanted to just get a 1 or a 0 all we'd say is if X or equals equals true then we'll say X or equals one else X or equals zero and now if we run this and we do one zero we get one if we do one one we get zero we do zero one we get one and you kind of see how that works anyways I just want to put a get put together a little example for you guys so I didn't just show you kind of the basics of the combo box in the next video we'll probably move on to doing check boxes or radio boxes or something else and then as we progress through the series we'll get into some more advanced examples as well as some layouts and some other stuff because there's so much to talk about with pie qt5 anyways I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you do make sure you leave a like and I will see you guys in another video
