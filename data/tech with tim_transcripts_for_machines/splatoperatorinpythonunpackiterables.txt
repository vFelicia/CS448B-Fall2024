many times in python you have a function something like this and the arguments for this function are stored in a list or in a dictionary now it can be quite annoying to have to call the function using the individual elements doing something like this so instead there is the syntax in python known as the splat operator or the unpack operator i'll show you that i can call the function func with star arcs now what this will do is actually unpack all of the items in my list into individual arguments and pass them to the function watch this when i run the code everything works fine now in the same way that you can do this on a list or on a string any iterable object if you have a dictionary so key value pairs you can simply make this two stars now i have to change the variable name here and this will pass keyword arguments so it will pass a equals one b equals three c equals four and d equals two hopefully you found this helpful if you did follow for more
