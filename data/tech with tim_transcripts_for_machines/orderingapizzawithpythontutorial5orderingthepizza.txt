hello everybody and welcome to the final video and you're ordering a pizza with Python series now in this video I am actually going to be using a modified version of the script that we've made because we're just gonna add some stuff to it to order a pizza to my house and then I will show you guys that I actually get the pizza from using this software now obviously I have to blurred out a lot of the information that we're gonna be using because I can't show you guys you know like my postal code and my address my credit card information and all of that but you know try to believe me I'm gonna be showing you the clock when I order and when I receive so that you guys kind of know that I'm doing this within the same time frame and anyways let's go ahead and get started so the first thing we need to do is figure out how we actually place an order so right now we've got up to the point where we collect credit card information and we you know make the order and find the store but we don't actually know how to place it so into place it's pretty easy we're just gonna copy this code just you order that place card and in my local Domino's tup place order and then the order and the card so I'm gonna go into my script here Evan I just want to remind everyone that what I've done here is changed customer to be console input get new customer that's going to allow the what is it gonna be the console will print out like some prompts for people to insert their information as if they were a new customer so you don't just have to hard code it into here it can be a different customer every time or a different address or whatever you want now we have the menu we show all this stuff so my local dominos done get menu print my local Domino's I'm just gonna add one thing up here print closest store like that I'll do a backslash N beforehand just so it goes down one line it will show this store and then what I'm gonna do is say print would you like to select this store if they say no we'll just exit the program um otherwise we'll continue so we'll say imports or we'll say like an S equals input would you like to order from this store question mark and we'll just put some brackets and say why n and then what we'll do is we'll say if they don't say wire they don't say yes then we will simply quit the program so we'll say if an s not in and this will be yes and why and we'll just throw this to lower then just print like goodbye or something goodbye oops like that exclamation point and then we'll just quit like that now otherwise then we'll show the menu which we're gonna do here and then we'll go through and we'll do the rest of it now what I'm gonna do here at the end is before I add in this code so ordered up place and my local dominos dot place order I'm actually going to ask the user which I've actually already typed out here I forgot that I put that there if they're gonna be paying cash or credit because there is actually an option to pay with with cash when you order this so we're just gonna ask them if they want cash or credit if they say cash then we won't bother getting their credit card otherwise we will actually ask for it so what I'm gonna say is if payment and notice again like I typed this in and we'll just say dot lower equals equals or actually we'll say if it's in holding of them two options they can type with card or credit card so if it's in that will ask them for their credit card oops I should by going like that otherwise what we'll say is card equals false now you'll see why I'm doing this in a second but that's all we need so then after this what we'll do is we'll ask one last prompt we'll say do you want to place this order like this is final if you place this order you're gonna be paying for it and then if they say yes we'll place it otherwise we won't so we'll say and ask equals input would you like to place this order question mark you can say why no and we'll say if an ask lower in Y or yes then what we'll do is place the order like that so we'll say actually at the end of this we'll say print order placed else we will say print goodbye okay so that's all we need for that now I just want to show you one thing so if we go to order here notice that the reason I was able to say card equals false rather than actually get a credit card information is because inside order if we pass card equals false then what that actually means is we're gonna pay with cash so what this does is a self dot pay with and the card that we pass when we place the order calls this method where it checks if the card is false if the card is false it says the payment method is cash which means that we'll just pick cash when it comes to the door so that's an option as well where we can type in the credit card now last thing note that here the postal code is transforming whenever we type in into a zip code now this isn't gonna work if we're ordering from Canada or someone or somewhere that doesn't have like integer values so I don't know if it's making any sense but essentially my postal code could look something like this right like like that like it could be numbered I think it's like numbers letters numbers I don't know like X like it could be something like that um where it can add letters in it so if I try to convert this into an int that's not gonna work so we have two options we can just type in an invalid zip code which is like type in 0 0 0 or I think we might be able to remove this and just send the actual raw data of whatever that zip code is that we typed in rather than turning it into an int I think that should be okay to do this this might not work if you're in the States I'd recommend you just leave it as in zip but for me since I'm in Canada I'm gonna change it to this so that my postal code will actually work if I decide to use my credit card so that's just something to note if you're actually gonna be doing this look inside of this pay with inside of the order dot Pi file and you might need to mess with this if to change the postal code so that it fits what country you're in there's a lot of stuff that's like country specific that has been programmed in this API and again another reason why we're learning it because we kind of understand you know how it could be issues with it and all of that ok so now that we've done that I think it's actually time to place the order so I'm gonna open up my command prompt type in some of my personal information I'll show you what I order and I'll show you the time and then I'll show you when I actually receive the pizza we'll be right back ok so I've now made my order so all I'm getting is just a teninch handtossed Canadian pizza to be quite honest I have no idea what's on that but we're just gonna go with it like I'll fine with whatever pizza it is okay so now I'm actually I'm going to insert my credit card information Oh what is this so it's saying well you pay cash or credit so I'm actually gonna decide to pay cash so that way you guys can watch me actually like place this order and see if this works oh let's go cash would you like to place this order yes let's wait and we get an issue okay so let's see what this problem is okay so I have an issue I have an idea that this has to do with the country that's inside of some of these modules so I'm gonna have a look through here and see if I can change anything so that we can order make sure that's ordering from Canada we don't have any issues like that but I'll be back in a second once I check through that okay so I've changed this here where it says country instead of ordered up pie to say ca for Canada I don't know if this is gonna work but we're gonna hop back in the command prompt and give it a shot if this doesn't work it's gonna be unfortunate because I won't really know how to fix this although I'm assuming this probably just has to do something with the fact that we have the wrong URL because this said the United States before it didn't say Canada so something to keep in mind if you're ordering from different countries or different continents or whatever you'll have to change the actual area code here and to be honest with you I don't know if Domino's is in like India per se like I don't know where this chain exists and not sure if it's just North American so I do apologize if you've kind of been following this and thought you could order from Domino's I don't know where the chain exists so let's give it a shot and it'll be right back okay so I'm in typed cache we've done this again let's see would you like to place yes error where are we gonna play successfully order placed for Rasika okay so that actually I think that actually worked so it said that this order was placed this is my last night as you guys have seen I might blurred out will depend on the video but it's fine I think you guys know my last name anyway so that's okay um so we didn't get an error we got some you know threaded sake error but it did say the order was placed it did not however say order place like this when I tried to place that my local dominos dot place order that's when we got the issue but I don't know where it prints order placed for whatever the name was so I'm gonna look around and see if I can find that and then we'll see if this actually happened I'm gonna call the store and see if this actually went through or not okay so I have a feeling that I need to change some more of these countries from all these files so I'm gonna continue to change these all to ca and then we're gonna have a look and see if this is gonna fix things because I have a feeling that we're just getting the issue with the with the country I'm pretty certain that's what it is because this should work like I've seen this used before so for you or else yeah that's what it is okay so for the country here I need to change this to be country Canada so we're just gonna say country Canada which I think I have imported up here yes I do so that's what I'm gonna do that okay so that's exactly what it is so I just need to change that to be Canada in this file so this is URLs dot pie I've changed this to be Canada I've changed it inside of track dot pie as well to be ca I mean it doesn't matter if you use country Canada or CIA it's fine and now everything I think in here is Canada whereas before it was all defaulted at us so even this one okay begin custom order so this one needs to be country Canada as well so we'll put CA and I'm just gonna go through here and change these now there's obviously a much better would do this I can like that would probably as a way to set it from here but just for the sake of this right now like this is kind of the way I'm fixing it um but I mean yeah you guys can maybe tell me if you think there was a better way that I should have gone about doing that okay so we've done CA done countries past in here okay country Canada Canada order alright all of this stuff so I think we're good I'm gonna try it one more time and then again wheeled back hi can you check if an order went through for me that I placed online well I don't know the order number but can I can I give you a name okay let's do a so that's actually that went through the reason I'm asking because I'm I did this from like I wrote some code to order the pizza so I was yeah I wanted to see if it actually worked or not okay so it's coming it's on the way okay awesome um thank you very much alright okay so I'll see if I can include some of that in the video there but this actually works so I just called the store to confirm if my order has been placed or not and it has so I'm gonna I don't want to do this again because I don't want to order something else but I'm assuming now we won't get that issue afterwards because I fixed the country so I think what that was actually supposed to be giving me that other stuff where we got the error there was gonna tell me the tracking number for my order now obviously I don't have that tracking number so I'm not I'm not sure how much I'm gonna include in the video but I did call the store they said it's coming so we'll be back when this pizza arrives in a film will clip and show you guys that this actually did work alright so we're back in we have a Domino's Pizza let's refresh the clock its 1240 4 p.m. so pretty much when he told me it was gonna come by and I believe that cost me twenty one dollars as opposed to what the total was on there like fourteen plus tax plus delivery plus all of that so that makes sense and to show you guys that I'm not lying actual pizza that was ordered using this program so I think that that is pretty freakin cool that that actually works that I can do that so yeah I mean that's pretty much it for this series the goal has been accomplished order a pizza with Python it has happened this pizza has mushrooms bacon what else does that on it pepperoni and some other ingredient on it and yeah so anyways that has been a series if you guys enjoyed leave a like subscribe to the channel and let me know if you're ordering any pizzas using this program
