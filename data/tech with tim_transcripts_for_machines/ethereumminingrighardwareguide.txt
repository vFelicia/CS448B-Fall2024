hey guys welcome back to another YouTube video today's video I'm just gonna be giving a little guide on what you need to buy if you're trying to mine a theorem and how you can make an ax theory and mining rig so I'm just going to go through all the different components that you're going to need to purchase and how you can set them up and then I'm also just going to show you kind of what I started off doing so that you can get an idea all right so my first mining rig I'm going to put a picture up here on the screen right now you I only had two graphics cards and I was mining at about 40 mega hash per second which I mean isn't that much but just for starting out is what I want to do so now I'm gonna be showing you a video I wish I had watched before I kind of set up this mining rig so I could have saved a bit of money and I also could have just had a better mining rig in general all right so let's get started right away with the hardware so we're gonna need obviously everything that you need in a computer and the first thing is the motherboard so I mean the motherboard as much as it is important it's really not a lot important pretty much any hseries motherboard will do as long as it has the right socket here so LGA 1151 and then it supports ddr4 really you're just looking for one of the cheapest ones that you can get and the important thing here is to look at the amount of PCI slots it has so you can see here it has one two three four five six PCI slots which is great which means we have room for expansion in the future or we can support up to six graphics cards there are some other boards that support a lot more PCI slots so they have like 10 or 12 like ridiculous amounts like that but if you're just starting out you don't really need them any PCI slots okay so that's the first thing to look for when you're getting a motherboard pretty much the socket the RAM and then the amount of PCI slots so the amount of PCI slots is definitely the most important and then the next thing we're gonna look for is a processor really here I just picked up the cheapest Intel Celeron processor I could find it's a 2 core processor does the job I mean you don't really need anything super great as long as it supports the amount of PCI lanes then you're good to go so pretty much any Intel Celeron processor if we're gonna be using this board so LGA 1151 then we need a 6 gen or a 7th gen processor alright the next thing stick a ram really I just picked out the cheapest Ram I could find on Amazon right now this one's forty seven dollars just for a four gig stick you don't need anything more than 4 gigs because of what's gonna be doing the power for your computer is the graphics cards alright so that's pretty much it for Ram graphics card so this is definitely the most important decision you're gonna make when you're getting an aetherium mining rig now depending on your budget and on how many graphics cards you want this decision may be different so this is the one that I recommend here especially if you're trying to go for a midlevel the high range mining rig you're gonna want to get a gtx 1070 that's my personal opinion it's the best bang for your buck in terms of hash rate and you can go check out my other video which I'll put a link up to now on the best GPUs for mining aetherium at the current time of 2017 and that relates to the dag size and how well they're hashing right now so this card I think if I can recall gut gets about 29 to 30 mega hash per second and if you overclock using one of the guides I have in my channel you can get even more and it isn't too unaffordable either at $550 so you can get a few of those to add into your mining rig alright now the next important decision is the power supply so depending on how many graphics cards you're buying this may vary now if you're going for four or five cards especially with the gtx 1070 and a thousand watt power supply will be fine for you but if you're going up to six cards you may want to move up to a 1200 watt power supply now this is just because the a thousand watt will power your system if you have six cards but it's going to be not at its peak performance and you're gonna it's not going to be as efficient as if you had per say a 1200 watt power supply and another thing to look at here when we look at the power supplies is the rating on it so you're always gonna want to look for an 80 plus rating on your power supply and also gold certification or platinum certification now that just tells you the efficiency of the power supply and can save you a lot of money on electricity costs if you go from say a bronze rated power supply to a gold rated power supply and this one here has all your necessary cables you're gonna want to make sure since this one is modular as well it's gonna have enough cables to power your graphics cards that you get here and just check the you pin connector on the graphics card in this case and it's an 8 pin connector so you can see that that one will be sufficient to power four or five of these cards all right now the next one this step is really not that important you just need any hard drive pretty much that you can download windows on to or if you're using fos or any of those other mining os's that exists or even Linux pretty much I just found a random power supply and Amazon cheapest one I could find 60 gigs one terabyte if you really want your system to run fast and boot up really quickly you can get an SSD but that's really not necessary and now this step here so a lot of people don't really realize that you can't just plug in six graphics cards into your motherboard so like here you can't actually just put them all into the slots like that you need to get PCI risers especially if you have a ton of different graphics cards you can see this only has two fullsized slots where you could plug 2 into there but it's at the point where it could be a fire hazard and a safety hazard if you have too many of them on your motherboard so show you if you saw my mining rig how the graphics cards were actually suspended they were above the motherboard and one of them was attached using this PCI riser right here so depending on how many graphics cards you get it's gonna depend on how many PCI risers you get in this case I just found a six pack on Amazon for 50 bucks it's a pretty good deal I just bought one of them when I did it I think it was like fourteen fifteen dollars and these are really important and you can plug them into the slots so that you can rise they're powered by the wayby SATA cable as you can see here in the picture on these SATA power right there and yeah so these are very important and this is what you're gonna plug your graphics card into now also an important thing to realize is that you can actually plug these into not just the PCI Express slots but the fulllength PCI slots so if we look on the motherboard here you can see there's a smaller slots there and then there's the longer slots these will actually plug into both of them so you can use these on the fullsize PCI slots and that's something to note as well um so yeah that's pretty much been my guide for what hardware you need to buy for a theory of mining again if you're just starting off small I wouldn't recommend getting too many cards if you just want to get a feel for it maybe get one card to card whatever you think you can afford and you can go ahead and calculate how much money you're gonna make if you just go to I think about you should look it up aetherium mining profitability calculator just like that and then you can plug in your hash rate and power consumption and you can just calculate how much you're gonna make per year per month per day etc on there so you can see how much profit you're actually going to gain and the payback period on each of these cards if you want to learn more about graphics cards and the best ones for theory and mining go ahead and check out the video on my channel for best GPUs remaining aetherium and say you already have mining rig and you want to overclock your cards I also have a guide on how to do that for both AMD and NVIDIA cards on my channel so that's been at for this hardware guide all the links to these parts are in the description below if you enjoyed please like and subscribe and I will see you again
