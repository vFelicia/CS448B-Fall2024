hey guys and welcome to the fifth and final video in my Python classes and objects tutorial series so in today's video I'm going to be talking about public and private classes and how to import your own classes from other files into like a main file you'll kind of see what that really means as we move along so the first thing to talk about it I guess would be what is the difference between public and private so I've brought in an example here I'm just kind of written this random example in Python to try to illustrate this to you so on other programming languages there's things known as private and public classes now private classes typically can only be used within the same file or within like a certain scope where public classes are accessed or can be accessed by everyone so private kind of means within something like it's not accessible outside of that whereas public means it's accessible everywhere now I have just a definition I found on Google that I'm just gonna read because it's the best way to kind of explain it and I can talk about it after so in terms of Java and we'll talk about this in a second public versus private class and it's the same for most languages means this so public is a java key word which declares them members access as public public members are visible to all the classes this means that any other class can access a public field or method further other classes can modify public fields unless the field is declared as final ok so what does that all mean and why did I just give you an example in Java well in Python there's actually no such thing as private or public classes there is conventions that we use to declare like a pseudo like private or like a public class but there's not really anything restricting us from using private classes so hopefully I can explain this but pretty much this first class up here is private and what makes this private is the fact that we have one underscore at the beginning of the class name now in Python or in Java for example when you create a class you would do like you can do something like this like public static class and then that would mean that it's a public class you could say like private class now in Python we don't have those so the way that we define this just as a convention is you start with one underscore and then the class name now to create a public method or like attribute of a class it's the same thing you just use one underscore so for example you can say I have to display methods here one is a private method as it has an underscore and the other one is public as it doesn't have an undersquare again like I've said it doesn't actually matter like you can still use this the regular way you'd use a method by calling dot underscore display but by putting this underscore here you're essentially telling other programmers and even maybe yourself later on in the future not to use this and you're saying this is private I don't want you to use it obviously if they decide to use it that's their decision but it's just telling you like don't mess with this don't use this it's private for a reason and typically when you private things that's because you don't want other classes to be able to use it and like mess with the class or do anything like that so same thing here when you create an entire class as private that means everything within the class is also private so I'm gonna go over to this file now and you can see I have one file mod in one file tutorial one now mod is this one that we just went through tutorial one is a new file and you can see that I'm actually importing mod so I'm importing this file now what I do that what that does is import all of the classes and functions that are within this file so for example if you wanted to organize your program you would have a bunch of different files that contain a lot of different classes and you would import them by simply typing this at the beginning of like your main script this way you can keep everything organized clean and neat and then you can see from mod I'm importing not private so the way that this works in terms of importing individual classes is you type the name of the Python file in this case mod and then the name of the class or function that you wanted to import and in this case I want to import not private so I can simply do that now say I've removed this line I say import from mod import not private I'm still able to access not private just in a different way you can see now this goes red the way I would now do this I'd say mod dot not private because it's saying we're looking within the mod file for the class or function not private but it's just easier to do it this way so that you don't have to type mod dot before all that stuff okay so I'm just gonna show you this working I guess I have this is not private class you can see we have two displays and when I run it we get high now I also want to show you the fact that although I told you that this class is private and this method is private that we can still actually use them so if I simply do test dot underscore display you can see that this now works perfectly fine and it gives us hello so I just felt like I had to make this video although it's not really an important aspect in Python just because if you guys are going to be learning different programming languages you have to understand the difference between private and public classes it's very difficult to illustrate with in Python because there's nothing that's truly public or private but just know that if you ever run across some classes that have underscores at the beginning of the name or underscores before method names for example like dotnet then that means that they are typically private or want to be private at least so you should probably not mess with them and not use them that goes for you as well if you are programming and you want to create stuff that you don't want people to kind of mess with just put an underscore before the name and just a typical convention in Python to do that to create a private or public class anyways that's been it for this video and for the series I hope that you guys did enjoy the series and you did learn a lot if you did please consider subscribing and hitting that like button as it would mean a lot to me
