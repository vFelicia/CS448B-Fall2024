hello everyone and welcome back to their Python quick tips in today's video we're gonna be going over the enumerate keyword slash function and what that does in terms of its using a for loop now what I want to do is just introduce a problem here that a numerate can solve for us so essentially let's say we have a list here like apples pears oranges fruits we want to loop through the list and we want to get the elements in our list as well as the index of those elements very common problem you need to do this for tons of different exercises and I'm sure you guys have created a solution like I'm about to introduce here so one way that we might do this without the use of enumerate is for element in my list which means we're gonna loop through apples pears oranges fruits all the elements but not the indexes we'll print that element out and then maybe we're gonna also check for a certain index to occur so we say if it's index 1 which essentially means whatever the second element is let's print the count is 1 that's just something I want to do and then we have this other variable outside of our for loop that's defined and we count and keep track of what index were on by doing that so essentially this count is outside it keeps track of what number we are on in the list and then we can look at that and do something accordingly since we already have the element we can just print that out by doing element but this is really not like the best way to do this now another way that we could do this is like this we can say for X in range the length of my list so rather than looping through the elements will loop through the indexes in our list and then we say print my list X which is going to be the element because we're accessing the element at index X then we say if x equals equal to 1 which means it or at the second element or the first index of our list we'll print X is 1 now these are fine these work but I'm gonna show you a more elegant solution up here that's much better so what you can actually do is use an enumerate keyword which allows you to loop through not only the index but the element as well so we can say for x element in enumerate and then we put my underscore list like this and now I'll just show you what we actually do here we can print X element and I'll show you what this looks like so I'm gonna erase these so that we don't see these and let's run this and what we get is 0 apples 1 pears 2 oranges 3 fruits essentially X lines up with the index of the element and we're able to access both X which is gonna be our index and the element by simply doing this XCOM element really nice super simple and this is what a numerate does I use it like hundreds of times a day when I'm writing code it definitely does save you a bit of time and just make your code look a little bit cleaner now if we wanted to duplicate the other example that we had what we could do is just print elements then we can say if x equals equals one print X is one like that guy believed I had a capital X here so to do that okay so if we run that we get the same thing apples pears X's want oranges fruits and there we go that is how enumerate works hopefully this helped you guys out a bit if you have any questions feel free to leave them down below and as always let me know if you want to see any other things in these Python quick tips series
