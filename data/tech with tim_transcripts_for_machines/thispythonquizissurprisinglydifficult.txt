in this video i'm going to be testing my python skills by going through a bunch of interactive python quizzes i'm probably going to start easy and then move into some more challenging ones as i do consider myself to be pretty good at python so i'm hoping i'm not going to be proven wrong here by these quizzes now these quizzes are available on the real python website this is an awesome website by the way i use this all of the time it has really great content and i'll leave the link to them in the description i thought this would be cool though because you guys can compare yourself to me and see how many you get correct versus myself and then maybe i can explain some more complicated questions with that said i do quickly want to mention that right now at the time of filming i'm about 5 000 subscribers away from 1 million on youtube so if you're watching this please leave a subscribe it helped me get to 1 million i would really appreciate that and now i am actually going to ask you a quiz question before we proceed and go through all of these interactive quizzes so the question is the following what is the sponsor of this video and you're going to have to watch the next minute to

to let's just dive in though and get into this interactive quiz i'm gonna start with basic data types in python now i don't have any idea how hard these quizzes are this sounds like it's gonna be really easy like what's a boolean what's a string what's an integer but it could be a lot more complicated so let's let's see here okay let's start the quiz uh in python 3 the maximum value for an integer is 2 to the 63 minus 1. okay already i have no idea if this is correct or not um i don't even know if there is a maximum value in python i've never seen like a maximum so my feeling is to go false because i don't think there's a maximum but there also would have to be up right um 2 to the 63 minus one seems like that would be the maximum if there was one but i think i'm just going to go with false because again i i have no idea what it would be so let's just let's go false uh okay apparently that was correct let's see what it says here uh limit was removed in python 3 it means there is no defined limit but the amount of available address space on your machine okay um how would you express the hexadecimal value a5 as a base 16 integer constant okay so i believe that the hexadecimal in python is 0x i think you lead 0x now a5 i think i can literally just write a5 um yeah i yeah i think that's fine let's try that okay let's go nice next uh how would you express the constant floating point value 3.2 times 10 to the negative 12 in python uh so you have to do something with like e here so it'd be 3.2 asterisks and then this would be 10e negative 12. that's what i think it is but i don't know if you do the e like this so let's try that and was i close um oh it's you just you don't need the 10. okay i mean i think that was pretty good i had the e so if i just removed the 10 it would have worked i also didn't need the uh what do you call it yeah okay i got makes sense okay i'm i'm fine with that one let's go next uh which of the following are valid ways to specify the string literal foo bar in python okay that's not going to be good because you're going to have two separate strings this will work because you're escaping that although oh no it wants that character yeah okay so that will work this will work because you're wrapping the single quote in double quotes this will not work this i believe will work so let's see if that's correct and there we go nice okay next question write an expression for a literal or string literal consisting of the following ascii characters horizontal tab character new line character the character with hexadecimal value 7e oh my god okay a string literal so let's go horizontal tab i believe is slash t uh the new line character i believe is slash n it might be slash r here but i think slash n is is correct and then the hexadecimal value i have no idea what this would be but i would imagine i would escape the zero zero x seven e um i i don't know how to do the hex at all i i think these are correct for the first two but i have no clue what the hex decimal is so let's just try that okay of course that's incorrect uh what is this saying the answer is here okay so i didn't need the zero i just need to escape the x7e and there we go okay you know what i i can live with that i've never had to embed a hexadecimal character in a string before so i'm fine with that okay next question uh consider the statement prince and then you have r foo backslash backslash bar backslash n baz okay which of the phone is the correct repel output oh my god uh i don't even know what the r does when it when it leads that um i have no clue what this would be the backslash n should move it down though so i think that's it really okay so r i guess means ignore the backslash yeah okay r i guess means you ignore any escape characters that's that's very strange i've never seen that before okay next question this is supposed to be basic data types these are really hard for basic data types uh which the following is not a python built in function okay so i know map i know round i know is instance wrapper i think it's diff okay correct all right guys that was a little bit rough i'm uh i'm not gonna lie to you here that was a lot more difficult than i thought it was gonna be let me go back to the main page and see if we can do another quiz and we'll see how hard that one is alright guys so i'm back to the main page here i'm not gonna lie that was really hard i thought these were gonna be easier especially because those basic data types and that was like really obscure and like specific stuff that you're probably never gonna have to know i was looking through here there's a few uh python dictionaries looks decent i clicked on it just to see python conditional statements let's just do conditional statements here and see nine questions let's go through it in a python program a control structure defines a program specific data structure manages the input output of control characters directs the order of execution dictates what happens okay directs the order of execution that one was an easier one which of the following if statements will not execute successfully uh this will not execute because it does not have indentation this might that will work that will work that will work okay so it's got to be that one very good next uh what signifies the end of a statement block or suite in python statement block or sweet a line that is indented less than the previous line not end not a comment not that so yeah it's gonna be that okay much easier much much easier already uh although i don't want to speak too soon what is the output of the following code snippet four bar in and this is foo bar baz okay this is weird i think this is going to be oh if bar sorry i thought i said far if bar is in foo so it is in there so this will print so we'll get one two well that's not gonna work so we'll just get one two four i believe that's correct all right much much easier suppose you have the valid or the following variables defined write a python if else statement to assign the smaller of a and b to the variable m okay uh the smaller of a and b uh write an ifelse statement i'm a little bit confused because these are predefined values that ask me to write an if statement write a python ifelse statement to assign the smaller of a and b to the variable m i mean could i not just do the min function though okay so i'm going to say if a is less than b then m is equal to a else m is equal to b i mean let's double check this assign the smaller of a and b to the variable i'm okay so a okay yeah okay good that was kind of a weird question again uh the following if l if else statement will raise a key error exception uh if the yes so if d is not in the dictionary then it will raise an exception you have to use dot get so that's true what if d does not refer to an invalid key but the expression in that elif clause never oh sir i didn't even consider the fact that it's not going to execute okay that makes sense i should have read the whole thing okay next question that's why you don't rush i guess on the quizzes which of the following are valid if else statements in python assuming x and y are defined properly if x is less than y if x is greater than 10 print foo i believe that will actually be valid i think that works um this no i don't think this wait if this do that else this this like i think this might work but i'm not sure if that's exactly the syntax on on how you write that uh the semicolons i think actually work as well again again i'm not quite sure here this i don't think will work because of the indentation are all of these correct which is following yeah again these are really weird i've never really seen it written this way i think that will work if another if and then the print that looks like it might work this one with the semicolons i think will work i think if you add semicolons that's fine this one i don't think this works because the else has a colon i don't think you need a colon after the else um and this one here looks like it might work so let's try this okay so this one doesn't actually work you can't do two if statements but these ones are good again very obscure stuff here um but that's fine okay i'll move on to the next question all right what is the value of this expression a plus x if one two three dot is digit else y plus b yeah c you don't actually have the um what do you call it the colon here right the else doesn't have the colon okay so a plus x if one two three okay what is the value of this expression yeah so that is a digit otherwise this so i think it's just ax right i don't know why it would be anything else than that okay very good uh suppose you have two variables x and y to find write a stub if statement to evaluate whether x is less than y the statement should not do anything even if the condition is true write a stub if statement imagine the stub if statement is it's saying like just write an inline if statement that doesn't do anything at all um i don't know what it means by stub though let's get a hint here hint use the past ah gotcha okay that makes sense now so suppose you have x and y register if x is less than y if x less than y then just pass is that what they mean okay that was yeah all right complete quiz and check results okay 770 percent i think one of the questions i got wrong i should have got correct the other one i just didn't know with the if statement much better all right so i think i'm going to end it here i don't know if you guys found this entertaining or not if you or if you were able to follow along again i found this pretty challenging these were some really obscure kind of strange python questions i know that is python for you but a lot of the stuff i've genuinely never seen in my like seven or eight years of writing code in python you know what take what you want from that but uh yeah that that's my thoughts on this quiz some very very strange questions especially for titles like conditional statements and whatnot although i guess now i know and i've learned a few things with that said though i hope you guys
