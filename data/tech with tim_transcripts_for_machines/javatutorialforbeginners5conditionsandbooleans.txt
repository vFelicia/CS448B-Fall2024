hello and welcome to the fifth video in my java tutorial series so in this video we're gonna be talking about comparison operators select greater than less than equal to not we're gonna be talking about chaining conditionals together which you'll see if you don't really understand what it is right now throughout the video and how we can use those boolean variables to do certain things for us so that's what we talked about in the first few videos and if you guys don't really know what the point of boolean is well this video will show you so without further ado let's get started so I'm just going to start off by typing a few numbers here because it's just the easiest way to compare things to start and then we'll do some other stuff so I'm going to create three variables that are integers X is 6 Y is 7 and Z is 10 now I'm going to create a boolean variable so boolean let's call it compared and we'll just set that blank for right now so what I want to do is I want to compare x and y and z using some different comparison operators so in Java I'm going to write them out here we have I believe four main comparison operators four or five so I'll type mode we can see so the first one is greater than and then we have less than we have equal to oops we have greater than or equal to less than or equal to and not equal to now I know I just want through those fast but they're pretty straightforward this is simply going to state whether something is greater than the other thing this is less than the other thing or whatever way you have it right this is is equal to so the double equal sign is different than the single equal sign double equal sign is when you're comparing two values to see if they are the same and the single equal sign like this one here is if you're assigning a value so make sure you remember that because a lot of people when they compare things they forget to add the other equal sign and they just use one and they end up running into some issues okay so greater than or equal to pretty straightforward less than or equal to same thing and not equal to as an exclamation point and an equal sign now I'm going to go through these and show what all these do so I guess so actually I'll leave that there and because I just remember that I have been forgetting to teach you this if you do two slashes in Java this stands for a comment and a comment is simply something that the computer is going to ignore and SCIM it's just there for the the programmer so they can look at it and be like okay this is what this line of code does whatever the computer doesn't care so whenever it sees a line that has starts with two slashes this is how you do a comment it just ignores that line and moves on so that's simply what a comment is and it just grows out and here to show us that that's a comment okay so compare so I want to compare X and y and I want to say see if X is less than Y so say if X is less than Y and what this statement right here that we're typing here is going to return a value of either true or false so we can look at this we say well 6 is that less than 7 yes it is so that should give us a value of true so if we print compare to the screen then you can see we get true like that now if I flip this around and I say greater then okay what do you think we're going to get well we get false it's pretty straightforward to compare the two values to see if they're the same we can do two equal signs and in this case we get false and now this this comparison operator some people get confused by but if I do not equal to what this is gonna tell me is if the two value so on the left side and the right side of the comparison operator are not the same so if they're not the same I get true if they are the same I get false so in this case they're not the same so we should be getting true okay and I guess I could show you greater than equal to but they're pretty straightforward in terms of how they work at least on numbers okay now these work fine so greater than or equal to less than or equal to on numbers but what if I want to compare strings so I'm just gonna change X&Y I'm just gonna make two strings here let's say oops string X I will say hello and string Y and this is equal to hi okay so see now I'm getting this blurred out or this red line here it's saying the comparison operator greater than or equal to is undefined for Strings so the only ones that I'm allowed to do on strings at least for right now that we're gonna talk about are two equal signs or not equal to okay and not equal to is simply gonna say right if the strings are not the same and if they are the same so in this case I say not the same I'm gonna get true if try to see it say if they are the same I get false now I want you to show you one thing here if I type hello and I add a capital o at the end of hello like this do we think that this is the same as hello with all lower cases or not well I'll show you it is not so capital letters do matter in program I mean let's same with variable names like the capital variable Y is different than the lowercase variable Y okay so that's how we can compare those and I want to see actually can we use greater than no we can't use greater than or less than on strings either okay so what I'm gonna do now is I want to chain multiple conditions together so I'm going to show you the end operator the or operator and the not operator and these are how we can add multiple conditions together to get one like main condition if that makes sense I'm gonna change these back to two numbers might be faster just to type them out into x equals what do I have six into y equals let's just do like 23 why not okay so now I'm going to compare multiple things at once so I first want to compare if X is greater than Y but I also want to compare if Z is greater than X say I want to check two things perfectly valuable in many cases you'd want to do that the way that we can do that in Java to compare if two things are the same is using this and operate an and operator is looks like this so it sees two and signs okay and then we have to add another condition after this in this case I'm going to say if Z is also Zed is less than Y okay you can see that's fine we're not getting any red lines and what this does is it's gonna compare the operation on the left side it's going to do the comparison on the right side and then we're gonna end up getting two values so in this case X is greater than Y so 6 is that greater than Y no we're gonna get false so I'll just type it out as if this is what's happening in the computer alright and that is that less than Y yes it is so we get true like this okay now we have a false and we have a true but we have this and operator in between them what this and operators gonna do is it's gonna check if both of the conditions on the left side and the right side are true if they are both true it returns true to us if they're both or if one of them is false both of them are false then we get a false value so in this case since this one is false we're gonna get a false value because both of them have to be true for this to evaluate to true so I'll show you if I do this okay and I print this to the screen you can see we get a false value because this is saying if this and this are true then the whole thing is true okay now another operator that we have is the or operator and the or operator is to straight up lines like this I don't know what they're actually called the key for that but anyways so this is gonna do kind of it's similar to end but in the other way around if one of the two conditions are true the whole thing is going to be true otherwise if both of them are false it's false right so the way that we can determine this again right as we'll do this condition we'll see what this is equal to and then we'll see what this is equal to and if one of them are true we get a true value so let's run and there we go you see we get a true value now we have a not operator now what naught does is simply going to reverse anything and this is the way I like to think about it whatever you have if you see the knot just reverse it so what this does is it's gonna say if this condition is not true then we get false or if this condition is false sorry so not true then we get true other way around if this condition is true then it's false because it's checking if it's not true I hope that makes sense you kind of just have to play with it to make sense of it but in this case since we get a true value and we have this exclamation point which is our not operator it is gonna give us false you can see here we get false now if in here I were to put a false value so let's just literally I'll just show you by typing in the value I say not and then false in there you can see that we get a true value so it simply just reverses like anything that you're looking at now I want to show you that we can actually combine all of these operators together so what we can do is we can use like ants and orders and we can have an infinitely long chain of a condition that will eventually evaluate to true now this is actually some kind of like math problems you have to do typically in University I'm gonna have to do it next semester where you have like a ton of different conditions and you have to figure out if you're gonna get true or false based on them so I'll show you like a pretty basic example so I'll say if X is less than Y and Y is greater than Z or Z plus 2 is less than 5 or what do you call it like X plus 7 is greater than Y okay so I just typed a bunch of conditions right how do we determine which ones which of these are going to evaluate first well that is a good question and typically you'd never type it like this because just looking at this like even I'm looking at it right now after I just typed it I'm like wow okay how do I determine which one of these is gonna happen first typically you put things in brackets so I would say something like this it's like x and y okay so I have this first condition out all right you put in brackets it's gonna evaluate this and in this case we'll get I'm not gonna bother doing the actual evaluation but let's say we get true okay or so we have true or whatever this evaluated with this is so what this is gonna do now is it's gonna look at Z plus 2 if that's less than 5 if that's true then we get true or and then whatever this is and then we could treat this as if this is in brackets like this okay so now the way that this would work is we do everything in brackets here we get a value of like true false we do everything in brackets here we get a value of true or false and then we'd see if either of them are true and return that value so you know what let's just print it to see what we get we get true okay I don't even know how that worked to be honest and yeah that's how we could do that we can also throw knots in here too so if I wanted to throw a knot like this then we can do that now you're not gonna see massive chained conditionals like this because of the exact problem we're running into it's difficult to determine what they are by just reading it and you'll see when we go into if and else statements in the next video how we can use these conditions to evaluate certain things I just want to show you that you can combine multiple things and for example I don't only have to use variables you can see that here I put Z plus 2 less than 5 that's a perfectly valid condition that works perfectly fine can change this is equal to 5 right on you can add constants like I could just say 2 is equal to 5 if I wanted to but that's fine you can compare with constants and with strings just remember you can do less than or equal to we're sorry not Alessa not if not equal to or equal to and you can compare floats with ins and you'll see as we continue going through the video it's too long to go through all them right now anyway so that has been it for this video in the next video we're gonna get into ifelse and l if statements and yeah if you guys have droid please make sure you leave a like I'll see you in the next one
