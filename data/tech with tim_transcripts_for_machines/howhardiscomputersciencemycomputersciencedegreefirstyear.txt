hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video I'm gonna be talking to you guys about how difficult computer science is now if you're subscribed to my channel you'll know that I'm 18 and I'm just about finished my first year of computer science so actually live in Canada and I'm going to a university in Ontario where I'm majoring in computer science and I believe my exact program is honors computer science coop and then I'm actually in the entrepreneur and business stream which means is I take one or two business electives each year and then when I graduate I get that extra little tag on my diploma saying that I likes did entrepreneurship so that's the exact program that I'm in what I'm gonna do in this video is I'm gonna start by just explaining a bit about computer science in general what it really is what you're taking in University and then I'm gonna go through my firstyear courses I'm gonna show you guys the averages for those classes my average for those classes and kind of explain why maybe some courses are more difficult than others or which ones are more difficult so you guys get an exact idea of what it's like rather than me just saying no it's not hard or yes it's hard okay so if you guys want to see exactly how I did in all my computer science classes make sure you stay tuned to the end of the video I feel like some of you guys might be interested in that so anyways alright so what I'm gonna do now is just talk in general about what is computer science a lot of people don't actually really know what computer science is before taking it and going into university now essentially what it is is it's not being a programmer a lot of people think computer science are just writing tons of lines of code and just being really good at coding yes obviously that's an aspect to it but it's really focused around efficiency algorithms design the ways that computer work and knowing these things allows you to write much better code so at the end of the day yes it comes down to writing really good code for your assignments and your projects and having good flowing programs but it's also really about the way that you approach problems the way that you think about things designing algorithms and if you graduate with the computer science degree that means you can take those skills to any different kind of program language it's not just like oh you're really good at Java programming yeah you might be but if you have the computer science fundamentals like you know a lot about algorithms or you know how to approach a problem or maybe you're good at machine learning then you can do that in any language and all that's gonna differ is the syntax and the words in that language that you're using okay so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go through my different courses I have to take five courses per semester I'm in my second semester right now so let's start with first semester go through which courses I took and the averages and how I did in those classes so the first course I had to take was calculus one now calculus one I have to look at my transcript here because I always forget and I'll pop it up on the screen I go out in a in calculus one which translates to a 9.0 out of ten point on a GPA scale you guys can convert that to like a 4.0 scale if that's what you use the class average for that was a 5.4 3 GPA which is sitting around 60 to 65% so you can tell that most people that took that that actually finished the class because this is not account for the people that dropped out of it didn't do amazing and a lot of people found it difficult now I would say Kelley this one is probably one of the hardest firstyear classes and that is just because it's just difficult a lot of the math that you have to do you're dealing with integrals with least that's what I'm doing that you might might be different curriculum and whatever school you're going to and it's kind of a big step up and it requires a lot of practice if you are not constantly practicing and doing your homework you are not gonna do well in that class and I think a lot of people are used to high school like I was where you just go in I don't maybe did a few practice questions before the tests or whatever and you're just fine this if you haven't been practicing like every after each lecture you're probably not gonna do well and I think that's why a lot of people found it very difficult because it just requires a lot of practice ok so the next class I had to take was introduction to linear algebra now this just sounds intimidating when you hear linear algebra you're kind of like okay Wow like what is linear algebra is a difficult class but it is not like crazy difficult so I finished that finished that class with an aminus which is like I think it's like 80 to 85% and the class average for that was five point one six GPA out of ten we again equates to about a 60% so a lot of people found that class very difficult and in fact I think actually like 35 percent of my class dropped out for making it to the exam because they didn't want that like F or the fail on their transcript and they already did horribly on the midterms so yeah so anyways a lot of people find that cost difficult because it deals with really abstract concepts the actual math that you perform is not hard by any means in fact I'd say that if you know like grade 9 or 10 math you're able to complete almost any like math equation or anything that it needs you to do in that class it's just a really abstract concept you're dealing with matrixes and multiple dimensions and a lot of people get caught up in the fact that you can't really visualize what you're doing for example if you're dealing with a 12 dimensional matrix you can't like you can't visualize what that looks like you used to three dimensional math with up to three variables X Y Z and now you're dealing with like 10 15 20 infinite amount of dimensions and a lot of people just get really confused and let that kind of I don't know distract them from how to do the math so the next class I was in was introduction to computing one this class is an absolute joke you've done anything with computer science like I mean like you've just written any kind of Python you've written any code like you can consider yourself a beginner you will be far ahead in this class they have to teach you like introduction clock they have to do like an introduction programming class and make it mandatory because they have to make assume that everyone knows nothing about programming going into University because a lot of high schools don't offer programming so they kind of teach it like from the very beginning which means if you've done anything with that you you'll be fine so you guys already imagined I got an A+ in that class I pretty well teach this class on my youtube channel and it was just it's just an absolute joke so if you have done anything with programming don't worry about your first year computing classes they're gonna be a breeze ok next class I was in was engineering economics and technical report writing now these two so technical report writing it was required some in the Faculty of engineering so I have to take that class that class is super easy as well it's just like really basic grammar and how to structure reports and do documents I hate the class it's boring I hate writing but I got an A in it it's really easy class average for that was 7 y41 like that's a highclass outrage for university so that means most people go like a 75 okay next one engineering economics I got an A+ in this this is a elective class I chose to take this likely you won't have to take any class like that you'll get to pick I don't know enjoyed that class and just taught a bit about business so I haven't yet finished these classes obviously but I kind of have an idea of their difficulty level so let's start by talking about introduction to computing so introduction to computing is a massive step up from introduction to computing one and it is taught in Java so the other one I think I mentioned was taught in Python this one is taught in Java so being taught in Java it means already the language is bit more difficult to use and they don't actually teach any of the syntax they just tell you like we're gonna continue learning about computer science concepts with the language Java not like we're teaching you Java just we're using Java to teach you concepts if that makes sense to you guys so I what we've done in this class so far and I haven't found it very difficult I got 96 on the midterm that I wrote a few days ago is like polymorphism inheritance what do you call it interfaces that's the word I'm okay interfaces I don't know why I couldn't remember that and then they have stuff like what do you do next acts queues just really like basic stuff we dealt with generics I don't know if you guys know what that is but nothing crazy difficult not by the end of the year we're doing some like graphical user interface stuff we're doing a few other like different kind of algorithms binary search trees just really fundamental computer science concepts that aren't crazy difficult but you know you do kind of have to practice them a little bit so that computing to class is a step up obviously from competing one but by no means what I say it's very difficult and you know if you're into programming it's almost like you kind of just enjoy doing it like I genuinely enjoy doing a lot of the work for that class and I'm it that being said I don't really consider it work right ok so next class I have to take and you will likely have to take as well is discrete math for computing this class is difficult um I'm doing ok in this class right now but it is it's just very weird it's nothing like you've ever done before it deals with set theory it deals with proving like formulas proving like you just do proofs like you have to prove that something equals something which seems like it just just difficult I need in like truth tables and basic logics like and or not but kind of with some weird like more difficult than I'm just explaining right there it's not class is difficult I can't tell you obviously with the class averages because I'm not finished yet but I'd assume it'll be fairly low next class digital systems this class is actually super interesting and it deals with really low level logic on how a computer actually works and it deals with like an gates nor gates Nan's latches memory if you guys know what any of that means then you know what it means but anyways it just deals with like really lowlevel logic which is really interesting and kind of gives you a different perspective on how computers work it is a bit of a difficult class but it's not it's not that hard if you practice and you actually read like a lot of the notes and whatnot take notes go to class it's not a nothing too crazy and finally the two other classes that I'm doing this semester are actually have to look cuz why do I forget what ones I'm doing that's probably not good calculus too yeah so calculus 2 is I would actually argue easier than calculus 1 you do need calculus 1 to be able to do calculus 2 I mean it makes sense 1 2 but the concepts are just simpler I would say and if you do the practice really calculus and math like that it's just practice practice practice it's not difficult at all and you can definitely get you can easily get 100 in that class if you just continually did the practice but that being said I mean most people don't do that so a lot of people do struggle with that next one I'm in is I have to look on here again Oh introduction to business management so again I know time in this entrepreneurship stream so I have to take some business electives this class I mean it's not really you guys probably aren't gonna have to take it it's pretty interesting it just kind of talks about you know we call it management what I say did I say business management yeah ok so it talks about management and just how to be a good manager in different aspects to look at in business and you know kind of from like an engineering like science perspective side to go into a class like that is interesting and just kind of hear some different perspectives and see different ways that people think because I think very logically and linear as opposed to like creatively and outofthebox which can be an advantage or a disadvantage so it's nice to kind of get some different perspective and take it different kind of class so anyways that has kind of been it about computer science I apologize for this video being so long but I wanted to give you guys a really good indepth kind of look at to what you're gonna have to take a little summary about each of them not too much but not too little how the class does an average on those how I do in my opinion on it so just to wrap up here computer science if you guys are into computer science and you actually like what you're doing first year it might sound difficult it might sound intimidating but what they try to do is they try to actually flush out all the students that can't handle it in first year personally in my program the reason why there's so many required math classes in first year is because once you get to second year third year fourth year they want to make sure the students that are there are serious about the degree that they're taking and a lot of people jump into computer science without any programming knowledge without any idea really what it is and when they get into first year they see all these hard courses and they just kind of jump ship or they change programs and I know actually a lot of people that have done that or that are thinking about doing that so they give you all these hard math classes to kind of flush out the people that you know don't really know what they're doing or don't want to be there and then in the next year's everything gets a lot better because you just get so much more freedom and selection in what you get to choose and I don't know personally I'm really excited about future years where I get to pick pretty well all the classes I get to take and everything I'm taking is just genuinely interesting to me so I don't know that's kind of been a bit about computer science and how difficult it is I would say it's one of the more difficult degrees that being said if you guys are into it and you like it definitely pursue it don't be intimidated by some of the math and some of the other things if you work hard enough and you actually just do the practice that's all it comes down to you will succeed and you will do well and that's the biggest thing I see in school in general honestly I know it's what everyone says but if you put the work in you will see the results anyways guys that's been it for me I'd love to hear what you guys think about this in your opinion on computer science difficulty all that in the comments below so let me know
