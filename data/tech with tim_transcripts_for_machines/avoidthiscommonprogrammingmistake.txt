for me personally if you were to give me a list of a bunch of functions or classes or kind of some detailed requirements right you gave me what exactly I needed to do I could complete those tasks pretty quickly and I would just continue going through them and spend the entire time pretty much writing code however if you don't give me that and instead you give me kind of a very very large task that's not broken down that requires a ton of thinking up front Etc that's going to take me a lot longer to complete but a lot of people especially as they kind of get into the intermediate and advanced stage of programming they forget that thinking about your code and designing your code is a completely separate thing from actually writing the code itself if you're constantly switching between these activities spending a few minutes writing a few minutes thinking a few minutes writing a few minutes thinking you're going to notice that you're extremely delayed you're not very efficient and you're constantly context switching and it's hard to kind of get into the Flow State and really get a lot
