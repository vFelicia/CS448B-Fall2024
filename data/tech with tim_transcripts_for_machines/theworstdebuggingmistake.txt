now I cannot tell you how many times I have spent hours trying to debug something just to realize I had a duplicate variable name I defined a variable here the variable was defined as the wrong type just check your variable names make sure everything's spelled correctly make sure the casing is proper make sure you don't have duplicate variables or maybe you're referencing a different value than you thought you were and so make sure you check through those and do that first because that is almost always going to be one of the root causes of your problem obviously if you can get that out of the way at the beginning that is going to save you a lot of time assuming that is what the problem is
