hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video I'm kind of showing you a cool facial detection thing that I wrote in Python and I'm just testing it here as you guys can see on the 2016 presidential debate I believe that's the year that this was taking place on and pretty much the goal of this software is to detect eyes mouth and face so you can see here that it's working on wherever these like announcer people are alright and it can detect things actually pretty well so this is like a really straightforward like took me like half an hour to write script it just uses Python and cv2 and pretty much the goal of it is to first detect the face once it detects the face and then looks for two eyes and a mouth within that face now you can see it's obviously not perfect this didn't take me very long to make and I'm working on kind of tweaking it and finetuning it but I thought it was something that's pretty cool and I wanted to show it to you guys and get you excited about some of the future videos that I'm going to be making so in some of the future videos that I'm going to be posting I'm gonna be showing you guys how to use cv2 which is kind of meant for like images and like recognition and stuff and then we're gonna be combining that with like AI and some machine learning stuff so if you guys are excited about that make sure you let me know in the comments down below now for warning I am going away for Christmas so that means I'm gonna be away from my PC and any recording materials that I have so I have a few videos scheduled to upload but I'm not gonna be getting into any of the machine learning or AI to toriel's really until we hit the new year so hopefully you guys are okay waiting for that anyways that's kind of all I had for you guys I just want to show you the cool little thing that I made in Python hopefully you guys find this as interesting as I do so anyways that's all I got for you guys feel free to continue watching the rest of the video and I will see you in the next one
