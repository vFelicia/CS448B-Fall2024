I can't even believe I'm saying this but you need to know the role when you are applying for a job you have to craft your application around the specific role and understand that every company is looking for something slightly different and you want to make your application appear as though you are the ideal candidate for this specific role not any software developer role this specific role so you need to read through the role you need to completely understand it and you need to accept the fact that maybe you aren't the ideal candidate and if that's the scenario maybe you don't apply or you'll omit saying a few things that just make you seem a lot worse than they do better there's a lot of times where you don't need to say something in the application and saying it is just going to hurt you a lot more than it's going to help you want to put yourself in the shoes of the employer and say would I hire me right now writing this application am I the ideal candidate based on what I've written here
