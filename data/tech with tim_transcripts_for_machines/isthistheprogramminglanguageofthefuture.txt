if you watch my videos then you know that I love python it's one of my favorite programming languages I use it all the time and I have literally hundreds of hours of content teaching it on this channel with that said though I'll be the first to admit that there's a lot of issues with python it's notoriously Slow It suffers from the global interpreter lock now fortunately for all of us python users there may be a solution coming very quickly called Mojo now Mojo is a new programming language designed by a company called modular from what it's promising on its website it seems like it can be a great solution for anyone who wants to use Python but get the performance of a language like C C plus plus or rust in fact Mojo even claims to be 35 000 times faster than Python and if that's even remotely true then this is going to be a pretty big deal
