if you're watching this video then that means you have a chance to win an rtx 3080 ti completely for free now this is courtesy of nvidia and i've teamed up with them to talk to you about their gtc which is the global technology conference which is happening this week from march 21st to 24th now registration is completely free and all you have to do to be eligible to win this gpu is register for the gtc and then attend an event and prove it to me by submitting a screenshot at the google form that i have below so again to be entered to win this gpu sign up for the nvidia gtc this is the global technology conference i will leave that link in the description and then submit a google form and have a screenshot of you attending at least one of the nvidia gtc events if you do that then you will be eligible and sometime after this has completed i will randomly select the winner from the form and then send the gpu to you wherever you are in the world completely for free now just to tell you a little bit more about the gtc as i've said it's the global technology conference it's one of the largest ai conferences in the world and they're going to have over 900 sessions from over 1400 different speakers now this gtc is going to be covering a wide variety of topics however some of the things that may be interesting to you include deep learning artificial intelligence natural language processing data science quantum computing and really anything you can imagine in the highend computing graphics and ai world will be covered in this conference now with that said let me give you a quick demo of some cool technology that nvidia has been working on that you can actually use today so in front of me i have the website for nvidia riva or riva not exactly sure how you pronounce that but this is a gpu accelerated sdk for building speech ai applications that are customized for your use case and deliver realtime performance now you can use this right now so i'll leave this link in the description in case you want to check it out there's also a demo that i'm going to run through in one second what this package allows you to do or what this sdk allows you to do is automatic speech recognition as well as text to speech so you can talk into the microphone it's automatically gonna recognize pretty much all of the words that you're saying as well as the punctuations like question marks exclamation points commas periods etc which is really cool and something i haven't typically seen in automatic speech recognition and then alternatively you can do text to speech so you can have kind of the ai voice actually read out whatever it is that you want now one of the really cool things about this sdk is that it's fully customizable and you can go in and tweak the model you can add your own training data and you can make it so it understands maybe specific jargon or terms that aren't in the dictionary or stuff that's specific for your application or use case anyways i'll let you guys check this out from the link in the description but for now let's just go through the demo here and i'll show you how this works so i've just started the demo here and you can see how it's doing on the right hand side of my screen now one of the cool things here is that we actually get punctuation so as you can see if i stop for long enough it will add the period and then if i were to ask a question like how's your day going you should see that we get the question so that's one of the impressive things with this sdk right here is that actually gives you the correct grammar and punctuation which is something i haven't really seen in any of the other automatic speech recognition programs or sdks whatever you want to call anyways this is done pretty well now if i just read some of the sentences now comma one of the cool things here is that we actually get punctuation so as you can see comma if i stop for long enough it will add the period and if i were to ask a question like how's your day going it adds the question so pretty good again you guys can check this out from for yourself i'll leave it in the description there's also some videos here of the domain specific automatic speech recognition that's why i was talking about how you can tweak the model add in your own jargon and terms and then the controllable text to speech so going in the other direction giving the computer some text and then having it read that out in a way that doesn't sound as robotic as your traditional kind of robot voice alright so that's pretty much all i want to show you for this demo but i will mention that if you're interested in natural language processing conversational ai which is kind of a field that nvidia is leading the way in right now then you may be interested in checking out the following sessions from the gtc so i just picked a few ones here that looked interesting that are in the conversational ai field or natural language processing so here's one this is on march 22nd conversational ai demystified you can read the description if you want another one here that was cool is expressive neural text to speech so if you want to learn about how that works uh continuing we have this one building large scale localized language models from data preparation to training and deployment to production another one you may be interested in and then lastly i have a list of all of the topics related to conversational ai and nlp so i'll kind of scroll through them here and you can pause the video if you want to read any that pop out to me uh looking at maybe automatic narrative generation with earth science transformer so you can see there's really specific stuff here kind of something for everyone here's one actually using riva or riva other thing that we were just checking out uh bring endangered taiwanese native languages back to life with the help of modern gpus like how cool is that that sounds pretty interesting so as you can see here there's all kinds of different sessions that you can check out the ones i showed you are just in the conversational ai because i just showed you that demo however there's sessions in all kinds of different fields and the categories that i mentioned at the beginning of the video now this was not enticing enough then remember that if you do actually attend one of those sessions and submit a screenshot you will be entered to win an rtx 3080 ti i cannot underestimate how powerful and crazy this gpu is so i'm sure a lot of you will be interested in winning that so with that said i will wrap up the video here thank you to nvidia for teaming up with me for this video and facilitating this giveaway good luck to all of you that are entering to win the gpu and i hope to see you in another youtube video you
