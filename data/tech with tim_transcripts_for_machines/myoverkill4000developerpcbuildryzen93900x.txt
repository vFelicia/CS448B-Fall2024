hello everybody and welcome back so in this video what I'm gonna be doing is building a brand new computer now I have a little bit of experience building computers the computer I have right now I built about three or four years ago I built a few computers for my friends so I kind of know what I'm doing but I've never worked with hardware at this scale and the last time I built a computer was like two years ago so this is gonna be an interesting video I have no idea how I'm gonna film any of this or what's even gonna happen so you're just gonna have to wait and see but let me tell you a little bit about the motivation behind this computer and why I've decided to go with some of the parts that I did so the reason I'm building this computer is because the one I have right now it's about three or four years old I kind of wanted a new one it's a little bit of a gift to myself before hitting three hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube I've just been working really hard I want to kind of get myself something and I think that this is a decent investment considering this hardware is gonna last me a very long time now what I do on my computer most of the day is really just programming work which this system right here is absolutely completely overkill for even some of the other things I'm gonna mention it is just way overkill but what else I do is some video editing I do some streaming content creation so it is worthy of me having a good computer I am gonna use this hardware but do I need something this fast no I just wanted it to be this fast so everyone that goes in the comments it's gonna tell me this is overkill I know I just want something fast I want something good and to be honest with you I don't mind spending the money because again this is just kind of a little treat to myself so with that being said let me go through some of the components here talk about why I picked them and then I'll try to go into some kind of video of me building this I don't know how that's gonna look and then I'll show you the final product alright so time to go through the parts here and I'll start by saying that this computer the entire build was about 4400 Canadian dollars now it might be a little bit off with that figure but it's in that range between like four and five thousand dollars and that is Canadian dollars so that's equivalent to u.s. dollars is about one point three five times more than a US dollar at the time of filming this video so you can use that as your conversion rate as we go through this video just note that again everything here's Canadian dollars because that's what I bought it for and that's the price that I know so with that being said done let's get started the first part I'm gonna talk about is the CPU so this is me Rison 930 900 X CPU it's 12 cores it has 24 threads it has a 3.8 gigahertz base clock and a 4.6 gigahertz boost clock absolutely which is crazy CPU super overkill but again I wanted something that is just gonna rip everything to shreds just be super fast in any application and this will be really nice for editing and rendering and all of that kind of stuff next we move on to the GPU so this is the rtx 2080 super just absolutely beast of a GPU sorry I forgot to mention this was 700 Canadian dollars this GPU is about 1100 Canadian dollars and it has raytracing and has all that fun stuff eight gigabytes of GDR six there's not really much more to talk about other than the fact that this is actually a white graphics card so I'll show it to you later but it's really cool what it looks like and it's RGB as well and that's gonna be fun to install in the system next we have the motherboard so obviously I needed something that was compatible with the rise in three I also wanted something I've had PCI 4 I wanted bluetooth I wanted WiFi and I just wanted something that was a really good overall board so I was looking at a few boards with like 400 $500 they were all sold out I couldn't find anything in the midrange so I either had to go low or high I decided to go high and I bought literally the best motherboard that consumers can pretty much buy today I'm sure that's alive but this is one of the best boards this was a $1000 motherboard yes I spent $1,000 almost the cost of my GPU on a motherboard it's hard to justify this but really it's just because I couldn't find anything else that was decent I was in stock and this is the Meg x5 70 godlike put it up here although it is kind of heavy and of course this has PCI for WiFi Bluetooth it has a 10 Gigabit Ethernet card that actually comes with it it has 3 m dot 2 slots comes with an expander card that has two more m2 slots which I'm not going to use as for 16 times see islands are PCI slots or whatever they are I don't know all the lingo and even opens up and has this cool little velcro thing you can actually see the board in it also has a display that can play like gifts on it and it has RGB and all of that really great motherboard this is gonna make it pretty much possible to upgrade to anything that I want so I won't have to buy another motherboard or anything like that in the future anyway super overkill didn't really want to buy this but kindness sorta was forced to so I just went ahead and did next I have 32 gigs of Corsair 32 hundred megahertz Ram nothing special about this it is RGB and white and that's just gonna be the RAM I wish I had bought something I've had more megahertz for this Rison CPU because they do like higher megahertz Ram but 32 mate hundred megahertz will do fine and 32 gigabytes will be more than enough Ram that I need next I have my oh s drive or my boot drive this is gonna be the Corsair MP 600 nvme gen 4 m2 SSD these things are stupid fast I didn't realize how fast they were rights at 5,000 megabytes a second or four thousand nine hundred fifty megabytes a second which is about 10 times faster than your standard SSD and I actually have two other 1 terabyte Samsung 860 Evo SSDs that I'm going to be putting in that I'm pulling from my system here that my system here is the one that's on the ground that I've been using currently next I have a 2 terabyte hard drive from Barracuda Seagate or something this is an older hard drive again I pulled it from my old system and then I have a really old hard drive that has a lot of videos on it that I just need to kind of install this is a 2 terabyte random Toshiba hard drive couldn't tell you how old this is but I am gonna be using it because I don't want to buy another hard drive next I have these ll 120 white RGB fans I'm probably need to buy more of these because you'll see later that my case is massive but these will go well because they're the same fans that are on the next part that I wanted to talk about which is this so this is the H 100 I RGB water cooler I think this was like $250 or something and yeah those are gonna cool the CPU that'll be a nice one and since forgot to talk about the prices these fans are like $170 this Ram was like $350 or something and this was like a hundred eighty bucks or something in that range next I have my power supply which is a Corsair RM a thousand X this is the most overkill power supply I could have bought that makes kind of sense I'm am thinking about potentially buying a second graphics card in the future so it is nice to have the possibility with this harddrive sorry with this power supply to power both of them I wanted an 850 watt power supply again they were pretty much out of stock so I just want one up and that is kind of how we ended up with this I have a few other random things that I'm gonna be still installing the in the PC that I already have I also have a huge case that's literally too big to fit on my desk so I'll show you that and last thing to mention is this is an e ATX motherboard which means it's a little bit wider than the standard motherboard so it does take up quite a bit of room and that is why I needs to go with the case that I have which you guys will see as I start building this so with that being said those are the parts I hope all my numbers add it up there I didn't mention a few things but that's alright and yeah let's get into the build and let's look at the finished product so I'm here it's the next day and I have to be honest with you guys that I'm so happy with how this build turned out it took me a long time I put a lot of hard work into making this I have my brother kind of come down and helped me a little bit as well and after about three and a half to four hours of building here we are now there's a few hiccups along the way the one massive mistake I made was I accidentally cut one RGB fan wire don't even ask me how that happened because I don't really know it just all of a sudden RGB stopped working and I went in the back and saw that I had cut the wire so that's interesting I had to throw one of those fans up at the top so that you can no longer see it and then I went out and bought some more ll1 20 fans just to make the thing really feel complete and fill up the entire front intake with 420 millimeter fans so I think this looks really nice the white is really clean and I'm just so satisfied with it and it's really awesome to be able to build this because a few years ago this would have been what I would have considered kind of a dream PC of mine when I was 16 17 and today I'm actually able to make that a reality really because of the hard work I've put into this YouTube channel so with that being said I hope you guys enjoyed this PC build apologize if the clips are not up to standard with some of those massive channels that do this for a living but it's just a fun video I want it to put out and show to you guys so with that being said if you enjoyed make sure you leave a like subscribe and of course let me know what you think of my new PC build
