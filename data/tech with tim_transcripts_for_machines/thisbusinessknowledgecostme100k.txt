foreign I'm going to share with you all of the business knowledge I've obtained over the past five years that's costing about a hundred thousand dollars now a lot of you may see me as just a programmer a YouTuber or some kind of simplistic title but the reality is I've been running companies for the past three years I am a part owner or a complete owner of multiple corporations I have all kinds of funds moving all over the place all the time and I am very very concerned about reducing and deferring taxes and with that comes some complex structures so in this video I'm going to share with you a ton of nuance and a lot of detail about what it's like to actually run multiple companies how you control a relatively High income and make sure you don't pay a massive amount in taxes how you access corporate funds personally how you do all kinds of stuff that I never see people talk about and that is very very important that I've had to pay a lot of money to learn over the past few years this money has been paid to accountants lawyers bookkeepers investment professionals advisors and all the other people that you can imagine so with that said sit back relax and let me share with you everything that I know for free video by sharing with you a piece of mindset that's important for a successful entrepreneur and that's related to opportunity specifically taking advantage of opportunity and kind of searching out in the marketplace for it now to give you a prime example I'm going to take the opportunity to share with you that I just released a brand new course called blockchain expert if you're interested in web 3 blockchain technology you want to learn more about how this works and potentially become a blockchain engineer or web3 developer check it out from the link in the description and use discount code Tim now in all seriousness guys what I'm going to share with you in this video is really everything you need to know about kind of more complex corporate structures so having multiple corporations like a holding company how you can use a trust to kind of prepare for a liquidation event or a sale of a company how you can invest funds within a company how you can control your income defer your taxes and access funds from your corporation when you need them personally this is going to go a lot further than you know oh set up a corporation because it reduces liability or oh you don't a sole proprietor I'm going to give you all of the nuanced details that often aren't shared in videos like this so with that said let's Dive In all right so let me Begin by outlining the kind of main goals that you should have as an entrepreneur when it comes to business and when it comes to these different structures that I'm going to talk about now goal number one I hope for most of you as an entrepreneur is to make as much money as possible right I absolutely want to do that anyone who tells you they don't want to do that is probably lying and that's why I have this YouTube channel I sell products I'm a part owner in another company that's a startup right now Etc I want to make as much money as possible that's cool number one goal number two is to keep as much money as possible it doesn't matter how much money you make if you keep none of it and this highly involves paying the least amount of money in tax as possible or deferring your taxes until a very far uh kind of point in the future ideally you want to keep as much money as you possibly can that could mean saving money that also typically means saving money on taxes which is really one of the main purposes of all these kinds of structures Now goal number three is to reduce your liability specifically personally also in a corporation you want to make sure sure that if you or ever to be sued if something kind of traumatic were to happen that you would not lose a massive amount of money you want to protect your assets and protect your funds goal number four would be to have flexibility right be able to take out money when you need it spend money when you want to go and buy an expensive car go buy a house kind of do what you need to or do what you want to and have the flexibility to access your funds from multiple places so those are the four goals at least that I have I hope that you guys have those goals as well keep those in mind sorry as we go to the Future sections in this video so in this next section I quickly want to talk about the different legal entities you want to be concerned with and the informational is the basics you want to know about it so when we're talking about legal entities we have our sole proprietorship we have our Corporation we have Partnerships we have notforprofits we have other more complex structures that I don't need to discuss for 99 of you here you're going to be concerned about sole proprietorship and Corporation now when I say corporation that could be an LLC if you're in the US I'm in Canada but most of what I'm going to say here applies to the US and North America in general okay so sole proprietorship Corporation I know many of you know this stuff but when you're a sole proprietor that means you don't have kind of a formal legal entity you're operating kind of under your own name maybe you have a business name I don't know exactly how that works but the idea is that all of your kind of personal stuff and business stuff are kind of mixed together in a sense if you were to ever get sued as a sole proprietor you would be personally liable let's say you got sued for a million dollars and you had a house well you would have to sell that house pay that million dollars okay so the liability is atrocious when you're a sole proprietor and the taxes are very poor as well because you're not able to control your income and you get kind of double taxed on payroll taxes which we can talk about in a future section anyways sole proprietor not ideal however it does make sense if you're making a very small amount of money and you don't want to pay the fees associated with a corporation if you're not concerned with liability no issue being a sole proprietor but if you start making more than 50 60 70 grand a year you probably want to consider transitioning into some type of corporate structure okay next Corporation Corporation has limited liability it's not completely unlimited it means that you could potentially be personally liable but it's a lot less likely depending on how you set things up in a corporation you have much more control over your income and taxes typically you're going to pay much less in taxes and be able to retain more money within your corporation there is various other benefits as well but those are the main ones you need to be aware of so for most of you you have to think to yourself right now does it make sense for me to be a corporation really this answer is going to require some legal advice talking to an accountant or lawyer but I wouldn't even bother paying the consultation fee unless you're going to be making again 60 70 80 grand per year or more or you think you're going to be at that point uh relatively soon in the future all right so moving on here let's say that you've decided you're going to be a corporation or you already are a corporation you have a company or some kind of corporate entity now what you need to consider is what it takes to operate a corporation so I'm going to share with you kind of what my operation of the corporation looks like relative fees and costs associated with that and keep in mind that at this point in time my Corporation is not I wouldn't say it's complex it's just me I'm the only uh kind of director and owner of the corporation but I have a significant amount of transactions and a very high level of income in the corporation so it's not you know Corpus making 100 Grand a year it's making multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars per year has Investments has some more complexity so mine is going to be a bit more expensive than someone just starting out would be okay so operating Corporation what do you need well first of all you need your minute books to be taken care of now the minute books essentially keep track of any share operations ownership operations stuff related to directors I don't even really know exactly what happens in the minute books I let my lawyer take care of that but every year your lawyer needs to update the minute books that's going to be a few hundred dollars so keep that in mind and this these minute book story need to be stored typically in a physical location at some law office I actually just had mine transferred here to Nova Scotia because I just moved from Toronto to kind of Halifax now okay next you're gonna have your bookkeeping now this bookkeeping could be done solely at the end of the year before you prepare your end of your financial statements but typically you're going to want a bookkeeper at least quarterly to go in update your books make sure you have some kind of idea and picture of the financials of your company you know all of the income you know all of the expenses you know your balance sheet what assets you have the depreciation on those and you want an accountant to be doing this right which is a bookkeeper my bookkeeper costs about 225 dollars per month goes in once per month updates everything this is very valuable to me because I like to see this I like to look at my books and I like to be able to analyze all of my expenses and my income and understand okay where am I making money where am I losing money where can I cut expenses where can I increase revenue and what activity should be should I be focusing on that's bringing in the most amount of money to the corporation so you want a bookkeeper most of you can do this quarterly again it's probably gonna be about 200 bucks 250 bucks a month depending on the volume of transactions that you have next yearly statements these are the most important so as a private Corporation as many of you know you need to file every single year you need to submit your profit and loss you need to submit your balance sheet you need to submit anything related to the change in directors or ownership Etc right I don't know exactly what you need to file my accountants do all of this for me but it's something along those lines okay so you need to have professional help doing this for you or you have to completely know what you're doing even myself knowing quite a bit about this I would not trust myself to file my own corporate returns I pay my accountant at the end of the year it's usually about fifteen hundred dollars for them to file and prepare all of this stuff and for most people it's probably going to be less expensive than that I have multiple corporations and when you kind of combine all of them together again yeah it's around fifteen hundred two thousand bucks for the year end statements okay next taxes now of course you need to pay taxes now a lot of times you don't know exactly how much you're going to owe in taxes and you need to pay it before you're going to be filing your yearend statements at least that's what happens for me in Canada so what I typically have to do is come up with some kind of estimate for what my taxable liability is going to be and I need to pay a little bit higher than that estimate before the taxes are due I think that's sometime in April uh here in Canada because my corporate year end is December 31st now again this is going to depend on your country but you need to pay your taxes so whenever you're running a corporation make sure you know what the corporate tax rate is and this is the rate that's going to be charged on your profits so if you have 100K profit at the end of the year and your corporate tax rate depending on the state or Province you live in is say 22 percent you want to be keeping at least twenty two thousand dollars in the bank in cash ready to pay your taxes for me I keep probably six figures in the bank just to make sure I always have enough for taxes at any point in time and I typically pre repay my taxes a few months in advance to make sure I don't forget so general idea here is make sure you save for taxes and pay your taxes ask your accountant you probably have to come up with some kind of trial balance or some kind of uh kind of estimate for how much the taxes are going to be and again typically you pay that before you actually file your year end okay now once you file your yearend any amount you've paid over in taxes you will then be owed by the government typically you will just apply that to your balance the next year or you can actually take a refund check from the government depending on your situation if you've underpaid then obviously you need to pay up the balance and then what's going to happen is the government will put you on a schedule on when you owe taxes the next year so if you had a substantial amount of income or you owed a substantial amount in taxes typically they're going to get you to remit taxes based on your last year income either monthly or quarterly so for me this year for example I now need to submit my taxes quarterly and that's going to be onefourth of the amount that I owed the previous year and then at the end of the year I will need to pay more probably if I had more income than I did in the last year again ask your accountant ask your lawyer they'll tell you what you owe but just remember taxes keep money in the bank make sure you have taxes and make sure you pay them on time all right so next we have HST or GST sales tax whatever you want to refer to it as now I don't know exactly how this works in the US but in Canada the way this works is that if you make more than thirty thousand dollars per year in a selfemployment way then you need to charge HST on every single um product and service that you sell now here in my Province it is 15 I know that's ridiculous in some states I think it's what like two percent they might not even have have a sales tax anyways it's absurd but let's say I have 100 service that I'm selling to someone I actually have to charge them a hundred and fifteen dollars I need to mark that that 15 was for HST and then I need to remit that HST to the Canadian government now the only benefit here is that when you do this remains you also get to claim any HST that you have paid and you get that refunded so let's say I go and buy something for 200 bucks I pay 30 in HST now what I get to do at the end of the year is I get to say hey I paid 30 in HST give me my HST back and the government will send it back to me usually what happens is you're just going to subtract how much you owe them versus how much they owe you and then you're gonna pay them the difference or they're going to refund you the difference depending on what the amount is that's how it works in Canada I don't know how it works in the United States but I'm sure there's some kind of sales tax that you need to be charging if you live in a sales tax state and you need to make sure that you're doing that because if you don't do that you still owe the sales tax so let's say that I charge someone 100 when I should charge them 115 I owe 15 to the Canadian government because I didn't charge them HST when I was supposed to so that's out of my pocket it's not out of their pocket and that just means I'm losing money at the end of the year so any HST that you owe the government is not your money it's the government's money and again you may have to remit this quarterly you may have to remit this yearly depends on what the amount was the previous year and what schedule the government has you on all right so now we're going to move to probably the most important section in this video which is related to accessing corporate funds personal now the first thing I want to say here is that it is very very important that you understand what you're doing when you give yourself money from your corporation there is a variety of different ways to do this which is what I'm going to talk about here but it's very easy to accidentally commit fraud especially tax fraud if you don't understand what you're doing when you take money from your corporation and you use it personally the first thing you need to understand here this core concept is that the money in your corporation is different than your money personally what you can go and do in terms of buying a car or buying a house or spending daily expenses is much different than the corporation's funds okay so just because you made a hundred grand a year Corporation doesn't mean you can go and spend a hundred thousand dollars personally very very importantly understands it's also very important that you have a separate accounts right you have a separate corporate bank account you have a separate uh individual bank account you have separate credit cards for your corporation and for yourself personally even if you have say a personal credit card that you use in your corporation that's fine but you should have have that card only be used for corporate expenses so you're separating everything out and you're not accidentally committing fraud with the personal card that's used for your corporate account all right keep that in mind consult your accountants consult your lawyers make sure you know what you're doing here so now that we've talked about that and you understand that you need to keep these things separate we have to understand how you get money out of your corporation so first of all what money does your corporation have well you have all of the revenues that you generated you're gonna have cash which is typically going to be different than the revenues because you have expenses as well and your profit at the end of the year in the corporation is your Revenue minus your expenses okay that's the basic idea behind it now with those profits in your corporation that is the money that remains in your corporation unless you decide to take it out via dividends or maybe you reinvest it or whatever you put it somewhere but the idea is whatever you have in terms of profits is the after expense amount in your corporation that you then get charged corporate taxes on now now what do we do in terms of getting yourself money personal so again many different ways to do this the first and most popular way to take money out of your corporation is to pay yourself a salary now this is just like any other salary you would get from any kind of job okay you would issue in Canada it's called a T4 I'm not sure what it's called in the US but what happens is your corporation pays you say a hundred grand a year you then pay the personal income tax rate on a hundred thousand dollars and that a hundred thousand dollars is an expense to the corporation the corporation remits the taxes that you owe to the government on your behalf and it pays its half of the payroll taxes you pay your half of the payroll taxes and again all of this gets recorded and then your corporation issues you with T4 again that's what's called in Canada that you submit to the government at the end of the year to declare how much money you made personally from the corporation this money is your salary and your after tax amount that you take home you can spend on whatever you want you can go and be an idiot with it you can go buy a house you can do anything you want with that salary money okay step one now the thing with the salary is that you pay personal tax on this salary now again that's an expense to the corporation but typically your personal tax rate is going to be significantly higher than the tax rate in your corporation so it's not always the most beneficial to take money out of the corporation as a salary because this is the most expensive way to take the money you're paying personal tax rate on that sell okay that's step one most common most people are going to have some kind of salary and then in addition use these other ways that I'm going to talk about that's step one most basic now maybe not step two but method two is to use dividends now dividends is cash that's left in your company after you've paid your corporate taxes that you can then issue to shareholders now Dividends are taxed at a different rate than personal income is and this again is money that is left in your company and a dividend is not an expense to the company so if I dividend 50k or 100K out of my company that's not an expense to the business because this is money that I've already paid tax on that now I'm giving out to shareholders now there's a few rules here when it comes to issuing dividends so please uh you know consult your lawyer or your accountant or whatever is advising you on how to do this but this dividend is just essentially cash that you can give yourself personally now you get taxed on this personally the tax rate is much lower because you've already paid taxes on it in the corporation and now you're paying taxes on it again personally now in Canada we have an integrated tax system which essentially means it doesn't matter how you got money personally you're gonna end up paying essentially the exact same rate that you would have paid if you were to pay yourself personally okay now that might confuse some of you I'll dive into that more later but the idea is you have your salary and you have your dividends understand the core difference between them all right so we've talked about salary and dividends now we need to talk about loans now I don't hear many people talk about this but a very convenient way to take money out of your corporation is to take a loan now as the Director of your corporation you have the ability to issue yourself alone personally so I can say you know Tech within which is my Corporation is issuing Timor Sega which is me a ten thousand dollar loan now there's all kinds of rules on these loans first of all I don't have any interest on a loan I can do a zero interest loan however I'm only allowed to carry a loan on the books of my company to a director or shareholder of the company for two years now this is pretty obvious if you didn't have this then you could just infinitely loan money and then personally I can never pay that money back and of course I would just be fraud right so that's why they have this rule you can only carry the loan for two years now with this though that allows me to reduce the amount of tax I would have to pay to access large sums of money so for example recently I bought a house when I bought this house I needed a fair amount of money for a down payment I think I need an extra 15 grand so rather than me bonusing myself 30 grand which is how much I would have the bonus to have fifteen thousand dollars after tax because I live in Canada and the tax rate is absolutely insane then what I would do instead or what I did instead is I loaned myself fifteen thousand dollars now when I loan myself fifteen thousand dollars what this allows me to do is access the 15K immediately and then pay it back to the the company over two years now since it's two years this means I now have two years where I can keep my personal income relatively low and slowly pay back the loan at say a thousand dollars a month 750 a month whatever the amount actually may be now what I can also do is I can write off my loan amount that I owe the company with how much the company owes me so in a lot of situations like now I have an office right this office is at my house my Corporation pays me rent every single month to have the office in this house it pays part of the electricity bill because of all the computers and lights and all this stuff going on here it pays part of my gas for any travel expenses Etc so at the end of each year my Corporation ends up owing me a few thousand dollars so now I offset the loan amount so say I owe the Corp ten Grand then if the Corp owes me Seven Grand now I only owe the corporation three thousand dollars then if I need to clear the loan balance I can dividend myself the amount and clear the loan or I can just wait till the next year and pay it off slow so hopefully this is making a little bit of sense but the basic idea is that when you need a large sum of money what you can do is loan yourself it rather than paying it yourself as a bonus or as a part of your salary and then that way you can reduce the amount of tax you pay immediately and just pay back the loan over time now you may still be short on how much you have to pay back if that's the case then you issue a dividend at the end of the year to clear the loan balance and then you do have to pay tax on whatever that dividend amount was alright so I think that's pretty much it for accessing corporate funds personally again the summary is you have a salary you have dividends and you have loans and those are really the three ways you access your corporate funds in a personal manner the whole idea here is to use these in a combination strategically such that you reduce the amount of tax you have to pay on money you pay yourself in the form of a salary or even as dividends because that is the most amount of tax you ever have to pay when you get salaried income so this is especially important when your income starts getting quite large what you want to do is reduce the amount that you're paying yourself personally only to reduce the amount of personal tax you want to keep some of that money in your corporation invest in your corporation rather than investing personally and use a strategy I'm about to talk to you about called dripping out all right so now we're going to move on to deferring taxes and controlling income now this is the main benefit of holding a corporation especially if you own it just as an individual now most of us understand at this point when you get paid a salary you pay the highest amount of tax you pay on essentially any kind of income your active income which is your salary income is taxed the highest in Canada if you make 250 000 or more a year you are taxed at 53 and a half percent on every single dollar Above 250. So if I were to pay myself 500 effectively I would be left with about 250 000 that's about what the math works out too it might be slightly more than that about 265 regardless think about that you make half a million dollars a year but you only keep 260 or 265 or 270 even if it's 300 still that's a ridiculous amount of tax to be paying to the government so with a corporation the benefit here is that you can control this if you make a million dollars a year in your corporation you don't have to pay yourself a million dollars you can pay yourself a hundred grand 150 Grand you can pay yourself the minimum you need to survive and then you essentially pay the least amount of taxes you possibly can to the Canadian government in a personal way now in the U.S exact same thing now I know taxes are lower in the US it depends on what state you live in there's all kinds of different strategies based on your loc and what you're doing there but the concept is the same you don't want to pay yourself an absurd amount of money out of the corporation because then you just get absolutely rinsed on taxes now the question comes okay that's great I understand that Tim but how do I get my money and use it from the corporation well this is where kind of the process of Dripping it out comes so for me I know that I'm not gonna spend half a million dollars a year I'm not going to spend a massive amount I don't want to go buy like crazy things that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars so rather than me taking this money now and giving it to myself personally and forfeiting 200 Grand and 250 Grand I'm going to defer my tax over a very long period of time and pay small amounts of tax every single year on the money that I pay myself now what this allows me to do is um a mass a large sum of money that's already been taxed at a corporate level in my Corporation I have way more money in my Corporation than I would if I were to pay it out personally so I can now invest this money in my Corporation and make outsized Returns on this larger sum of money than if I were to pay it to myself personally and simply invest it in my personal account so again what I'm doing is I'm saying I'm gonna pay myself the minimum I possibly can to survive what I need for groceries what I need for rent what I need for a vacation whatever money I want to spend that's what I pay myself personally I essentially spend all of it I save a little bit so I have a bit of a personal cushion but essentially I have unlimited access to funds from my company so why do I need to pay it to myself when I don't need the money I don't so instead I pay myself whatever ever I require I pay the taxes on that and then I keep the rest of my money sitting in my Corporation now yes it does get taxed in my Corporation but in Canada the corporate tax are in the province I live in is 11 so that means that I now keep hundreds of thousands of dollars more per year than if I were to dump it out and just pay it to myself personally I take all that money I invest it and now my money that's invested can make so much more money that later down the line I don't mind paying myself a little bit more and paying some more tax because all of this invested funds is generating essentially fulltime salaries right massive amounts of income per year because I have a way larger amount than if I were to give it to myself personally so hopefully you guys are understanding the process here you want to amass the large amount of capital in a company where it's taxed at a very minimal amount for in the US I think it's like 22 25 right for me I have small business tax rate currently soon I'm going to be out of the small business tax rate and having to pay more but for me it's only 11 so I take all this massive amount of money I keep it in my company I invested in the company and it grows grows grows grows grows and then I slowly drip my money out every single year and defer all of my taxes over a long period of time now once you get to the point where you have millions upon millions of dollars okay you can start taking out more and yeah you're gonna pay a high amount of tax but at that point your Investments have grown so massively because of the strategy you used earlier now you don't mind paying the extra amount of tax whereas again if I were to pay the tax earlier that reduces the amount that I can invest and reduces the amount I can make on my investments and can compound over time hopefully that makes sense but that's the strategy here that's what you want to consider and that's how you need to kind of think about this whole strategy using the corporation all right so now we move on to talking about some details related to investing in a company or a corporation first of all you can obviously do this any massive company you know has Investments or has holding companies that hold Investments for them okay so you can invest in a company most very wealthy people you know have a lot of their Assets in different corporations um for this this purpose right for investing now one thing you want to know about investing in a company is you have a realized gain versus an unrealized game now this applies personally as well but the idea is your realized gain is a gain that you have made by selling the investment an unrealized gain is a game that you've made but you've not yet sold you haven't essentially locked that game in so very simple example I invest fifty dollars it goes to a hundred dollars I don't sell the investment I have an unrealized gain of fifty dollars okay realized example I have 50 bucks becomes 100 I sell it I have a realized gain of fifty dollars my investment went up by 50 bucks now this gain gets taxed you only get taxed on the gain when it is realized now this is another way to defer taxes you never realize again or you take a very long time or you realize it over time right anyways I realized my gain of fifty dollars as soon as this become realized now I pay capital gains tax now capital gains tax is 50 of the capital gain is taxed at whatever the capital gains tax rate I know this seems a little bit confusing but if I had made 50 bucks right that's my realized gain only half of that so 25 is taxed and that's taxed at a different rate depending on a lot of other factors State Province Etc right so in my case it's taxed at about 50 and that means that effectively I get taxed 25 on the total gain so if I made 50 bucks I get taxed 25 I pay 12.50 in capital gains tax there you go okay that's how capital gains tax works now next thing you need to understand is that once you have all this money right and it's invested you won't start thinking about reducing your liability so the issue happens or the issue occurs when you start obtaining a lot of Investments or a lot of cash within an operational company so for example I have Tech with to make I do sponsorships I have all kinds of clients I you know sell courses and there is some inherent liability in what I'm doing it's possible I could get sued for something now if I were to be investing all of my assets in my main operational company and I got sued those assets are up for grabs so what you need to start considering once you get larger sums of money is how do I protect these assets from the liability of my Corporation now you're reducing liability at a corporate level not at a personal level so we've already reduced the personal liability by separating our operations into a company now we need to separate our assets into a holding company to reduce liability from the operations of the main company okay so hopefully this is making a bit of sense so what you want to do is you want to set up now a separate corporate entity and there's all kinds of complex structures to do this I'm not going to walk you through the exact process but you need to set up a separate company with legal advice that will allow you to transfer assets from your main corporation into this company now typically what ends up happening is your holding company is going to own the operational company or it's going to be the beneficiary of something like a trust and the trust is going to own the operational company now this allows you to essentially take the profits from your operational company and transfer them to the holding company where then in the holding company they get invested now in this holding company you have zero operations the whole purpose of the holding company is to hold the assets of one or potentially multiple operational companies so now you invest in the holding company and you reduce that liability so now if your operational company gets sued they can only come after the assets of the operational company owns not the a holding company because the holding company is on top owning the operational company now it's very important that when you do this you don't taint the way that assets are transferred if you transfer Assets in a non kind of legal way or in a certain way you can essentially taint the relationship between your operational company and your holding company and you can open up liability in your holding company so again this is something you need to talk to a lawyer about I'm not quite qualified to get into that much detail but just understand that the way you transfer is important and you need to discuss this with professionals that have set up these structures before all right so with that said that's pretty much gonna wrap up this video there was quite a bit of stuff here I apologize it was kind of all over the place but I really just wanted to sit down and kind of just rant you guys about all this business knowledge because I feel like I've obtained quite a bit I've learned so much over the past few years and this is stuff that took me a really long time to learn was really expensive and that I think should be free and that all of you should know and understand if I had been taught this when I was 17 18 I can only imagine where I would be right now and I hope that this opened up your kind of Horizons and perspective on what's possible with corporate structures and why you should consider getting into them as your income grows full disclosure here I make hundreds of thousands of dollars per year this is not something that makes sense to do unless you make a lot of money if you don't make a lot of money you're gonna pay a lot in fees my lawyer accounting bookkeeping fees per year between my corporations is probably around twenty thousand dollars right in terms of all the stuff that I need to do setting up new entities it's expensive but in the long run it saves you a ton of money especially in so with that said I'll wrap it up here hope you found this helpful I look forward to seeing you in another YouTube video
