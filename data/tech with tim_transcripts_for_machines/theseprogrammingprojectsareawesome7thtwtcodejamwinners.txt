in this video i'm going to be sharing with you some awesome programming projects that were made as a part of a coding competition that i host that we call it timothon or a code gym now all of the information on how you join this how you get notified on when these events are going on is in my discord server so make sure you join that from the link in the description and before i say anything else i want to give a massive thank you to my discord staff team who pretty much organizes and runs all of these events as well as a bunch of other community related stuff which again you can find from the discord server now in this video specifically i'm going to be showcasing the top five projects from this coding competition i'm then going to be announcing the winning team so first second and third place and then i'm gonna be giving away some additional prizes uh that we'll talk about later on now for this code gym we had some awesome prizes we're giving away 800 400 and 200 usd to the first second and third place teams and this is courtesy of algo expert who has sponsored this code gym you guys know i work with algo expert in fact i have my own kind of course with them called programming expert you can check out all of their information from the link in the description they were kind enough to uh sponsor this code gem and in case you're unaware algo expert has some new products out so they have front expert machine learning expert they have systems expert and then of course the original algo expert which prepares you for technical coding interviews as well as all those other products pretty much but with some more specialization so check them out massive thank you to them for sponsoring this and they're going to be giving me some programming expert licenses to give away to you guys as kind of special prizes i'll talk about who's going to win those and how that works in a minute for now though let me dive into kind of the theme and just a bit of context and then we'll get into all of the projects and if i'm boring you then you can skip forward there should be some time stamps when i actually start kind of demoing the top five projects all right so i'm just on the code jam information page here i'm going to give you a little bit of context first thing to note if you want to read any of this yourself you can go to the website twtcodejam.net i also want to give a massive thank you to everyone who participated here as well as my discord staff team for organizing this doing all of the grading which i'm going to talk about in a second and generally just spending a bunch of time helping out the community really appreciate it guys i also want to note if you did not get in the top 5 or the top 15 or anything like that please don't be discouraged please submit again i've seen many of you guys submit over multiple code gems and you just keep getting better and better and that's really the point of this yes the prizes are nice but i want to give you guys an opportunity to practice and create some cool coding projects regardless though the theme for this code jam was make every day a little less ordinary and the way that the projects were graded is once people submitted them that approximately two weeks by the way to work on these projects my discord staff team went through and graded every single project out of 40. now they use the following four pieces of criteria the theme the functionality the code and the intuitiveness of the project to grade it then once all the projects were graded we were able to narrow it down to the top 15. once we had the top 15 i sent the 15 projects to nick white and ben ayowa who are two celebrity judges for this code gym so big thank you to them and we're gonna hear from them in a few minutes actually they also have great youtube channels which i'll leave in the description regardless though they then graded the projects that allowed us to narrow it down to the top five and those top five is what i'm showing you here now both nick and ben did select their favorite project and what they selected or the team that they selected is going to get a special prize outside of the prizes that i already mentioned uh and with that said we can dive into the projects apologize for the long intro just want to give you guys the full context here now we will look at the top five and then announce who the winning teams are all right so diving in here i have project number one i'm not showing these in any particular order just going through the different uh projects that are in the top five so this project here is called friend court now i believe that this is kind of like a tinder knockoff with discord we're gonna have a look at it in a second uh but the contributors here are soul ninja and i am saptorishi uh apologize if i'm mispronouncing that i'm probably am anyways you get the point to that is who created this so let's actually click in here to friend court already have it open uh we can see we met on discord meet new folks with new niches every day at friend court okay so let me log in with discord once i do that i'll be right back all right so i've just signed in here now i will note that i did use this previously when i used it the first time it did ask me to select my interest so that's why it's not doing it here but it looks like i can view different profiles here and swipe left and right uh based on if i like the profile and if i want to make a friend or get a match or whatever so i can see can i click on him no okay i can't click on him but i have interest we have the pronouns we have anything highlighted that we both like doing so we both like gaming we both love coding okay great let's give a like on that uh let's see if i can swipe left okay and it says go touch some grass uh try reloading to fetch more profiles if that doesn't work come back after some time i imagine just not many people have actually signed up for this website uh so that's probably why we're not seeing it and then i can go to matches here and if i had any matches i would see them but apparently i don't i guess you guys didn't want to uh to match with me on this platform anyways that is fine uh oh and if i come back okay there is actually more people so i had to refresh the feed so let's swipe and see if we get some matches okay matches uh let's see no unfortunately we don't have any okay so it looks like that's it for friend cord i'm not sure what else i could mess around with here seems like filter is blurred out for some reason and then of course i can log out and i get brought back to the home page overall great project here definitely fits the theme make life a little less ordinary everything is very clean it works it's intuitive great job guys let's move on to the next project alright so moving on here to another project this one is called proactive although i've seen it called proact as well just from scrolling through the readme here uh now this is by ben robo that's the team name as well as the participant so just one person and let's just click right into the app and start having a look here so making life less ordinary the one and only app you would ever need to stay motivated okay let's just go through here we have about okay so shows us who wrote this very nice uh let's go to features we have motivational quotes mood melody daily fitness very nice although this says lorem ipsum so i guess he didn't quite finish this paragraph here that's fine i won't penalize that too heavily as long as everything else works let's go to home get started okay we're gonna load in here and let's see what we can do okay so looks like we have motivational quotes on this page uh looks like i can flip through them excuse me i get some cool backgrounds i can favorite them okay so let's favorite that let's favorite another one uh can i download this yeah so i can click download or i can escape nice uh it looks like i can share oh sorry feature not available okay that's fine try downloading and then share as pics notification set how many quote reminders you'd like to get every day that's cool okay i can go through the different categories i don't know who would want 80 quotes per day but i'm not going to go through this i trust that works okay let's go back let's go here uh let's go view reminders okay no reminders let's go categories looks like categories doesn't do anything okay and favorites and then i can view the quotes that i've favorited and go in here nice okay overall pretty good although i'm not sure about the categories thing i imagine he just forgot to link that page or something okay let's go to the next section here we have mood we'll give this a second to load okay medi uh brilliant things happen in calm minds become your brilliant very nice very motivational uh let's click a mood here relax okay come on um there you go okay so it just takes a second to pop up uh let me turn on my speakers here i imagine this is going to play some music and actually will you guys be able to hear this let me just change this so that you guys can hear the music if it starts coming on okay i think you guys should really hear this in my recording but music is playing that is relaxing very nice okay let's try anxiety okay let's give it a second okay so the responsiveness is not the best here with these moods i'm not sure if you can change them okay sleep let's click it and okay so we get some some more sleep music very nice all right let's go here to daily fitness okay fit bro is loading up uh onboarding okay continue okay great good day tim you have no workouts oh this is cool oh wow okay there's a lot of stuff here in this workout page damn how did you get all this stuff did you pull this from some website or something i'm curious uh i guess you could have just put in a bunch of names and pick some different uh what do you call it images for them okay let's let's click into one here there's a video showing me how to do this wow okay this is impressive you did a lot of stuff here can i pull this up yeah i can i get some information about how this works wow this is uh very well done and we have different categories here equipment required and this just keeps going yeah you must have pulled this from from some website okay achievements we have achievements based on workouts that i've done okay very nice i have my profile okay tim i guess i can just log out i guess that's all i have here for for profile unless let's click here there we go okay profile name tag name oh no that's adding a workout sorry profile okay the profile page it looks like there's something behind here but i guess maybe this is all for profile okay that's fine let's just do something let's say test test let's go okay just just insert some random numbers here just make sure this works add workout and there we go okay it gets added to the page wow i'm impressed i wasn't expecting you to have so much stuff for each one of these categories very well done i think i covered most of this if i keep going it's gonna be very long uh let's move on to the next project all right so moving on here to project number three this one has a hilarious name zero to chad uh very nice very clever introduction this is zero to chad your allinone selfimprovement app become the best version of yourself okay learn and share ideas manage and track habits show your achievement monitor your time usage on different websites okay this is by team coffee i've seen this team before thank you guys for participating again we have milan and any i'm not even going to try i don't know how to pronounce that i apologize uh let's click in here though oh our chrome extension okay so chrome extension for monitoring and i guess that's what it is so let me install this chrome extension and try it out okay so actually i lied there is a chrome extension i will install that after but there's a main website the chrome extension seems to be kind of an addon for that for tracking your time uh so let's log in for now though or let's take action okay username tim let's just go with fake email like tim gmail.com if i could type here uh okay is it gonna let me have a weak password here let's see sign up okay very good we can save that select the topics that interest you uh let's go crypto business finance fitness let's just select a few here programming technology okay next uh select your habits okay um these are not all gonna be accurate here i'm gonna make myself look a lot better than i am but let's do this okay let's go next uh training more than three habits at a time would be inefficient okay is only letting me select a few or no it's just giving me a warning there that's fine okay next and wow okay this looks awesome so i have home explore habits my posts achievements web usage i have a quote of the day you guys have made some really impressive stuff especially considering this only takes you guys two weeks to do okay track your habits uh click on more okay i have all the other habits here let's go to explore you might like these collections i guess these are like tweets or something that i can view let's click on this no it almost is just like a little blog post or something they have here okay that's cool uh what else c plus plus versus rust comparison very nice recommended post don't code all day go touch some grass very nice thanks your mom uh warren buffett nice oh wow you guys have like a whole feed here of different posts okay let's go to my post let's make one post uh regular post test posts cool project okay tags uh selfimprovement why not okay let's post that uh okay it should be at least 50 characters long you guys going to make me do this okay i think that should be 50. let's post and there we go okay achievements habit master complete 60day streak web usage okay so this is for the chrome extension so i can look at that in a second uh but yeah this looks really cool nice idea good project everything is very sleek everything looks good although when i like this i guess it's instantly moving up which i don't quite like because i don't get the feedback on actually pressing the button other than that though really good job guys and looks like of course i can log out from here okay so let me try that chrome extension then i'll be right back okay so i installed the chrome extension here was actually pretty easy to do you can see that it's right here zero to chad website time tracker it doesn't allow me to really do anything from the extension but it does actually now show me this graph here of minutes spent and on what website now of course i haven't been on long enough for it to give me really any information but it did kind of show up that it was registering my time and if i refresh here let's see if it shows anything else okay refresh one more time uh no it just says uh minutes spent and it was showing github there a second ago because i was on github anyways i'm going to trust this works i'm not going to go through and actually test this over you know the span of a few hours regardless though really great project guys all of these have been super impressive so far this is going to be a tough decision let's move on though to project number four alright so moving on to project number four now this one i believe is called uno life uh and this is by a bunch of cells fire plank and snowball now i'm not familiar with bunch of cells but i do know fire plank and snowball from the discord server these guys have been around for a very long time fireplank and i have actually played chess a few times on chess.com uh and yeah he beat me pretty much every single time because he's like way better anyways uh looks like this is made completely in rust i have a ross tutorial series right now they must have been watching that anyways let's have a quick look at this okay so looks like we actually need to run this from the desktop let me install it and we can have a look and see what uno life is all about alright so i've got it installed and opened up it was actually super easy to do this so thank you guys for that uh looks like i have home games settings and about so let's go to about uh just give some information wow you guys are 16 and 14. okay well that's impressive already uh you guys are coding your own apps here and in the top five of this code gem uh we have settings okay so i can reset the high score i can change from light or dark theme this is light theme okay actually let's leave it on dark theme for everyone let's go to games here so tictactoe wordlesnake2048 i know to play all of these okay let's click okay i guess we'll go here okay here here here okay it's a draw makes sense i can change to man vs man purple verse ai i can reset very nice let's try wordle i guess i just type something um i actually never play this game let's just see though enter okay heard nice none of those are in it that's great uh can we do something like worst okay this is gonna be bad i'm not gonna play the entire game very nice though i trust that works let's go to snake okay i guess i can move with the arrow keys this reminds me of the snake game i made uh in in python looks very similar except the head of the snake doesn't have eyes like mine did okay nice so we can play snake let's see if i can kill myself okay there we go you lost i hit the edge of the screen okay let's do another game let's try 2048 uh how would i do this oh i just have to hit down uh or right or whatever on my keyboard i wouldn't mind if they showed the controls here on on the screen it would probably be a little bit easier but that's all good okay and then yeah we can play 2048 nice i'm not going to continue on with that uh 15 puzzle okay so we have 15 puzzles now i have no idea what this game is so it would be nice if there was some kind of instructions or something um or at least a little bit of info because again i just don't i don't even know what the goal is here uh maybe i'm trying to arrange it 1 to 15. i'm not going to go through because i could fully be doing the wrong thing but nice okay another game show meme nice okay and it just shows me a meme that's funny okay i'm not even going to read it all let's go to another one here though and click show meme and see if it shows me another one yep okay i get another me nice guess you guys have multiple uh sweet click on the games tab okay click on the settings tab check out uh click on the about us tab i think i went through everything here i know i went quickly through the games but you guys get the point they're basic games i trust those work uh nice awesome work here guys great project pretty unique to use rust i didn't see anyone else use rust and you made a desktop application as opposed to a website uh so definitely points for creativity with that said though let's go on to project number five alright so moving on to project number five now this one is random iq i want to find the contributors here i didn't see it on this page uh contributors uh looks like we just have m m yeah again i don't know how you it's how you pronounce this uh anyways looks like just one person here okay very good uh let's go back to the main repository okay let's go back uh and no board days again okay it's a website where people can get a random challenge finish it and then share the moment okay so let's go to random iq and let's see how this works okay so it said i have to log in first so let's login nice okay i got like a cool login form here i'm curious what they're actually using for this because it looks prebuilt but let me sign in though and then we'll be right back all right so i've just signed in here and it looks like it's just giving me some challenges and i can accept them or refresh uh so let's just go through a few create a cookbook with your favorite recipes type cooking price free participants one okay let's accept the challenge let's see what happens when we do that uh okay challenge is added let's click on that let's see and there we go okay create a cookbook with your favorite recipes and then i guess if i completed it i could add a picture related to the challenge and tell us how it went and then finish uh please vote this build field went well okay and is that gonna work maybe i need to add an image too okay that's fine we'll we'll get out of this for now okay finish challenges randomize let's go back here let's do some filters let's make it education let's make it free let's refresh okay learn morse code okay that's cool that's a nice challenge let's accept that one all right looks like we're loading here okay let's get another one study foreign language okay we can accept let's go to your challenges and let's see if they're all here and nice okay we get them all showing up and then i imagine once i finish them i'd be able to have a look here at all my finished challenges let's go to explore and i can see what others have done okay so i can see what challenges people have completed you can like them nice okay this is cool and yeah the footage at the bottom here that makes sense sweet can i click into this oh i can report that okay nice and we have the time uh hold the video game training with some friends sweet okay so i think that's it for this website simple but cool idea definitely does make life a little less ordinary so 100 fits the theme very good job guys again a few cosmetic things i think would have been kind of simple and just cleaned up the website quite a bit other than that though very nice job so that i believe was the fifth and final project now that we have gone through those let me take a quick break and then i'm going to announce to you the three winning projects as well as some special prizes uh based on some projects that our celebrity judges sorry have selected all right so i just spent a minute here going through each of these projects again making sure i didn't miss anything and that i went through all the features that i kind of briefly looked at in the demo thank you to everyone for participating these projects were super well done and this is a very difficult decision now i'm going to announce first second and third place but i want to quickly give a word to our celebrity judges who both selected their favorite project and those projects are going to be getting a prize so let's now go over and talk to ben and nick all right so ben thanks for joining me man thanks for being a celebrity judge i just want to give you a chance to quickly introduce yourself in case anyone doesn't know you here hello everyone my name is ben you can find me on the internet on youtube or tick tock and i like to do tech stuff as well i used to do tutorials like tim but not so much anymore nice yeah you're working on void pet right now right you're kind of online game yes um believe it or not i'm building a game right now called void pet incredibly waste of time but this time it turned out pretty well uh we'll see how it goes yeah guys check it out it's pretty cool i've seen it a few times and there's a bunch of work being done on it anyways the reason we have you here is because you are judging some projects for us so i actually gave you the top 15 projects to judge uh and you came up with what your favorite one was as well as gave them all scores so i just wanted to ask you here what was your favorite project and why because they're going to be getting a special prize here my favorite project was uno life that made the rusty project because it was coded in rust every single game which i thought was quite impressive because i cannot code and rust but i hear russ is really cool so when i saw data and rust i was envious and i was like they deserve an extra prize because they put the extra effort to code all the things in russ when they could just done in python so that's why i liked it yeah awesome all right well there you go so i believe it is team rusty uno life you guys gonna be getting a special prize i'll talk to you about that in a second ben thanks so much for helping out and hopefully uh we'll have you as a judge for the next one yeah thanks for having me tim hey nick thanks for joining us here and being a celebrity judge just want to give you a quick second to give yourself an introduction in case anyone here doesn't already know you hey guys i'm nick white i also have a youtube channel where i do tech coding content some educational some entertainment and i've worked with tim before as a algo expert employee yeah and we've also done a few collab videos on nick's channel yeah and i think we have some other stuff regardless thank you nick for helping out helping us with judging and i just have one simple question for you what was your favorite project out of the ones that you looked at and why uh i really liked friend cord by touch some grass pro just because it was the most um polished project tinder swiping is not exactly easy to implement and then they uh hooked it up to discord which is pretty cool kind of a unique idea kind of a fun idea and um i don't know i just took more creativity i think than a lot of the other projects for sure i would definitely agree so thank you very much nick for helping out and being a celebrity judge that team is going to be getting a special prize because you selected them as your favorite project and hopefully we can have you back for the next code gem thank you for having me all right so big thank you here to ben and nick for selecting their favorite projects if you worked on one of the projects that they selected then you're going to be winning a programming expert license key completely for free every member of the team is going to get one all right so now without further ado let's now to the top three again very difficult decision and we're going to start with third place so drum roll please editors put in some suspenseful music or something the third place team is zero to chat so zero to chad third place let me just quickly find who wrote this again milan and name i cannot pronounce anise or something like that again i apologize uh this was your project you created kind of the habit tracker you had the uh what was this the chrome extension which i did verify was working afterwards you had achievements you had posts you had kind of like a social network aspect to this and i thought you guys did a really good job this was an awesome project and the only reason i'm actually placing this third as opposed to going higher was i just felt that the styling could have been done a little bit better it didn't look quite as polished as some of the other projects but again i think you guys did a really awesome job you had a great amount of features and definitely fit the theme as well making life a little less ordinary so thank you guys for your submission congratulations on third place i'll reach out to you on how you can claim your prize so now we move on to second and first place now this was a very difficult decision i'm not gonna make you wait any longer the second place project was dramatic pause please friend cord now friend cord this in my opinion was the most polished project i thought it was one of the best ideas out of all the ones that we had yes it is kind of cloning and mirroring uh you know something like uh tinder but i just thought it was a creative idea and it's really easy to use everything seemed to work unfortunately i didn't get any matches but i'm not going to penalize you for that and i just thought the styling was good everything was good generally again just no real negative feedback that i can give this project so that's why i selected it for second place uh and now once i announce first place i will just discuss why i chose that over this for first place so congratulations guys i'm gonna put up whoever made this on the screen and i'll reach out to you for your prizes but now we need to discuss who won first so the first place project here as i'm sure many of you have already guessed is proact now again this was a really difficult decision i was between friend court and pro act for first and second and the reason i went with proact here was just because i thought that this had a lot more features there was a lot more to it than friend cord and this as well was very polished everything with the exception of that one paragraph that i found that said lorem ipsum was you know pretty well done there was just so many different workouts we had three different modes inside of here yes it was a little bit laggy on this screen but i'm willing to forgive that just because of the sheer amount of content that was on this website i just thought that when we're comparing the two yes one was more polished than the other but this had so much stuff that i just thought it deserved the win i'm sure you put a ton of work into this and really that's kind of why i selected it for first place again i thought the idea was good definitely does make life less ordinary and overall just a really good job on all these projects making it very difficult for me to decide so i'm gonna put up who made this project on the screen congratulations to all of our winners to who these celebrity judges selected and really to everyone who submitted a project i do these code gems that you guys can have fun so that i can have a cool video to post every few months and showcase some community projects and if you guys like this idea of kind of showcasing what people in the community have made we can do this more informally as well going forward where i showed just some cool community projects that weren't necessarily made uh just for something like this like a coding competition so with that said i am going to wrap up the video here again congratulations to everyone thank you all for participating thank you to my discord staff team thank you to algo expert for sponsoring this competition and i have no more thank you so i'll wrap it up here if you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another one
