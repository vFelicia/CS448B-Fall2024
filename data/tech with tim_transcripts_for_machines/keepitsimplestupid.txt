now I'm guilty of this as well but most people and especially younger programmers at least from what I can see is write crazy convoluted methods and just ways of doing things that are super Advanced to try to show what they know or to try to prove that they're smarter than other people go ahead if you want to do this but it just is such a headache in the future when maybe you haven't programmed in a month or you haven't looked at this code in a while and you come back and you're adding a new feature and you run into a bug and then you realize maybe that bug is from something you wrote before you go back and you try to read these methods and you're like holy crap what was I doing whereas if you had just added you know two or three lines simplified things a bit made them a bit more readable this would have saved you a tremendous amount of time so just keep things simple to start
