hello everybody and welcome back so what I want to do in this video was taken opportunity to give you a formal channel update talk about some new things that are coming on the tech with Tim YouTube channel some new things that I've launched and just what's going on with me this last year has been a really long journey I've done so much I feel like in 12 months and I figured today we'll take a little step back summarize some of that and talk about what's to come for the future so the first thing that I want to do is say thank you to all of you guys genuinely thank you to every single one of you if you're watching the video right now thank you thank you for liking the videos subscribing commenting just any support you give me really means the world and it's the reason that I'm able to do all of these things and I'm able to sit here in this chair and talk to you guys on the internet on this YouTube platform over a year ago I was at less than 20 or 30,000 subscribers and I just cannot tell you how unbelievable it feels to sit here have so much support and an amazing community that really does support me in anything that I do so with that being said let's talk about are the new exciting things that I'm working on and what's common with the tech with Tim YouTube channel and what you can expect so I guess the first exciting piece of news to share with you guys is the launch of my new podcast called time out with Tim now you probably understand that why I have this microphone this big boom arm and this audio quality it's because I've recently started the podcast time out with Tim which is about taking a timeout pausing relaxing and listening into my perspective on some different things as well as having some other guests on so what I'm gonna be doing with this podcast is posting full video versions of it on a second youtube channel called time out with Tim I would really appreciate it if you guys go over that YouTube channel and subscribe to it there will be a card in this video and a link in the description but what I'm gonna be doing here is just having guests on talking about attack talking about programming pretty much anything that I can't fit into a shorter 10 or 15 minute video on this main channel I'm gonna be talking about on the podcast now it's a great opportunity for me to answer some of your questions talk to you guys about things that maybe aren't super tak in programming niche because that's what this main YouTube channel is about and talk about finance talk about investing talk about work ethic lifestyle the things that are really important that I think I have some valuable insight on but that I wouldn't really feel comfortable making like a 10 or 15 minute short video on this YouTube channel about so if you guys have any interest in that please do you go subscribe to that channel time out with Tim again this will be available on Spotify Apple music pretty much any platform you can think of it'll be available in audio format and I'll be taking some interesting clips from those podcasts and sharing them on my social media so if you just want the shortened version you know follow my Twitter follow my Instagram Instagram I believe its tech underscore with underscore Tim and the Twitter is tech with Tim with two M's so I'll just be sharing it on that LinkedIn as well you guys can follow me there but I'm really excited about this podcast I have a few really interesting guests lined up I have an episode going live I believe today if you're watching this video and it's just I think it's gonna be a great time and that is something that I'm really focusing on for this year is getting that podcast growing growing that podcast and just making it super valuable and super interesting to listen to so the next piece of exciting news I have for you is something called channel memberships so very recently I added a feature called channel memberships to the tech with Tim YouTube channel now essentially what this is is you'll see a little button it says join and if you click on that you'll have more access and you can watch my little promo video and read through what that actually means but the idea behind this is that if you'd like to you can support me on a monthly basis by paying a small subscription fee and gain access to exclusive content perks and benefits that nonmembers won't have now I want to make this clear anything if you're not a member right now and you don't plan on being a member nothing is gonna change for you there's nothing you won't see there's nothing you're gonna miss out on but the benefit of being a member is you'll get to shape and kind of change and choose the direction the tech with same YouTube channel goes in now what I mean by that is members people are supporting me are people that in my opinion are above and beyond they're like the superfans in my opinion so I want to make sure that I'm giving them value and posting videos that they want to see so I'm gonna have weekly maybe biweekly they'll depend on how many videos I'm doing at one time pulls on the community tab for only members where they'll be able to vote on what videos that I want to that they want to see next what series I should be working on and just anything that I'm thinking of doing if I have some random video ideas I'll post them on there and you guys can say hey yeah that's awesome I want to see that or no don't do that I wouldn't watch it and this feedback is really gonna help me pick what videos I'm doing what I'm working on next and making sure that I'm providing the most value possible to all of you especially the members now as a member you're also gonna have access to a custom emoji your little badge beside your name now that's gonna tell me and everyone else in the comment section that hey you're a member and to me what that means is I should try my best to answer your comment I should try my best to make sure I'm responding to you because again you're someone who's paying money each month to support me and that to me is invaluable so that's the idea behind this memberonly concept don't worry nothing's changing there's nothing explicitly exclusive to members other than those poles and the community posts that I've talked about and if you decide to be a higherup member so one of the higher tiers because what I just described applies to all members then you'll gain access to a discord role as well as early access to the release of my new videos so what that means is let's say I have a video that I have on YouTube ready to go live and it's sitting there for two or three days before it's actually posted to all of you if you remember you'll be able to see that immediately as soon as I upload that video to YouTube so this could mean you get to see a video 12 or 13 hours before I go live or this means you could get to see an entire series you know two or three weeks before the final episode is actually uploaded so take that into consideration if you do want to become a member I don't want to force any of you to do this there's nothing I'm gonna hold out and only give to members other than again the ability to kind of choose the videos that I'm gonna be posting on the channel and I really you know just say thank you in advance to anyone that decides to do that because it really means the world to me and to see people purchasing that which some people already have really shows me that hey you guys appreciate my content you appreciate what I'm doing and you know you've even decided to pay you know one or two dollars a month just to say an extra little thank you so those are the two big things that I need to announce what I'm gonna do now is talk to you a bit about me how my situation has changed a little bit due to kovat 19 and what my plans are for the summer just so you guys are aware so as you know I'm 19 fulltime university student I'm just about to finish so I'm in Canada about the GTA Area and all the schools here actually closed what that means is we've been doing remote University so no inperson classes so I actually moved back to my parents house now which is why I have this nice beautiful setup compared to my university room from before and I'm about to finish school so I've got three or four days left I'm gonna finish all my exams and then I'm gonna have about a three or four week period before I start at Microsoft as a remote for engineering intern now I'm really excited about this a lot of you been asking me are you still gonna be posting videos or you're still gonna be doing stuff yes guys of course I'm gonna be posting videos tech with Tim he's kind of my priority you know I don't shouldn't really say that I guess but it's what I'm always gonna be working on no matter what I'm doing I'm always gonna have some social media presence and posting things online so don't worry about that if anything Microsoft is gonna give me more content more advice more tips that I can share with you guys now other than that what I'm doing for the rest of the summer is just you know doing that doing the YouTube channel doing the podcast and anything else that comes up so if you guys have ideas for what you want to see on this channel maybe something different maybe like I do 20 or 30 videos where I work on a big project something like that let me know in the comments down below I'm open to all different kinds of things I think we've struck a pretty good balance between tutorial videos and kind of face to face advice videos but let me know what do you guys prefer something like this a video where it's more informal I'm kind of just talking you guys but advice or tips or like former tutorial videos all the time where I'm giving you no technical instruction and really teaching you how to do something I want to hear your guys feedback again thank you for everything that you guys have done for me subscribing for the channel liking the videos you know sharing the content it really does mean the world and I'm really excited to see where we can take this community in this YouTube channel in the future you know it wouldn't be out of my mind it wouldn't be crazy to me to be seeing tech with him hitting half a million a million subscribers by the end of this year and I can only tell you how many new and exciting things I'll be able to do with numbers like that so with that being said I hope you guys enjoyed if you did make sure you leave if they like subscribe to the channel and consider becoming a channel member to gain access to some as perks that I mentioned earlier
