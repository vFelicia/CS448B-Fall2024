in this video I will share with you five practical python projects that will help you develop the skills that you need to become a Python Master these projects are in a variety of different areas they go over many different topics and the point of this is that they will give you a very broad knowledge of python and make you very comfortable and competent working with the language each project that I put on this list will teach you a different skill it will be something practical that you could actually apply in the real world and you will learn a ton so without further Ado let's get into the video I encourage you to work on these projects and practice your skill just like I practice my skill of my sponsor Segways before we get started I need to thank lenod for sponsoring this video I've been using and working with lenode for nearly three years now and they've consistently been my goto choice for hosting my applications and servers in fact right now I'm using the node to host the official Tech with Tim Discord bot a website multiple of my domains and a kubernetes cluster now lenode was just recently acquired by Akamai and as a part of this acquisition they're going to be adding more than a dozen new data centers around the world in the next year lenode makes it super easy to spin up servers with their oneclick app Marketplace and have tons of written guides and YouTube videos on their channel to help you get started now if you're having any issues you can reach out to the 24 7 support team and actually talk with a real human being now the node's pricing is simple with no hidden fees and full transparency and you can test out the node services for free by using the link in the description and claiming a 100.60 day credit for any new accounts it's been an absolute pleasure to work with lenode over the past few years and one last thank you to them for sponsoring this video alright so I'll get into the project ideas in a second but I just want to mention that the ideas here are just that their ideas they're meant to be inspiration so please add your own creative touches think about ways that you can kind of change the project around make it more applicable to you I'm just trying to give you some inspiration here and give you an excuse to go work on a python project if you want some full python project walkthroughs you want some more help going through them then you can check out my course programmingexpert.io we have a bunch of projects on there hundreds of practice questions and that's going to give you a lot of resources if you're just trying to get better at python anyways let's dive into project number one which has to do with scripting and automation so python is one of the best languages when it comes to writing automation scripts command line tools and really anything that kind of manipulates files or folders or directories or does I guess like a repetitive human task so I'll give you a concrete example of something I built recently in Python that's kind of an automation tool so a lot of you know that I work for a startup right now and at that startup we have a few game developers now for each game they make there's kind of like a template that has some prebuilt components has a little bit of prewritten code some stuff that's going to be kind of the same for each game uh and you know some metadata files and some information that they kind of need to fill in now previously I had this big long like documentation sheet that said okay dude this this is this and it was like you know 10 steps to set up the game but there was always mistakes people were kind of forgetting fields uh and it just was time consuming right for them to go and read the documentation so I said you know what I'm gonna write a quick tool that will just kind of do this for so we have this template folder so what my tool does is you run it it asks you you know what's the name of the game what's the description what's all of the metadata required then it copies the template folder paste it change the name of the folder goes in fills in all of the metadata deletes any unnecessary files adds new files and just sets up the game so that it's pretty much click and run and then the game developer just goes into the folder writes all of their game development code and then we're good to go I know if they use that tool that everything's set up properly and there we are we've just you know done everything that usually would take them you know 20 30 minutes in about a 30 second kind of I don't know input to the script so those are the type of things I'm talking about for this first project they don't have to be overly complicated they can just be something that really makes your life easier and kind of does some file operation right there's some manipulation of things that usually you're doing manually that you could probably spend about an hour writing a script or they're just going to clean everything up and make it so that you're not going to make any mistakes and everything's going to be a lot faster another example here is to like clean up a bunch of temporary files or unnecessary files you could literally write a script that just deletes everything from your downloads folder that would be like 10 lines of code but now you just double click this rather than you know going into the downloads folder selecting everything deleting it I know it's okay it's gonna be you know five ten second difference if you do something like that but the point is python is really good at working with files it's very fast to write code when you're trying to do these kind of scripts so think about how you can automate some of the activities in your life and start creating basic Python scripts that do that if you can get familiar with the OS module the pathlib module you're going to feel like you have kind of superpowers when it comes to file operations manipulations searching for stuff on your computer and just going to make you a really good python developer alright moving on to project idea number two now this is going to be in the web development category now this again is one of the more practical things you can do with python building websites building rest apis building back ends that's what python is good at now I wouldn't necessarily recommend using python for building an entire front end although you can definitely create something that looks decent using something like Django or Flash and kind of sprinkling in a bit of HTML JavaScript CSS Etc but if you can build something with python that has an authentication system right that's going to be a really good learning experience and something that is going to look great on a resume so I'll give you a few ideas here for kind of Web projects to build with python that aren't massive but that are definitely worth doing and that will teach you a bunch of skills so the first one I'm going to give you here is to build a Twitter club now I know that might seem kind of intimidating at first there's a lot of stuff in Twitter but whenever you're building a social media clone if you actually take it kind of down to the Bare Bones like what are the absolutely necessary features it's pretty simple to implement these think about Twitter someone posted tweet you can reply to a tweet you can like a tweet you can retweet it really that's the core functionality that you need to have and then from there you go and you say okay I'm gonna add a profile where you view all of this user's tweets I'm going to add a search page where you can search for a user slowly you can add on a lot of features and this is a project you can work on for a really long time and shows a lot of skill if you're going to put this on something like a resume so the reason I would recommend something like this is that first you have to build your authentication system you have to be signing in users signing out users making sure you have unique usernames you're going to have to have a database you're going to have to associate data with users you're going to have to have a way to quickly search for users there's a lot of skills baked into a project like this and even though it's not necessarily original it's something you can put your own spin up for example I tried to create on a live stream a typing racer clone you guys know the game where you like type against someone and you're trying to do the fastest words per minute except rather than doing just regular sentences it was code so it's like a code racer game right I think that's what I called it um in the live stream I didn't end up finishing this project it was kind of a big project that I tried to take on in too short of a time but again another great idea you have the authentication system you're gonna have to have live socket States where people are actually interacting with each other in live time a lot of stuff to learn from a project like that and something that's great to talk about on a resume alright so the next project I have for you has to do with web scraping and data collection now for this project I recommend that you do something where you're grabbing a large amount of information either from an API where you're actually scraping a website and grabbing all of this data yourself that's probably the preferred approach but if you can't find a website that has the data that you want then maybe you go with an API that will kind of give all of it to you and then you take all of this data you parse through it you pull out the meaningful parts and then you display it in some kind of dashboard now in Python it is a bit difficult to create graphical user interfaces so you could do something simple like use map plot lib right and you can kind of set up you know charts or graphs or whatever you want to do with that or you could create a front end and actually display it on the front end if you have you know some basic JS CSS HTML skills so kind of up to you in terms of the display but I recommend having you know two distinct parts of the project where you have your data collection kind of parsing through the data cleaning it up knowing how to work with larger pieces of data Maybe use something like pandas maybe you're saving stuff in large Json files or databases and then you actually go and kind of display this and make it a bit Visual and graphical now in terms of a specific project I recommend you do something with GitHub so you can do something like a GitHub language tracker which is going to track all of the most popular programming languages based on I guess percentage of language in GitHub repositories I think that's how you would do that or you could do something where it shows you your commit history so maybe use the GitHub API you grab information about your commits your logging you know information about different pull requests you have open whatever you want to do but I would do something that's counter related to programming or a field that you're interested in and that way it's going to look good on a resume you can be a bit more passionate about it when you're kind of talking about it and if you do something related to GitHub then that's something that's a bit more practical I would say right because you can actually create a tool that will help you visualize okay these are all the issues I have open on GitHub these are all my pull requests I know that already exists but we're trying to work on projects here that build skills so using a bit of web scraping using different apis parsing that data displaying in a graphical format I think this makes a really good project and it's going to teach you a lot of great python skills alright so moving on to project four I have to do something related to game development now I know that python is not the best when it comes to game development a lot of people are probably going to hate on this because you're not going to create AAA game in Python anything you make in Python that's a game you're probably not going to put like on the app store or something like that right however doing games in Python for me is what really got me into programming it's what taught me a ton of skills and really I credit that to me even having this YouTube channel when I was younger I used to make so many games in Python because I just loved doing it I loved playing games I loved making the games and it was a really fun way for me to practice a ton of python skills so I would highly recommend to anyone here that you know maybe didn't like the other projects as much just wants to work on something solely for fun or as a hobby project make some games in Python they're really fun and they teach you a lot so I'll give you a few different kind of game development ideas and just by the way I would recommend to use a module like Pi game although there is a module pie monk which is pretty useful if you want to do like physics related stuff where um you know all the physics is implemented already so you have like bouncing gravity different shapes and objects I have a tutorial on my channel if you guys want to check it out anyways a few game development ideas I would make something like Battleship brick breaker Space Invaders Hong you could do Flappy Bird you could create like a Mario cup platformer clone you could make Pokemon if you wanted to do that there's all kinds of different things you can do and if you look up you know python game ideas you'll probably see a bunch from my channel you'll see a bunch of other really impressive games made in Python Now by working on a game you get a whole different skill set in terms of Designing a program laying out a screen all of the math related to like the geometry and how you do collision and how you implement uh you know like jumping writing gravity so you're actually applying oftentimes I find like some basic physics or math or trigonometry tree and it's cool because you're taking stuff that's not just programming and kind of implementing it into your code you also have to figure okay how do I spawn objects on the screen how do I reset a game how do I make this kind of scalable so I could add new levels or new objects it gives you in my opinion a decent perspective kind of program design and I think it's something useful that a lot of you could find some value in so moving on to my next project and this is to do something related to web 3. now I know a lot of people instantly hate when they hear crypto they hear web3 if you're one of those people I would say relax I'm not scamming you I don't have a coin to sell you I'm just trying to give some new ideas some things that are going to be interesting that is kind of you know relevant with the trends in Tech today so a lot of people are into web 3 and I think that it would be a cool idea to do something like querying the blockchain grabbing information about the most recent block you know graphing the trend in difficulty grabbing your wallet address and creating maybe even like a blockchain wallet you could do that in something like python you could create a blockchain wall it allows you to send ethereum receive ethereum them view all of your different transactions track the balance of your account over time there's a lot of cool stuff you can do with web3 just gotta open up your mind to the possibility that not all of this is a scam I know many of you watching that don't feel this way but anytime I talk about web3 I just get spammed in the comments with people like hating on it so I felt the need to add that in there anyways a ton of cool web3 projects I'm actually working with someone right now who has a really cool idea related it's like a web 3 lottery where he's kind of tracking all of the transactions that are being sent to an address and he's doing this cool kind of cryptographic math thing where he's rolling a lottery and sending a random amount of Bitcoin to a certain address I don't want to spoil his idea too much but there's a lot of cool stuff you can do and you can do this completely in Python which is what I'm doing with him alright so that did complete my five project ideas now I will add in a few bonuses here that I wanted to leave until the end and this is of course like machine learning data science there's all kinds of stuff you can do with machine learning and data science and python but I don't like including those as projects in this video because they are kind of a whole different field of programming and it's a very different skill set if you want to get into machine learning data science that's really a different career path than all of the other kind of projects that I just walked you through so of course you can do something like that it's obviously going to make you a better python developer to be working with machine learning models understanding how to analyze largescale data but again doesn't necessarily fit kind of the theme or topic of this video so with that said I will wrap it up here hope you guys enjoyed hope you found some inspiration and some project ideas let me know what you're working on in the comments down below and I look forward to seeing you in another YouTube video thank you
