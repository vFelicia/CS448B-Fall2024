now the next thing to talk about here is the fact that a lot of people jump into projects or start doing things and they have absolutely no idea what's involved in it they have no idea what they're getting themselves into now let's say this is specific to Python and you want to program neural networks and make machine learning applications come up with a plan and figure out if this is even possible to do with your current knowledge base because you don't want to be wasting your time trying to implement this crazy complicated algorithm or do this ridiculous thing try to figure out what you should be doing do some research make a plan and then that way when you start programming you'll have a better idea of what you need to do that's going to save you a lot of time from just you know checking and guessing and doing all that which happens all the time
