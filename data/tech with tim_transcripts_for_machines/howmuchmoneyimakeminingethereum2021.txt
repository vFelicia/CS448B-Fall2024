hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm gonna talk to you about how much my ethereum mining rig makes now also go through the specs of the rig show you a few photos of it talk about how i set it up in my house and some of the obstacles i faced when i did that then of course i'll go through the profitability so how much it makes how much the expenses are so in terms of power and electricity and all that kind of stuff finally i can actually show you my ethereum mining dashboard and you can see all of the overclocks that i've done and the software that i use to control my rig anyways let's go ahead and get started and i will talk to you about how much this rig makes but i do need to mention that something else that makes me money is the sponsor of

get started using algo expert today by clicking the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform all right so the first thing i'm going to do here is just tell you a bit of a story of how i actually acquired this mining rick so it was back in april of 2021 so about six months ago from today and one of my friends approached me he knew i had some experience with cryptocurrency and with mining in the past and he said hey i'm looking into buying an ethereum mining rig would you potentially want to join me do you want to get your own rig do you want to maybe split one with me either way the more money we can spend the more we can likely save because we'll get some type of bulk discounter deal or combo deal or something along those lines anyways i end up saying yes i end up figuring out that i can actually buy this in my business which means that i can depreciate the rig and that's really good means i can save probably actually a few thousand bucks over the lifespan of this rig and so i go ahead and you know buy a mining rig with him now what we do is we go on kijiji we look at the different prices of graphics cards and originally we're planning on just building the rig ourself i know how to build computers i have lots of experience doing this and building mining rigs in the past as well in fact quick tangent here back at the beginning of this channel so probably in like 2015 or 2016 this whole channel tech with tim was completely about cryptocurrency in fact you can probably find some old videos on this channel where i discuss cryptocurrency stuff so anyways just to you know prove the point i used to mine back when i was like 15 and 16 and so i was kind of excited to get back into that space because while i was at university and in shared living places i couldn't really have a mining rig but now that i'm in my own house it actually makes sense and i have a place where i can set it up so anyways we going kijiji we end up realizing that it's probably just going to be better to pay someone to make the rig for us they can go out they can find all the cards they can waste their time doing that we don't have to actually go and try to acquire like all of these different graphics cards which are really hard to find and this guy has all the other parts he's built you know tons of rigs he'll set up all the software for us and the time save was just definitely worth it so we find a guy in kijiji uh he builds rigs to order so what we actually have to do is tell him the type of rig that we want and he goes out and buys all the parts and then once it's ready he gives it to us we verify that he's legit and we both order a four times 30 80 rig from him so just a rig that has four 30 80 graphics cards in it and this rig he quotes us for 13 200 so each of us are getting one of these so in total our order is 26 400 this guy's completely legit he did a really really good job on building the rig we go pick it up from him bring it back home everything works everything went really smoothly and so yeah we were happy we had the rig and this is again like april 2021 so about two weeks later we both end up actually adding to the rig so i added a 30 70 to the rig this cost me about 1700 and so my rig now is about 14 900 canadian dollars i need to specify that everything that i'm talking about in this video is canadian dollars i live kind of in like the toronto area so that gives you a bit of context there okay regardless we get the rig set up everything's working and in terms of the setup what i did originally was i just put it in my basement so i have a spare room in my basement it's pretty large i leave the door open in there and the reason that's an important note that the door is open is because these rigs especially the ones with the higher end graphics cards like the 3080s or the 3090s generate a ton of heat like a ridiculous amount of heat if you go in the room where my mining rig is and i'll show you some photos on the screen here it's probably four to five degrees warmer than the rest of my house like no joke it's that warm and in fact in the kind of winter months so i guess april was still a little bit cold here it was actually kind of heating the basement for me and i guess you could say it was maybe saving me a little bit on heat but anyways point being it just is really really hot so that's an important consideration anyways in terms of the setup the first thing i needed to figure out was where i was going to put it so i did that i put in the spare room and then the second thing was how i was going to get internet to it so fortunately when i had moved into my house and i just moved in and marched about a month before i got this rig i'd actually preran a cat6 cable to this room now i use this cat6 cable or was using this cat6 cable to run an access point so i have an access point that i keep in the spare bedroom in my basement and so i only had one cable going there and it was being used on the access point but i knew that what i could do is just run that cable into a switch and then i could have two outputs coming out of the switch run one to the rig run one to the access point and i was all good hence why you're going to see this kind of like really jank wiring going on if those photos are showing up on the screen right now all right so that was problem two relatively easy fix in getting internet to the rig but then the third problem that i had was i wasn't sure if i was gonna have enough power in the area that i needed it so you might be a little bit confused by this but the rig that i have has a thousand watt and 850 watt power supply in it and under peak load the combined usage of the two power supplies is about 1300 watts and so that means that i can just barely get away with having a 15 amp circuit or using a single 15 amp circuit for this rig so let me clarify here in canada the standard circuits that are ran in your house are 15 amps which means you can do about 1500 watts a little bit less than that if you don't want to have the uh i guess what he called the breaker trip in your circuit panel but i wasn't sure if what was ran to that room was a dedicated circuit or not so if this was not a dedicated circuit what that would mean is that there might be other outlets in my house that are sharing the same 1500 watt maximum load and so i might have say four outlets all using the same circuit and so if my mining rig is plugged in and using 1300 watts and then i plug in something like a blender or i plug in something like a subwoofer that could fully trip the breaker and well that would be bad you wouldn't want to do that so i was fortunate that the outlet i had ran to that room actually was on a dedicated circuit this was here before i moved into the house so i wasn't sure and so when i plugged it in everything just worked all was good i was very happy because that meant i didn't have to do custom electrical work and run a 20 amp circuit to that room or just a dedicated circuit anyways point being that was all good very happy about that fingers crossed that everything is going to continue to work there but then what happened one day actually when i was live streaming some of you may have seen this happen is there was a power surge in my house and one of my power supplies actually blew up now it wasn't like a violent like explosion in my basement but i heard it and there was a capacitor that exploded inside of the power supply and so it completely ruined that power supply just was not usable anymore so i aura made it ended up getting a new one and then plugged in the new power supply and since then it's been good but because that happened i was really concerned that could potentially happen again so i went out and i bought two ups now a ups is an uninterruptible power supply i use them pretty much everywhere in my house i think i have like seven or eight of them here and the point of having the ups is that it's a battery backup and a surge protector for whatever you have plugged into it so each ups i bought was about 200 bucks so add maybe 400 bucks to the cost of my rig if you're including the ups's in it and they support 900 watts so that's why i had to get two of them because i couldn't find one that was affordable that was gonna do the entire rig anyways i get two ups's and the point of the ups is that it's a surge protector and battery backup so if the power does go out or does surge the battery and the ups will be able to support the rig for probably about 20 to 30 minutes and hopefully that's enough time for the power to be restored so anyways that is the general setup of my rig again i have it in this basement bedroom it has lots of airflow in there i have a bunch of fans connected to the rig too to make sure that the cards stay nice and cool i have all of the cards overclocked which i'll talk about in a minute and to summarize i have five cards i have four 30 80s one 30 70. the other components are not super important i have 1000 watt power supply one 850 watt power supply it's on a custom built frame so the guy that we bought the rig from actually designed and built that frame for us and then we have like a dual core processor four gigabytes of ram some motherboard that has six pci slots to support up to six graphics cards and one random ssd like a crappy shitty ssd that you use to run the operating system on so that is the setup hopefully that was not too long and you guys got the idea there and can see some of the photos but now let me actually head over to my dashboard i will show you how much money this rig has made me and then talk about some of the expenses with it all right so i'm actually in my hive os software here or hiveos dashboard which i'm going to talk about now i was going to do that later but i figured we'd just skip to it now so the software or the operating system that i use on my mining rig is called hive os this is free and what this allows you to do is actually control all of your rigs remotely from the web so right now i'm just on a website it's called hive os okay i've signed into my account and you can see here that i have one mining rig it's called four times rtx 3080. it actually has five gpus as you can see up top here but originally before i added the other gpu i called it this and i just didn't change the name point being though you can see we're hashing at about 449.3 mega hashes per second i have about almost 1300 watts being used so 1.277 kilowatts so that's about 1 300 watts and you can see the price per day in electricity is about 3 and 12 cents u.s so the figures you're going to see here are us but all of the figures i discussed previously were canadian it's annoying in canada we use canadian dollars and then everything shows up in us but you get the idea so there you go you can read through this i have five gpus this is my actual rig and this is called a worker so if i click into this worker here you can see we have all the graphics cards it shows what all of the cards are hashing at so my 30 80s are going at about 96 and my 30 70 is going at about 61. now if you're curious you can see what the fan speed and all of the overclocks are so we actually undervolt the core clock by negative 225 overclock the memory clock to 1800 and then the power limit is set at 230 watts for each 3080 and 130 for the 30 70. now you can also look at the load average of the physical computer itself so how much free space the free ram all of that kind of stuff not super important but yes this is the rig now i'm mining using something called the hive on pool now that is not super important but you can see my effective hash rate is 449.3 sorry not effective average hash rate is 449.3 uh and my effective hashrate is whatever is here and that will be changing as you know random things happen with the network okay so that's kind of the basics i mean there's not much more to go through here i could do a whole video on the software you can see there's all kinds of controls up here like i can change the fans i have this hash rate watchdog which means if the hash rate goes below a certain number it will actually restart the computer for me i can remote access i can look at power options so i could you know reboot shutdown whatever all this kind of stuff not super important not the point of the video but there you go okay so that is that now let's go and look at my profitability here which i think i can do by clicking on hive on pool all right so i'm here on my hive on dashboard this is where it actually shows how much money the rig has made now you can see here right away if we look at the numbers about 30 bucks a day but 215 us dollars a week and so far i have been paid about 7 200 us dollars now of course you want to convert this to canadian dollars to compare against the prices i gave you before but i do need to mention that these numbers are highly dependent on the price of ethereum in fact you should really probably only look at how much ethereum i've made because ethereum price changes all the time and so this number here tomorrow could be a lot more it could be a lot less so really you just want to look at the amount of ethereum which is almost to a theorem about 1.9 ethereum and this again is in a time frame of about six months okay so that should give you an idea now i will say that i've seen this number so for the daily earnings be about 50 us dollars that's the highest i've seen it and the lowest i've seen it has been probably 17 18 bucks now in all of these numbers you do need to factor in the price of electricity which is three dollars and 12 cents us that's what it's approximating it at it's probably a little bit higher than that because where i am electricity is pretty expensive but that is kind of the idea so really not much more i can say than that i will leave you by mentioning that you might be thinking that i'm losing money right now you might be looking at this and saying okay you've made about let's say 9 500 canadian dollars if you do the exchange rate maybe a bit less than that you paid about 15 500 if you factor in the ups's and so you are down right now about six thousand canadian dollars okay if you're looking at it only in that sense yes i guess i would be down six thousand dollars but you have to remember that my ethereum mining rig is still worth something so even though i paid for it fifteen thousand dollars right now if i were to sell it i could probably sell it for about thirteen or fourteen thousand dollars and so all i actually have to do whenever i'm mining ethereum and i have that rig is i have to make the difference in depreciation that's all i have to do and if you want to factor in inflation as well you can do that but the point is that if i simply beat the depreciation of my mining rig then i'm going to be generating some type of profit because the mining rig still has value and i can always sell it if i want to i'm not planning on selling the mining rig i would really like to you know break even by making that amount of ethereum but the point is that this is a very safe investment because of that let's say ethereum tanks in value and all of a sudden this is worth nothing okay that's fine i'll just go sell my mining rig i'll probably still make money because ethereum's probably not going to be to the point where 1.9 ethereum is worth less than you know 2 000 canadian dollars that would be pretty ridiculous and so hopefully that gives you kind of an idea of the business strategy here i'm pretty well guaranteed to just kind of win so long as i can continue mining ethereum and the value of ethereum is not going to tank to literally nothing all right so with that said that's pretty much everything i had for this video i don't really make cryptocurrency videos uh very often anymore i used to do them all the time but if you guys like this type of content please do let me know by leaving a like leave a comment in the description and maybe i will make some more in the future with that said hopefully you enjoyed the video if you did make sure to subscribe to the channel i will see you in another one
