so as the title of the video states i am joining a tech startup in fact i've already joined this tech startup but now it's completely official which is why i'm actually making this video i'm gonna be joining as the only engineer i'm gonna be responsible for building the entire product which is gonna be a mobile application the back end systems all of the automated testing and devops and all of this type of stuff and i'm very very excited i'm going to share some more details with you in just a minute however one thing i need to announce here and discuss which is highly correlated to this opportunity is that if you're watching this video right now the tech with tim youtube channel has officially hit 1 million subscribers now this is absolutely unbelievable i need to give a massive thank you to all of you for really making this goal and this dream come true and supporting me over the almost six years that i've been doing youtube even though i don't respond to all of your comments or necessarily acknowledge everyone subscribe to this channel i do read every single comment on this channel i've seen a lot of you guys for multiple years commenting on my videos being a part of this community and again i just need to give a massive thank you because really your support has genuinely changed my life now with that said i also have put a massive amount of work into this channel as i said almost six years ago i started this when i was in high school i really started to take it seriously when i was about 18 and got into first year university and at this point in time i have almost 750 videos almost 350 hours of recorded content on this channel and i have dumped just so much time into this uh in the past six years i've you know done probably thousands of hours worth of work this has really been my life and i have quite frankly grinded my ass off to produce youtube content for all of you guys and to hopefully set myself up for success going forward which at this point in time i'm quite happy with and i think i've kind of done so the reason i'm saying all this is because at this point in time i've been doing this for so long this has been something i've just been putting so much work sweat and energy into and i'm finally ready to kind of take a slightly different direction here in my career and in my life and do something more related to development as opposed to just filming youtube content all day so what that really means here is that i'm gonna be scaling back my efforts on youtube i'm no longer gonna be posting three or four times per week or coming out with kind of massive tutorial series i'm probably going to try to do one video a week and just take a bit of a break from this constant grind of youtube which i'm sure many of you are familiar with from kind of watching other content creators and move more into this startup position where i'm going to be writing a lot of code i'm finally going to be learning a lot more by actually applying all of my knowledge which is what i tell you guys to do on this channel all of the time and i'm hoping that once that startup kind of starts to take off if that does occur then i'll move back to youtube and take a lot of the knowledge that i've gained and kind of start teaching that again so really the point of this video is that i am taking a slight break from youtube i'm just going to be scaling the efforts back i'm going to be doing kind of my own thing here with this tech startup and i'm also going to be working a few other freelance things and kind of stuff behind the scenes because to just be quite frank with you guys i'm getting a little bit tired of just posting youtube videos constantly and sitting in front of the camera and filming this was something that at one point in time i really really enjoyed i loved doing and that you didn't even have to pay me to do i was doing it essentially for free when i started the channel i wasn't making any money at all but i've just gotten to the point where i'm feeling a bit burned out there is this kind of constant grind mindset trying to get views trying to get subscribers trying to make sure you're being consistent and it does really take a tear on you and honestly i'm surprised i've made it an entire six years so i'm gonna be scaling back a little bit and focusing on something else that i'm actually really excited about for the first time in a while so that's really what i wanted to talk about in this video i'm going to talk more about the startup now but i just want to let you guys know that i'm not going anywhere i'm still going to be posting i just think the format is going to be a bit different it's probably going to be more talking head style stuff as opposed to kind of indepth tutorials and again i'm doing that just to kind of recharge focus on something else that i'm a lot more excited about and then hopefully take again the knowledge i learned from working on this tech startup and bring it back to youtube and teach you you know within the next year or two years or something along those lines so to the tech startup here what am i doing for this company you know why am i excited about this etc so this is a very early stage company we're just out of kind of the seed fundraising round here it's pretty much a two or three person company at this point in time i am one of the largest shareholders here i'm not necessarily an employee i'm more of a cofounder in a sense although i'm not the majority shareholder of this company and uh yeah i'm gonna be joining as an engineer although i've actually kind of already been working on this for a few months and i'm going to be building out a react native mobile application so crossplatform for both ios and android as well as doing all of the backend systems all of the data analytics at least when we're starting out building out actually the entire user interface although i'll have people that will design the interface for me that will kind of hire in terms of freelance uh and yeah all of the engineering related tasks that's kind of my role for this company i've already been doing it and honestly i've been very excited i've been a lot more motivated to get up and to start working and uh yeah it's been really nice to work on a very large code base as opposed to kind of these smaller projects which is what i've really been doing on youtube right when i do youtube tutorials and programming maybe it takes me a day or two to prep i write out some code but beyond that i don't extend these projects i don't continue them on i never really see something all the way through and with this that's what i'm planning on doing and again that's why i'm very very excited to really be building something completely from scratch and pretty much alone now assuming this company does well we start generating some revenue bring on some investment then of course there will be other engineers we'll start to grow the business that is a long way away from here so just to take a quick tangent here as i start to end the video i just want to mention that this was a very difficult decision to kind of stop youtube or not necessarily stop but slow it down and move to something that is a lot higher risk right now i could just keep posting youtube videos a few times a week i'd be very comfortable i don't need to do anything drastic i'm essentially operating a company where i can project pretty uh accurately how much money i'm going to be making per month what i can make in a year it's just kind of operating it'd be just be doing the same thing and it's fairly safe at least from my mind and instead of doing that i'm kind of stepping away and moving into something that is much higher risk obviously a higher reward if it does go well but it has a very high chance of failure and the reason i did that is i just figured that this is kind of a great time in my life to take a risk like that if it fails i'll be fine i can always go back and post youtube videos i can always live off savings and passive income fortunately in a position where i don't need to be making tons of money right now and that was kind of my mindset in terms of of doing this so i'd love to hear what you guys think in the comments down below again a massive thank you to all of you for helping me reach 1 million subscribers i know it does seem a bit weird that once i hit this massive milestone i'm kind of taking a break and moving a bit away from it but for me it just feels like a really good point to kind of transition shift a little bit and move into something again that's very exciting and that i've been a lot more motivated to work towards as opposed to just kind of doing a very similar thing that i've been doing for the past few years so hopefully you guys enjoyed this content i know it's a bit different than what i usually post but i just wanted to be real with you talk to you about where my head is at and kind of what's going to be going on in the future if you do have any content ideas for me stuff you'd like to see kind of once a week a few times a month leave that down below and with that said i hope to see you in another youtube video you
