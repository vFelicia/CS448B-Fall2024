most freelance developers have no idea how much they should be charging and they miss out on thousands upon thousands of dollars by simply charging too little in this video I'm going to share with you exactly how much you should charge as a freelance developer I'm going to explain how you can justify that price and how you can adjust that depending on the client that you're working for now my name is Tim I've been a software developer for over five years I've done fulltime work freelance work I've paid freelance developers and I've gone from making about twenty dollars per hour to over 400 US dollars per hour when I do freelance and Consulting work I know that sounds insane but I promise you after you watch this video you'll understand why and how and how you can get to that same level so with that said let's get into the video after a quick word from our sponsor if you're like me then you look at your screen for 8 to 10 hours every single day making your monitor one of your most used items fortunately a few years ago I discovered Ben q and they've been my goto monitor brand since so much so that I teamed up with them and they've sponsored this video and are actually the official monitor brand of tech with Tim right now BenQ actually offers some really affordable monitors that are specifically designed for programmers under their GW line these monitors actually offer a coding mode which optimizes the contrast and saturation specifically for dark mode iCare technology USBC connection and a great quality display without breaking the bank these monitors come in 24 and 27 inch and are perfect for anyone looking to upgrade from a single laptop screen or a low quality display personally I use two 27inch gw2785 TCS for my secondary setup where I work off of my Mac laptop with one of them positioned vertically they've got speakers a microphone and best of all they offer BenQ Eye Care technology which automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen to make it easier on your eyes check them out from the link in the description and enhance your coding and efficiency today the first thing you need to understand as a freelance developer is that you are a business you may be the only developer in that business but you are a business that means that you need to maximize profits just like every other business that exists on planet Earth put aside the emotions you're not the nice guy helping out a friend you're not doing this as charitable work you're not doing it for fun or a side project you are making money keep that frame in that context whenever you get into any type of negotiation and you'll see immediately that you're going to be treated with a bit more respect and that you're gonna be able to demand higher rates now why is that the case well a lot of software developers are very nonchalant they're very relaxed they're developers after all right they want to sit in the basement they want to write code and they want to do the engineering work and that is definitely me but at the same time you need to put on that CEO kind of business hat act as a professional and go into a meeting with the idea that you're here to negotiate and you're here to figure out what the optimal exchange of value is between you and the business what you are doing as a freelance developer is you are providing value to a company or to an individual a client whatever it may be in return you're going to be compensated for that value so you need to understand how much value are you able to provide and then what percentage of that value are you going to take back as your compensation so let's give an example here when I was much younger 18 19 years old I would actually do homework assignments for friends or on sites like Fiverr so people would kind of come to me and say hey I have this python assignment I you know waited two days until it's due I'm not gonna be able to finish it can you finish it for me in that context I was only able to provide minimum value the reason for that is I'm working for a student this isn't something that's going to make them any kind of money all I'm doing is saving their grade and I'm saving them the time of completing the assignment so in that case charging 30 per hour or charging 100 or 200 for the project is a reasonable exchange of value because I'm saving them a bit of time and I'm saving them you know their grade or portion of their grade now let's switch the example up and imagine that we're working for a company that makes one million dollars per month in Revenue they sell some product or service they they have a checkout page that checkout page is poorly optimized you can go in there and optimize it fix some technical bugs and maybe that leads to five percent more people actually making it through the checkout process if that's the case you did probably the same amount of work that you might have done for another client but you were able to provide fifty thousand dollars worth of value in the first month right it's six hundred thousand dollars worth of value over the entire year in that context is it reasonable for you to charge twenty thousand dollars through that fix or twenty five thousand dollars sure it is you are only clawing back fifty percent of the value that you provided to the company from their perspective it's a nobrainer look at the ROI they just got a 200 Roi on their cost and a lot of times I'm gonna pay you until it's finished think of things like bug bounties why do they pay so much for that because the amount of money they get back from the work that you are doing is absurd so it's much more about the client that you're working for and the amount of value you can inject and provide then is what exactly you're doing or the technical skill that you have so always keep that in mind and go into your negotiation locations and meetings with the idea that you are going to figure out where you can provide the most amount of value you're going to ask the correct questions you're going to understand the type of business that you're working for and you're going to put that business and kind of CEO hat on and start the negotiation from a value proposition perspective all right so now let's dive into hourly versus per project pricing now in the majority of situations you're going to make more money if you charge per project and it's going to be a lot easier to charge a much higher rate because you're not breaking it down per hour typically you don't want to charge for your time you want to charge for your experience and the value you're able to provide however this is only the case if you have a very very welldefined project where the requirements are scoped out you know exactly what it is that you need to do and you draw up a great legal contract that defines exactly what you need to provide to be given that amount of money it also is important that you're taking a portion of that money up front and then you have some type of payment plan so you don't need to wait until the entire uh kind of finished product of of the project to get your payment this case even if the client's complaining about the final deliverable maybe you already have 75 percent of the income for the project and you're actually in a decent situation and you don't need to worry about maybe suing someone or going through a whole kind of massive process which can happen especially if you're a small freelance developer working for yourself so keep that in mind with Project based pricing you want to have the project very very well defined this cannot be something where it's like oh we need to build this and they don't tell you exactly what you need they should be defining the requirements and you should have a strict list of exactly the deliverables that you need to provide and what is going to be the criteria for success for completion if you hit those you need to get paid and you need to get paid throughout the project right so if you're not getting paid you know that 50 payment up front or whatever you want to charge you don't start work very very important you do that to protect yourself now for hourly this is going to work in much more Dynamic flexible situations where you're not sure exactly what work you're going to be doing or how long it's going to take if that's the case you're going to pick an hourly rate which we'll get into in one second and you're going to track exactly what you do in those hours and you're going to make it clear at the beginning through a written legal contract what it is that you're expected to do in the hours that you're working most important thing especially as you get into higher rates here guys is that you have everything on paper even if it's emails you need to have everything in writing there's no handshake deals here I can't tell you how many times that has gone very poorly for myself and for people I know get it in writing alright so now let's talk about actually picking your price first of all when you're pricing for a project this is going to be preferred you're probably gonna make more money this way and it's going to be a lot easier to justify a much higher rate so when possible do Project based pricing however again make sure you're protecting yourself and you have it very very well defined exactly what it is that you need to deliver so you know that you're not going to be working essentially for free to do something you didn't originally agree upon okay so if you're doing this it's pretty much exactly what I told you you're going to determine the amount of value you're able to provide and you're going to take a percentage of that back in compensation let's say we're making a website let's say the website reasonably will allow the company to make ten thousand dollars per month maybe they convert 100 users on the website that each pay them 100 bucks in this case is it reasonable for you to charge them ten thousand dollars or five thousand dollars to the website yes that's reasonable because they're gonna make that back in one month or two month or two weeks however you want to figure it out okay so that is a very reasonable way to charge for project now when you're charging per hour it becomes a bit more difficult typically what you're doing is very Loosely defined you don't have a deliverable and it's much harder to say hey I'm gonna provide this or this is the tangible finished product so here you're typically going to go with some industry standard rates which I'm going to share with you now and I'll talk about how you can bump those up all right so if you're in entry level or Junior developer this means you're really just getting started out you don't have advanced technical knowledge you can't do everything yourself you're really going to be doing smaller tasks scripting stuff and working for people that don't have any coding experience right if this is the case there's a lot of competition for what you're doing and you're probably going to be in the 25 to 50 per hour range with that said if you have a specialty in a specific Niche you know a module really well you know something that not a lot of other people in your industry know then you can bump this right up and you can charge slightly more but I would say for most of you you want to try to be charging 35 to 40 dollars per hour as an entry or junior level developer also remember if you're doing this on a contract basis and you're working for one company a lot they're not paying you benefits they're not paying you payroll tax so whatever someone would be getting paid as a junior or entry level developer at that company you should be making more on an hourly basis than they are you don't have job security you don't have benefits you don't have any of that stuff so if the developers are making 30 bucks an hour you should be making 40 okay that's what you want to think about maybe even charging more now midlevel developers right this is probably where most of you will fit in I'd recommend you're charging around 100 per hour 50 to 100 again depends is exactly on what you're doing a really good rate 75 80 85 90 an hour go look at job postings most fulltime software Engineers are going to get paid around a hundred thousand dollars per year maybe eighty thousand dollars per year in the United States again depending on where you live so if someone's making 80k per year what does that work out to 40 50 bucks an hour something like that I don't know what the exact rate ends up being so if that's the case you probably are charging 65 70 75 dollars an hour again you're going to be above whatever the kind of fulltime salary hourly pay equivalent would be you're probably going to be working less hours and you're not going to have all the benefits and all that other stuff lastly senior developers now this is where it gets a little bit insane this means you're capable of doing probably everything that the company needs whether that means you do it yourself or you have other people up to you but you're going to be charging anywhere from 100 to really it's kind of infinite but usually 200 or more per hour a lot of times at this point I am really considered a more senior developer now I start charging at a hundred dollars an hour and I'll only do a hundred dollars an hour if I'm building a longterm relationship with a company if it's something where I'm only going to be working 10 hours 20 hours swimming along those lines I'll usually bump it up to 300 400 per hour so that the company understands hey yeah it's a really high rate but I'm only working 10 hours so you're only gonna have to pay me Max 4K okay this is another thing to keep in mind your rate will depend on the number of hours projected that you're going to be working if you're working for a company you're only doing five hours whatever the rate is you'd normally charge double it or triple it because you're only getting five hours from that company and you're not getting any kind of relationship you're not getting any other benefits you may get if you're doing more hours with that company there's no consistency there's no reliability right whereas if a company is promising you minimum 20 hours per week or something then your rate's going to be slightly lower because you have that security of income so that's what I like to consider when I'm picking the hourly rate but none of you should be charging less than 25 US dollars per hour especially if you live in the United States and keep in mind that even though you're competing with a lot of other people here here you are the professional you are the business person you're gonna get it done you are a legitimate business right you're doing freelance software development you're not just another dude on Fiverr you're someone who's gonna respond who's going to be professional who's going to get the work done who's going to hit the standards and meet the requirements if you can do that you're already above 90 of people and your rates are based on really what you can do and the amount of value you can provide it's not based on the competition in the market no one comes to me and asks for consultation and says oh well this guy only charges 300 they come to me because they know I'm capable of doing it and they want me to do it so I get to pick the rate right that's the position you want to be in obviously that takes time but I'm just trying to give you the full perspective here on how you can really make it as a freelance developer all right last thing here a few extras to consider first of all always have something in writing as I said Consulting agreement freelance agreement whatever you want to call it get a lawyer write it up for you pay the few hundred bucks use it as a template in this agreement Define first of all maintenance and a warranty period okay especially if you're doing a big project you want to say hey if there's any critical issue something that was my fault that I did wrong I will go in there and at no extra cost I will go fix that for you now you can write a specific criteria for what is going to be under warranty right just like any product or service that you buy you typically have a warranty if you're a legit professional here you're going to have a warranty on stuff that you're providing as a freelance developer beyond that maintenance or additional changes a lot of times clients are going to say hey can you fix this can you change this can you add some tax or make this image larger whatever something that wasn't originally in the required scope of work if you want if it's a small thing go ahead and do it for free but typically I will put in a maintenance hourly rate that means hey once all of this is finished if you want me to go do maintenance on this site this means I'm going to charge you 100 per hour for maintenance or whatever it is that you want to pick for the maintenance rate now if you end up doing a lot of extra work you probably want to draw up an additional Consulting agreement where you're doing you know a new set of features a new set of very strict requirements and maybe you're charging a flat fee for that additional work all right lastly licensing and intellectual property very important and oftentimes overlooked if you're providing software for someone it's going to be implied that they own the software and they own the code but you want to put this in writing and they're going to want this in writing a lot of times so you need to be very clear that whatever it is that you do is their property if that's the way that you want to set it up now there's all kinds of other things licensing models etc etc sorry but you want to be very clear what is the company's intellectual property what is your intellectual property and what are you licensing or allowing them to use or what do they own once this work is finished okay I'm not a lawyer so I don't want to talk about this too much but look at that pay a lawyer trust me it's worth it get those Clauses in there and very clearly Define especially anything that you have that you don't want to potentially be stolen by a company let's say you use a proprietary piece of software that you've ridden yourself that you use for all these different companies for all your freelance work well it's reasonable that a company might actually say hey well you did that while we were paying you per hour to work on this product that's ours we own that piece of software so you want to make sure you exclude that specifically so there's no question that any internal tools or software you write for your own use is not owned by that company anyways that's going to wrap up this video I
