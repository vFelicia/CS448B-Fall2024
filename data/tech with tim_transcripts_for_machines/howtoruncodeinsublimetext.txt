hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to show you how to run code in sublime text this is a question i get asked all the time so i figured i'd make a short quick video and demonstrate how to do that with that said let's go ahead and dive in alright so i'm here in sublime text i have it open in front of me and right now i just have a folder open with a very simple python file so i have import sys and then i'm just printing out the version of the python interpreter that's being used to run this code and then i'm printing out hello so that's the very basic setup for me at least if you want to run some python code but for you guys i'm sure many of you want to run other types of code so don't worry the stuff i'm going to show you in this video will apply to other languages as well but i'm just going to do all of the demos using python all right so how do we run code in sublime text well in sublime text we have something called a build system and we kind of perform a build and a build is just really executing your code so the way you see all of this stuff is you can go to tools and you can see that we have build system and then we have build we have build with we have build results save on all build this is all of the stuff related to actually running your code anyways go over build system and you'll see that you should have automatic checked now if you don't have automatic check you should check that but you can see all of the builtin build systems that sublime text has so if you're using any of these languages here and you have the correct interpreter or compiler already installed on your system and that's available on your system path i'll describe what that is in a second then these build paths or build systems should just work so for example if i go here to python and i select this i don't need to select it i'm just going to select it to show you now the way that i would run my code is i would do control b on my keyboard or command b on your keyboard if you are on mac or you can press the f7 key and f7 will run your code so we'll open up kind of the console here and you can see the output of your code tells you how long it took now to close this window you press escape and again to run this it's ctrl b or command b or f7 or function f7 if you're on mac or linux that is how you run this code now for some reason that doesn't work for you there's a few different things you do to try to fix this first of all if you're using something like python when you install python or if you reinstall python make sure you add this to your system path now the system path at least on windows can be accessed by going to your environment variables so just type in environment variables or env in this case in the windows search bar it'll bring you to something that looks like this and then what you can do is go to your path you can press edit and you can add the direct path to where your interpreter compiler whatever it is may be so in this case you can see that i have python38 python38 in my path so that means i'm actually able to type the command python and run the python executable i'm not going to get too far into this but that is the reason why for some of you this won't work because you don't have python or whatever interpreter or compiler you're trying to use added to your system path now if you don't have it added to your system path don't worry you don't need to add it but to do that you would press new and then type in the actual path to where the executable file is but if you don't want to do that the way that you can fix this is by creating a new build system so what you can do is go to tools here in sublime text and then you can go to build system and new build system now i'm going to show you how you make a new build system so what i'm going to do is save this file first of all it will bring you to this kind of user directory so you want to be in the user directory don't change the directory when you save this file and you want to call this file something whatever the name of the build is dot sublime build so in this case i'm going to add a path for my python 3.9 interpreter so i'm going to say python39 good and then this is dot sublime hyphen build it's very important that you have this extension if you don't have this extension it's not going to show up as a potential build system and then you can name this here whatever you want so i just named it python39 good okay so let me save this and now i'm going to show you what we actually need to type in here to be able to execute some code so what you want to do is have cmd right here so this is your first kind of key inside of this json or dictionary or whatever you want to call it and then what you want to do is the following you want to have a list you want to put the name of the command that you want to run so in this case i want to run python and then you want to put the file that you want to run this command on now in this case you're just going to do dollar sign file this stands for run the current file so right now what i've done is i've said okay when i run this build system right here in my terminal i want to run python space and then whatever the name of the file is that's what this does if you have multiple commands that you want to run then you separate them by commas right and they'll be separated out on the same line hopefully that kind of makes sense but that's what this build system will do so i'm doing python and then the name of the file now in my case this python the python interpreter that i want to run is not added to my system path and so python like this is not going to work what i actually need to do is give the direct path to where this python interpreter is so i'll show you but if you go here look i'm on my c drive and notice i'm in a folder called python39 so python39 right here and then what i have is well my python interpreter this python right here that's what i want to access so what i'm going to do is copy this path and then i'm going to go here i'm going to change this to a forward slash and then i'm going to put another forward slash between python so this is actually the executable file i want to run it's in my c drive in the python 3.9 folder it's called python okay and then i want to run the file so this will separate this with a space and just run that now that we have that the next thing that we need to add here is our selector so we're going to say selector and then this is going to be equal to in my case python dot and then source or sorry other way around this will be source dot python now what this means is to automatically select this build path for anything that has python code that's kind of what the selector says now what i will do is leave a link in the description to the documentation for how you create a new build system so you can read through it and see all the specifics but this is the basics here on how you would do something for a new python build path anyways now what i'm going to do is go back to test.pi and show you that now that i've saved this if i go to tools i go to build system i now have this python 3 9 good as another build system that i can use so now if i select that and i run this notice i'm getting 3.9.7 whereas previously if i just go back here to automatic and i run this i'm getting python 3.8.3 so i'm changing what's being used to execute this python code so let's go back here and i'll select python 3.9 good okay so that's pretty much it for running code in sublime text now the last thing i'll show you is how you cancel a build so sometimes you have an infinite loop or you just want to exit the build at some point in time there is actually a shortcut you can use to do that now i'm not sure what the builtin is because the builtin shortcut i overrode but i'll just show you how to override it and then how you can see what the shortcut is so we're going to do is go to preferences and then keybindings okay when we do this it's going to open up this large thing like this now if you go in here you can see what all of the key bindings are and what they do so you can kind of scroll through here and try to find what it is you're looking for however on the right hand side of the screen we have any of our custom key bindings so in this case i have one custom keybind and this is ctrl shift c and what this does is cancel the build so what you can do is add this in to your custom keymap okay and then you can just make this whatever you want so i've made this ctrl shift c but just keep this exact same format so you want your open curly brace keys colon and then whatever the key is then you're going to have command and then cancel build and this will cancel build so in this case it's ctrl shift c for me so that means if i want to cancel my build let's just do a infinite loop here so let's go while true print test okay i'm going to run this so now if i want to cancel this ctrl shift c and notice it cancels my build okay so that is pretty much all i had to show you i apologize if this doesn't necessarily work for all of the languages that you were looking for but hopefully this at least gave you kind of a little bit of a head start into how you can run some code again the trickiest thing here is going to be creating this file if you need one you just need to actually figure out the path to the interpreter or compiler you want to use and then you're going to have to choose the right selector i'm not sure what all the selectors are off the top of my head that's why i will leave the documentation in the description alright so with that said i am going to end the video here i hope this was helpful and i look forward to seeing you in another youtube video
