hello and welcome back so in this video I'm just gonna be teaching you one more operator that I forgot to mention in the last video and we're gonna be talking about getting input from the user using something called a scanner now this scanner is going to allow us to grab like text numbers strings all that fun stuff from the user and then do something with that input and that's kind of the basis of programming right based on what a user does we want to do something in most cases so the first thing that we're going to do is just teach this other operator it is the remainder operator it's not gonna take me very long this case I'm just gonna say int X is equal to 56 modulus and this is what the name of the operator is modulus it's simply a % pick a number in this case I'm gonna pick five okay so what this remainder operator does it's called modulus okay some people like to call a remainder operator and it's simply a % gives us the remainder of this division so this division is actually equal to would equal to 56 divided by 5 should give us 11 okay 11 remainder 1 is what this division actually is equal to so if we print X we should get a value of 1 and there we go and that's literally all your remainder operator is gives you the remainder of a division I don't think I need to talk about it too much more I'm sure you guys want to get into the input so I will leave that alone for now ok so let's get rid of this line and now let's talk about how we can get input so using a scanner is what we're gonna do so well first thing we need to actually do is at the top of your program you might notice I have a new line here now this says import java.util.scanner I need you guys to type this out for me Java util dot scanner make sure you add your semicolon because this is what we're gonna be using to get input and whenever we use certain tools in Java we need to import them at the top of our program so that we can simply just type like certain dot types and we'll get into this later when we talk about classes and methods and all that stuff ok so once we've done that we need to set up a new scanner object so we're gonna type scanner the name of our scanner I'm just gonna say SC is equal to a new scanner and inside of the scanner we're gonna type system dot okay in this brackets this might seem confusing but all this is doing is it's saying scanner is a dab type just like string as the data type just like boolean is data okay it's a different type of data type but it is in a data type its name is SC and instead of typing like 1 or like putting quotation marks and typing a string we're gonna say what's equal to a new scanner and what this scanner is gonna be is system in which means typing on your keyboard and there's different types of scanners which we'll get into later not in this video so once we've set up our scanner we need to actually use the scanner so how can we do this so what I'm going to type now is I'm going to say let's say a string scan is equal to SC dot next and I think we can just use next yeah so what this does is we're creating a new variable string it's called or it's a string type called scanned it is gonna get the next stream of input from this scanner object okay so SC dot next is what allows us to get a string from the user so I'm just gonna print out scans after we get it because I want to show you what happened so I'm just gonna run the program in Illustrator and we'll talk about it so now you can see if I go down here my cursor shows up and I'm able to type this cuz when type below okay watch would watch REMS when I hit enter it prints hello underneath it so hello which we typed in was the input it got scanned in by this scanner object using SC next it got stored in the variable scanned and then we were able to print scanned out to the screen okay pretty straightforward that's how it works with strings now watch this if I type 1 1 works fine but I just need to show you that now I'm gonna do this within Takai so I'm gonna say int scanned equals SC next well what's what's happening what's wrong well the issue right now is we are trying to turn a string which is got which is what this returns to us into an integer so we can't actually do that because what per say no way I would proceed we just run into an error we cannot convert from string to because what this method gives us is a string now if we wanted to be able to get an integer from the user for them typing in we have to use a another method okay and this one is called next it now you can see we're getting no more red lines everything seems to be working fine SC next int and if we run this then we type like 54 that works fine prints that out for us what would happen so if I try to type in something like hello so there's no errors right now like job is not telling us there's anything wrong if I type hello we get an issue now that's because this was expecting me to type in a integer and what happens in here like this little line of code what it actually does is it tries to convert what I'm typing in which automatically comes in as a string into an integer so when it tried to do this it tried to convert hello into an integer and no one not you not you not you or me knows how to convert hello into an integer so it threw us an error and said no that's not allowed you can't do that so I'll show you what we can do now if we want to get boolean x' and other types and i'll show you a way to work around an error like this okay so if we want to get a boolean value we could type boolean scan equals next and when you look at this boolean that's literally the name to get a boolean SC next boolean okay so let's run this now note a boolean has to be true spelled correctly at for false with lower cases I'm pretty sure so true that works fine but if I try to type like hello or if I or something in there that's gonna crash it's gonna give us an issue okay so boolean lets you do that one if you want to get a double you can do double equals next and guess what this one is next double there you go and now it's gonna expect a number of some sorts like six we work fine but I'm gonna do six point three and it prints out six point three let's actually just test 686 yeah it just gives us six point oh so that works fine okay I'm two getting doubles now I want to work around the issue of what happens like we get that crash okay we don't we don't want that crash so how can we fix that if per se when it's expecting a double I type in like hello well what we should do is always get a string so we should always say SC done next and always turn this into a string and that because a string can be anything like anything we type in here is fine to be a string because remember a string is simply anything in double quotation marks so if I type true although yeah we know it's a boolean it's in the quotation mark so it's really string okay if I type one that's a string type one point six it's a string anything can be converted into a string pretty much so that works fine for us now once we have it as a string we can then convert it into an integer so I had to say a quick cut there but what we're going to do now is we are going to attempt to convert this value into a different type so in our case I want to convert it into an integer so a way that we can do that is we first need to set up a variable so I'm gonna say into X in this case is equal to scant now I need to put something with this scan I can't just say int x equals scan I can't I can't just do that it's not just gonna be able to convert that for me it doesn't know how to do that so what we need to do here is actually do dot and or certainly it's type here integer dot parse int okay and then inside of the brackets for parse int we're going to put scanned and what this is going to allow us to do is well convert into an integer and if you guys just highlight over this if you don't know what it does it you can actually read through the definitions in this case it's gonna say parse is the string argument as a signed decimal integer the character in the string must be all decimal digits except the first character may be an ASCII minus sign okay so we can tell you it tells you exactly what this does it tells you what integer does integer is a class so yeah it they'll convert that for us so then I find one two print X to the screen that would work fine now the thing is though and this is what we're gonna be doing the next video is we still run into the same issue because again like now if I type something like Hello we still get a crash because how do we can convert hello into an integer well we should really first check if the value is an integer and I'm gonna be showing you in the next video I believe the next one were the one after that how we can actually do that using if statements and else statements and error caching later on so stay tuned for that but this is the way for right now you know you're gonna be getting an integer that you can convert it in or obviously you could just do next int and turn this to an int like that and everything works fine for you anyways that has been it for this video and again in the next video we're gonna be going over conditional statements and then probably will be going into if analysis the one after that anyways if you guys enjoyed it as always please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next video
