so step number one is to get a general overview or summary of what you're about to learn now what I usually do for this is find someone who's kind of an expert in the topic that I want to learn and watch a half an hour video from them or maybe go through kind of like 20 or 30 minutes of some documentation or a book or something along those lines and just try to get a general sense of what it is that I'm learning kind of some key information and points about this topic and then hopefully get a sense of kind of what's possible what I plan on learning what I don't want to learn that's what I like to do it just gives me a really kind of decent picture of what's about to be happening what I'm about to be learning and I find it helps me to retain information especially as I move on to step number two
