hey guys welcome back to another YouTube video today's video I'm gonna be showing you how to install PI game for Python on Windows so this is Windows 10 right now this will work in Windows 8 but if you're using an earlier version of Windows so Windows 7 or Windows XP you're gonna have to find a different tutorial for this because some of the things I do aren't going to work in that version ok so let's get started right away the first thing you need to do if we haven't done so already is download Python so I assume most of you already have Python downloaded but if you don't just go ahead and head over to the Python website slash downloads and then download Python 3 point 6 point 3 or whatever the latest version is when you're doing this tutorial so I'm just going to go ahead and click on this and we'll go through it here so now that this is loaded up if you haven't already installed Python you're just going to want to make sure you click on this check button here it says add pipes on 3.62 path now this is really important and this is gonna save you a lot of time later on if you do this if you add to the path ok otherwise if when you installed it you didn't add to the path I'm gonna show you guys how you can edit the path and you can add it in so you're gonna be able to do what I show you next okay so I actually already have this installed so I'm not gonna install it here but if you don't then just go ahead and click install now it's very simple you can go through the process okay so now that we've done that I'm gonna show you how we can install pieing so the first thing we're gonna want to do is open up our command prompt so this is our first test just to see if this works and if this doesn't work then I'll show you the next step later so we're just gonna start by typing pip soapy IP now you should see something like this come up if you don't don't worry just wait a little bit later I'm gonna show you how we can get this to work so if this didn't work for you you might get some an error that says pip is not a recognized command on Windows or something like that and I'll show you how we can how we can fix that so now if this worked for you well you get all you have to do now to install a PI game is pip install PI game just like this and pip is pretty much package installer for Python and it's built into Python if you added that to the path so if you do that pip install PI game then it should start collecting everything and installing it so here we go it says it installed PI game correctly so now I'm just gonna uninstall just so I can show everyone else how to do it properly okay so if that didn't work for you don't worry if it did work for you can just click off the video now and it should everything should be working in PI game alright so now let's say that didn't work that pretty much just means that the path for Python is actually not in your environmental variables so what we need to do is we need to get to those environmental variables so a way to do that is to just simply go to control panel so we can just search that in the bottom here control panel load that up here and we're gonna click on system and security we're gonna click on system again and then advanced system settings on the left side here and now once that comes up you should be on the Advanced tab and you're gonna click on environmental variables right here all right so now we're gonna scroll down until you see something that says path so here you can see if I drag my window boat mine's pretty long that's just because I have three different paths now yours is probably only gonna have one thing in it it's probably just gonna have this Windows apps path it's not gonna have the python path if that other thing didn't work for you so now we want to change this because we want to add something to this path so you're gonna click on edit and it's gonna come up and it's going to show you these three different paths right here now you may have one you may not have any so let's say you don't have any of them here then what you need to do is you need to make a new path by just clicking on new and simply calling it path like that and then you can type in the directory which I will show you in this next step okay so say we have this path already we click Edit and now you have one thing in here what we need to do is we need to add the location of where your Python is saved on your computer so you should know where it's saved this is the default location where I have it so in opt out of local programs Python and then Python 36 that's where my python is saved if you don't know where yours is you can just go to Windows Explorer here and just search throughout your whole C Drive for it it might take a second depending on how fast your drive is you search Python like that and just wait for it to load up it is gonna take a minute but it will show you where the Python directory is so you can type that into the path like that all right so now that we know where our Python directory is all we have to do is click new and then you can simply type it in so for example I already have mine here but you do see drive slash users slash and then so on filling in your Python path so that it should end like this with Python and then python 36 so I'm just gonna delete that one cuz I don't need that alright so once you've done that now you're gonna type the exact same path again so you're gonna click new and you're gonna do the exact same path you just typed in which would be this one here except you're gonna do slash scripts and then another slash at the end so this is just so that we can use the Python package installer and you have access to Python so you have two different paths which are gonna be in your command prompt okay so again I'll just go over that quickly because we weren't kind of fast all you need to do is find the location of your Python so the directory on your C Drive D Drive wherever it is type that in so you just click new like that and type it here and then you're gonna do the exact same path except you're just gonna add scripts to the end and you're gonna hit new again when you do that so you have two separate paths and they should look something like the two I have up here right now once you've done that you're gonna click OK and ok again at the bottom and now we're gonna go back to our command prompt to make sure that this all works so now you go to command prompt and we'll do the exact same steps I showed before you just type pip install pygame like so it should grab it and install it and it doesn't take very long just like that now if you want to verify that your thing is actually working your PI game is working you can go ahead and open up IDL e which is Python which you just installed wait for that to load up so I got mine over here and then all you have to do is just type import PI game like so and if you don't get an error message that means everything's working and you successfully installed PI game alright so that has been this video for today I know a lot of people have been having trouble installing PI game they think they have to go to the website to download the wheel file you may have to do that but if you followed everything I did in this tutorial it should work for you and if you're having trouble adding the things to the path you can always just reinstall Python and click Add to path and it'll do it automatically for you so you don't have to go through that whole process alright so if you liked the video and it helped you out
