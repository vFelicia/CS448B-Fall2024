now I typically recommend that people that are diving into machine learning and Ai and actually want to understand what's going on should have a understanding of linear algebra basic calculus like something you'd take in grade 12 or first year university and then probably understand things like matrices vectors multidimensional math and just be generally speaking okay at reading like mathematical notation and comfortable kind of digging into it a little bit I'm not telling you you have to be a math whiz I am not a math genius myself but I did go through two years of math courses in University these were the computer science math classes and that helped me tremendously when I was learning machine learn so if you don't know the math it's fine you can still continue here but I will warn you it's going to be much more difficult to really grasp what's going on and I'd highly recommend you don't skip this if you have access to these kind of math courses
