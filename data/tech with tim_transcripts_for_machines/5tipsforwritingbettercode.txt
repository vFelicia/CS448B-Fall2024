are five tips for writing better cleaner code tip one is to plan before you start writing your code come up with some kind of idea of what you want to do and think about in your mind how you're going to split everything up into different logical sections number two is to split up large complex blocks of code into multiple functions where each function describes exactly what it's doing step three is to reduce your levels of nesting don't have 20 if statements inside of each other try to reduce that as much as you can it makes your code much more readable and easier to understand next you want to use good names for your variables functions classes Etc make them as descriptive as possible even if they are a little bit verbose lastly stay consistent that means if you use something like snake case for your variable names always use that for every variable name whatever you decide make sure you use that consistently throughout your program so your code is clean easy to understand and consistent
