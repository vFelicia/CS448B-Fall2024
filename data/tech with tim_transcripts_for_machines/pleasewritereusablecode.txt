now this is pretty straightforward and intuitive but we want to make sure that whenever we're writing code we're thinking about how we can make this code AS reusable as possible rather than writing say a super specific function that does one thing really well but only works in maybe one specific implementation maybe we spend a little bit of time and make it a bit more General so we allow it to be reused in different contexts right oftentimes you're making a small sacrifice up front so that later on your code is a lot more reusable and you're saving a ton of time because now you don't have to go back and understand this code rewrite this code you're going to thank yourself because the code you wrote before is just more reusable
