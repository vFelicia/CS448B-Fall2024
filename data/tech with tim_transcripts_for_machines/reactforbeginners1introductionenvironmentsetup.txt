hello everybody and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on react now in case you're unfamiliar with react this is a frontend web framework that is used to build user interfaces it is powered by javascript and i actually believe that this was created and is currently maintained by facebook and the entire library to my knowledge is open source now react is just a super popular and really good thing to know now in 2021 it allows you to kind of make more advanced websites and to go beyond really simple user interfaces and make user interfaces that have a lot of logic behind them now just bear with me for this short introduction here i'm just going to talk about some prerequisites kind of for this tutorial series and what you can expect to learn by the end of it so as i said react is powered by javascript so it's going to be a really good idea to have some javascript knowledge before going through this i'm not going to be explaining any super basic syntax like functions if statements anything like that i'm going to assume you have some familiarity with javascript and you've used it before with that said if you don't i do have a tutorial series on javascript i will leave a link to that in the description now throughout these next videos there's probably going to be about 15 of them i'm going to show you all of the core and important concepts of react so that's going to include stuff like components and jsx props styling state i'm going to show you about events forums how we can display data i'm going to talk to you about setting up a very basic json server talk about hooks use effect fetch http react router reducers all of that kind of stuff really the core aspects of react now if you don't know what any of that stuff means don't worry obviously i will explain it in depth i'm going to try to keep these videos relatively short and kind of just pack in one topic in each video now throughout this series we'll be actually building a project to learn all of this the project we're going to be working on is an inventory management system this is going to be pretty straightforward but we're going to be able to add items to the inventory search items in the inventory and then obviously display those items on the screen and kind of look at details related to them all right so with that said let's get into the first video here what i'm going to show you how to do is set up our programming environment download our editors download node.js and all of those things that we need so the first thing we're going to do here is we're going to go to our web browser and we need to install the following visual studio code node.js and then the react developer tools this is a chrome extension i believe there's an extension for firefox as well but i'm going to be using chrome for this video so if you want to follow along exactly then download chrome and download react developer tools now all three of these links here will be in the description start with vs code then download node.js you can just run through the kind of default installation and then obviously install the react developer tools in chrome all right so once you have all of those installed what you're going to do is open up visual studio code this is an ide and that's what we're going to be using to write our react code now you don't need to use vs code this is going to make our life a lot easier you're going to see here that there's a lot of files that's involved in creating a react application and while using something like vs code will just make stuff a lot simpler it has really good auto complete and it's good to kind of get used to using an ide especially when you're working with a large framework like react regardless the first thing we're going to do here is install an extension so open up visual studio code mine's in full screen mode yours might look like this to put in full screen mode you press f11 if you are on windows then press here on this extensions tab kind of the little grid with that box hanging out what you're going to do is search for react and you should see that there's this es7 react slash redux graphql whatever snippets what you're going to do is install that and then this will give you a bunch of auto completion and just kind of cool features related to react so that we'll have a better experience here in visual studio code once we've done that what we're going to do is open up a folder or create a new folder in vs code and this is where we'll kind of start our project so what you can do is you can go to the files tab here in vs code and press open folder or you can press file and then open folder you can go to wherever you want to open the folder for so i'm going to go to my desktop i'm going to create a new folder i'm going to call this react tutorial and i'm just going to put working because i have another folder called react tutorial where i have some kind of template code just for myself and regardless i'm going to open up react tutorial awesome so now you can see that it says react tutorial we're now in this kind of project directory we could call it and what we're going to do is open up the terminal in visual studio code so to do that just kind of drag up from the bottom here you should see a terminal pops up and then we're going to type in the following command to actually start and create kind of a template react project so once you've installed node.js you should be able to run the command npx when you run that you should get some type of output if for some reason that's not working then probably reinstall node.js because that should work for you now if npx is working and hopefully it is what you're going to do is type npx and then create hyphen react hyphen app and then you're going to with the name of your app so in this case our app is going to be an inventory management system so i'm just going to say inventory will be the name of our react app so again npx create to react app and then inventory and notice here that i'm in the directory where i want to create this folder so i'm in my react tutorial and when you open the uh the terminal nvs code by default it's going to put you into the directory that you have open so anyways i'm going to press enter here and this command is going to take a minute or two to run it's just going to install a ton of stuff and give us kind of some template code so once this is done i will be right back so we will continue in one second but i need to quickly thank the sponsor of this video and this series which is alco expert algo expert is the best platform to use from preparing for your software engineering coding interviews they have over 155 coding interview questions on the platform which are taught by great instructors including myself get started with algo expert today by clicking the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform alright so the command has just finished running you can see here there was a ton of output in the terminal a bunch of stuff was being installed and now we're getting this kind of nice uh i don't know output here that's saying success created inventory at and then the location inside the directory you can run several commands yarn start yarn build yarn test and yarn eject now you can read through these if you would like but obviously i'll discuss them myself as we kind of go through this so if you look now inside of your folder you should see that you have a ton of files inside of this inventory folder so you have node modules public src and then you have a few files here now i'm not really going to discuss all these right now in the next video go through what all of these files are and what ones you can change and deleting kind of how everything works but for now i want to show you how we can actually run our kind of development server and start seeing our sample react app so just to clarify here the command that we typed in this creates kind of the starting react app for us it does all of this really annoying setup yes you can set up a react app manually if you would like to but running this command just saves you honestly probably about half an hour uh if you were trying to look up and find how find how to do this for the first time regardless what we're going to do now is cd into our inventory folder and now that we're in our inventory folder in our command prompt what we're going to do is type yarn and then start now yarn is just kind of a package manager it's very similar to npm and when you do this what it's going to do is run a script that by default is kind of set up and installed when you run that command and it will load your development server for you now you should see that it opens in your default web browser local host colon 3000 this is the address or the location of your kind of development server where all of our react stuff is going to be rendered and shown and right now you can see it says edit src slash app.js and save to reload and then there's kind of a spinning little react logo here and this is what the starting code will do for you it just creates this kind of very simple web page here so you can go here now and it says you've uh you can now view inventory in the browser you can go to localhost colon 3000 or what you can do is go to the ip address of your machine colon 3000 this just running on your local area network so if you were to go to your phone or something and type in this command you'd actually see the the same application great okay so now let's just quickly make a change so i can show you kind of how this works so i'm going to put this on the side of my screen let me move this a bit smaller i'm going to go into src app.js and let me just kind of move this down here i just want to make a quick change to this paragraph tag and show you that this file right here is kind of what's being rendered on the screen so again if you went to inventory src app.js now we're just going to change this p tag and say my website is running exclamation point i'm going to save this file when i save this file it will automatically reload the website and you can see it says my website is running if we go back to the terminal it should give us some output here saying that it kind of reloaded this let's look here okay i guess it's not going to tell us anything that's fine but regardless this is kind of like a hot reload we didn't have to manually reload the server it just automatically determined there was a change to the file and well it updated it for us okay so that's pretty much all i needed to show you to actually set up your kind of environment and start getting coding the next thing i'm going to show you here is the react developer tools i'll just kind of really quickly go through these and then we'll look at them more in depth when we actually start writing some code so obviously i have my react application open here on local host colon 3000 that's the port i believe you can change that but by default this should be what yours is running on what you can do now is right click if you're on chrome here press inspect and then you're going to see that it brings up this kind of console so what you can do is actually go to these little arrows here and you should see something that says components and profiler this is if you have the react developer tools chrome extension installed and it's active so what you're going to do now is press on components what you can see is we have this one component called app this probably doesn't mean anything to you right now if you're just getting started with react but this is kind of a place that we can go to look at and inspect our react code and this will make a lot more sense once we actually have something interesting to look at i also note there's something called a profiler this is actually what we can do to kind of measure or sorry what we can use to kind of measure the performance of our react code anyways i just wanted to show you those two tabs there and how you kind of access the react developer tools pane from google chrome all right so actually with that i'm going to leave the video here in the next video i'm going to go through this entire project structure so it was automatically generated for us discuss what all these files mean talk about kind of how things are set up and how react actually works and then from there we'll go on and actually start writing some react code and learn more about this as i said at the beginning i'm trying to keep these videos relatively short anyways hopefully you guys are excited again please do leave a comment letting me know what you want to see in this series i'm not yet filmed all these videos when this is going to be released with that said i will see you in the next react tutorial
