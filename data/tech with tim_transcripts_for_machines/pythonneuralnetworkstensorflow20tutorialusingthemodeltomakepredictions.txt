hey guys and welcome back to the fourth video in the neural network tutorial series now in today's video what we're gonna be doing is just simply using our model to actually predict information on specific images and see how you actually use the model I find a lot of tutorials series don't show you how to actually practically use the model but what's the point of creating a model if you can't use it now quickly before I get too far into the video I would just like to show you guys something that I'm super excited to announce because I've been waiting for them to come for a long time and it is the official tech with Tim mugs so you guys can see them here I just wanted to quickly show them to you guys if you'd like to support the channel and get an awesome looking mug I actually really like them then you guys can purchase them just by I believe underneath the video it shows like the teespring link um but yeah they're awesome they look really good and the reason I've been holding out on showing them to you guys is cuz I wanted to wait till I received mine to make sure that it was up to quality and that it looked good enough to sell to you guys essentially so if you'd like to support the channel um you can get one of those if not that's fine but if you do decide to buy one please send me like a DM on Twitter Instagram or something and let me know so I can say thank you to you guys so anyways let's get into the video um so what I'm gonna do actually is I'm gonna we need to continually train the model every time we run the program which I know seems like a pain but unless we want to save the model which I guess I could actually show in this video later as well we just have to train it and then we can use it directly after so after we've you know tested this we don't need to do this evaluate anymore we are trained the model we can use it to use it we actually just need to use a method called predict but I'm gonna talk about kind of how this works because it is a little finicky we're not even just finicky but just not intuitive so essentially when you want to make a prediction using the model I'm gonna set up just a variable prediction here you simply use model dot predict and then you pass it a list now what you would think you would do is just pass it like the input right so in this case we just pass it some input that's in the form 28 28 and it would predict but that's not actually how it works and when you want to make a prediction what you need to do is put whatever your in put shape is inside of a list or actually well you can do it inside of the list but you can also do it inside an NP array as well like an umpire right and the reason you to do that is because what predict does is it gives you a group of predictions so it's expecting you to pass in a bunch of different things and it predicts all of them using the model so for example if I want to do the predictions on all of my test images to see what they are I can do prediction equals Moldavian jiz and if I print out like prediction you guys will see what this looks like so let's run this here and see what we get so obviously we have to train them all each time which is a little bit annoying but we can save it later on and obviously this one runs pretty quickly so it's not a huge deal alright so there we go so now you can see this is actually what our predictions look like now this is a really weird kind of like looking prediction thing we're getting a bunch of different lists now that's because right our output layer is ten neurons so we're actually getting an output of ten different values and these different values are representing how much the model thinks that each picture is a certain class right so you can see we're getting like 2.6 to the e to the negative 06 which means that obviously a very small number so it doesn't think whatsoever that it's that and then I'm trying to find if we can see ones that aren't like to the e huh but apparently it's we didn't really get lucky enough with it showing because they just cut some of them off here but if I print out let's say like prediction zero and I guess we're gonna have to run this again I probably should have thought of that then you guys will see exactly what the prediction list looks like and I'm gonna show you how we can actually interpret this to determine what class it is because this means nothing does we want to know is it a sandal is it a shoe is it a shirt like what is it right so there you go so this is what the list looks like so if we look through the list here we can see these are all the different probabilities that are our network is predicting so what we're actually gonna do essentially is we're gonna take whatever the highest number is there we're gonna say that is the predicted value so to do that what we do is we say NP dot Arg max okay and we just put it around this list now what this does is it just gets the largest value and finds like the index of that so in this case since we have ten neurons the first one is representing obviously tshirt the last one is representing ankle boot it'll find whatever neuron is the largest value and give us the index of that neuron so if it's like the third neuron then it's gonna give us pull over right and and that's how that works so if we want to see the actual like name though rather than just the index then what we need to do is just take this value and pass it into class names so let's say class underscore names and then we'll index whatever the value is that this NPR max prediction zero gives us right so let's run this and see what we get now all right so there we go so we can see that now we're actually getting ankle boot as our prediction which makes a lot more sense for us right rather than just giving us like that prediction array or whatever it was okay so that's great but the thing is how do we how can we validate this actually working well what we need to do now or not what we need to do but what we should do now is show the input and then show what the predicted value is that way we as the humans which know obviously which is which can validate that so what I'm gonna do actually just set up a very basic for loop and what this for loop is gonna do is loop through a few different images in our test images and show them on the screen and then also show the prediction so show what they actually are and then show the prediction as well so to do this I'm just gonna say for I guess in this case I in range five and what we'll do is I'm gonna say PLT dot grid I'm just gonna set up a very basic like plot to show the image I'm gonna image show our test underscore images I right I'm gonna do this see map thing so I say see map equals in this case PLT dot see m dot binary which is just gonna give us like the grayscale and then I'm gonna say P ot dot X label which just means underneath and I'm gonna say is equal to actual and in this case I'm going to say plus and what do we want to do we need to get the actual label of our test image which would be in test underscore labels I and then what I'm gonna do is add a header and say this is what the model predicted so to do this I'm gonna say PLT dot I believe it's sorry not header it's about title and the title will simply be prediction plus in this case we're gonna say prediction and then I now the reason we can do this for sorry we're gonna have to literally copy this this whole argonauts thing and we'll put that here except instead of zero we're gonna put eye and just that way it will show all of the different images right so now what I'm going to do is for each loop here I'm gonna peel T dot show which means I'm gonna show those images so we can see exactly what they look like so quick recap in case I kind of skimmed over some stuff all we're doing is setting up a way to see the image as well as what it actually is versus what the model predicted so we as the humans can kind of validate this is actually working and we see okay this is what the image and the input is and this is what the output was from the model so let's run this and wait for it to train I'll fast forward through this and then we will show the images okay so quick fix here I just ran this and I got an error we need to do class names and then test labels I and that's obviously because the test labels are gonna have like the index of all of these so I can't just put like the number value have to put the class names so that we get the correct thing anyways I hope that makes sense to you guys let's run this now you can see that was the error I ran into again fast forward and then I would back alright so I am back now this is a little bit butchered and how I'm actually showing it but you can see that it's saying the prediction for this was the ankle boot and it actually is an ankle boot now if I close this it'll just show four more because that's the way I've set it up so now you can see that prediction pullover it actually was a pullover all right we see we get prediction trouser it actually was a trouser and prediction trouser actual trouser prediction shirt actual shirt and obviously if you want to see more you could keep looping through all of these and doing that now say you just want to predict on one image well what you could do for example is alright and this is kind of a weird way what I'm about to do but you'll see let's say we wanted to just predict like what the seventh image was well then what I would do is just say test images seven which is going to give us at 28 by 28 array and then I would just put it inside of a list so that that way it gets it's given the way that it's supposed to look but that also means that our prediction list right we're gonna get is equal to this it's gonna look like prediction and then it's gonna have this and then inside it's gonna have all those different values so it's gonna have like 0.001 0.9 but it's gonna be a list inside of a list so that's just something to keep in mind when you're working with these predictions because that is really the only way to do it and that this is exactly what tensorflow recommends on their website as well if you're just predicting for one item just put it inside of a list so that it's gonna work fine so anyways that has kind of been it on using the model to predict stuff in future videos we'll get into a little bit more advanced stuff this was a very easy classification problem just really meant to give you an introduction and personally I think if you've never worked with any machine learning stuff this is pretty cool that in a few minutes of just kind of writing a little bit of code whether you understand it or not you can create a simple model that can classify fashion items like a shirt and a tshirt and I don't know that's pretty cool to me and in future videos obviously we're gonna be doing a lot cooler stuff it's gonna be a little bit more advanced but hopefully you guys can stick with it I'd love to know what you guys think of this series so far so please leave a comment down below it helps me to kind of tweak my lessons and all that as we go forward if you guys enjoyed the video please leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again
