hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video I'm gonna be teaching you all about dictionaries so dictionaries are very similar to sets in Python now if you don't know what sets are pretty much they are a collection of unique elements okay so it's a set is something that's like this so s is equal to and then curly brackets and like 1 3 4 6 7 okay now if you tried to add a duplicate elements in there you would see that if you print s it simply removes that duplicate element now this is the exact same thing with dictionaries they can have no duplicate elements they're completely unique and they're also unordered and that's the same as a set a set is completely unordered although it looks ordered right now it is unordered in pythons memory and in your computer's memory okay so that's the same thing for dictionaries now I'm gonna show you what a dictionary looks like pretty much it is a key value pair so for each key there is a value associated with that and keys and values can be anything you want so if I create a dictionary again I'm gonna use curly braces except the way that I create a new item or like a new element in the dictionary is I give it a key so in this case we're gonna do like Apple and then I'm gonna do for and I'll do like I don't know let's say pair 5 like this ok if I print D you can see we get Apple for pair 5 now you may have guessed but Apple would be a key and 4 would be the value and then pair would be a key and 5 would be the value and this is the way that you can create a dictionary kind of like in one line like statically type in all the entries now obviously there's a lot of different ways and I'm gonna go through that just in a bit ok so now how do we access these values or how do we access these elements so in a dictionary the way that we do this is not something like this like D 0 because we get key error 0 doesn't exist we have to do deep and in the square brackets we put the key so in this case if I wanted to access the value 4 well that's associated with the key Apple so I would type Apple D Apple and you can see it returns a value of 4 now dictionaries are very good because just like sets operations are really fast on them so the operation like in index would he call it remove append those operations are extremely quick on dictionaries and on sets and that's because likewise they are unordered and that's why we can do these operations so fast and why you don't use dictionaries now again if I did something like D pair that we get a value of five now I'll show you again like what happens if I do d4 so four exists in my dictionary but it's not a key it's a value so I type T 4 you can see we get a key error so keys just so you know can they also don't have to be on strings they can be anything you want them to be so a key could be a list two key could be a tupple it could be a number so now I'm going to show you how you can add new things into the dictionary how you can create new key values pairs okay so if I do like something like this and I say D and it's critically actually let's make it a tupple all right it's like a position to three okay and I say is equal to seven so the key at two three the tupple to three is equal to seven that works perfectly fine if I check D we get Apple for pair five and then the key of two three is equal to seven so again shows us now that we don't have to have keys that are just one data type we can mix data types we can create them to be tuples and we can do all that kind of cool stuff so yeah if I access that key we get D three we get seven like that okay now again the reason we can do this and we can add a key like this is because dictionaries are mutable so they are changeable in in the memory system okay now to clear a dictionary we can do something like this like D clear and if we type D we get an empty dictionary and that's pretty straightforward okay so now I'm gonna go into looping through dictionaries and kind of like why they're useful so let's say for example we have a problem and I think I should you just need to create a new text file like this or a new file and we want to count and store the count of every letter in a string so I'm gonna say s is equal to hello my name is okay so hello my name is like this and we want to count every letter in here and store it in a list and be able to access like the count of any single number now there's a few ways we can do this but one way is to use a dictionary so if I create a dictionary I said count is equal to a new dictionary it looks like this with two curly braces now I'm gonna loop through s I'm gonna say for L and s and I let's just say like CHR for shark or ice actually f of type char for char in s now all I'm gonna do is let me say if char in counts alright because we're gonna use the each character as a key in the dictionary and then we're going to set the count to be the value when you access that key you'll see what I mean in a second so if chart in counts what we're gonna say is gonna say count char is equal to counts char plus 1 okay let me just say this quickly so that I can run this alright and we'll say else so if our character does not yet exist in our counts well let's create a new count so let's say count and then when I say char is just equal to 1 because we've counted that element at one time so I'm gonna run the program and if I type count you can see that we get h equal to 1 there's II has 2 l2a1 m2y and you can go through and you can see all the counts of each individual letter like this so now again if we want to print the count of each letter well we could loop through and print all the counts or we can say well we want to see how many times I shows up so let's do this count E and how many times that show up well that shows up two times in our count and that's a really useful example of how we can use dictionaries and there's tons and tons of other ways to use them that is really like really efficient ok so that's a really good way to use them and yeah so now let's go through a few more methods of dictionaries and we can see how we can actually loop through them ok so now that I've created this count let's actually just loop through our dictionary and see how that works so I'm gonna say 4 key in counts and let's just print key now you can probably guess what this is going to do but pretty much when we loop through a dictionary so we've created this dictionary counts after we've done this loop what it does is it automatically loops through each key and each key is going to be something like L o M it doesn't loop through the values so if I print this out to the screen you can see that we get hello my name is and those are all the keys in our dictionary because it loops through the keys now if we wanted to loop through not the keys but the values there's two ways we could do this so four key and counts if we wanted to print out the value well it's pretty easy you can just do counts and then key like this and that would simply print out the value because it's corresponding to each key but another way to do this is to change this I'm gonna just change this to I 4 I encounter values like this and what this does is get all of the values in dictionary and now it allows us to loop through it so if we do that now you can see we're getting 1 2 2 1 2 1 and so on like that so it goes through all the different values in our dictionary now if we want to go through each key and each value there is another little method that we can use this really useful to do this and it is items so for I or for key comma I encounter some value we're gonna print key and we're gonna print by and if we print that out you can see that we get H 1 e 2 L 2 o 1 M 2 and it goes through and it gives us all of the different counts in our dictionary right and that's really useful ok so now that we've been through those let's go through like removing things from the dictionary and changing things that already exist so you can see here that we've kind of already done up here we said count char well that's equal to whatever the count is of that plus 1 and now that means we actually change the value of the key char whatever that represented and we added one to it but other ways that we can change this is really simple so we need to say counts and we know that a exists right I understand can't E is equal to 87 and now that means well if this already exists in our dictionary we're gonna replace it if it doesn't we'll add a new element in so if we print or if we run this and then we simply do count you can see that E is now changed to 87 now to change a key is a bit different the way we need to do what we need to do if we're going to change the actual value of a key is what we need to store what that key is what the value that key is and then add a new key with that same value and then delete the old key if that makes sense so we want to change e to be like said we didn't want a anymore well what we have to do is figure out whatever the value of County is trying to say the what do you call it V is equal to County okay and now we're gonna del actually we can't tell it yet we're gonna say count Zed like this is equal to V so now we've added in a new key that has the same value as whatever this key has now we can simply do this we'd say del counts eat okay so what we've done here is we've stored the value of whatever is pointing to and that we've changed or we've added a new key into the dictionary which is dead and it's now equal to that value and that we've deleted this so I think this is gonna work but let's just try because we might run into an issue here okay so now we're just gonna do two counts okay so there we go so we have Z is equal to two and we've removed the key key from our dictionary and that's what you do if you wanted to like change a key so does the same value but the key is different all right so I think that is pretty much it for dictionaries there's not much else I could really show you I could say well if you wanted to like remove an item from the dictionary without doing that del this is the way to do that you can say d dot pop and then just put in whatever the key is so if the key was like a then I can put a in there and that would simply remove that whole key from the dictionary anyways I hope you guys learned a bit dictionaries are really useful and there's a lot of applications to using them this has kind of been the basics if you want like a wit more advanced tutorial to showing like some more methods to using dictionaries let me know cuz I'm happy to do that stuff you guys but anyways that's been it for this video if you guys enjoy please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in another video
