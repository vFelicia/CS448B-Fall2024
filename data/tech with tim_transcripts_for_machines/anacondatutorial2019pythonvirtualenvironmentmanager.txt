hey guys and welcome back so in today's video I'm gonna be going through an anaconda tutorial so explaining and walking you through how anaconda works why it works what commands we can use how to create new environments how to use those environments and how to manage them now this is a very important skill um if you're working in a large project where you multiple projects on your computer you know when you use something called virtual environments now whether you use anaconda to do that or just like the builtin virtual environment is up to you but anaconda is a great choice a lot of people end up using it just because they see it in like a tutorial video but essentially it's a great way to manage your Python packages and have different Python versions running on your machine at once so obviously the first step is gonna be to download and install anaconda so once we've done that this is just the website by the way I'll leave the link in the description you can download it just make sure when you're downloading it if you don't already have an installed is you check the little box that says add Conda to path now this is important because we want to make sure that we're gonna be able to use the commands in our command prompt now for some reason what I'm about to do doesn't work for you just let me know in the comments I'll try to help you out okay so if I go to CMD it's gonna be our next step here nice I can close this actually what we're gonna start first start by typing is Conda okay assuming you have everything installed now if this shows up you get some nice text then you're good you're ready to go if this doesn't show up trying to reinstall anaconda and do the checkbox that says what do you call it add Conda to path now if you already have virtual environments I will warn you that it may override those environments but you do want to find a way to get connor to your pass you're able to do what I'm gonna do now otherwise you're gonna have to use the Conda what do you call it there should be like an anaconda thing anaconda navigator you're gonna have to use this app and if you use that you could probably figure out what to do okay I might go through it later now essentially what we're gonna want start off by doing is create a new virtual environment so to do this we're gonna do Conda creates n then the name of our environment in this case I'm just gonna call mine test and then you're gonna do your Python version so let's get something to say python equals and then whatever version i want so let's go three six okay so again Conda create n the name and then whatever version you want now already you can hopefully see the advantage of Conda we're allowed to have Python versions that aren't the current version so if you go to the Python website yes you can download other versions but having multiple of them on your machine will allow you or like you will run into errors doing that so essentially doing this you can choose the Python version you can use it will store it all nicely and you won't run into any errors so we're gonna use three point six I'll hit enter enter I don't know why this isn't working okay there we go so now it's gonna solve and set up the environment now I'll wait for this to be done I'll be right back okay so the condo environment is set up now it's ready to go we called ours test now the next step and it's actually telling us what to do here is to activate the environment so it says to activate this environment use activate test so let's do that activate test now when we do that you should see that you get these little brackets and it says the name of your environment and then that your command line is after that now if this is working you've done everything successful good job we're ready to go so essentially what we're doing now is we're in our virtual environment which means whatever we do in here will only be applied to our virtual environment which is really nice because it means we can install packages they won't affect other things on a machine it'll only affect this virtual environment so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna install package let's say pip install hmmm what's the interesting package I want to use this one for an example PI okay so I'm going to install PI we'll wait for this to run and still and then I'll be right back okay so that actually installed way faster than I assumed but anyways we're in so now this is where you'd want to install all the packages you're gonna need to use for your project so what you can do is well obviously just keep typing pip install and then the name of all the packages say you want numpy so you want discord I don't know whatever you want this is where you're gonna install it now just notice if for some reason let's say you closed this command prompt alright and you want to install more packages or later on you realize you need another package you don't want to create a new environment you want to install the 20 or you have what you can do is run the command prompt okay I'll drag that back to the center you can type activate and then you can activate your environment again so this case will activate tests and this is just to show you that you don't have to do that directly after in creating the environment you can do it at any time you want okay so we've got tests now if we want to see all the packages in our environment we can ukon the list and this will go through and it shows you all your packages CI pip pymongo Python whatnot and then if you want to remove a package I believe you can just do kondeh remove and then just name the package that should hopefully work let's see what it says recon remove uh okay I don't know that's probably how you do it you guys can ask me if you're trying to do that anyways so now let's go to hack sheet how to actually use this environment so I just want to show you an example here say you have like IDL e installed and most people do they have this installed on their machine this is the first version of Python you installed and after you install this you installed anaconda okay now notice like you've just installed pymongo right into this virtual environment but watch what happens if I try to import pymongo here no module named PI but what we have pi here why is it not working now the issue is this is a different version of python than the one you've just created and this is your base python installation and have an installed pymongo into that virtual environment you've only installed it into this one so how can we actually run our python script maybe we're writing it using ideally we did a new file we wrote our code and now when we hit f5 it's not working we can install our packages well the way to actually run your python script is from the command line now it may seem kind of difficult or annoying to do this but if you're not using like an an IDE this is the way you pretty will have to do it so let's say on my desktop here I have this Q based algorithm ok that will run that script so what I'm going to do is I'm going to change directory to my desktop so I'll say CD desktop and now I'm in my virtual environment still still says test and I'm on my desktop now what I'm gonna do if I want to run a Python script just all I have to do is Python and then the name of the script so in this case mine is called Q based algorithm so just a shortcut here by the way if you don't realize what I'm doing is I'm just typing the first few letters then hitting tout it's automatically Jan the next line for me so I'll hit I'll do Python Cubase Algren up I hit enter and then you can see it actually prints out the what he call it the result of that for me and it runs that script for me if you're running a graphical user interface like a game it would load up the game for you and this is how you can run things with your virtual environment so I'll do like a quick test for you just to prove that this really does work so I go file new file and we'll just say import PI ok let's save that as just del on my desktop and watch what happens when I hit f5 no module name pymongo right because we're using three point seven point one but now so this is the file Dallas should be on my desktop it's right here I'm on my desktop watch what happens when I'm in my virtual environment I run it so python if i clicked on that properly python del dog py you see no errors everything is fine because we have pi mangu installed in this virtual environment and that's the python we're using to run del so that is essentially how that works now if you want to see a list of all of your different environments what you can do is Conda list env I believe oh I think it's like this Conda env list let's see yeah and there we go so that lists all of the environments for you so you can see I have my base environment discord new web meaning go through and see all them times here tensorflow obviously this one which is the one we're currently and wide as a star now I just want to show you quickly you can deactivate your environment by typing deactivate obviously it'll bring you back to the lost environment you were in in this case we're in actually what's known as the Conda base environment and if we try to install something in here it's like pip install and then you do something here what's gonna happen is Reutimann's actually installed into the base Carnot environment now that's fine but that means when you want to run something you just type Python like without activating environment or you can type activate just to activate Conda so you'll see this action in a second so I type activate you see it brings me this base environment and then what I can do is I a new Python and like delve py but notice that when I do that oh that's actually working for some reason in my base environment anyways that is essentially how that works so you have a base environment you can install packages in there as well but typically it's a good idea to install them inside of like their own environment and use them for different reasons right so for different projects you have different environment to use those environments so last thing if you want to delete an environment so let's say we want to get rid of this one it's pretty easy to do this you can just do Conda remove env n and then the name of your environment which is tests of Conda remove environment and standing for the name test watch what happens when I hit enter you can see it goes it's gonna solve the environments following packages are missing Condor and move hmm Conda env removed I believe is what this my bad guys so Conda env remove and test so run that and there you go it says these are gonna be removed hit yes and you can see it removes it from our system and that is essentially how you use anaconda how you set up virtual environments and that's probably the reason why if you guys have been using it and then trying to do stuff here it's not working if you want to run something you have to do it from the command line or set up this as an interpreter for your project which you can do using a PI charm and Jupiter notebooks and whatnot if you guys
