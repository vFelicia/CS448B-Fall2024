so we all know that big Tech employees get paid insane salaries however it might surprise you how different those salaries are based on where you live now I myself live in Canada but back in January of 2020 I accepted a job offer from the U.S Microsoft Office now at that point in time I was offered 7 350 US dollars or the equivalent of 10 290 Canadian dollars I was also offered a forty nine hundred dollar relocation stipend or bonus or whatever you want to think of it as after completing that internship remotely from Canada I was then offered a new position at Microsoft as an intern again this time from the Canadian office now from the Canadian office my salary was drastically different I was offered 5300 Canadian dollars a month so approximately half and then a 4 900 relocation bonus of the same thing and a 3 500 signing bonus
