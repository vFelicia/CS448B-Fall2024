hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in this video I'm actually starting a new series on classes and objects in Python now I'm gonna start off fairly simple and just explain to you kind of what is a class what is an object how can we create our own and in future videos I'm gonna get a lot more advanced and show you some really cool things that you can do with classes and objects to not only make your life a lot easier but are really cool in my opinion and I didn't even know you could do them until I was kind of searching around before making this video so make sure if you guys are interested in bringing your program and cut to the next level and stepping out of the basics of Python and moving into more of an intermediate to advanced topic that you guys watch through this series because you're gonna learn a lot and you're gonna have a fundamental understanding of Python that you never understood before if you can understand the topics I'm gonna talk about okay so let's start by talking about objects what is an object well in Python an object is pretty much anything and you can see on this my screen here I have two variables X equals 5 y equals string now to us without any understanding of objects and classes this just looks like X is equal to an integer that's 5 and Y is a string and that string value is string now I just want to show you quickly and you might have seen that you can do this before if I print out the type of X and what you call it we'll just do the same thing here with Y run our program you see we get class int and class string now this is pretty trivial you figured this was gonna happen but what does this class actually mean here well pretty much whenever you create a new object in Python store whenever you create a variable or something like that it automatically creates an instance of an object now if X the way that you can also read this is X is equal to an instance of the int class and its value is 5 whereas Y is equal to an instance of the STR class and its value is strength now these classes allow us to have builtin functionality in Python now you might take for granted the fact that we can do something like X plus 7 right and obviously we know we're gonna get 12 when we do that if we do like X minus 6 or X / 4 but someone actually coded this functionality in Python and you just can't see it when you're coding here because it's kind of underneath and I'm gonna actually show you a way that you can look at this builtin code okay so just know that anytime you create a variable and any time you kind of use any functions like for example if you use I don't know say like H is equal to what's something we can do like int Y okay I know it's not gonna work but whenever you use functions like this someone already coded these functions for you and they're typically built into a class of a certain type when you do something like Y dot strip you just take for a take for granted the fact that you can use this dot strip method and this is called a method but someone actually built this in and the reason you can use this is because it's a method on the class of STR if I try to do something like X dot strip well clearly that's not going to work because X is not a string object so just understand that whenever you create anything in Python it is actually an object without you really knowing it or not okay so now I'm going to show you I'm just gonna run this in debug mode so I can print some stuff up to the screen okay so like a console and python calls okay so I'm using PI charmer this works perfectly fine with regular ideally in Python okay so if I type this help function and I pick a class I'm gonna pick int like this okay I type help on int you can see it prints me all this stuff now what does this actually mean well once we get to the top you can see it says class int of type object or inherit from object so pretty much whenever we create an integer and the way we create an integer and python is simply by just saying like x equals five x equals four hundred seventy whatever like that it automatically defaults this x is a type int and you can see here that actually tells us exactly how this class works and this is really useful if you don't know documentation you can just type help on something and it'll read out all the class and everything for you so converting numbers string to an integer return zero if no arguments are given that's what happens when you call the int function and when you give a base well then it tells you what it does there okay now it says methods defined here well these are actually all the methods that you can use on the class integer so if you have abs you have ad and bool sealed if mod equal to float floor floor tip and I'm gonna show you what all these actually mean and why they have the underscores on them later on okay so just wait for that you can see that there's a ton of different methods and a ton of functionality already built into this integer class size of string and you can just keep going two bytes and there's a ton and then class methods defined here we're going to talk about what those are later now I want to show you if I do the same thing on string so I say help on oops on STR like this then we get the same thing except for string and this one is going to be we call it a little bit longer because there's more things you can do with string but you can see we have class string and it inherits from object and we'll talk about all what all this means later just follow along for now create a new string object from a given object if encoding and so on okay and it goes down here add contains equal and you can go through all of the different methods that it has now obviously this is the same for boolean values and for what do you call it floats and all other data types in Python now if any of you've ever seen turtle before you know that if you create for example import turtle okay wow I can't type today and you create like Tim equals turtle dot turtle like this what you're actually doing is creating a new instance of a turtle object so in this turtle module there's a class named turtle and when you call this what's known as a constructor you're actually creating a new turtle object and you're just naming it Tim or storing it in the variable Tim okay so what else should we talk about with objects here yeah so let's talk about the difference between methods and what do you call it functions quickly so a function everyone here should know is created with the defined key okay we're like to find keyword so I say define func give it a value X and we'll simply return X plus one now we know to call this function what we can do is we can simply say like print and then func five and we know that that should give us a value of six right because it just simply adds one to what we're giving and this is a function there's no question about it okay now a class is actually what you call with the dot operator so this you're sorry not a class a method so this dot right here turtle the turtle is a method that creates a new turtle object and I'll show you what I mean here so if I do something like print Y dot upper well this upper right here is not a function it's actually known as a method and it only applies to the class STR so I'll just print this Coakley just show you we get string in all capitals okay if I tried to do something like X dot upper and I click the play button here well X has no method upper and you can see into object has no attribute upper okay and that's because well X is an object of type int and remember when we typed help on int well we didn't see any upper method there so we actually can't use that and that's why we can only use methods on their correct datatypes right so if you create a float and you do like I don't know F equals like five point five then obviously if we try to do F dot upper here this is gonna crash as well because well float object has no attribute upper right it doesn't have that class or that method sorry in it okay so what method is anything you're calling on an object itself right and a function is something that's gonna take an object and apply an operation to it right so you can see here that five is passed into the function we don't have to do like X dot function we just pass it in there and then it returns us a value now methods can return us values as well this one is returning us a value of all capital string it's just different how we actually call those things and they are very similar just the difference is the way that one of them you call on an object and one of them you have to just call and then pass an object through and sometimes these methods can take objects as well for example let's see if I do X dot or F dot replace I think that's the thing all right I'm gonna have to do y dot replace why doctor place like this okay and then I'm gonna pass it a I don't know what should we pass it let's pass it a s and we'll replace it with a blank string okay so we're passing a object of type string and we're passing another objective type string and that's what this method takes as well as we have to call it on the instance right so string so if I call this we get train and six because it's simply replaced s with quotations okay so I think I'm gonna cut the video here I hope you have a little bit of an understanding of what an object is because in the next video we're gonna create our own objects and our own classes and we're gonna talk about that it just was fundamental that you guys understood this before moving on to the next video okay so that's been it for this video if you guys liked please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
