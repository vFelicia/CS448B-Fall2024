often times in python you want to loop through multiple objects at the same time or combine objects together there's an easy way to do this and that is using the zip function the zip function looks like this zip now this takes any number of iterable objects strings lists tuples whatever and combines all the items together into tuples let me show you what i mean this will be names and ages now the zip function returns a zip object that is iterable so if you want this to be a list convert it into a list and notice i get all of my items combined together now of course we can combine multiple intervals so let's go with initials now and notice we get the initials as well great so now that we have that we can loop through this using a for loop so i could say four item in zed and then i could simply print out the item and you'll see that we get all of our items or i could get every single individual element so i could say for n a and i in z print n a and i standing for name age and initial and notice we get all of those values hopefully you found this helpful if you did follow for more
