all right so the first thing to do that's going to save you a lot of time is to avoid bugs now I will say and I acknowledge this bugs are going to happen they're inevitable you're going to run into them so being able to kind of avoid as many as possible and then understanding how to solve them when you run into them is going to save you massive amounts of time to avoid bugs the first thing I recommend is just thinking before you start rambling and just writing a ton of code what I usually do is I'll bring up my whiteboard and I'll bring out my tablet and I'll start drawing stuff out and just thinking logically about the problem and I start thinking about possible edge cases for what I'm doing why this might break and I'm trying to break my own kind of concept and idea before I even bother implementing it into code
