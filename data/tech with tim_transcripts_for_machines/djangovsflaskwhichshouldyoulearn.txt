let me explain to you the difference between Django and flask and which one you should use while Django is a high level full stack web framework that includes everything you need to write an entire application out of the box that means it has tools like authentication admin panels and an orm which is an object relational mapping used for working with your databases next we have flask now flask is known as a microweb framework that does not come with all these tools out of the box with that said it's much lighter weight it's much faster to get spun up and working with and it's a lot easier to learn if you're a beginner or working on some kind of small project so which one should you pick well if you want everything out of the box you're going to be creating a large application especially if you're going to have authentication probably go with Django if you're working on more of a hobby kind of a side project or something a little bit smaller I'd recommend flask now that's not to say you can't create a production ready application using flask you absolutely can but it just doesn't have the level of features and support that Django does so you'll likely be writing a lot more code than you need to
