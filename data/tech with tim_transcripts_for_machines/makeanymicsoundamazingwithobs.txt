hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so if you guys want to make your mic go from sounding something like this to sounding something like this then make sure you watch until the end of the video and so I'm gonna be going over some tips and tricks and some filters that you can use in OBS to make your mic sound much much better hey guys and welcome back to a youtube video so that little snippet you heard at the beginning it's just trying to show you the comparison between the two different microphone settings so that first recording you heard was pretty much just my blue Yeti microphone there's no filters on it there's no postprocessing that's just the raw what it's capturing and the only thing I've changed on that is the gain setting on the back of the microphone now the the next recording you heard is what has all the filters on it so that has a compressor it has gain it has a base filter and a bunch of different things gonna be showing you today now hopefully you can appreciate the difference in sound personally I think it sounds a lot better it removes some of the background sound and it also just makes my voice sound a little deeper with a little bit more bass which is always a good thing especially if you have a little bit of a higher pitched voice it's good to add a bit of bass to it just sounds nicer so let's get right into the video so first of all we're gonna need to have our OBS opened up so if you guys don't already have OBS so you don't know how to use it generally like vaguely then you kind of want to go watch my last video where we set up OBS for screen recording and audio capture so if you don't know how to do that go check out my video it's in the top right hand corner here and then come back to this one okay so if you've done that already you have your OBS you have your audio device in here and all you want to do is make it sound better it's pretty straightforward to do that so we're gonna go into the little settings bar beside our audio device here and we're gonna click filters like so now in here if we click the plus button down here you can see there's a few different filters now you can play around with these filters however you'd like I'm sure some of you may have already seen them but getting the right settings it can take some time and I'm just gonna show you my settings and hope they'll work for you so the first one that I use is noise suppression so pretty much what noise suppression does is it tries to remove some of the constant sounds in the background so for example that buzzing sound you may have heard in that first recording of my microphone without filters that would have been the fans of my computer spinning and with noise suppression that removes that sound now it's important that your noise suppression is not too high because if it's too high it's gonna reduce the quality of your mic so so if you have a very quiet space you're probably not gonna want to use noise suppression as its gonna reduce the quality of your mic so the further right we go the less suppression the further left we go the more suppression so I like to keep mine between 15 and 20 uh obviously it's gonna depend on how loud your space is if you have a very loud space you may want to put it up to 20 but I wouldn't go much higher than 20 because once you go past that you start to hear the difference in quality so I'm gonna leave mine on 15 for right now and we're going to add another filter now now it is important that the order of these filters so pretty much I'll go over why I have the order I do at the end but it is important and it's gonna make a difference okay so now we have this VST 2x plugin so pretty much OBS actually allows you to add external plugins into the program which is extremely useful and what we're gonna do here is we're gonna be using a plugin that allows you to alter it's kind of like an EQ plugin so allows you to alter the tone of your voice change the bass frequencies the treble frequencies and we're gonna go over that at the end how to install that but just add this one in for now okay we're gonna hit + again and now we are gonna go to compressor so we're gonna click OK now we can see the default settings of compressor here it starts by giving you a ten to one ratio of compression which is not what we want we want to bring this down to about three or four now you can play with this number all this stuff here you can play with to make sure that it works for your setting but three is what I use in sounds best for me for the threshold we're gonna move this to about 20 decibels again that should just be a good number to use you can play with that and anywhere between like 22 and 18 the attack time I'd like to keep this as what do you suppose excellent close that as short as possible so that it picks up the recording the fastest so we're gonna go back here filters the release time I like to keep my release time again back down as quick as possible so one millisecond and then the output so pretty much whenever you're compressing something it's gonna make it a bit quieter so after we compress it we want to gain up and by gaining up that means we're just simply just gonna add to the volume and make it sound a bit louder so I like to keep mine at about three again you can play with this if you're very close to your microphone you might want to put this a little bit lower otherwise you're gonna be piercing people's ears with how loud it is and then you can just leave this thing down here to none all right now we're gonna add our next plugin and this one is an optional plugin and this is called noise gate so pretty much after we do our noise suppression after we have the plugin and after we compress everything we're gonna see well do we want to be picking up sound or not now what noise gate does is it pretty much says well if the volume of your microphone is not at a certain threshold we're not gonna pick up any sound at all now again this is useful if you have a really loud space you have a lot of background sound and when you're not speaking it'll be completely silent the only thing is it tends to cut off your words slightly so even if you put this attack time down to about one the fastest possible and pretty much what the attack time does is it's how long it takes before it starts recording so once it hears 32 decibels of sound then it'll take one millisecond before it starts recording although it says one millisecond it actually takes a bit longer and you'll hear that the beginnings of the words or the end of the words will start to be cut off also if you keep this threshold too low down here then what's gonna end up happening is when you're speaking if you say a word quietly or like a softer sound then it's gonna cut that word off completely now you do have to play with these sliders here I'm not gonna be using noise gate I just figured I'd show it to you guys in case you wanted to I used to use it and it was okay but I did notice when I back on the recording said take cut off the words of it again this is better than having a ton of buzzing like I'd rather have my words cut off a tiny bit that have a ton of buzzy in the background but it's not something that I'm gonna use right now so I'm just gonna click on this eyeball over here to turn that off okay and then the last one here is gain again so pretty much it's kind of redundant because in compressor we have gain but if you wanted to add even more gain or just have a separate setting for it then you could click gain here and same thing as the compressor you can gain up or gain down however you would like you can see when I put it up here and then you look down at that blue yeti thing it keeps going red that's because it's too loud and yeah so I'm just gonna turn that off again cuz we don't need that now let's get into the plugin so we have our filters everything should be sounding better I recommend that you guys are testing this out by just hitting for example start recording say something into your microphone hit stop recording listen to it and then play with some of the settings that's what I had to do to get these settings but now we're gonna move into the filters so if we go back to here we click filters and we go to VST plugin and you can see if you guys hit this you hit please select plugin you're not gonna see either of these plugins here that's because we first need to install them so the one that we're gonna be using is called Marble geq and I'm gonna show you how to install that right now so what we're gonna want to do is open up our web browser so for example I'm using Google Chrome and we're just gonna go to this website up here it's called Vox and go calm I'm gonna put it in the description down below so that's easy and you guys can click on it now once we get to this website we're gonna scroll down a little bit and we're gonna see that we have download VST for Mac download this for win 64 etc and you're gonna type ARP not type you're gonna click on the one that suits you so obviously I'm using a Windows machine I'm gonna click on this one and we see that we have it downloading already once it downloads we're going to open this up run this like this and click yes now we're going to accept the terms click Next and we're only gonna click on the ones that we need so for example if you're running a 64bit machine you don't need the 32 bit host you can leave ProTools I don't really know what it does so I just left it to make sure that it works and then next and since I already have it installed it's it's fine we can just click no but you guys gonna click Next and you're going to install it now make sure you remember where you install this because we're actually going to have to move it so once we have it installed what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to our file directory here we're gonna go to wherever it's installed so mine should be in C Drive and then Program Files and you'll see you have a little folder called bucks angle like this okay now from this Vox angle folder what we're gonna do is pretty much just take this interior folder so this book Sango Marvel geq and you're just gonna drag it somewhere where you can store it so I'm gonna drag it to my desktop for right now click continue like that and now it's on my desktop it is down here okay so once we've done that now we're gonna go back to local C Drive we're gonna go back into Program Files and we're gonna create a new folder called VST plugins so I already have one created here and you can see that I have the flux angle folder in here but what you need to do is if you don't have this just rightclick anywhere new folder and then just call it VST no space plugins like this now it is important that you have these capitals and everything is spelt the same and once you've done that you're gonna hit enter now I already have this folder so I'm just gonna delete this new folder because I already have one now once you have that folder VST plugins' you're gonna open it up and you're simply gonna find your box angle folder and you're gonna drag it in again mine's already in here so I'm not gonna drag it in now once you've done that you should be able to go back to your OBS so let's open that up and once you go back into your OBS and you click VST you should see Marvel geq in here if you don't just make sure that inside of your Program Files that you have the VST plugins folder and inside of that folder you have the plugin that you just installed another thing that you can try doing if this doesn't work and this is what I actually had to do is go back to your installer so for example let's go down to downloads we'll go to this box Ango setup click yes and then go through the same steps but this time when I ask you to install it change the path of where you're installing it directly to that VST plugins folder that you've already created and that should work for you guys if it doesn't just leave a comment down below and I'll try to help you out so once we have this installed what we're gonna do is we're gonna keep we're gonna press open plugin interface now it's gonna load up something that looks like this yours is gonna have all the white bars in the middle this is just because I have a preset already now we're gonna go to presets and here we go so we have some presets right here so ultra bass boost lofi mids boost side bass and so on now this is where you can play with the different settings so the one that I use right now to make it and I think it sounds the best I've played with them is bright and bacey but we do have ultra bass boost and they pretty much do exactly what they say presence this one makes you sound a lot clearer but it kind of slurs like some of the higher pitch words I don't know you have you have to play with them and see which one works for your voice now once you have the one that you like you just click on it click set as default set as default and then you could activate like that and there you go you should see this popping up here and again you guys if you know a lot of stuff about yuki we're just playing with these you can change these bars yourself so it's not like you have to use a preset just the preset sound a lot better if you don't know what you're doing and personally I don't really know what I'm doing I just use this thing because it makes it sound better now once that's done you all you have to do is just click the X button here and there you go your microphone should be sounding a lot better so yeah you're probably gonna have to play with some of these filters noise suppression so on you can add noise gate you can add gain until your microphone sounds better and this definitely is gonna make your microphone sound much better than it did before personally I've been playing around with audio settings for about a week or two now and this is the best solution I found to my microphones sound as professional as possible so let me know what you thought down below in the comments and if this made your microphone sound better if you guys have any questions don't be afraid to leave a comment I do respond to most of the comments and leave a like if this video helped you out and help me out by
