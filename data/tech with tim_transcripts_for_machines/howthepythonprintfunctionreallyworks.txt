almost all python programmers start by learning how the print statement works however they don't actually learn how the print statement works what i mean by this is that the prince name it does something that we don't see it prints a new line after it prints what you're printing out in fact this new line is actually a special character that's invisible to you called backslash n notice now if i print backslash n another line happens and if i go backslash and again another line happens so what we can actually do is override what's printed at the end of our print statement so it no longer prints this backslash n to move us down to the next line let me show you you can pass this end equals and then whatever you want in this case i'm going to do a pipe to the print statement and now after it prints out your content it will print out a pipe now in the same way when we have multiple things being printed here we have a default separator of a space if we want the separator between these items to be different we can use sep equals and then whatever we want so in this case i'll just go with a bunch of x's now notice we're going to have a bunch of x's in between our two words hopefully you found this helpful if you did follow for more
