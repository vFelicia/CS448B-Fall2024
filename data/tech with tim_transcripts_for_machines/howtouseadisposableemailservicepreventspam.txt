hey guys welcome back to another youtube video in today's video I'm going to be talking about something called a disposable email service now these are extremely useful and I use them all the time pretty much what a disposable email is is it's a temporary email that will automatically delete itself after a certain period of time meaning that when you don't want to receive spam or you don't want to give out your real email to an account or maybe when you're signing up for something you can use this email that is temporary but will still work and in this case you may say well why don't I just use at no mail well there's a reason for that and that's because if you use a no mail and then that website or account that you're signing up for says okay well we've sent you an email to this account you need to verify it by clicking on a link how are you able to do that with the no mail in this email we can actually check all the emails that have been sent to this so that we can verify our account without actually giving our real email now this may not be great if you're using an account that you're going to be using on a daily basis or a lot or has personal information on it but if you just want to sign up for something for like a few minutes or you want to access a website but you need to put your email in then this is a really good way to do it okay so let's uh let's do an example here so let's say we want to make an Instagram account like this okay so we want to create a new Instagram account but we're only going to be on Instagram for like five or ten minutes we just want a way to get on it we don't need to use this account again so I don't want to give it my real email because I don't want to receive any emails from it I just don't want to use my real email so instead I'm going to put in a fake email so in this case I'm just going to do 10 3 4 5 6 at mail and nature.com now I've never initiated an email like this I've never created an email email that has mail nater column on it I've simply just made this up on the spot and you can do the same if you want to test this out my full name I'm just going to put some random letters like that and then same thing that'll be my username because I don't really care it I'm just trying to get on Instagram for a few minutes and then the password I'll just do a bunch of random letter got okay so we have to remember this email so I'm just going to copy and paste it and then we'll click signup okay well something went wrong but let's just show you what would have happened here okay so we did Tim three four five six now usually what Instagram will do is it'll send you an email to this account right and it'll say well you need to click on a link to verify your account so let's say it did that and let's say I used the more general email let's say we you just Tim Kim at mail Nader calm okay and we click go and we see a ton of different emails pop up and some some from three minutes ago six minutes ago right about an hour ago and then after two hours it actually deletes the email so that's why it is temporary right okay so let's say this was the email that we received no reply here okay so we'll click on this and then what would happened is there would be a link here and we would click on that and we would be able to verify our account um so yeah that's how that works now the email that I used was Tim three four five six now this one probably doesn't exist right now because no one's used this name but we'll see so Tim three four five six there's currently nothing in this inbox right so if Instagram had sent us that email it would have gone into this inbox that we would have been able to search here and we've been able to click on the link and activate our account without using our real email now the only thing to note about this service here called mail Nader com this is the link up top is that it is public right it says right here free public email meaning I can check any Inbox in the world if I just search like maybe hello that's probably going to be in inbox for that and if I looked through the emails carefully enough I'd probably find some information on some people that have signed up for accounts right because when you sign up for an account it may send you an email that has that information in it so if you're ever creating an account that you know you're going to be using for a variety of things or you're going to be using multiple times or that you have personal information or maybe you're storing money on it you're not going to want to use this email service this is just really if you want to prevent receiving spam emails or you want to line up for something today and then you're probably never going to use it again so yeah that's how the disposable email works whenever you are signing up for an account and you want to use one of these disposable emails all you have to do is simply type in the name of the email that you want and then at mail Nader comm once it's sent the email to that you simply go to this inbox right here and you type the name so say you did Tim three four five like this and then you click go and it'll pop up the inbox and show you the email that was sent so yeah that is disposable email I hope this was useful information to you and that you can use it in the future if you liked the video please like and subscribe and I will see you again in another one
