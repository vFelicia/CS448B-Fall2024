hello everybody and welcome to the second official tech with tim code jam project showcase what i'm going to be doing in this video is showcasing the top projects that were submitted in a recent coding competition that i've been running and then i'm going to be picking and announcing the top three winning teams if you are on one of those teams don't worry i will reach out to you guys afterwards and we'll talk about how you can claim your prizes but for this video i'm just going to be going through some really awesome projects that you guys have built kind of giving my reactions to them and then of course announcing my three favorite ones now just to give you guys some context here all of the information relating to future code gems and just all of the kind of stuff that i'm going to be doing that's external to the main youtube channel is in my discord server so if you guys want to be a part of these coding competitions you want to do weekly coding challenges you want to be a part of a minecraft server that's going to be coming soon probably in 2021 and a bunch of other really awesome and cool things that i'm up to then join the discord server from the link in the description i will also mention that we have an official website that is used now for our code gems so if you want to see all of the submissions you want to see more details about this specific code jam and what goes on and kind of how this works then click the link in the description the official url is twt codejam.net although we may be changing that in the future either way this url should still work so anyways that is enough for this introduction i'm really excited to get into these projects so let's go ahead and get started with the first project so before i get into the projects i want to quickly thank everybody that made this possible so first of all everybody that participated in the code jam a big thank you to you especially if you submitted a project and i hope you're going to be joining us in the next code jam which will be happening pretty shortly again all the information in the discord server another big thank you to all of the volunteers and my entire staff team on the discord server i'm very busy and i could not have gotten this done without them they actually developed this entire website that you're seeing right here and made it possible for us to have a really nice way to view all the submissions and handle the voting system which i'm going to talk about next so the way that i'm actually picking the top 10 projects here or actually have the top nine is by votes so since i cannot go through all of the different submissions myself we implemented a system that allowed people that participate in the code jam to actually vote on their top projects or their favorite projects out of all the ones that were submitted so the ones that have the top votes are pretty much all of the ones that i'm showing here there was a few ties and a few projects that i was not able to set up so unfortunately i had to remove them and i will quickly mention that the basic rules here were if i was not able to set up your project in under 10 minutes or i had to download over a gigabyte of files i simply skipped your project i'm sorry but it was a requirement that it was easy to set up and if i couldn't set up in under 10 minutes then unfortunately i had to skip it so anyways i've got nine projects to show you so let's get into it all right so i have the first project up in front of me for each project i will link in the description the original github repository so you guys can check it out for yourself i will also show the contributors of the people who made this project based on their github username so i will all be up on the screen i won't explicitly mention it but of course you can see it there so this first project is called student portal and i'll quickly go through some of the features i have looked at a lot of these projects already because i had to make sure i could get them to run before i did this video uh but yeah just keep that in mind this is pretty much my initial reaction but there is you know some stuff that i have already seen first i'm going to go to settings and just mess with that so you can see history that's what i was doing previously but i can change the appearance so i can go to dark mode okay and go to rgb mode oh that's kind of cool it's like changing colors that's going to be hard to read so let's go to dark so i can go to custom as well let's leave it on dark i can change the screen transition let's go to fallout and let's go back oh okay that's kind of cool wikipedia let's just search up tim and see what we get okay get some references nice looks like that's working notebook uh let's see if i can add something let's go edit and then hello edit it's not working okay hello and hello my name is tim nice save okay looks like i can add another one sweet uh we already clicked that translation let's try hello to do we have a french here and there we go we get bonjour alright so that is indeed working that's cool uh let's go to books let's type one in let's go seven habits of and you guys probably know the rest let's see if that pops up seven habits of highly effective people nice okay i like the ui for this i can look at the description of the book i see the cover that's kind of neat even tells you the price i guess if it's listed and finally youtube you already know what i'm going to search here let's search tech with tim and let's see what we get we get a bunch of my videos and some secret button well it says do not click so i'm not going to click it anyways there we go so we have a bunch of my videos nice and that about and i guess it just tells you what this is made with and all that i'm not going to read through that nice okay so this was built in kibi i did see that on the repository impressions looks really good really cool i like the ui and it's pretty impressive that they made this entire app using only python so i will give them props for that all right so this next one is called homework management now i will tell you that i already have created an account here technically if i go to account you can see this is the account but if you didn't make an account it would have told you to do that when you try to go to this homework page but anyways i'll put the contributor up on the screen but let's go to homework i have an account already made and now let's go ahead and add one so i design an analysis of algorithms nice let's say that this is assignment two which is actually true i do need to finish this let's say i should probably do this tomorrow dot dot dot okay i guess i can pick one to do i actually don't know when it's due but let's just go with the 16th why not on monday and then i can mark it as finished or not now i'm going to leave it as not finished because it is not and let's add homework homework added okay sweet so now i have the homework added in here i guess i can mark it as finished or market not as finished let me go to account and it says okay unfinished homework this is what i still need to do let's mark it as finished and see what happens when i go to homework so it doesn't seem to update when i press this radio button so that's something to note there but other than that this is a pretty cool idea to track my homework and be able to keep track of what i need to do one because this is something that i definitely always forget about i actually usually write it on a whiteboard but it would be nice to have some kind of website so really cool idea cool concept and i trust that this works with adding more fields but i am a little disappointed that the finished button uh doesn't seem to be functioning as i as i navigate between the pages anyways awesome work and now let's move on to the next one and boom okay i'm signed in so you can see that i do have my logo up here so what does this say pay for courses we don't do that over here top 30 picks from us so from reading the readme and looking at this project it seems like what it does is pretty much just show you the best free courses on youtube now i need to search through here and make sure they've included some tech with tim ones okay sweet i have go laying on there tensorflow i made that one as well okay so they are not failing already because they included my stuff uh but this is really cool looks like i can click into one of these let's go learn more okay and boom brings us to the playlist on youtube awesome that is really cool okay let's go back uh let's search for something let's search for javascript see what's popping up here four results found jquery javascript electron and whatever that is i don't know how to pronounce that okay let's go to favorites uh seems like you haven't favored any courses press that icon okay sweet let's favorite this one and let's go to favorites and boom showed up okay nice so that is working suggest a course oh this is a really cool idea so i can put my email course title course url and i guess they'll manually review that and then decide if they want to put that on the site or not a little about page this is pretty cool and yeah i'm not going to go through this too much more but generally this looks really awesome this is just a really polished fully functioning website and i think the idea is really cool to kind of bookmark and keep track of your favorite courses and really easily find great resources online this fits the theme jam for sure which is for students and really just great job i'm pretty blown away by how awesome this website looks and just how everything is so kind of polished and looks really nice anyways that is it for this one awesome work guys i'm going to move on to the next one all right so this next one i have here is called polytask contributors will come up on the screen uh but from looking at the readme it looks like first of all i can change the theme here so auto light or dark and then i can add these widgets to this screen looks like i can resize them and i can drag them around as well and this is kind of like a dashboard i guess for myself that i can use as a student so i have a calculator i have a dictionary i have a timer and a clock okay and then what else do we have we have snake ah snake okay let's see if this snake game works oh it actually does okay that's sweet so i can literally play snake on my little school dashboard i don't know if that's going to make us too productive if we should have that on here but this is pretty cool that this works right in the dashboard and you guys can see me just failing to hit the thing okay great anyways we're going to end snake after that calculator let's make sure that works 4 divided by eight what did we get or was that a plus i guess that was a plus not divided uh nice okay looks like i can resize these okay sweet notes let's see hello my name is tim regular bold oh sweet okay and what about the timer okay so there's a clock there is a timer i guess i can pick that and then there's a stopwatch and that is functioning damn okay that looks really cool dictionary uh why is death the thing that's popping up there but let's try that and boom it gives me the definition okay that is really cool i really like this this is a unique idea i like the fact that i think can i add multiple things i can and what does this do oh that's the the color theme so yeah i can kind of make a nice like personalized little dashboard and if i was studying or something i guess i could have this up while i was writing notes or whatever it was that i was doing awesome let's move on to the next one all right so this next one is called the studentology the perfect place for students to learn nice i like the background already let's go to projects there's an about page there's a contact page as well okay so this is made by just for fun nice uh looks like i look at the source code there okay this is i guess the page we want to be on scientific calculator todo list formula cheat sheet wikipedia search uh pomodoro timer is that how you say that i actually don't know how to pronounce that let's go to scientific calculator boom okay it's just regular scientific calculator make sure that works it does indeed todo list okay let's add an item let's add hello to the list let's add do my homework to the list and let's make sure this does indeed work okay check it off oh that's nice like the little animation for that but let me go to the todo list again and the items are gone okay i'm going to mark that down because the todo list probably should be persistent but anyways that's cool formula cheat sheet looks like there's some different formulas on here basic formulas area volume squares cubes okay this is actually a really cool idea and pretty useful i definitely have used these formulas and forgotten about them many times let's go to more formulas okay take me there it was lagging a bit for me but i think that was just my computer uh trigonometry formulas let's have a look at these ones sine cosine tangent um co secant secant cotangent sides ratios okay that's really useful again i could definitely could have used that um back in the day uh let's go back to look at the physics formulas and wow okay they have everything projectile motion work and energy waves and motions definitely super useful i'm going to guess that these guys here are in the physics and maths based on them even knowing how to add these formulas here okay nice wikipedia search you already know what i'm gonna type here let's try it out and no i guess i'm not on wikipedia okay let's go to a different one uh pomodoro timer i'm probably really butchering that name but anyways and okay so it looks like there's short break which is five minutes i guess long break which is 15 and then work and it seems as though this bubble like fills up which is a really cool thing but this is a good idea and this is awesome there's a bunch of stuff in one website and this is a really cool project so that's all i'm going to look through for this one but i really do like the ui design i like the kind of stuff that you have here and just a really neat idea and awesome work let's move on to the next one all right so this one is just called pomodoro timer so we just saw an example of that in the last project but this whole application is just that looks like i can start the timer i like the nice like animation when it's popping up here i can reset it like i can go to settings and okay so i can pick i guess this is the amount of time that you're supposed to be working and then small break long break okay sweet and let's go to about this website is as is a functional and minimalistic pomodoro timer with the goal of helping you focus and be more productive okay nice you can read more about the method here let's click on that and nice okay so i guess i can read this after the video to understand what this means but cool the website looks really nice let's go back to it i do like the minimalist stuff and i feel like if i'm studying and i wanted to use this method this would be a great website to use there's not too much stuff going on i don't have the option of just pressing the short short break or the long break it forces me to do all of the work and then i guess those timers will start after that but of course i'm not gonna wait 25 minutes to figure that out so let's move on to the next one all right so this next project is called wise drinker this one seems pretty cool and from reading the description i guess it's meant to tell you what your current status is based on the amount of drinks that you've had now i'm actually going to go in the imperial system because i don't know my height and all those things in centimeters and i have gone through this app already so i know what it asks you for but it asks me for my weight my height and all this other stuff so i will put in some true information you guys can guess what is correct or not uh let's go with 150 for the weight what is your height in centimeters or inches uh now i don't know if that's asking like does it want me to put like five foot nine that is my height actually five nine does it want me to do that or does it want me to like put in the number of inches that is five nine uh probably the other way around i guess that's i guess that's going to be 69 inches and then how many hours since your first drink let's go with three hours since my first drink all right uh check if you ate before drinking i did okay let's submit it says our status is not even lightheaded normal is zero okay a blood alcohol level and we drank three hours ago or that was when our first drink was okay so now choose what you drink okay let's just go with liquor sure how many uh how much liquor did you drink in ounces let's go with six submit drink and it says our status is a bit dizzy this is the blood alcohol concentration and this is the time since you first drank okay this is cool that's neat and i guess this is just something to tell you relatively what your blood alcohol is going to be and then you could determine i guess if you were old enough if you should drive or not or what your status was or all of that so impressions on this one first thing the status thing uh kind of throws me off a little bit just because i feel like that's like how do you predict that um but cool idea i really like the fact that has the bac and just the ui is useful it works everything seems to be functioning i would say maybe it could have used a little bit of polishing up maybe some better colors or a nicer ui but generally really cool idea really nice app and awesome job let's move on to the next one all right so this next one is called snake lingo now there's actually a bunch of music playing right now i don't know if you guys can hear that or not in the recording uh but there is music playing and from reading the description of this one it was saying that what this was meant to do is teach you a new language or help you learn a new language by playing the game of snake so i'm going to go with one that i might actually be able to get some write on which is french and let's try this okay loading loading loading and fault all right what is that gonna be or foe sorry what am i saying fault i guess i found an l there um i honestly don't know what that is i'm gonna go with should looks like that was correct what is this one now uh sotunu uh let's see supported maybe that seems to make the most amount of sense it goes with the right letter okay and then what's this one uh yeah i'm gonna say it's probably this in the corner boom okay nice what's this attention i'm pretty sure that's warning let's see boom looks like that's right uh let's guess get one wrong and boom okay game over you learned zero words you got four correct learn towards zero snake length four and i guess i could play again okay so that is a cool app i don't have enough time to go through and test it out but that is really neat uh i wonder if it keeps track of your high scores and stuff that would be cool and generally just a cool idea and a way to guess to get people to learn new new words in a specific language all right so awesome work let's move on to the next one all right so this next project i have here is called quad i guess it's v1 which is the test i guess for this code jam initial impressions looks pretty cool looks you know somewhat polished not you know the most modern ui in the world but if it works it works and i guess this is what it does so it organizes urls organize video conference joining links there's an editable todo list and a quote every time you refresh the page now let me sign in i did actually create an account before this just to make this process faster so i've signed in and you can see that i have no links here i do have one task that i added and then video conferences i do not have any so let's go to video conferences let's add a conference name test url test and platform let's put on zoom add conference please enter a url oh so it does have some verification there www.test.com really that's you're gonna tell me that doesn't work okay let's try this one okay so it looks like it worked with the https i have my test i guess i can click into it and wow okay brings me to that url nice let me go home let's go to links let's add techwithtim.net as a link and we'll just make the link https colon slash tech with tim.net add url and when i click on that it brings us to a very slow loading techwithsim.net nice todo list my todo list item is still here so it doesn't seed save let's delete that i'll confirm the delete and awesome that looks to be working okay so that is a pretty cool app actually seems pretty useful to me and i like the fact that you have an account so that i can sign in and sign out from different computers i guess keep track of important links that i want to know like my website tasks of course and then video conferences all right so nice work and now i'm going to announce the three winners all right so i've picked the three winning teams i'm going to announce them now and then again i will reach out to you guys on discord privately to talk about how to claim your prize but i want to quickly mention that this was not an easy decision there was a lot of awesome projects here and please do not be disheartened if you were not chosen for the top three this is my bias these are the ones that i liked personally and well i'm sure some of you in the comments may disagree and i would love to hear in the comments down below which project was your favorite or what you liked about some of the other ones that were shown here so with that said i'm going to quickly mention some of the factors in my decision making so first of all i was considering how unique was this project was this something that was kind of out of the box different than what most of the other ones were or was this something that i could have came up with in you know 10 or 15 seconds my next one was how functional and polished was this project so where all of the features actually working if i went to a web page where the ui buttons functioning all of that kind of stuff and then how polished was it did i feel like this was a finished project or did this feel like something that was rushed and kind of handed in in the last minute uh now that's pretty much all i considered of course another small few things as well like maybe the styling of the application or actually how complex it might be or what it actually accomplishes and what it does but generally that's what i looked at and with that i have my three winning teams now in third place we have polytask now i'm not sure what the team name of this is but i will throw it up on the screen so congratulations you guys came in third place the reason i chose this for third place is not because this project was something that had an overwhelming number of features and a bunch of different pages but i thought this was a really cool and unique idea and something that i may you know have potentially thrown up on my screen just like a widget dashboard while i was studying i thought this definitely went well with students i like the fact that you can customize the layout resize all of these different things and generally just something pretty unique and that's why i picked it for third place all right so that is our third place winner and now i'm going to go to second place and in second place i have student portal now the reason i picked this one for second place is because this was unique this was built in kivy almost all of the other ones were actually websites i like the fact that pretty much everything here was actually functioning it saved everything it worked well it looked like this was just really polished the ui is pretty great for something built solely in python in my opinion all of the features that i use worked pretty flawlessly there wasn't really any issues with them the about page was nice and then the settings page had just all these extra things that really made this feel like a complete app for example i can change the screen transition i can change the actual color maybe go dark mode or light mode i can look at the history of the things i've done i can clear that history i can turn it off just felt really polished really complete looked really great and i just thought generally was a really cool idea to do this in kivy add all these different things together and that is why i chose it so congratulations to whoever made this again i'll put the team name up on the screen you guys are the second place winner and now let's move on to the first place and now in first place we have as no surprise course yard now this was definitely my favorite project it was not hard for me to pick this as first place i just felt like the ui on this really blew me away and just honestly looking at the site this feels like something that i would see on just any other regular modern website i really appreciate the fact that they have the logos there's a lot of just small little attention to detail things just like the highlighting of little buttons um the fact that when i go over this it gets a little bit larger you know expanding the search bar just felt really nice i liked the fact that i could sign in with my google account that i have the change in colors and then i can favorite all of these different projects or sorry all these different courses i guess and that actually functions i can search for courses the idea itself is just really unique no one else really came up with something like this and of course this isn't really a factor in the decision but i appreciated the fact that some of my courses were actually included in this list like for example the golang tutorial so anyways that is all i'm going to say this was just really well done congratulations guys i believe these are the three authors right here i'm not even going to try to pronounce all of your names but congratulations you came in first place and i hope that you're going to participate in the next code jam and show us what you can do for another topic so with that said that has been this video i hope you guys enjoyed seeing these projects and again a massive thank you to everyone who participated all the staff members in my server and really everybody who made this code jam possible as a reminder we're gonna be hosting these pretty much every two months so make sure you join the discord server if you want to participate and with that being said i hope you enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another youtube video you
