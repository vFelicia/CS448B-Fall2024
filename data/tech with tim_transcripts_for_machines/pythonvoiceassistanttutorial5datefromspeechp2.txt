okay so hello everyone and welcome back so I kind of split this at a nice point here because what we're gonna be doing now is after we've looked through that string and figured out you know we're talking about Tuesday September 5th or we're talking about Wednesday or next Wednesday or Friday the fifth whatever it is that we're we're finding we need to determine how we can actually turn that into a date now the thing is we can have so many different combinations of these words in our string and they can all represent a date accurately so for example writing by say you know what do I have on Sunday well I'm probably talking about the Sunday coming up and if that's already past then the next Sunday right so that's enough information to give us a valid date we have to take today's date and figure out where sunday lies past that now if I say what do we have on Friday the third I need to determine you know which which Friday is the third right and then if we just have a month well that's not enough information to give us a date if we have a month and a date then we know what we're finding here right think there's all these different things we have to think about and that's we're gonna do in the rest of his function determine an accurate date now I just want to keep in mind this may be a little bit glitchy but it does work fairly well from the examples that I've tried to use I mean if you find any edge cases where it doesn't work definitely let me know and I'll try to fix them in later videos it's the first thing we're gonna start by doing it's just saying if month is less than today dot month and month does not equal negative one now what this is gonna do is essentially say if we found a month in this string of text and it's less than the current month that we're in today we need to add one to the year so that's like saying you know say the month is September which it is right now when I'm recording this video and we asked about what do I have on January 3rd well I'm probably talking about January in 2020 so what I need to do then is say ok we need to figure out that since that month is less than the current month because obviously it comes before September now let's add one to the year so that we do this accurately so we're gonna say year actually equals year plus one like that and that's how we can determine and get an accurate year based on what month we type in now the next thing we're gonna do is something with the day here so Marissa say if day is less than day dot day and month equals equals negative 1 and day does not equal negative 1 then what we're gonna do is add 1 to the month so in this case once a month equals month plus 1 now what this means is you know let's say today is the 6th which it is and I say what do I have on the first look that's all I say what do I have on the 1st well then what I'm probably referring to is the next month on the first since we're checking here so as long as we haven't defined a month and we have defined a day and the current day is less than or I guess the day we've defined is less than the current day we're probably talking about next month so let's add one to the month for that date that's what that's doing ok the next thing we have to do is a little bit more complicated but that's fine we're gonna say if month equals equals negative 1 and day equals equals negative 1 and we just check something here that's one more thing and day underscore of underscore week does not equal negative 1 if this is the case what this essentially means is we've only defined like Tuesday like we've said what do I have on Tuesday we haven't defined like January 1st orbs February 3rd we just picked a day of the week in this instance we need to figure out what day that is now this is somewhat complicated because we don't have any number information so we need to figure out what the current month is what the current day is what the current year is and then determine what the date is gonna be based on that so what we're gonna do to start is we're gonna say the current underscore day of the week is gonna be equal to today dots weekday now what this does is actually tell us which day of the week it is now these range from the index 0 to 6 where 0 represents Monday and 6 represents Sunday so let's say you know we get today though we did we get 0 that means today is on Monday that's gonna be important in a second you guys will see why now the next I'm gonna say is difference equals day underscore of underscore a week which is remember the one that we found so whatever index we found for the current day the weeks or whatever one they typed in or whatever they say the assistant the current day of the week now this is gonna do is tell us the difference between these two dates so let me bring up this calendar here you can see I'm on stackoverflow figuring out how to use the time date module but I just want to give an example here so let's say that today is Tuesday so Tuesday the first we'll just go in January for this example and we say Friday well we need to figure out how many days come in between Tuesday and Friday now in this case we know it's 300 because well we have Friday Tuesday and that gives us a difference of three days so what we can do now is just add three days to our current date to determine that the current date that we're the date that we're talking about is actually the fourth of January that's what I'm trying to do here now it becomes problematic when we say something like what do I have on Monday because if you look at it Monday is actually one day behind Tuesday so if we use the same formula of just finding the difference then what we end up getting is like the day before that which I guess would be December 31st when in reality we actually want to go forward so we need to apply another check here now to say if the day that we are referencing is less than the current day move to the next week and look for that date so that's what we're gonna do here so we're gonna say if difference is less than zero which essentially means we have a negative difference so we've going backwards we're gonna say difference plus equals seven now what we're also gonna do in here is we're gonna check if we've said the word next in our string of text so if I say something like what do I have next Saturday well I don't not talking about the Saturday coming up I'm talking about the one after that so I need to add now another seven days so I'm talking about from two weeks from now so this is pretty easy to do but I'm just gonna say if yes it is it word no it shouldn't be word what I need to do if texts don't count like this and we say next is greater than or equal to one then we're going to do is say difference plus equals seven like that okay so that is pretty straightforward for this function and now what we need to do is actually return the date and the time now just would be some adding seven here is because that essentially means like go up to the next week and the way that this works the difference is if you look here if we have a negative one difference if we add 7 to it then what we actually end up getting is Monday because that's six days from Tuesday and that's how this works correctly so any what we're gonna do here is actually just return today which is the current date plus in this case we're a new date time dot I want to say it's like time Delta yes I believe that's what it is and then here we're gonna put difference which essentially means whatever this difference number is we're gonna add that to the current date and then that will automatically figure out you know if we need to go the next month to the next year and return that as a date object where we will print it out after now otherwise what I'm gonna do down here is return date time dot date time our nights daytime date and I believe in here I put month equals month day equals day and year equals a year and what that's gonna do is just return to us a date object with this information and we've figured out what the day month and I guess yeah day month and year is up here so that's it for actually this function here and now we just have to figure out how to call it and actually use it and test it out which we'll do in just a second all right so now that we've created this function that's gonna figure out what the current date is for us or the date is from some string how are we actually going to call it so I'm just gonna start by deleting this here and what I'm gonna do is show you guys how we can call this function actually use it properly and print things out so what I'm gonna do is actually say text equals in this case get underscore audio dot lower like that and then what I'm gonna say here is actually we'll just test it out to start and I'll add something else I'm gonna print get underscore date from the text okay so let's do that and let's run this so what I'm gonna do is speak into the microphone here and pretty much just say like like do I have plans on September 3rd and then see if you can give us what that date is relative to today so let's speak into here Oh what's my air here function does not have an ad shoot what am I saying text equals get I need to put these brackets like that so Tex equals get audio dot lower and then we'll pass that in so let's call this now do I have plans on September 4th hmm I'm getting error here value negative 1 is not unless so give me a second I'm going to try to find what this issue is ah so this is a silly error here but I seem to remove where this says month here and actually put word because we're actually checking the word not the month so that's my mistake if we run this now we should hopefully get this fixed do I have plans on September 9 and what we can see here is we actually get this date here that comes up which is 2019 September 9 we knew a few more tests to make sure this working fine do I have anything on January 25th give it a second here to register and we can see that we get the date January 25th so this is indeed working we're gonna be using this function later and kind of tweaking and messing with it to actually get what activities we have on that date from our Google Calendar so no means that is kind of it we're using this function now I know some of you might say well what happens if we don't give any date and we passing this in well I'm gonna fix that in the next video when we talk about some more specifics here but with that being said I hope you guys enjoyed make sure to test out this function to see if everything's working properly and keep in mind if you don't give like an accurate date when you call this you're probably not gonna get something that's correct because you'll get something like negative one negative one negative one here which will cause you to run into an error so anyways that being said I hope you guys enjoyed make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video
