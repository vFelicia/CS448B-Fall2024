foreign so over the past couple months you've been binge watching my YouTube videos you've taken a course like programmingexpert.io and you finally feel like you've gotten python down you're good at programming and you're ready to move on to something else so the natural question becomes what is next what do I need to learn and how do I level up as a developer well in this video I'm going to share with you three programming languages that I would recommend you learn after learning python you don't have to learn all of these languages in fact I've picked three very different languages based on different types of developers and where you kind of see yourself going in your career so stay tuned let me share these languages with you after a quick word from our sponsor before we get started I need to thank lenod for sponsoring this video I've been using and working with lenode for nearly three years now and they've consistently been my goto choice for hosting my applications and servers in fact right now I'm using the node to host the official Tech with Tim Discord bot a website multiple of my domains and a kubernetes cluster lenode makes it super easy to spin up servers with their oneclick app Marketplace and have tons of written guides in and YouTube videos on their channel to help you get started if you're having any issues you can reach out to their 24 7 support team and actually talk with a real human being now the node's pricing is simple with no hidden fees and full transparency and you can test out the node services for free by using the link in the description and claiming in 100.60 day credit for any new accounts it's been an absolute pleasure to work with lenode over the past few years and one last thank you to them for sponsoring this video so I want to begin here by giving you a quick summary of the Python language and just talking about some of the different language features so you understand why I'm recommending these other languages so python is a general purpose objectoriented dynamically typed programming language now dynamically typed means that when you're using python you don't really need to know what types your variables are you don't need to be declaring those they can change types and you can do all kinds of weird and kind of wonky operations that you can't do in other programming languages because of the fact that it's dynamically tight this also makes it much more beginner friendly and python include a ton of standard Library features that other programming languages don't have there's a ton of helpful builtin functions there's a ton of stuff that's automated for you and just done automatically and you don't need to worry about low level code and you're not really looking at pointers or memory or any kind of optimization on a lower level python is a very high level programming language now python for me at least is what I use when I want to get something done fast and typically when I'm scripted so it's really used a lot in machine learning artificial intelligence data science it's used for backend web servers and it's used for other scripting tasks so if you want to automate some file operations or you just need to do any automation python is really really good at that because of how quickly you can write code however python is not the best when it comes to Enterprise grade applications anything that requires a high performance and you're not going to see python in a lot of large scale apps it doesn't scale extremely well and that's coming from a guy who loves writing code in Python I would never use Python to create something that's like a massive application that would not be my choice so with all that said the core disadvant advantage of python is really the performance and scalability of it and the fact that you're not going to be using it in massive applications so with that said let's now roll into my three language recommendations and I'll kind of compare them all to Python and give you the reason why you may want to learn this language so there's three different routes that we can go down here the first route is you want to learn another programming language and you want to learn something that's similar to python so a lot of your knowledge is going to carry over you like the syntax of python you like python you want something that's going to be close to that the next route is you want to learn something completely different something that has really no resemblance to Python and that's going to give you a completely new perspective of writing code and then the third alternative is you want to learn something that's complementary to python something that can kind of use with python and that gives you two languages that can work together in an application now with that in mind I'm sure many of you are guessing the languages already but let's go to point number one which is you want to learn something familiar and similar to pyte so this language that I'm going to recommend to you for this First Avenue is to learn go now go is a fairly new programming language it is statically typed it is extremely fast and highly performant and it's typically used in backend applications for backend web services now go is actually a language that I teach in programmingexpert.io I also have a few uh tutorials on it on this channel and a lot of people really like go because it's extremely simple it has a very similar syntax to python but it's much more powerful when it comes to creating web services and backend applications so if you're someone who's more of a backend developer you don't really see yourself working on the front end you just want a language that's going to be more capable and used in more production grade software go is definitely a great language and it's going to give you a really good perspective on what it's like to work with statically typed languages in go you're going to be dealing with features like pointers references you're going to have go routines and concurrency and you're going to be able to create scalable and very fast applications with this language now in terms of the limitations of go you can't really use it in many frontend applications maybe there's a few Frameworks that I'm not aware of but it's not the best if you want to create say a user interface that's not the language that I would recommend this is really a language that's going to be pretty easy to transition to from python but still give you a good perspective on the different aspects of coding you're missing in a dynamically typed language yet you're going to have this high performance language it's very In Demand right now A lot of people are looking for go programmers and personally this is the one I would recommend to most people if you really like python already you like python you're going to like go I can promise you that so moving on to my second recommendation this is something very different from Python and this is C plus plus now C plus plus is objectively a very powerful programming language it has really unlimited use cases and C plus plus has been used in tens of millions of development projects that may be an exaggeration but it's used literally everywhere and anything you could think of making you can do with C plus plus you want to make a triple A game yeah you can do that with C plus plus want to make a website you can do that want to make a compiler you can do that want to have a really high performance kind of like little chip that's sitting inside of some Hardware device you can do that with C plus plus in terms of writing the software for it so this is a very very powerful language and one of the reasons for that is that it implements a a lot of lower level features that you're not going to see obviously in languages like python for example in C plus plus you're going to be exposed to pointers references addresses memory management you're going to be dealing with stuff that you didn't need to deal with in Python it's not to say that you can't use these things in other programming languages like python or like go but it kind of forces you to know more about what's happening in your code when you work in a language like C plus C plus plus is also just a very fast programming language uh it will do everything maybe a thousand times faster than python depending on the operation and it's just a very wellknown General programming language that's used by millions of people and that you can't really go wrong with learn now with that said I will warn you it is more challenging this isn't something that is as beginner friendly I wouldn't recommend most people start learning C plus as their first programming language and this is something that's going to take longer to learn and get good at than something like ghosts you kind of need to pick what you want to do here you want to get kind of a hybrid between Python and C plus that would be something like go or do you want to dive right into the deep end and go with a more challenging probe programming language but is maybe more powerful in the future really depends on what you want to do and where you see yourself if you're someone who's just going to be working on the back end maybe go is totally fine for you if you're someone who just wants to learn a ton of new stuff you want to dive into something completely different then I would recommend C plus plus now though let's go on to my final recommendation so moving on to my final recommendation I have something that is very complementary to Python and that is Javascript now JavaScript is obviously a very popular programming language it's used by millions of people in millions of applications if you've ever been on the web you've interacted with JavaScript multiple times now JavaScript is my recommendation here because it meshes really well with python now with python you kind of have the back end you can create a web server you can you know hook up a database you can do all of that with python relatively easily then what you need is some frontend user interface so rather than using python to do that you can use JavaScript you can spin up a simple react server you can use something like angular it's very easy to go and build a project when you know languages like Python and JavaScript you kind of already already are a full stack developer when you know these two languages now obviously there's a few more things that you'd want to learn but I just think that if you're kind of trying to pick the language that's going to progress to you the fastest in terms of getting a job or building projects or apps Python and JavaScript are going to be the ones that you probably want to know they're the easiest to write in in my opinion they're the most popular there's tons of resources for them it's very easy to kind of get started with this quite quickly now the downside of JavaScript is that it is a dynamically typed language that means that you're missing out on all the benefits of a statically typed language when you decide to learn something like this rather than C plus plus or go switching from python to JavaScript you're not going to be learning a ton there's going to be a few features that you pick up in JavaScript that you didn't know about from python but you're not going to be handling memory you're not going to be dealing with lower level features you're not going to be getting this kind of full perspective on all these different types of programming languages because you've kind of stayed in a language that's very similar to Pi so again this decision is really up to you and deciding on okay what do you want to learn what are your goals is your goal to get a job as fast as possible to build a project you you just want to become a better programmer are you interested in just learning new stuff do you want something kind of similar to python up to you I'm going to let you make the decision but these are my three recommendations to summarize go kind of a hybrid between C plus plus and python very similar syntax to python but it's a very high performance language very good for backend web services very popular nowadays as well and you're going to learn about concurrency lower level features really good second language to Python and probably pretty fast for you to learn compared to a language like C plus moving on to C plus plus objectively the most powerful language on this list something that's used by so many different projects that's constantly in demand and that is going to teach you a lot about computer science topics and just becoming a better programmer in general finally JavaScript probably the most practical language in terms of getting a job or building a project it's not going to give you the most learning benefits in terms of computer science or becoming just a better programmer or Problem Solver but it's going to allow you to build stuff much faster than the other options that I put on this list so with that said let me know what you guys guys think in the comments down below these are my three recommendations I'm curious to hear what yours would be and I look forward to seeing you in another YouTube video
