hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video I'm gonna be showing you something pretty cool and new that I've just done with my computer so if you guys have been subscribed for a while you know I have a custom PC that I built myself and pretty much I've been wanting to for the past little while to be able to run both Mac and Windows on that computer because I do have two old IMAX are having iMac and then a MacBook Air but they're both from like 2010 2013 respectively so they're not very good at video editing and they're fairly slow so I figured well I want a video edit using Mac or I want to use Mac for some reason why don't I just put it on my regular PC now I thought this is gonna be a lot easier than it was but now eventually after many hours of working towards trying to do this I've actually been able to load up a dual boot where I have both Windows and Mac on my computer so I'll show you here it looks like I'm in the Mac desktop and that's because I am right now this is actually running off of my regular PC so if I show you the specs here I can see this is not an ordinary uh Mac and it shows you that we have a 3.8 gigahertz Intel Core i5 8 gigabytes of ddr4 and then in our X 480 and I'm gonna show you these specs again in Windows just to show you that I am actually running this on the same computer now if I go over to storage here we can see I have Mac OS X we have untitled which is just my other my other drive that has windows on it and then I have my other two data drive so these just partion din the two different disks but this is the one that I store like videos on and stuff like that so you can see I do have my three drives memory it says that it's like this so I have my 2 4 gigabytes and then I have two empty slots which is correct and then you can see my two displays which aren't the the Mac display so it's got this wrong here it says I have a 4k at 21.5 inch display that's not correct the displays are these ones here and yeah so pretty much what I'm gonna do now is just show you guys me on Windows now how the dual boot works so when I load up my computer it first asked me do you want to boot from windows or do you want to boot from Mac do you want to boot off a recovery disk it asked me all the different boot options and then I select that every time so I'll show you a quick video it's just gonna be off my phone I know it's poor quality but that's all I have to record because I can't screen record the the BIOS in the computer so we'll roll into that now so you guys can see here that we have our clover bootloader now what this does pretty much is it allows me to either select if I want to run Windows or run Mac so you can see here it says boot Microsoft I've gone ahead and I've clicked that you can see we run through the BIOS and we should be at the Windows loading screen there we are so now we're at the Windows loading screen and you can see I can sign it to my account okay so now we are in my Windows desktop this may look slightly familiar to some of you guys have you been subscribed if you've seen some of my previous videos this is the one that I typically would use to record anyways here I have the specs brought up here just in control panel so you can see I have my Intel i5 three point seven nine gigahertz three point eight whatever eight gigabytes of RAM 64bit OS on this case we're in running Windows 10 so I'll go ahead I'll close that you can see if we look over at MSI Afterburner here we can see my raid on our X 480 graphics card and the specs for that as well and then if I close that last but not least we can see my disk drives here so we have our SSD which is the 120 gig and then we have our 240 gig it is to be noted that if you want to do this on your own computer you can actually just partion your disk so that you have two separate versions one for mac one for Windows you don't have to actually buy two separate hard drives like I did although it does work slightly better if you do that and then I have my other drive which is my one terabyte actual hard drive so with the spinning disk in it that had that two par Shinzon it that we saw before so I am indeed running this Mac and Windows dual boot off of the same computer and right now as I stalk I'm just gonna load up a few photos and show you what my setup looks like just to show you I I don't have a Mac computer I'm just running the it off my Windows machine so the way that I was able to accomplish that and I'm sure this why a lot of you guys clicked on this video you're wondering how you can do the same thing it's very complex so it's called building a hackintosh so pretty much what a lot of people do is they want to run mac but they don't want to spend twenty five hundred three thousand dollars on a mac computer so they spend $1,000 $1,200 building a really good PC and then they just install mac on that computer now the thing is mac is really hardware dependent that means that it requires a certain graphics card certain processors and certain drivers so if you have an AMD processor for example you're not going to be able to run mac OS on your computer um that's like if you have some Nvidia cards they don't work and there's no drivers for them on Mac so fortunately for me I have an i5 which is an Intel processor so any Intel based processor typically works and I have an AMD graphics cards and those typically work as well so other than that it doesn't really matter what type of hard drives you have power supply not that matters it's just really the graphics card and the processor also some motherboards have issues booting into Mac as it runs a different file system than Windows so I'm not sure what the two file systems are called but pretty much a Mac Drive can't be read on Windows and a Windows drive can't be read on Mac unless they're format formatted appropriately or there's thirdparty software that's able to do that so what'll happen if you don't install what's called a boot loader which is what I have that and you guys saw the video of that previously where it said do you want a boot from Windows UEFI or do you want a boot from Mac so on for Mac OS X then your motherboard won't let you boot on to the Mac OS operating system because it's not recognized in the in the motherboard there pretty well so there's a lot of steps that go into doing it it's really software related so once you have the hardware done you just have to make a live USB using a Mac computer so you already have to have a Mac for this to work once you have that USB then you have to install the bootloader onto it and then you have to boot from the bootloader onto the USB where you can then install Mac onto your hard drive once you have it on your hard drive you have to boot again from the USB and then install the bootloader onto that hard drive and it's just a whole bunch of steps but if you guys want to see how to do this a full tutorial it's probably gonna be like a 20 or 30 minute tutorial honestly if I do it um and make sure you leave a like on this video and leave a comment down below saying you want to see how this is done and I'll be sure to release a tutorial for you guys so that's been it for this video if you guys enjoyed please make sure you leave a like and hit that subscribe button and I will see you again in another video
