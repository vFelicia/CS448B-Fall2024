so as I continue to post YouTube videos I realized quite quickly that although raw programming skill was pretty important so was the ability to communicate so as I started to develop and improve my communication skills I saw the benefits of this immediately now this skill is what eventually led me to actually land a job at Microsoft and to get offers from companies like Shopify while I was applying for internships when I was only 19 years old I really wish I had focused more on communication skills earlier in my career earlier in my journey because a lot of the opportunities I have today came up because of my ability to communicate I'd even go as far as to say that communication skills have carried me much further than my programming ability so hopefully you take this point to heart and you too start working on your communication skills as well as your programming skills
