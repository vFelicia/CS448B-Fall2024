hello everybody and welcome back so in this video what I want to do is talk to you about why I think right now is a great time to get started with a YouTube channel a personal brand a blog anything if you have any desire to do this right now this is the time that you want to do it what I'm gonna do in this video is talk to you not only about why that's the case but but about the opportunities that you're gonna get by doing this now obviously I have this YouTube channel tech with Tim and when I started this I was only about 16 or 17 years old I could have never imagined that it would have grown to something like this and even just a year ago I had no clue that I was gonna be sitting here today talking to an actual camera and giving you guys advice about this specific topic the amount of opportunities that come from some kind of social social media platform or a personal brand or just having some kind of platform to express your opinions and views and share value with your audience is remarkable and to be honest I couldn't even dream that some of the things that I'm able to do today because of this YouTube channel one of those things being telling you guys about my beginner Python programming course which is now on sale for only $9 if you use the code code bid 19 now I've listed this or nine dollars and not free because I do actually need to make sure I can keep up with the demand from students as I share a private email where you can ask questions and send a final project to but if you would like to get started with Python and have some free time you can check this out there's a link in the description so why I think right now is a great opportunity to do this is because I'm going to go on a limb and say that you have a lot of free time with this coronavirus going around and a lot of people being told to stay home business is closing you know shops kind of shutting down in just the streets being emptier and emptier I can bet the chances are you're gonna have more free time and I know the biggest excuse or the biggest reason a lot of people don't like to do something like this is because of time now as much as this is a horrible and tragic situation I think that there's some light and some positive things that can come out of it like this you're gonna have a lot of free time so whether you decide to do a YouTube channel with that whether you decide to do a website a blog something I want to encourage you to do something with that time rather than sitting around and playing video games or watching the news or you know watching TV whatever it is you're gonna do take some of that time maybe not all of it and dedicate that to something that's going to benefit you when we come out of this kind of downward spiral that we're going on right now this is the time where the people that take advantage of this opportunity are gonna come out much further ahead and you can see that through all of history right I mean there's famous sayings that riches are made in in recessions I'm not saying we're going into a recession but this is kind of kind of applies to this situation where right now maybe you can't work maybe you're staying at home maybe there's no way for you to even make money starting to do something like this is gonna open up opportunities for you maybe not now maybe not in a month but maybe in a few months or even a year where this could be something that could generate you revenue this could be something that opens you up to opportunities this could be what gets you your next job and what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna keep this video kind of short it's talk to you about some of the opportunities that I've had from my YouTube channel and not all of them have come when I'm at a hundred two hundred thousand subscribers they were coming at 2,000 subscribers 3,000 subscribers 500 subscribers you don't need to wait to get to the very top before you can take advantage of the massive benefits that a social platform gives you and speaking a bit about growth and even just getting your YouTube channel getting whatever you're doing off the ground now is going to be the easiest time honestly in the next 100 years in my opinion to do this this is when everyone is staying at home this is one most people aren't going to be doing what you're doing and starting a YouTube channel or a blog or whatever it is they're gonna be watching your videos I can almost guarantee you that the viewership on my channel is going to increase during this time just because a lot of people don't have anything else to do so right now if you have any motivation any desire or you think you might want to do this in the future get started I'm telling you I'm trying to motivate you and get you to do this because you're gonna look back at this and say why didn't I start something during this time that would have been a huge benefit to me so what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna try to keep this video a bit shorter is talking about some of the opportunities that this YouTube channel has given me and what you guys can expect to get from your YouTube channels or from your blogs or from your platforms or whatever it is when you start these things up so the first opportunity here is obviously a revenue generation I'm not sure if any of you know but I actually own an incorporated company called tech with Tim Incorporated and that's where I run all of my stuff there so I'm not just my YouTube channel but my course is my website anything else I do go through that corporation and the reason that I've been able to do that is because when I started this YouTube channel wasn't making very much money he was making like a hundred dollars a month fifty bucks here and there right maybe a few sponsorships every now and then but now it's gotten to the point where I'm able to turn this into a full business and this is something that's honestly mindboggling to me I never thought that I would be able to make a fulltime living from looking at a camera and sharing value with an audience but that is exactly what you can do if you're willing to put in the work now I know a lot of you are gonna say well Tim I can't build a hundred thousand subscriber YouTube channel or two hundred thousand subscriber YouTube channel tonight I'm gonna say actually yeah you can but I understand your point and what I'm gonna say there is you can stay start making money as early as you want with a YouTube channel obviously there's some strategic things that you can do but things like affiliate marketing sponsorships brand deals right all of those things there's no limit to when you can do them and especially if you have your own platform or your own product or something that you're selling it doesn't matter how many people are watching you you can always share that with them now obviously there's some strategy that goes behind this and I'm not gonna really go into that in this video if you guys would like a video on that let me know but what I'm meaning to say here is if you have say 500 loyal fans and you can sell say a 200 dollar course to one or two of them that's already four hundred dollars right I know that might not seem like a lot of money but if you can do that once a week or once a month right those things add up and the little bits right is really what encourages you to keep going and maybe in these times is what's gonna make a difference so you can definitely generate money I know YouTube channels that are smaller than ten thousand subscribers that are making more money than I am right it just depends on how you want to do things and there's no magic number that gives you a certain amount of money right that's that's just the way it is depending on the channel you start depending on the niche you're in depending on what you want to do and how many product placements and ads and things you want to run you are kind of your own boss when it comes to how much money you're gonna make and that is the great thing about these opportunities is that you get to decide how much you want to make and how you want to make that kind of money now the next opportunity here is actually just being known in whatever kind of industry or whatever field that you're in and having something to show for it for me for example I'm only 19 I'm a second year computer science student and I was able to just land a job at Microsoft and I didn't even have to go through the regular application process the reason for that was because of this YouTube channel because they can see that I've been putting a lot of work into this that I was motivated and dedicated and that hey I actually do know what I'm talking about you can watch 400 videos of me talking about those specific things so regardless of if you're gonna make money from this or not this is something that you can point people to and say hey guess what you're asking if I'm a hard worker I posted a hundred YouTube videos in twenty twenty twenty when I had a hundred subscribers I pushed through I was motivated and I'm gonna come and do that for you at your next job right there's just so many things you can get out of this and there's really no negative to doing another huge benefit here is just a community the amount of stuff that I've learned and the amount of video ideas I've gone in amazing people I've met because of this channel is unbelievable I know people around the world now that I'm able to send a text to and have a conversation with about pretty much anything I want because of this channel I get amazing people reaching out to me every single day offering me jobs offering opportunities offering to chat and that's just something that's irreplaceable that there's nothing else that can really do that for you other than having an online platform and I think that's something that a lot of people forget that it's not at the end of the day about the money it's not even about the credibility it's also just about you right this could be something that you really enjoy and really have fun doing and this leads me into my next thing which is this is a huge opportunity to grow your skills and not only filming editing marketing advertising but also in communication I can tell you guys that since I've set up these cameras and set this thing up in my room my ability to communicate not just with the camera but with other people in general has gone up tremendously I mean some of you may disagree with that fair enough but I can say that's helped me in job interviews that's helped me in presentations it's helped me in school there's no negative to doing this and this is what this video has been about I just wanted to give you guys a glimpse into what a YouTube channel can really do for you and why right now if you have any motivation any desire any reason at all that you want to start one get it go ahead and start doing it the number one thing to remember is just to try your best to stay consistent and to never worry about how many people are following you if I was worried about how many people were following me when I was at 10 15 20 subscribers I wouldn't here today and I wouldn't be sharing this video with you so keep going guys get something started it doesn't matter what it is but just do something this is only gonna benefit you and with this amount of spare time you have now this is really a great opportunity to take advantage of so with that being said I hope this gave you guys a little bit of insight and motivation into why you should start a YouTube channel personal brand of website whatever it is in 2020 right now and with that being said if you guys have any questions leave them down below I'll try my best to help you out and answer them I hope you guys all stay safe and I will see you guys in another YouTube video
