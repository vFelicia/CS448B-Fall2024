in this Python quick tips video we'll be talking about these sip function and before I talk about that I want to quickly introduce a problem that the zip function can help us solve so let's say for example we have two lists x and y now they can contain a different amount of elements that doesn't matter what I want to do is loop through them and find the elements that are the same and find the elements that are different at the same index so essentially since this 9 here is an extra element we won't bother with that so what I'm gonna do to do that without my knowledge of the zip function is I'm gonna take the minimum length of x and y and loop through that using a variable I now what I'll do is I'll check if the value at X I is the same as the value of y I and if it is I'll print out same otherwise I will print out not same now when I run this we get an output that looks something like this same as 1 1 not same 2 1 same and so on now this is kind of tedious and there must be a better way to do something like this and there is and that is called B zip function so we can actually avoid this entire mess of a for loop by using zip now what zip does and I'll show you without the for loop first is it takes any amount of iterable objects and packs them together into tuples now some of you're telling me it's called tuples as well either way that's just the way I pronounce it doesn't really matter what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the list of zip of x and y and just show you what this looks like so when I print this you can see we get a list of tuples here we have 1 1 2 1 3 3 4 7 essentially what this does is matches up items in the list so 1 goes to 1 2 goes with 1 3 3 4 7 and then we will omit any other items now if I do this the other way so Y X this will still work will get pretty much the same thing just with the y coordinate first and the x coordinate second and notice we're not including the 9 now we can do multiple elements in this as well I can do something like Z equals and we could do you know like 1 2 like this and now if we throws that into here what we're gonna get is well a list of three tuples but this time since there's like two elements and Zed we're only gonna get two tuples here so how can we use this knowledge now the zip function to help save us some time in that previous problem so I'm gonna get rid of Zed here and I'm gonna do this now with zip so what I'm gonna do is say for I G in zip X Y if I equals equals J print same yes we'll do a capital here and then otherwise so else we will print not say okay so there we go so let's run this nap and we get the same output same not same same not same so essentially we're looping through these tuples that we built here so x and y is signing i to the first one j to the second one then we're checking if those values the same printing same otherwise we were printing not same so this is very useful this can save us a lot of time and if you're trying to create combinations of items from a turrible objects like lists zip can definitely help you out with that so anyways this has been Python quick tips on zip this is very useful you're gonna use a lot in for loops maybe in wild loops as well so get comfortable with how this works and try to think about the way that you can implement solutions using this because often it will save you a lot of time and result in you not having to build an entirely new list by yourself
