so about a month ago i told all of you that my tech startup velocity was hiring software engineers specifically game developers now i received hundreds of applications for this role and thank you to everyone who applied i personally read through every single application and i'm still going through them today now i'm not going to lie to you guys i was pretty disappointed in the quality of applicant and just the amount of effort that went into the applications so much so that i felt the need to make this video and share with you all of the things that you should never do if you want to get hired by a tech company or even get an email response these are really simple things in some cases they're single words that you just shouldn't include in your application and i guarantee if you follow what i say in this video you're gonna have a much higher chance of actually getting an interview and getting some response based on your applications again i don't want to single any of you out here but i really think that i can help you because a lot of these applications i'm talking about ninety percent of the applications i received i was able to rule out in about five or ten seconds of reading through them and i really wanted to hire game developers i wanted to hire as many of you as i could but some of you just made it completely impossible for me to even consider you so with that said let's get into the video and i'll share with you what you should never do if you want to get hired by a tech company but one thing you should do before that is listen to the sponsor of this video

are especially important when you are trying to stand out from hundreds of other people and you have someone like me who doesn't want to spend 10 hours reading every single aspect of an application so what you need to understand about say a manual review process here of applicants which a lot of smaller companies like my company is doing is that as the person reviewing your application i am going to take any opportunity i can to move your application into the trash pile the reason for that is i want less applications to review and i want to narrow down all of the possible applicants before i start reading into all of their applications more in depth i'd rather really quickly scan through 300 applications then look more in depth at say 20 or 30 of them before maybe reaching out and contacting a few people then read every single application all the way through so if you give me a reason why i can move your application into the trash pile i'm going to do that so what am i talking about when i say this well a lot of you in the first sentence of let's say the long answer aspect of the application where i asked you something like what's your experience or what are some games that you've built in the past you started very first sentence first impression saying i have no experience i am just beginning i am a beginner i don't know react i don't know javascript i don't know this i'm not good at this or alternatively you said something like i want this job because or i want to work with tim or i'm looking forward to working in a tech startup now all of those things are not necessarily bad to say but they're not the first thing that you should lead off with when you're trying to grab someone's attention for me for example as soon as i read the word beginner if that was in the first or second sentence of your application i immediately put it into the trash because even though yes you may be someone that i could train you may be someone that's going to be a great member of the team and really committed right now as a tech startup we're not looking for beginners we're looking for people that are confident people that know what they're doing and people that want to work and that i don't have to handhold when they're building different games now this goes with another section of this video which is knowing the role but you don't want to start out with something negative or something that gives someone a reason to discredit you or to move you away from the possible applicant pile you want to start with something along the lines of i have experience in react in javascript i'm confident that i would be a good person for this role you want to do something that gives some passion that gives some energy that shares experience that gives me a reason to continue reading your application and if you can make it unique that's great for example all of the applications that started with something like i'm an athlete myself as well as a programmer i read the entire application the reason for that is that the company that we're building has to do with athletics so if you're someone who's an athlete and you know at a program i'm interested in you because even if i can't use you as a software engineer maybe you have some other role in the company so that's what i'm talking about here you want to build a good first impression and you want to avoid putting anything in the first few lines of your application that allows someone to stop reading the application or kind of rule you out due to a red flag alright so moving on to section two here which is projects now once i've gone through kind of the basic text of your application i'm gonna start clicking on links i'm going to look at your linkedin i'm going to look at different projects and i want to get a sense of what you're able to do so with projects here so many of you submitted projects that were not relevant at all to the role so you submitted stuff that was like a machine learning application or a python app or something that just was not a game or didn't show the ability to work with html css javascript etc which was listed under the job requirements so if you submitted any project even if you submitted five projects and one of the projects you submitted was completely irrelevant to what we asked you to submit i'm crossing you off because if that's one of the best projects you have and it's not even relevant to the role it's another reason for me to get rid of you right now with the projects a lot of you also submitted just super basic projects you submitted stuff that anyone was able to do it's been a tictactoe application you submitted stuff that was just ripped from my tutorials or ripped from other people's tutorials right that was just almost the exact same code not that i went and looked at the code but i just knew looking at the project how you came up with this you didn't submit anything that was original at all right so if you did that again immediately i've just crossed you off of the list here continuing some people submitted like 20 projects you submit 20 projects i'm not going to go look at all 20 projects i'm going to look at maybe the first three i'm going to click on a few random ones so if coincidentally the one that i clicked on looks really bad that's too bad right so i'm fortunate because now that's the impression that i've got of one of the three projects that i looked at so what i would recommend for the projects here is make sure you're only submitting at most i'd say like three projects on something like this that the projects are relevant to what the role actually is so in this case they're games or they show you have the ability to make games or they're a really polished portfolio website or react website and that all of the projects you submit look really good are completely polished are things that could be a production application also all of the projects need to be click and run they can't be things where i got to download the github repository i got to build the npm packages i got to host it on localhost if you do something like that i'm just not going to do that that's too much effort for me to go through just to find out that oh this is from a tutorial or you're not even going to be the person that i end up interviewing so you have to understand again from the interview perspective i want it to be as easy for me as possible to look at your application and get rid of it so don't make it easy for me to do that make it really hard give me a really polished project give me two really polished projects do a few really good games or show me that you have the ability to do that as soon as i see that now i'm excited and i want to look through the rest of your application and i'm kind of rooting for you at this point right after looking through hundreds of really really bad applications so that's what i have on projects again the first impression of projects is super important they need to look good they need to be relevant they can't be simple or trivial and you don't need to submit 100 of them if you submit 100 i'm not going to look through all of them i'm only going to look through two or three anyways so pick your two or three best ones and put those forward all right so next section here is on confidence self doubt now when i was reading these applications one of the tones i was kind of looking for in your writing was confidence the fact that you had the ability to do the job you knew you could do the job there wasn't any doubt that you were going to be able to fulfill the role that you were going to be able to complete what was being asked of you as soon as there was even a little hint that you weren't sure of yourself that you didn't quite know if you were going to have the the skills or the chops for lack of a better word to complete the job again i had to throw your application out unfortunately in this type of role i can't be someone who's motivating you or training you constantly or hand holding you through what you need to do this isn't something where we're trying to ramp someone up over a few months this is a role where we need someone to come in and finish the job without really any help at all yes i can give you you know a few minutes a day or i can you know walk through how to set up the repository or something but beyond that there can't be a kind of reliance on someone else or this you know doubt of ability so just a note there you want to be confident obviously you don't want to overstep and become super arrogant in your application but honestly i would rather read an application from someone who knows what they're doing who says yes i'm a professional i make games this is what i do i have this much experience i absolutely can complete this job as opposed to someone saying well i'm just getting started and you know i'm really motivated about learning i want to join the company i want to work with tim and they just this kind of hint of selfdoubt right they're not giving me this confidence it's not giving me the fact that they know how to do this they're saying well i think i can figure it out and that's great for a lot of other types of roles but i don't want someone who thinks i want someone who knows all right so next section here is to give more than you take now this is in really any area of life you are going to be attracted to someone if you offer them more than you are going to take from them this is the case in relationships this is the case in employment agreements this is the case in any type of relationship that you have with a seller with a company however it may be there's always some reciprocation right and people don't want to be in relationships where they're giving more than they are getting from the other person and they feel there's not a accurate say value exchange or i guess a fair value exchange so when you are trying to get a job what you want to be doing is saying this is what i'm going to give you this is what i can give to the company this is how i'm going to be an asset this is how i can help you you do not want to be saying this is what i want from the company some companies will ask you that and it's fine to answer and you can give some answers to that but you want to be very careful how you phrase that because the last thing i want to do is hire someone who just wants to work with me and just wants to talk to me all day or just wants to learn that's all they want to do right they just want to get experience in a startup they don't want to help us build games they don't want to help take this company to another level right they're not saying those things they're saying this is what i want from the company not this is what i'm going to give you and this is what i'm going to do for you even if you do want those things the most likely way to get them is to first state what you're going to offer and then later on you sprinkle in a little bit of okay this is why i'm interested this is why i want to work from you it's a balance and you need to make sure you are giving more than you are taking otherwise like in anything people don't want to have a relationship with you especially employees so hopefully this is making a bit of sense general rule in life if you're trying to sell something to someone give them more than you are asking from them that's the only reason someone would buy a product from you they think they're getting more than how much money they're giving you for the product right or they think it's a fair value exchange so with that said let's move on to the next section all right so last section here and i can't even believe i'm saying this but you need to know the role when you are applying for a job you have to craft your application around the specific role and understand that every company is looking for something slightly different and you want to make your application appear as though you are the ideal candidate for this specific role not any software developer role not any game developer role this specific role so that is why i was telling you before that a lot of the applications said i'm a beginner or i want to learn or i'll work for free i didn't even read through because that's not what we're looking for for this role i don't care if you work for free or if i have to pay you i just need this to get done so if you tell me i'm a beginner but i'll work for free i can't hire you that's more of a burden on me than it is if i just pay someone to do the job right so you need to read through the rule you need to completely understand it you need to accept the fact that maybe you aren't the ideal candidate and if that's the scenario maybe you don't apply or you omit saying a few things that just make you seem a lot worse uh than they do better right so kind of this whole section here just understand the role do some research you should have watched through the five minute video you should have read through the application online you should have tried to understand or put yourself in the shoes of me who's going to be hiring you and say what does tim want here does tim want to train someone for six months to learn how to do this or does tim want someone who can come in and complete the games hopefully the tone of my video would have you know kind of set that and explain that to you maybe that's my fault for not clearly articulating that but you want to put yourself in the shoes of the employer and say would i hire me right now writing this application am i the ideal candidate based on what i've written here and again i want to be clear i'm not saying lie i'm not saying to be untruthful or deceitful i'm just saying that there's a lot of times where you don't need to say something in the application and saying it is just going to hurt you a lot more than it's gonna help so with that said i think i'm gonna wrap it up here i hope this was not hurtful i hope you guys didn't take this personally i genuinely want to help you here i know a lot of you can be great software engineers you can be great in the role that you're talking about and that you probably would have been good for this company however some of the things you said were just too big of a red flag for me to take the risk at even interviewing you and spend that time and that's why i wanted to make this video so hopefully in the future you're going to have more luck and you can take some of this to heart and really consider it the next time you're writing an application where you're applying for any type of company so with that said i hope you guys enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in the next one you
