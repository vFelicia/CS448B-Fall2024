now fortunately for you if you already know how to code this is actually a pretty simple thing to get into and I would imagine that after the next four or five months if you really put your head down and tried to study this content you'd be ready to land a pretty high paying web 3 or blockchain development role now one of the reasons for that is that all of this stuff is so new and a lot of companies are in desperate need for developers there's a ton of new startups right now a ton of web 3 companies and they need to hire blockchain and web3 developers not enough people have these skills and what that actually means is a lot of these companies are hiring developers with no blockchain skills with no web3 skills and training them while paying them so that they're qualified for the job just because they need developers and they can't wait they need to train people that need to get people into this industry
