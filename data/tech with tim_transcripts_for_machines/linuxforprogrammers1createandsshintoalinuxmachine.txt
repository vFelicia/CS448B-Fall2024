hello everybody and welcome to a brand new tutorial series on linux 4 programmers now this series is going to aim to make you comfortable using a linux device and teach you the things that you need to know as a programmer about the linux operating system now specifically we're going to be focusing on common linux commands we're also going to be talking about networking ssh we're going to be talking about users and permissions the basic linux text editors that you need to know and then a few more advanced things like cron jobs shell scripts and how you can actually connect a domain with a virtual server now these are all good things to know and as a programmer you do need to have a lot of these skills in fact at many job interviews you will get asked are you comfortable using linux do you know these different linux distributions and depending on your answer to that question you may or may not be getting a job linux is just something that you really should be comfortable with as a programmer and even though you're not going to be using it every single day it's very important that if you do need to work on a linux machine you know how to do so so with that said let's get started in this tutorial series in this first video we're going to be learning how to set up a virtual linux machine and then how to ssh into it so as i mentioned the first step in this series is to get access to a linux device so you can follow along with the rest of the videos now if you have your own linux device at home that is great but if you don't we have a solution for you and that is lenode now lenode is actually the sponsor of this video and this series and they were kind enough to provide all of you with a free a hundred dollar credit towards your first lenode servers so if you want to get started using lenode go to the link in the description it should bring you to a page that looks like this and what you need to do is press this create free account button and it will redirect you to a page to create a brand new lenode account where your 100 credit will automatically be applied now lenode is a server hosting company they also have a bunch of other things as well which i'll talk about later but they're awesome i've been using them for over two years i host websites on lenode i have servers that i use for databases i actually have one of my main domains hosted on lenode so definitely super reliable i trust them and i've been a long time customer and that's why i'm happy to have them sponsoring this video and this series now the last thing that i need to say about lenode is that they're actually going to be providing early access to the later videos in this series so almost all of these videos will be posted on youtube on a regular upload schedule but the last five videos will be on lenode's platform and if you want to get access to them immediately so as soon as i finish filming and editing them then you do need to sign up at this webpage right here they will be posted to youtube at a later date but i don't know that exact date right now so if you want to make sure you have these immediately as soon as they are finished then sign up at this page the link will be in the description and these are the specific videos so shell scripts cron jobs advanced commands deploying a simple python web server and registering a domain on lenode and we're going to be connecting that domain with the web server anyways let's move on now and boot up our first server so at this point in time i'm going to assume that your account is set up and ready to go if it's not pause the video and come back afterwards anyways now that we're here on the note i'll just quickly walk you through the platform so to create a brand new node you can press this create button here you can also create a bunch of other things like volumes node balancers you can deal with domains on the node in fact i actually host one of my domains on the node as well as two of my servers that i use related to my discord server which you guys should definitely join from the link in the description anyways lenode also has strong integration and support for kubernetes and pretty much anything that you need as a developer you can access here on lenove now let's get started by creating our first server you can see i have two right here but to create one we're going to press the create a node button or create at the top left and then press the node now from here we need to select a few things so the distribution of our lenod the region root password and all of that now for this tutorial series i'm going to be using ubuntu as my distribution so i'm going to pick ubuntu 20.10 i would recommend that you all use ubuntu as well and the rationale behind this is that ubuntu is one of the most common linux distributions a lot of the other linux distributions are fairly similar so a bunch of the stuff that i teach here will actually apply to other linux distributions as well of course there's differences between them but ubuntu is what i'm most comfortable with and familiar with and i figured that's what we should use for this series anyways after we pick our image we can go to our region so i'm going to select toronto ontario and then we can choose our lenode plan so you can see that the cheapest lenod plan and this is really all that we need for this series is five dollars a month and is the nanoed one gigabyte with 25 gigabytes of storage personally i'm gonna go with the node four gigabyte just because i want something that's a little bit faster but you're welcome to pick whatever you like and you can also see that they have dedicated cpu options high memory options and gpu options as well though just not in this region so let's stick with the node 4 gigabyte and then let's give a label to our lenove so i'm just going to call this one tutorial but i'd highly recommend you call this something that's meaningful to you because when you have a lot of the nodes it's hard to keep track of which one is which lastly we need to enter our root password so i'm going to go ahead and do that right now all right so i've entered my password and we're actually ready to go and create our first lynn node now before i do that i will mention that there's some addons like you can add backups each month and a private ip address you also if you wanted a node that's for a specific purpose so you wanted it say for like mongodb you're a minecraft server or something like that could click on the marketplace and within the marketplace there's actually a bunch of options for kind of prebuilt lenods or preconfigured servers and you can press on this and then that's actually going to kind of do a lot of the necessary setup for you for whatever the application is that you're running anyways i just need to go back and reselect my distribution because we're not going to choose any of those marketplace apps but it's really interesting and definitely makes it much faster to set something up so i guess i'm going to have to go back through and redo a bit of this yes i need to reenter my password but that's fine now we are ready to go so i'm going to go ahead and press create and this will just take one second and then our la node will be booted up and i will be right back all right so our lenode is now running you can see that because we see the running icon right here before it was showing booting and it was kind of a little yellow icon now quickly if you want to power off or reboot your lenode you can press the buttons right here we don't really need to mess around with anything more on this page though all we need to do is keep track of this ip address right here so find your lenods ip address it should just be under ip addresses you're going to want the one that's shorter yours will probably look a little bit different than this but copy it to your clipboard and also make sure you remember your root password because that's what we're going to need next so now that we have this ip address we actually need to ssh into this server and start doing something on it start working on the server so now before we move any further i do need to quickly thank the other sponsor of this series which is algo expert algo expert is the best platform to use when preparing for your software engineering coding interviews i actually work there as an instructor on the platform and i can highly recommend it as many high quality coding interview practice questions so get started using algo expert today by hitting the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to show you how to ssh into your machine on mac and then i will show you how to do so on windows so on mac it's really straightforward you don't need to download anything you simply need to open up your terminal you can do that by going to the spotlight search and searching for terminal then go inside of your terminal and simply type ssh then root at and then the ip address of your server after you do that simply press enter it will likely prompt you with some question that says yes slash no as the potential answer just type yes in there and press enter and then it should show you a password field here at the password field simply type in the password for your server so what you set up when you were on lenode so the root password it's not going to actually show you any characters are being typed in but it is working so just type it in and then press enter and then you are good to go you can now skip through the windows section but i will show you now how to ssh into your machine on windows if you do not have a mac so go to this website right here i'm going to leave a link in the description but it's simply putty.org and download this tool this is simply an ssh client and it just allows us to actually ssh into our server it makes it really easy to store all of the ssh credentials and information and all of that so once you've downloaded putty what you need to do is open that up so you can do that from the windows bar down here and you should see an application that looks something like this what we're going to do is we're going to paste our ip address right into the host name or ip address field and then i'm going to show you a few more things to configure our putty session so first of all the port number of 22 is fine you can leave it like that you want the connection type to be ssh and then close window on exit you're welcome to select what you want here but i'm going to leave it only on clean exit next what i'm going to do is just make the font size of my putty window or ssh client or console or whatever you want to call it a little bit larger so i'm going to go to the window thing here i'm going to go to appearance i'm going to go here where it says change and i'm going to change the font to just be size 24 just so that you guys can read this because it's a little bit small otherwise you also can change the colors and all of that from this page but we don't need to do that anyways let's go back to session you can see that we still have the ip address in and now what we're going to do is just save the settings that we just put in so anything that we do or anything that we're changing kind of in this putty client it's usually a good idea just to save it so we don't have to do this again so what we're going to do is insert a name where it says saved sessions i'm just going to call this tutorial and then you can go ahead and press save and that will save all of this information so just to show you how this works if i delete this ip address here and then i press on tutorial and i double press it i didn't actually mean to double press it let me close this and show you again here all right so i just had to reopen putty i don't know i accidentally double pressed it didn't mean to but if you press it and then you press load then you see that it actually loads the name it loads the ip address and if i were to go back to appearance here you can see the 24 point font is still saved so anyways this is how you save a session i usually recommend you to save them and then you can easily load it after anyways once you have the ip address in this field and you've changed all the settings that you want go ahead and press open or as you saw double click on the tutorial thing there and then this will open up a little window so when you're prompted with a little window that looks something like this just go ahead and press yes there's no worries with this and then you should be good and you should see something that says log in as now i'm just going to make this full screen so that it's easier to see but when it says login as you're going to log in as the root user it's going to say root like that and then it's going to ask you for the password now the password is whatever you put in when you actually set up this land so in that root password field so i'm just going to type mine in you're going to notice that you don't actually see anything popping up but it is indeed being typed in and then once you've typed in the password press enter now assuming this password is correct you should get a screen that looks something like this and now you can see information about your lenode so at this point in time if you've successfully logged into your lenode you have completed this first tutorial series there's one last thing that we can do that's usually a good idea which is just to update the software on our lenode but after we do that that's going to conclude video one and then in video two we'll move on and talk about some basic linux commands you need to know so anyways to end here we're going to update the software on our lenode by typing sudo apt update like that and this will just run through and update all of the necessary packages and then the last thing we're going to do after we update is we are going to upgrade so we're going to say sudo apt hyphen up and then grade like that then this will upgrade all of the packages that we need if you're prompted with something that says do you want to use this much extra space just go ahead and type yes it may prompt you that multiple times after you type yes press enter and then you should be good to go so anyways now that our server is updated and upgraded we are ready to continue with this series so i hope you enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a like and subscribe and i will see you in the next video
