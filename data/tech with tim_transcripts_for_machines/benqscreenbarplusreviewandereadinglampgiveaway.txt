hello everyone and welcome back so what we're gonna be doing in this video is doing a review for the BenQ screen bar plus which is a more affordable version of the Ben QE reading lamp which I talked about in a previous video now another bonus for you guys here in a massive thank you to Ben Q once again for sponsoring this video and for sponsoring the giveaway that I'm about to talk about is I'm actually gonna be giving away a Ben QE reading lamp now these are very expensive highquality lamps I have one sitting right there you can kind of see just the edges of it but this is valued at almost 300 dollars and they're gonna be giving it away to one of you lucky viewers so make sure you guys stay tuned throughout the video to learn how to enter that giveaway and with that being said let's get into the review and talk about the screen bar plus now the way that I like to describe the screen bar plus is an intelligent lightbar now this light bar sits on top of your monitor and projects light downwards and outwards now this light is anti glare which means you don't see anything on your monitor and the whole point of it is to provide accurate and sufficient lighting to help you look at your monitor screen for longer so this is advertised as an ear eating lamp which essentially means that it's designed to save your eyes now if you guys are like me and you sit at your computer screen for 6 to 7 hours a day then you know that this can have a massive effect on your eyesight and it's not difficult to strain and stress your eyes out now the great features of this lamp is that it takes up hardly any room because of where it sits on your screen and it's fully adjustable like you guys are seeing me use now so you can adjust both the temperature and the brightness of the lamp which means that you can kind of change from a nice cold light when you're trying to get some work done to a nice warm reading light now another standout feature here is the automatic sensing this light has I'll talk about it a little bit in the future but essentially what it does is sense the light in the room and automatically adjust the light temperature and brightness to fit that so this is the main controller for the lamp and this allows you to toggle all of the different settings so to turn the light on and off to change the temperature which I just did there and then to change the brightness the way you typically do it is you set your temperature and then you can kind of tweak the brightness from there and this is the automatic sensing I'm talking about where you hit this green button here it lights up and it automatically changes the temperature and brightness accordingly toggling the lamp is pretty easy you just press down on the main kind of spinner there and that is all there is to it now this the light sitting above the monitors we just want to give you guys an idea of kind of what it looks like from below but when you are looking at your monitor you can't actually see that little light aspect there because the light is projected directly downwards unless you tilted a few degrees out which I showed in the previous clip so here we're just gonna talk about some of the parts and kind of putting together this lamp so this is the counterweight that actually sits at the back of your monitor it's extremely adjustable I have a bunch of different monitors I've tried it on I haven't had any issues getting this light on now all you do is essentially just clip that light bar into there and that's all there is to it this is the main controller we've kind of already talked about this a bit it has a nice rubber pad on the back to kind of keep it from slipping and it does look actually decent on the desk in my opinion now the nice thing about this lamp is it actually would be powered from like a monitor or a keyboard or even your computer it uses one USB for the power and then I believe that's a micro USB that just plugs into the back of the lamp so this is really nice because you don't actually need to run this into a wall outlet although you can if you want and you can just plug it into the computer and then whatever your computer's on your light will actually turn on as well obviously with the toggle so I just want to show you guys here how you kind of attach this it's very easy you just kind of clip it on the back you can adjust that counterweight like I'm doing now and just clip it right on to the monitor I haven't had any issues getting this on and even on a curved monitor which this is it actually works fine now one of the few complaints I do have about this lamp is the length of the cable that comes with it now it should be fine for most people that use this but personally for me I have my lamp on the other side of my desk from where my computers and it's actually not long enough for me to stretch and plug in both the lamp and the USB into my computer so I've had to run it into a little power brick that I plug into the wall outlet that I have down below but just a small inconvenience that I figured I'd mention in case you guys have a massive really long set up this might not work perfectly for you now what you're looking at right now is a clip of my desk with only the screen bar plus light on now I have this on my secondary monitor but I'm trying to illustrate to you how much light actually comes off from this now this is really nice because for me as a student what I usually end up doing is writing something while looking at my computer screen so by being able to have this lighting kind of adjust it out to where my paper might be I can actually write and see what I'm writing while I look at my computer screen without having a glare from a lamp which you would usually get just a quick warning here be careful when purchasing this lamp if you do have a webcam I mean it's pretty straightforward you can see here essentially this lamp is gonna block the webcam unless you move it kind of to the very edge of your monitor or a different location just want to make sure you guys were aware of that so you didn't buy this lamp and realize that now your webcam can't actually see anything based on the location it's in so now time for some of my final thoughts about this lamp now to be transparent I did receive this lamp for free as a review unit but it does retail for 129 US dollars and you can find it on Amazon at the link below now in terms of kind of wrapping up this video here I will say that this lamp definitely does make a difference I've been skeptical about whether these products really work but after using them for about a month now I can definitely say that it does make a difference and I notice a huge difference when I go to a monitor that doesn't have this kind of lighting setup and even just in terms of lighting up the working area of my desk it's been really nice and I really am glad that BenQ reached out to me to do this kind of partnership in sponsorship so anyways with that being said if you guys do have the budget for this lamp I would definitely recommend it and I think it's a worthwhile investment in your eyesight and just kind of in the future of looking at your monitor screen alright so now it's time to talk about the part that you guys probably clicked on this video for which is the giveaway so I'm gonna be giving away one BenQ e reading lamp obviously
