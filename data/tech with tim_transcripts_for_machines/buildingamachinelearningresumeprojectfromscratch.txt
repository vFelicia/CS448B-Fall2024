today my goal is to work on a machine learning project that would look really good on a resume I have no idea how this video is going to go but I want to give you a realistic look at what it's like to build a project completely from scratch what I go through the bugs I run into how I plan how I design how I come up with the architecture I just want this to be a more real video than some of the tutorials where I already have the code written and you guys know that I'm not really problem solving on the spot anyways I think this will be an interesting idea let me know what you guys think of it in the comments and let's dive in and build a machine learning project so first things first we need an idea now when I generate ideas I typically apply the following checklist first of all is this practical does it make sense is this something I'll actually use second is this challenging enough that I'm going to learn something and I might have some things to talk about in the interview but not challenging enough that I won't be able to complete it so I want to pick something in that intermediate difficulty where I know kind of how to complete the project but there might be a few things that I'll need to learn or pick up along the way which will give me something to talk about in the interview and then lastly I want to make something somewhat visual or at least very easy to use so if I wanted to link to a website or if I want to have just a simple app that someone can download there's not a ton of setup steps and people will actually be able to use this project relatively simply so with that in mind the project I'm deciding to do is a sentiment analysis project for my YouTube comments the idea is I want to have a little UI where you can pop in the URL of a YouTube video it will analyze all the comments and give you kind of a rating and say this video had 80% positive comments 20% negative or something along those lines so that's the project I'm going to try to build now let me show you how I'd plan that out all right so I don't want to bore you guys too much with architecture here but usually when I start a project I'll just do a quick kind of mind map or little diagram in my horrible handwriting just so I have a general sense of the steps or at least parts of the project that I need so you can see we have a front end here I just kind of Drew basically what I'm looking for I want to have you know a title enter some URL and then we're going to have some sentiment report where it's saying you know the percent negative positive neutral Etc that's going to connect to some kind of API the API is going to need to fetch the comments from the YouTube url run the model on those comments and then return and format the result back to the front end and then in terms of my model to create the model I'm going to need to find a data set to train the model on clean that data train the model with that data test it save it and then deploy and use it very very simple you can see we kind of have three parts model API front end I think for this project I'm going to use D Jango we'll see if that works in a second and for the model I'm probably going to go with something like tensorflow just because that's what I'm familiar with all right now let's start working on our model now to work on this AI model it's actually one of the few times that I need a pretty ridiculous computer in terms of specs now fortunately for this video video I teamed up with MSI and they sent me over their Raider g78 hx1 13v now this is a CS 2023 awardwinning laptop and is actually the most powerful laptop I've ever used it has a ridiculous Intel 13th gen I9 1390 HX processor that has 24 cores eight of which are power cores meaning they can utilize Intel's adaptive boost technology and get up to 5.6 GHz it also comes with an RT X 490 and 32 GB of RAM which means I can actually load and train these pretty massive machine learning models locally not to mention it's got a 240 HZ 17in 16 by10 QD display that is true cut technology it looks incredible and I can game on it while I'm taking a break from coding now you guys might not know this but one of the massive issues and concerns I typically have with these huge laptops is that there's not enough power to go to both the GPU and the CPU at the same time to run them at their full potential in parallel now this laptop actually mitigates that it has something called over boost technology which allows it to deliver 250 watts in parallel to both the CPU and the GPU so that it can boost up hit those turbo clocks and actually utilize the full potential of the hardware now that's a great feature but for any of you that won't be using the GPU all the time you can actually toggle the discrete graphics mode which allows you to optimize for your performance or battery life using the 9 9.9 wat battery that's charged by this ridiculous power brick that comes with this computer now of course this has Windows 11 full I/O HDMI 2.1 Thunderbolt 4 ethernet SD card reader audio jack really everything I feel like I would need for a mobile workstation which is how I'm going to be using this laptop going forward regardless if you're interested in this computer you can check it out from the link in the description now let's start training that AI model all right so I just got some boiler play code running here just to test my tensorflow installation and a really simple model I'm training this off the IMDb movie review set which is a really popular one that comes built into tensorflow now it's not going to be the best for our use case but it will at least give me a baseline of how much better we need to improve the model and how much more data we might need to feed it so I won't run through all the code here what I'm going to do is just train up this model and let's give it a quick test and kind of see the results we're getting so far so the model is now trained it's giving me a testing accuracy of 86% which is not great but let's just run some simple queries here to see what we're getting so let's say I love this video remember it's going to be sentiment analysis okay positive nice I hate this video positive okay so a little bit of work to do here let's do another one this is really bad positive okay so clearly making a few mistakes here back to the drawing Bo let's see if we can improve this it's been about an hour and what I did is just downloaded a new data set that's a lot larger and closer to the type of content we'll be analyzing so I got this data set here it's called sentiment 140 with 1.6 million tweets I couldn't find anything on YouTube comments so I figured I'd go with this instead by the way this is from kagle they have a bunch of free data sets if you guys want to download anyways I trained up a model here took about 20 minutes on this computer which is pretty fast even on GPU uh training here and let's give this a shot and see if it works let's say this is a really bad video I don't like it come on give me negative yes negative okay uh let's see this is the best video I have ever watched positive okay this is okay let's see what it says for that negative all right so that's not quite correct but at least the other one seemed okay uh do another one I really enjoyed this nice work positive okay so it seems like we're getting some decent results here I can continue to test this but I think for now this is probably going to be good next what I'm going to move on to doing is the API cuz I got to grab those YouTube comments so then we can feed it through the model so I'm happy to report that I've made pretty good progress here the next thing I wanted to do after getting that model trade was grab all of the YouTube comments from any given video and then feed them into the model so I just wrote a script here with the help of chat GPT that goes and grabs all of the public YouTube comments for a video given its ID that's working you can see if I go here I punched in one of my videos and we're getting all the different comments with all the Emojis and all this stuff so now what I got to do is take these comments pass them into the AI model and get some kind of output or report so the percentage positive percentage negative Etc then I got to aggregate those once I have that then we can go make a little API and a front end and we can hook this up so we get a bit of a graphical user interface for the project so I'm happy to report I got pretty much everything I was talking about working I set up a really simple flask API that just takes in a video ID on a get endpoint returns all of the comments on that video the one I chose had a bunch of comments and then it gives you actually the results for every single comment so positive negative Etc with the analysis of the sentiment then if we come down here and gives you a little summary and says this is the number of negative comments this is the number of positive comments total number of comments and then it gives an overall rating so it's saying about 69% of the comments were positive now I don't know if that's necessarily correct or not I would think that the amount of positive comments would be larger but I guess there's a bunch of comments where the sentiment is kind of unknown and it's probably leaning towards negative there there's probably some ways we can tweak the model and make it a little bit better but for now I'm happy with this so to quickly show you the code get out of OBS there you can see that I have one simple script here for my API that's simply calling to get all the video comments and then calls to get all the predictions counts number of positive and negative returns a summary and then simply returns a Json response now what we've got to do is hook this up with a front end once we have the front end we'll have a nice graphical user display and the project will pretty much be done all right a few minutes later and we've got the front end up and running I just made a simple input box here where you put in a YouTube url I then have the little summary here so pause POS negative number of comments overall rating should probably round that value but that's fine for now and then if we go through some of the comments here you can see this one for example you don't really do a good job at explaining negative okay makes sense someone didn't like the video continuing here thank you so much for the tutorial really appreciate it positive now I went through and there is a few mistakes like it's not perfect but when I was trading the model I was getting about 81% accuracy and it seems like that's about the accuracy I'm getting on it analyzing all of the comments regardless this is actually a useful project it's somewhat function working pretty well as far as I can tell and this would make a great resume project that I'd actually have quite a bit to talk about during the interview I can discuss how I adjusted the model how I collected the data how I cleaned the data how I connected everything with an API made a front end had a back end even though this isn't the most complicated project in the world there was a lot of different parts that went into it and that's kind of what makes a great project having a ton of different things and showcasing your skill and knowledge across multiple domains so with that said I'll start wrapping it up here will mention that there will be a link to the code in the description if you guys want to check it out and I will say that this was a nice change of pace and different video than what I normally do if you guys enjoy it please leave a comment and let me know and obviously this laptop I was using was actually quite Pleasant I was a little bit worried that I was going to be less efficient or I wasn't going to like it as much as working in my big kind of office desktop multim monitor display but since this is a really powerful laptop it felt pretty much the exact same as my big huge computer that's like doubled the price and since this has such a massive monitor 17in screen I actually found I had enough real estate and even though it would have been nice to have some extra monitors I didn't really think that I needed that I could definitely bring this with me on the go and be close to as productive as I could be in my huge office kind of desktop PC setup anyways I'll wrap it up here if you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next one
