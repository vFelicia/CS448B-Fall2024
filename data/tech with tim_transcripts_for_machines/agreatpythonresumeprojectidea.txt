python is very flexible when it comes to web development but I'm going to recommend here that you make something like a social media Clump so something like Instagram Twitter Facebook YouTube you're not going to build a full Instagram app or a full Twitter you're going to build kind of the core features where users can sign in and sign out they can post something maybe they can search for different users and look at a profile they can like and they can comment that alone is a ton of different features and even if you just build a really Bare Bones version it's pretty impressive now the reason it's impressive is because if you're making something like this you need to make not only a front end but a back end as well you're gonna have to learn a lot to make this and it's going to look really good on a resume
