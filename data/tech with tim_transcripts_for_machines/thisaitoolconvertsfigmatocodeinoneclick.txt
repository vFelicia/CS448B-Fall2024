if you've ever worked on some kind of Dev team or built out an app or website really anything us are facing chances are you've worked with a designer and they've built everything out in something like figma they then hand you the design and they say okay you're on your own now go ahead and code this out now this always seemed a little bit backwards and broken to me we've already got the entire app it looks great it works in figma it's well structured and now all of a sudden I need to remake the entire thing and worst case now something changes in the design I got to figure out what that Chang ches and go in the code and do it manually now this is really inefficient and fortunately we now have some awesome AI tools that can actually do all of this for you now you may have seen my previous video on a gamechanging AI tool called loc ai. a that is a design to code tool that could convert any figma file into highquality frontend code in just a few steps now today I'm teaming up with them to share with you their latest product which is locy lightning which is even better than the last one and can do all of this in a a single step that's right one step you can take an entire figma document and convert that into highquality readable reusable frontend code it really is absolutely gamechanging best part it's completely free and I'm going to show you a quick demo here of exactly how it works now this tool is powered by something called Loco AI which leverages their inhouse large design models which are trained on millions of designs and applications now this really is the future of frontend development and the best part is that this is all available inside of figma Dev mode this is a new workspace that helps you transition from design to code faster with figma Dev mode you can easily inspect designs view code from design components compare changes export assets and more Dev mode also works seamlessly inigma for vs code which I'll get into later in this video so to get started with locy lightning what we'll need to do is toggle Dev mode in figma so we can go to this button up here in the top right hand corner this will enable Dev mode and we we should now see a plugins tab if you're not seeing that you can go to the left hand side here and you can go to plugins and then click on manage plugins from here we'll simply search for locy which you can see that if I can type correctly is already here and now it will load up the locy plugin from here what we're able to do is actually generate all of the code for our Figi by simply clicking a single button so first we'll select a few settings for the type of code that we want so you can see we have some options react HTML CSS nextjs view Etc and then we can go here and select if we want typescript JavaScript Tailwind pixels REM you get the idea and later on if you change your mind you can actually adjust this and the code will be regenerated for you so I'm going to click on apply and then on let's go from here we'll select all of the frames we can do that by holding shift and just selecting the ones that we want and then we can go ahead and convert these four frames now at this point what Loco AI will do is actually optimize our design by making it responsive using things like Auto layout and then it will tag interactive elements like buttons inputs Etc as well as creating different reusable components and automatically suggesting layer and class names to make our code more reusable and clean this is pretty incredible that with a single button click obviously once we've selected our options here we can generate all of the different code and Loco AI handles all of this for us now this differs from the previous version of locy where there's a few steps that you need to run through here the Loco AI takes care of all of it and you can see at this point that now we've generated the code and we can actually go ahead and view an interactive preview as well as the code so let's make this a little bit larger here okay so expand this on the left side we'll expand this demo and let's just zoom in a bit so we can actually see it and you'll notice that I can click on the different interactable elements so these were tagged by local AI as interactable elements I can go in choose different options press on the buttons I can even view different responsive views here so if we make this a bit smaller you'll see that as I click through we can view what it looks like on large screens small screens Etc to make sure it's nice and responsive and now if we uncollapse this and continue to scroll down here you'll see that we can actually view all of the code and the components that Loco AI created so let me expand the code here and you'll see if we click through the different pages so details sign up Etc we get all of the code we get the components that were created and Loco AI has created Pixel Perfect components for all of the different pages that are involved in our application so now at this point that we've got the code there's a few options here we can copy the code just by pressing this button we can download it and modify it directly or we can move further and talk about something known as the Builder so if I click on continue and Builder what we're able to do here is actually sync our code with the locy builder which allows us to view the generated components we we can actually bind Dynamic data and then we can export the code and sync it with things like GitHub this is pretty cool and it gives us quite a few options and allows us to really customize this generated code before we bring it into something like our IDE so we have a few options here first thing we'll need to do is obviously connect to our locy account which we probably already would have done and now what we can do is create a new project so I'm just going to call this locy with Tim like that we can choose any of the options want so I'll just leave it as typescript CSS variables and then we can select a UI Library if we want that so I'm just going to leave this as is go ahead and click on Create and I'm going to go to all selected frames so it brings our entire project over into the Builder so what I'll do now is I'll sync this to the Builder we'll give this a second and then I'll run you through the Builder and show you exactly how this works and how we can really take this to the next level all right so we've been redirected to the Builder now and I just want to quickly take a step back and recall what just happened we we opened up a figma file we enabled the locy plugin in figma Dev mode and then in one single click after we selected our options we're able to generate all of the code for that figma file and there's a bunch of different options and now we're viewing it inside of this editor where we can make changes bind data Etc so this platform here is the locy Builder it has a bunch of different things that you can do inside of here I'll give you a quick kind of overview of how it works so that you understand the lay of the land and then we can talk about export settings viewing the and vs code Etc so let's just make this a little bit larger so we can view it a bit easier and we can see here that on the left hand side of our screen we have our layer panel now the layer panel just allows us to view all of the different root components and layers that are created for us so we can see the different frames Etc that we have within the current page we can change into the different pages like the signup page the details the main content and if we want we can go to the file explorer here and we can view all of the different components the CSS and we can restructure this and change the hierarchy if we want to do that now those are kind of the two main things here on the left hand side in the middle of the screen here we have this interactive kind of demo that allows us to select different elements and then I can also change the screen size so I can make sure everything is nice and responsive and you can see that as I do that it actually selects the different frames that I'm on so I can view the entire hierarchy of my project in this layer panel so if I bring the code window up you can see that as I actually select different elements on the screen it automatically adjusts what file and what code it's showing me so that we can see exactly where the relevant code is which is pretty useful now as well as that we've got some options on the right hand side here so we can bind Dynamic data this allows us to actually create State variables and Link those to different components we can configure our code and then we can export sync and deploy this code with a bunch of different options for example we can push it directly to GitHub now another great feature is that we've got a live prototype so if I click on view prototype here you can see that we have the Prototype let me just zoom in a little bit so we can see this easier I can select some different dates for example go ahead and press on search brings me to the next page and then if I want I can actually share this prototype so if I click on share prototype it will give me a public link by default it will go to whatever page I select up here and then we can copy the link paste it people will be able to view the Prototype immediately obviously we can also change the screen size again to make sure that everything looks nice and then we can go back and edit this in the Builder so now let's quickly talk about components because this is one of the main concerns many people have when using a tool like this they want to make sure it's actually giving them good reusable and clean code that has the correct components so we can go ahead and click on view and when we do this we'll be able to see all of the components that have been created by Loco AI what it does is automatically identify all of the reusable components and it will assign human readable names to them now if we scroll through here we can see a few different components and we can go over to something like the stays nearby card now within here we can click between different instances of the component we can see that we're viewing those in the preview and we actually have the ability to edit any of the property names and the values so if we scroll through here we can see all of the prop names which are reusable and actually quite good we then have the ability to detach this component if we want and we can also create manual versions of components as well so let's say at this point you've set up your components you're happy with this and you actually want to take this code now and Export it well first of all you may want to actually change something so if you go to configure code you have the ability to select for example Tailwind instead of CSS modules and now if you just go ahead and click on save it will automatically update the code for you so you can actually see now that if we bring this up in kind of real time there it changed this so now we're using Tailwind classes rather than using our CSS modules anyways let's say you're happy with this now you can go ahead and go to sync export and deploy we've got a bunch of different options here you can go to netlify verell Etc or for most of us we probably want to go to GitHub so what I'll do is click on sync project here so we'll sync the project with GitHub we need to connect our account which I'll do right now and then we can push this to a new repository all right so now that I've connected my GitHub I can just create a new repository so let's just go locy with Tim demo like that and we can confirm this you'll see that we get kind of this GitHub staging view where we can select the files we don't need to change anything here and we'll just push this directly to GitHub all right so now we can go over to our repository and we can see we've got all of the code here we can modify it we can do whatever we'd want with our GitHub repo so now a final step that I'll share with you pretty much all of the kind of conversion from the UI from the figma file to code we don't actually need to do from our web browser we can do it directly from our ID like vs code so let me show you here a great plugin that we can use specifically figma plugin that lets us pretty much follow along with those same steps directly in the IDE all right so I just opened up vs code here and what we can do is actually enable the figma extension so if I type here in the extension panel figma you can see this will pop up now I've already installed it obviously you need to install it and then sign in and then you can click on it on the bottom left here so when I click on figma you'll see we get a bunch of different projects and go to my shared files and click on the one that I want to open up and here now we can close that Tab and you'll see that it actually loads up figma for us on the right hand side of the screen so now what we can do is Click into a frame so maybe we'll click into the homepage here and we can now enable the locy plugin directly from vs code in this figma extension so we'll just type locy click on that and now we'll be able to do the exact same steps where we can run and automatically convert this into into code so if we scroll down here we have the ability to say let's go so again we can click on what we want so react typescript Etc we'll click on let's go we can select the frame that we want so let's just make this a little bit larger let's select the homepage for example maybe this time we just want to do one frame and we can go ahead and convert that now again locy is going to automatically optimize this design for us and then spit out the finished code so there you are we've got our code and the process has finished all right guys so with that I think I'm going to wrap up the video here now I just wanted to show you this really gamechanging AI tool that is pretty incredible from going from a design to code in quite literally one step obviously there's tons of customizations a lot of other features you can mess around with but I want to thank locy for sponsoring this video and allowing me to share this product with you as I said it's currently free you can check it out mess with it in figma or directly inside a vs code and hopefully it's going to save you a ton of time like it's been saving me so thank you very much for watching if you enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next one
