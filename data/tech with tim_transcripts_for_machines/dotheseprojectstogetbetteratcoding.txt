second way I have you to get better at programming is something that I say on this channel constantly and I apologize if you if you guys have heard it a ton of times now you're getting tired of it but this is to work on projects a lot of people that work on projects will pick something that they've built 100 times they'll go build a clone of something or they'll build something that they're very very familiar with and comfortable with what you should do is pick a project that is challenging something that's outside of your comfort zone something that you have no idea how to accomplish and then as you work on this project you'll go and look things up you'll watch a few videos and immediately you'll take that knowledge and actually be able to apply that into your code and see if you're understanding it and learn a ton working on projects is just a really really great way to get better at programming if you're not doing it I highly recommend that you do
