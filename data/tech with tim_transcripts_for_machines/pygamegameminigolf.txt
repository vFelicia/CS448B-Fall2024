hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video I'm gonna be showing you something that I made in Python so it's gonna be a little bit different usually I do tutorials or howto videos but today I'm just gonna be showcasing one of the programs that I made now Python is a great language you can do a lot with it and the reason I'm showing you this is because a lot of people think that Python is a beginner's language or just an intermediate language and once you get advanced you can't really use it for that many things which is definitely not true now especially with game development obviously there are better languages in Python but you can go pretty far and if you aren't subscribed to my channel then you won't know that I've been doing a PI game programming series where I've been showing you guys how to program a pretty simple game using Python and the module PI game now this program here that I'm using does use PI game and that's the main like GUI for it it's all in PI game there's a little bit of tkinter but not that much and this is what my main script looks like it's about a thousand lines and I have four other files so combined we probably have about 3500 4000 lines in this game just to give you guys an idea so this is fairly advanced and again if you guys want to see a tutorial on this or something like this then let me know in the comments down below I will warn you that I do use some like advanced physics and some pretty advanced math in this so if you're not into that then you might not want to see a tutorial in this as it is pretty complex but I'll go ahead and demo the game for you guys right now so if we run the program here you can see we've got super mini golf by me and then we have coins up here which is going to be zero and then the ball shop and your best score so if I go over here this is just one course you could possibly add multiple courses into this I just haven't done that yet in the ball shop we have all the different colored balls and pretty much based on the coins that you collect in the game you can buy different balls and then you can equip them from here so I'm gonna equip the green ball right now and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna start running the program now you should hear a little bit of background noise I have some music going on and you can see you have a little coin spinning I have a little power bar down here and I can shoot this ball around so pretty much the ball just follows my mouse like this and if I click look in the bottom left corner you can see the power bar go and then my ball will launch basically wherever I shoot it now right now the coin collision is not working just because I had to turn it off as I was testing something via and then if we go to the top right up here I can see we have our power ups and I have so this is power ball this is Mulligan which means like take your shot again and this is sticky ball so say for example I put sticky ball on and let's try to land it somewhere then the ball will stick directly where it is shot too so all of this is uh all these graphics you can tell are just designed by me by hand I know they're horrible but I just wanted something easy to use and something that I could get the right dimensions for these powerups are inspired by an app on the App Store it's called super stickman mini go that I used to play all the time so I kind of modeled this game after it and there we go so I get it in and now we are brought to the to the score sheet after this so you can see we have the part of the course I just made this 9 holes and then it's gonna show you your whole the part and then how well you show so since I shot for you a little green and changing my score on the hole so I'm just gonna click to continue and now we're on the next level now it is a little bit glitchy sometimes the game especially because I didn't make it on this computer I made it on a different computer so sometimes it doesn't always work perfectly but we'll go ahead and we'll shoot the ball and I'm not gonna play all of the levels because it will take a little bit of time but you can see how it works so if I get in the water we get water hazard plus one stroke and hopefully you guys are noticing the way that the ball moves is in like a perfect parabola conic because there's no wind resistance no air resistance and it just works like it would work in physics so again I she's the power shot there to get up but you said I didn't like that shot I could just click little m button here and then it would take me back to my last position and remove whatever strokes I gained from that last shot so we'll go back to Power Shot here we launched ourselves up and then again once we get on the green here what happens is you get into pudding mode which means that you can only shoot in a straight line towards the hole and all you have to do is just set your power ah and then it works like that so I don't know guys can let me know what you think of the game down below yeah so not when I got plus four or CC we get a little red nine and then once you get to the end of the game it's gonna add up all your coins it's gonna add up your score and then if you had a better score than your previous score it's gonna save that and it's gonna show it to you so yeah that's pretty much been the golf game that I made in Python let me know what you guys thought of it down below and leave a like on this video and subscribe to the channel
