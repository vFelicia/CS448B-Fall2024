all right so the first and probably easiest side hustle to get into is tutoring so you can do it when you're a complete beginner you can do it when you're an intermediate you can do it when you're an expert and obviously as you tutor more and more you get better and better and you increase your prices based on who it is you're tutoring and what topics you're teaching so to give you a very concrete and real example of how you can do this if you're a student then what you can do is go to any Professor that you have or any teacher that you have assuming you do okay in their class then you can say Hey you know I'm looking to uh be a tutor do you have any references for me is there any students that are struggling for example that maybe could use some help if you're really good and get to say a level like I'm at right now you can easily be charging 250 an hour for a tutoring session I know that seems insane but trust me it's happened I've been paid that countless times to tutor
