description and stay up toate on the everchanging tech industry so let's begin with a few important facts about the Python language and then I'll talk about who should learn it and who shouldn't and I think you might be surprised what my recommendations are now the first thing you need to know about python is that it is extremely popular and it has been for many many years and that's because it's very flexible it is a general purpose programming language and that means if you learn the language you can create a large variety of applications that doesn't mean python is the best for creating all different types of apps but having python under your belt really gives you a flexible language that lets you create a a lot of different things it's also very easy to learn it's beginner friendly and a lot of people will go to python as their first language because of those features it's not very intimidating and people can get a lot of confidence in the language pretty quickly which can propel them into other programming languages so with that in mind who should learn python well the first group of people I recommend Learn Python are those that are complete beginners that don't really know where to start if you're struggling picking a language or a framework you don't know the area you want to dive into then I'd recommend just starting with python because it's relatively simple there's tons of resources online it's very flexible and you can make a lot of things with it and you'll learn it pretty quickly compared to a lot of the other options this way you're not going to be wasting your time going through a ton of different options or learning a language that you may never use Python is always going to be usable to you and once you learn it it's really easy to switch over to another language now the next group of people that I recommend Learn Python are those that are interested in machine learning artificial intelligence data science or research heavy tasks almost all of those fields require Python and that's the primary language used in them and most of the popular Frameworks and libraries for those type of fields are written in Python so if you are interested in that then definitely just go and Learn Python you don't need to be a complete expert and a lot of the time is going to be spent learning the specific Frameworks and modules that will help you achieve the tasks that you're trying to complete for example you want to build a machine learning bot you want to interact with some different open Source llms a lot of that's going to be much easier to do with python than different programming languages now one thing to note about python before we get too far is that while it is a general purpose language and you can build pretty much anything you can imagine with it it's not usually the best option for a specific task what I mean by that is while you can make a mobile app with python and you can make a website and you can make a game there are other languages or Frameworks that are better suited for building those specific applications for example you want to build a AAA game python is not going to be the language you go with you're going to want to choose something like C++ or C and utilize a framework maybe like Unity or something more complicated than that the point is that while python can do a lot of these things it's not the best for those tasks so if you know you want to be for example a mobile app developer then go and pick the best language for building mobile apps that might be Swift cotlin uh Java depending on what you're doing so just keep that in mind it is general purpose but again not usually the best for all of these really specific tasks now with that said something that python is really good at is Automation and scripting if you're someone who's more of a hobby programmer you want to build some scripts to automate your life or do some fun things on the side definitely choose python because it's so fast to build those types of applications maybe you want to work with raspberry pies you want to build a simple security system or you want to change the lights on your Christmas tree doing those type of things using python is really quick and it's really where the language shines also if you want to get into devops if you want to get into back in development python is well suited for those type of tasks so it is something I definitely recommend learning and even though you might need to know some other languages a lot of companies that are hiring for example a backend developer or someone doing some automation or scripting is going to assume that you know a little bit of python now another great Reason To Learn Python is if you're going to be doing coding interviews if you know you're going to be getting into that coding interview style question where you're doing leak code problems and all that kind of stuff on a whiteboard it's a lot easier to solve those types of problems in python just due to the nature of the syntax being really simple and the language being probably the closest to English out of most of the other programming languages makes it a lot easier for you to write and for your interviewer to understand and I find you can get things done a lot faster with the helpful methods and features that python has compared to various other languages it also just means that there's less syntax and complication that you have to deal with and I find you have some less error prone Solutions writing in something like python that you might have writing in say C+ Plus or Java or JavaScript just due to the nature of the syntax and again just how easy the code reads when you're actually writing things out so definitely something to consider now my last major argument for learning python is that it's just so fast to learn so if you are considering learning another language python is a great one to add to the list that you can get done in a fraction of the time compared to some more complex languages that we're going to talk about later with that said let's now talk about who shouldn't Learn Python and my Arguments for that now we're diving in and talking about why you may not want to Learn Python now the first reason on my list is that it just doesn't make you competitive there's a lot of other higher value languages and skills that you can learn that will make you stand out in the job market and the reason for that is pretty much everyone knows a little bit about python it's a very easy language a lot of people will use it for just a few weeks and then slap it on their resume almost everyone coming out of university has done a little bit of coding in Python and if that's the only language that you know you kind of just look like everyone else that has those same languages on their resume now only knowing python also just doesn't allow you to qualify for a lot of different jobs there are so many positions that require specialized knowledge in say JavaScript or Java or C++ or go or a wide variety of other languages and you can be a lot more competitive getting good in one of those than just having this more General Python language on your resume so if you are trying to get a job while python can help you a little bit I'd say that most of your time is better spent learning a different language where you can qualify for more specialized roles that have less competition again if everyone knows Python and everyone's applying for all those python entrylevel developer positions it's going to be a lot easier for you if you get good at one specific language and you're competing against a smaller pool of people that have that qualification rather than everyone who knows python now another reason you may not want to learn python or you may want to switch to another language if you're already learning it is because it's a relatively simple language and it doesn't cover a lot of important programming features now now python is dynamically typed and it is objectoriented whereas a lot of other languages are statically typed and if you just know python you are missing a lot of fundamentals and important programming skills and that's actually why in things like my programming course with course careers we start by teaching you JavaScript we could have also taught python because they're similar in terms of the style of the language and then after that we immediately go into a statically typed language like go the reason for that is so that you cover all of those fundamentals that you miss from a language like python you learn learn about static typing you learn about concurrency you learn about pointers references Etc and you build a more solid base as a programmer to more easily transition into other languages so it's fine if you know python or you want to keep learning it but I'd recommend diversifying into at least one other language highly recommend that that is a statically typed language so you kind of cover the full spectrum of types of programming languages and you learn some of those more advanced features that you just don't need to know in a language like python now another reason you may not want to learn python and this is one of the reasons sometimes I dislike working with it is because it's not a very visual language what I mean by that is it's very difficult to build graphical user interfaces or visual applications with python a lot of times people find it easier or more enjoyable to write code when they can actually see a visual result of what it is that they're doing and that's why often times I do recommend learning JavaScript because compared to python it's a very visual language and you can very quickly actually see what it is that you're doing and what your code is producing whereas with python a lot of the times you're kind of stuck to the terminal you're stuck on the back end and while you can create uis and you can create kind of visual applications it's a lot more difficult there's more to learn and it's just not the best for doing those type of tasks so if you're someone who knows you want to be building visual applications user interfaces things you can actually see and interact with probably skip over Python and learn a different language maybe like JavaScript now lastly a reason you may not want to Learn Python is the slow execution Speed and Performance now this hasn't really been an issue for me in most of the applications that I build but if you are building something that is highly performant that needs to work on very specific Hardware where you need complete control of the language memory what's going on on a lower level definitely do not use Python because it is very bad at those specific tests and out of most of the modern programming languages it is one of the slowest so there we go that is why you should or shouldn't Learn Python and I'll quickly cover what you can do here if you're not learning python to stand out in today's market and be more competitive now what I would say is that if you want to land a job which I imagine is most of your goals if you've gotten this far in the video you really need to focus on looking at what employers actually want today now to do that you obviously can go through a curriculum maybe where they've curated it to those specific things for example I have a course with course careers but if you don't want to do that what I would recommend is go and look at a bunch of different job postings in areas that you're interested in for example if you want to get into frontend web development if you want to get into AAA game development whatever ever it is go look at companies that are hiring developers and read exactly what it is they want you to have a lot of people kind of go into this blind they just trust some random person like me online and watch one video and pick a language don't do that instead go read all of these different job postings see the type of job you would want to have and see exactly what they're listing as the requirements maybe python is there maybe Java is there maybe C++ is there maybe Frameworks or languages you've never heard of are there go and find what you want to do and then Focus learning for those specific positions don't just look at one look at 20 30 40 100 curate them and figure out what's popping up the most so that you're going to stand out and have the highest chance of qualifying for as many jobs as possible that's my recommendation that's exactly what I teach in my types of courses and that's how we've curated the curriculum for specifically entrylevel developer positions regardless I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see
