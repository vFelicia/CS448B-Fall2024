hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so first of all I just like to start off by saying happy holidays to everyone Merry Christmas I hope you guys are enjoying the holidays and you guys are having a good break from whatever it might be they usually do like work or school or whatnot and today I just wanted to show kind of like a beginner level video because I know a lot of you guys are just starting off with Python they're watching my content and I felt find that this might be helpful and obviously it's a lot more fun when you're learning to be able to like make games and apply your knowledge doing something like that rather than like math related programs or whatnot okay so in today's video I'm gonna be showing you how to make you choose your own adventure game now this adventure game the pretty much the way works is we're gonna be asked questions by the console based on your answer you're gonna be let down different paths and based on what path you eventually lead up on you either going to lose the game or you're going to win the game now obviously you can make these as long as you want I've seen people make choose your own adventure games that go for like you could probably play them for like half an hour just keep typing and going and going and going and the way we're gonna do this is just by nesting if statements and health statements and elif's and by using like input and some basic commands in Python that if you guys are familiar with you will already know I'm just gonna be showing you how to kind of apply them quick sidenote as it is Christmas if you guys would like to give a Christmas gift to me just know that I do have a patreon donation link and a PayPal donation link down below you guys enjoy the content and it helps you out please consider donating as you know I don't make that much off of YouTube and it really keeps me motivated to keep pushing out content for you guys that being said if you can't do that that's perfectly fine I would really appreciate your support with either like a subscribe or just by sharing the video so with that let's get started so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna ask a question and I'm gonna ask the user if they'd like to play the game typically the first thing we do so we're just gonna say oh would you like to play and then what I do is I usually just put the answer I'm expecting in brackets so they know what to type okay so we've got that so we'll say if answer dot lower dot strip equals equals yes then in here we can start playing the game and otherwise so if they type anything other than yes we'll just print that's too bad not mad but right so what this is doing right here is pretty much just checking what this answer is we have don't lower they're just gonna convert whatever the user types into all lower cases and this is going to strip any white spaces from it so if you had like two spaces then you typed yes it'll just strip that off so that we can compare it directly to the string yes and see if they typed like any variation of yes okay so the my game I hadn't really thought about what I'm gonna do for this I'm thinking maybe something like you're being chased and you have to choose like if you're going left or right or if you go down the forest or if you go down the sidewalk I don't know like some random thing it's prolly gonna make no sense but obviously modify this game to be whatever you want I'm sure you guys are a lot more creative than I am and I'm just gonna make it kind of short so that you can see the flow and how it works so what I'm gonna do is ask another questions I'm gonna say answer equals input I'm going to say you what do you call it reach a crossroads would you like to go left or right just a very basic okay or right and then if the user types left we'll go one way if they tape right we'll go the other way and if they type like nothing else then what we'll do is we'll just tell them like they lost like they went down a path that was not acceptable okay just say if answer equals equals left and again we're probably gonna want one adult lower and don't strip this and we can actually do this just by putting it right outside the input this will just save us from having to do it each time we check so we'll just type this once so don't strip answer it you can start left and we'll say L if answer equals equals right and then we'll do a last else statement here and here we'll say print invalid choice and I will just tell the user they lost or not they lost you lost like that right so if they go right then we're gonna take them down a different path and if we go our cert and if we go left or an taking down different paths now if they go left what I'm gonna ask them to do is I'm going to say like you encounter do you want to attack it you want to run away so my god okay just a classic example so say answer equals input and you guys can make these like really long look I'm just doing this very simple I'm sure I already said this but what did we say here we'll say you encounter a monster would you like to run or attack and then in here what we can do and I think you guys are probably getting the idea of how this works now is it check answer again and we'll say if answer equals equals attack then what we'll do is we'll print that was not the greatest idea because you probably don't want to talk a monster that was not the greatest idea and then we will simply say you lost and obviously you probably wanna make this story a lot more detailed and more fun because right now this is kind of a very simple game we'll say else or actually L if answer equals equals run actually you know what let's just do LS because as I tape anything other than attack then we'll just tell them like you got away and then you can keep going so we'll say okay so we'll say print good choice you made it away safely okay awesome and we can ask another question down here which we'll do in just one second okay so let's go back here now in case you guys getting a little bit confused cuz we are working with a bit more code now essentially what's happening here is we're first asking question right if they want to play they say yes we're gonna come in here and we're gonna actually start our game in this game our game right now is what I have highlighted so what you do after you ask the question so you reach crossroads would you like to go left or right is obviously returning it into lower case we're stripping the spaces and we're checking their answer because this is in the same indentation level as when we ask the answer so we check if they say left we check hmm yeah we check if they say right sorry I was kind of getting confused there and then if they say anything else we just tell them they have an invalid choice now based on if they choose left or if they choose right they're gonna be prompt with different questions in this case if they choose left they're gonna say that they encounter a monster would you like to run our attack and then we can go into this part of the story as well as this part of the game if they had the answer right well we don't know we want to do yet but we're gonna put something in here so if they answer right we can say like I don't know what's a good thing to say I'm just gonna tell them they lost here because I don't want to create too many kind of paths but what do you typically do is you create another kind of section like this in here and you have like a ton of different paths and eventually and this is what makes a game more difficult if you have like a ton of different paths and only one of them is correct then you could be going down like a really long path just to find out that you could have never won on that path and that all of the possible like ways to get off or decisions you could have made will lead to you to lose and in earlier decisions you had to make like a correct one okay so in here I'm just gonna say print you walk aimlessly is that how you spell that word maybe to be you write and fall on a patch of ice why not you injure your leg and let's say cannot continue game over okay there you go is that inter tell you spell injure maybe okay anyways alright so let's just test this out right now before I go any further and make sure everything is working so it says what do you like to play I'm gonna type yes and it says you reach crossroads would you like to go left or right so let's see what happens if I go right if I go right says you walk aimlessly to the right and fall in a patch of ice you injure your like and cannot continue game over and there you go so you can see to how that cannot work so if we run it again then we'll type yes again Oh since I have this slash we got out of that so you have a shoe type yes correctly okay you reach crossroads would you like to go left to right so let's go up left now if we go left says you encounter monster would you like to run or attack so if we run away it says good choice you made away safely and then this is where we're gonna continue our game so I hope you guys can see how this is working okay so in here blast one more questions I think I might wrap up the game because thank you guys are getting an idea of how exactly to do this so we'll say answer equals input and we'll say hmm you see I ate let's see here a car and a hmm coin let's see here which would you like to take and we'll give them the options here which I know I haven't been doing but we'll add this in now and then again we can check one more time we'll save answer equals equals plane we'll do something here else if they type anything else still a car or any any other word then we'll do what's in the else so the type plane will say print unfortunately wow that was really messed up spelling unfortunately you do not know how to fly plane and therefore game is over we'll do that or someone K you do don't know how to fly dot dot dot and then we can just say game over otherwise we'll say print and I don't really know what the objective of this game was but we can just say you won something like that okay so you know obviously see this game makes like really no sense there's no story line to it it's not the point of the tutorial tutorial is to show you how we can kind of nest stuff like this so yeah hopefully this gives you an idea of how you can kind of make your own choose your own adventure game obviously you would want to keep going creating more paths and it makes a good game if you make some paths where you don't lose on one of the decisions so for example one we're going right or going left we don't lose on like both of those paths so right we'll give us a new path and this way it makes it more interesting it makes it more depth of the game and obviously you can play it a lot more times so anyways I think I'm gonna wrap up the video here that's been it for coding a choose your own adventure game in Python and actually one last thing I'll just show you in case any of your still around here is if you want to make this gameplay on repeat so you never break it and you're gonna keep playing you put while true like this and then you tab all of this in I don't know why that's not tabbing okay and then inside of the else statement you say break like this what'll happen is this will continuously run until they eventually type anything other than yes to play again and if they don't type yes it will break out and it will end the game okay so that's when at 4 choose your own adventure game in Python if you guys enjoyed please make sure you leave a like and subscribe to the channel and I will see you again in future videos
