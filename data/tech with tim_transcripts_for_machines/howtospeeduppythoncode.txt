how can we speed up our python code well one way to do this is to actually use C code as an extension to our python library or whatever it is that we're creating now python is really built on top of C A lot of people don't know this but there's a lot of you know functions and things that you're actually using that are written natively in C and that python kind of just has an extension for that allow you to use them so if you need to create something that's going to run very quickly in Python and you can't use a different language what you can actually do is write that algorithm and see and import it into your python code as an extension so you can run that code faster than if you had just written it natively in Python
