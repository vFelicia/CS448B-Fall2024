thank you in this video I'll share with you exactly what I would do if I was a complete beginner starting completely from scratch and wanted to make a hundred thousand dollars from development or programming now there's a lot of different ways to go about doing this however I think what I'm going to lay out here is probably the fastest route to go to making that kind of money but I do want to mention that this is going to skip over some of the fundamental skills that I may have mentioned in some of my other videos talking about how do you master python or the road to becoming a selftaught developer all those other kind of videos those are really focused on how do you build all of these skills that are going to be important in a longterm career a skill that you need to land a fulltime position that could be paying you way more than a hundred thousand dollars a year this video is really focused on okay my main goal is how do I make this money as quickly as possible and that's going to mean skipping out on a bunch of the skills that you don't need to get immediately into some jobs that can pay you a good amount of money so hopefully that makes a little bit of sense to you but let me dive into this kind of road map or guide and share with you exactly what I would do so the first thing I would do before I touch any programming languages get into any code is I would figure out what Niche I wanted to get into now the niche that I would pick would be the thing that had the lowest barrier to entry so essentially required the least amount of time but gave me the highest value skill relative to the time put in now there's a lot of niches like backend developer full stack developer where you can make a ton of money if you master that talk however that's probably going to take you months if not years to really get to a point where you're job ready so you probably want to be picking something that's a little bit less intimidating kind of less uh work right just less skill required so you can actually go out there and start making money as fast as possible so I'll list out a bunch of niches here and then I'll give you an example of one that's probably the best for beginners just in terms of how much money you can make doing it and how easy it is to really dive into so we have stuff like basic web design we have ecommerce we have Shopify we have mobile development data science machine learning in infrastructure devops cyber security game development I could go on and list like a bunch of different niches here right in the programming field now any one of these niches are going to be a good one to get into but you want to be picking the highest value you want right which one could I start charging money for immediately now if you check out the sponsor of this video which is free mode you'll see that they actually have an entire boot camp on Shopify and ecommerce development now this is probably the best Niche to dive into because this requires essentially basic frontend developer skills like CSS HTML JavaScript but you don't have to be an absolute expert to use these platforms right or to make a Shopify store this is kind of a low code platform this is something that almost any of you watching this video could probably do in the next two or three weeks with very minimal coding no and this is a very high value skill because a lot of people right now have ecommerce stores need maintenance done on them they need you to build a store for them they need you to go and add a custom page or some cool animation or JavaScript you know code on the website and this is something you can get paid a significant amount of money to do you with very limited skill set you actually think of what's required to go out there and build a website in 2022 it's very basic knowledge of programming and knowing how to use one of these kind of editors right Shopify Wix WordPress whatever it made so I would personally probably go into something like frontend development learn just the absolute Basics pick up some kind of platform right like Shopify Wix WordPress Squarespace and then immediately go out there into the free market and start charging money for it now if you check out fremo from the link in the description you'll see that this is exactly what their course kind of aims to do right that's what it tries to teach you how do you go from zero knowledge of programming to getting paid as quickly as possible and that's why I actually put them on this video as a sponsor because it's just the most fitting thing I could think of right this is a real world example of okay you're a complete beginner learn the basics that you need immediately start making money from it get into some real world projects have some mentors have some Live support and that will push you very very quickly into a position where you can charge money for these skills that you've obtained so hopefully that makes a bit of sense but first step here is really pick your Niche figure out what it is that I want to learn and what's going to make me the most amount of money as quickly as possible then move on to the next steps so after you've picked your Niche and you have some kind of vision or some kind of direction that you're going to be going in now you have to actually acquire this skill now this is going to be different and take a different amount of time depending on what Niche you want to go into and what you're focused on but for me personally I would probably look for some kind of course or some kind of comprehensive resource whether it's free or whether it's paid they gave me everything I needed in one place ideally I'm trying to do this as quickly as I can so I don't want to be spending hours searching every day for free resources or just looking for all different kinds of stuff I kind of want everything in one place and I want someone who's qualified to be kind of guiding me into what I need to learn one of the hardest parts when you're just getting started is figuring out what you need to learn then you actually have to go and learn it so for me I would try to skip the figuring out what I need to learn part and just pay someone to tell me that whether it's through a call or a mentorship or I'm paying for a course I'm going in a mini Boot Camp or whatever it may be but if I was doing this as fast as I could then I would just pay to try to do that now if I didn't have the money to pay for that then I would obviously have to build a curriculum on my own go and consult a lot of kind of free resources and then go and learn all these topics from whatever free place I could find now that's 100 doable that would just definitely take me longer and I'd spend you know a good amount of time kind of searching for these resources as opposed to having them in a single place so that's what you got to do in this section I wish I could give you more actionable advice but you have to find a place you can learn what it is you need to learn and then go and learn it all right now step three and this can kind of be intertwined with step two is going to be to find some kind of support group or Mentor or network where you can validate that you actually know what you're doing so once you've learned some of the basics so once you're getting into the point where you're acquiring this skill to be able to build the confidence to sell your services you need to know that you actually have some idea what you're doing right you need someone to tell you that knows what they're doing hey yes this is correct yes you're doing this right yes you're not an idiot right yes you're not wasting your time you just need some validation to build that kind of internal confidence so that you can then feel like oh I can go apply for jobs now I can go and actually make some money I can go and charge people on Fiverr or upwork or whatever it's gonna be I know this step is what holds a lot of people back they've learned all this stuff usually on their own and now they're like well you know I think I'm there but I don't know if I'm there and they have this kind of lack of confidence right they have the Imposter syndrome where they don't push themselves to The Next Step because they think there's so much more stuff they still need to learn so personally for me I would look for either kind of like a free community or I would look for a paid Mentor or someone or something where I could validate what I know and I could go and check off the box and say yes I know how to do this yes I know how to do this oh I missed that one okay I gotta go back and learn that topic and then once I felt confident I was like okay I know what I'm doing other people are kind of at my level they're making money doing the same thing I am I'm gonna go now and jump in and kind of start the money making process right so now that you've done that you've picked your Niche you've learned the skills you've got some kind of validation some mentors maybe like a little group or some community that you're a part of where you can kind of ask questions and validate what you know now it's time to make money right okay gotta go out there and actually earn some dollars so for me what I would do is just immediately start applying to any kind of freelance or contractor jobs that I could find and I would do as many as possible because as a freelance developer I can take on a hundred jobs right I can work 14 hours a day I can do as much as I want to do and I can work on any kind of schedule whereas if I try to go for a fulltime job that's probably going to take me a lot longer to acquire there's probably going to be some higher requirements especially if the company is offering benefits if there's inperson interviews if they have this whole long process that's going to be a slower Avenue to me making money as quickly as possible so you have you know the two routes you can go and kind of do it freelance on your own which is what I would feel comfortable doing or you can go and try to jump into some kind of jump now I know for a lot of people getting just a fulltime gig is a little bit more comforting right that's kind of what they're used to that's what they've done before but for me personally I've always kind of made money on my own so that's what I would probably kind of lean towards okay how can I maximize my income and not be limited by a single number that I negotiate one time when I go in for a job interview so I would post my stuff on Fiverr on upwork I would go and find any kind of contract stuff that I could so anyone looking for work and I would spend a significant amount of time just constantly reaching out to people and saying can I do this for you can I do this for you how can I help you blah blah I'm trying to get as much work as possible so how would I do that well I might go on LinkedIn and find people that are looking for specific developers I might go to people I know that have say a Shopify store or need a game developed or whatever Niche I'm in and again offer my services and just keep going and going and going and getting as many clients as humanly possible now there's so many different ways to go about doing that this isn't kind of like a marketing or sales video I won't claim to be an expert in that field but that's what I would do I'd go out and try to get as many freelance gigs as possible now at the same time once I started taking on a few gigs and I felt it confident I might even start trying to teach people what I know maybe someone's a complete beginner and maybe I can mentor them a little bit maybe I can give them a basic tutoring session on how to use Shopify I can explain something to them I would take on side gigs as well and just really do anything that I thought could make me money right so I might even start a blog I might start a podcast I might make some YouTube videos that's definitely a longer term play but you guys could see where I'm at now and that's what I started doing well before I was like a good programmer I was a beginner programmer yet I was still teaching people that were even more beginner than me how to get to you know one step further in their Journey so that's personally what I would kind of do I would take on major contract work where I try to get some big contracts a bit of security in terms of the income then I would in my free time if I didn't have any work to do be building out some kind of side business or side gig okay I'm gonna do a blog post okay I'm gonna do a YouTube video okay I'm gonna do a podcast whatever something where there's the potential to grow a little bit of an audience and then hopefully from that audience I can get some clients or I can start to monetize the Audience by doing sponsorships advertising whatever again much longer term play but even if you add a hundred people that read your blog the chance that one of them is looking for the service you're offering is fairly High you could probably get you know a few clients from doing it so that said I think I'll wrap up the video here hopefully you guys were able to get a little bit of value from this obviously this is not easy to do I'm never going to tell you it's easy to go out there and make a ton of money from programming but is 100 possible hundreds of thousands if not millions of people do it every single year and you really just gotta push yourself and kind of find the motivation to go out there and start because I promise you if you do you will not regret it that said I hope you
