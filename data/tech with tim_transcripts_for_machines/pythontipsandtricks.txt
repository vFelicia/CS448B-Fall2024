hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video I am gonna be showing you some cool tips and tricks that you can use in the Python programming language now most of these tips are very specific to Python and you probably don't even know they exist but they're definitely gonna be able to save you a lot of time programming and they make things a lot easier so one of the great things about the Python language is it has a lot of builtin functions methods even modules that you can use to help you program and it's built around all the things that are wrong with other programming languages essentially so a lot of these tricks are you having here you probably don't even know exists and can save you a ton of time and a ton of work so go ahead and make sure you watch through the whole video is I'm going to be going through eight tricks in this one I'm gonna do a part two video later on but these tricks will save you a lot of time and when I found out about them I was very excited because I no longer had to go through rigorous coding to perform somewhat simple tasks so let's go ahead and get started and this first one kind of solves a problem that a lot of programs will run into if you're trying to well solve problems so that what you want to do is you want to have the index of a list and you also want to have the element in that list so I'm just going to write a list here to start and in this case I'm just gonna do a B and C very simple for the purpose of the example now what you would want to do essentially in a for loop is you'd want to have well the index of the item P also want to know what the item is so what you typically would write is something like this you'd say for X in and let's say alright actually we're gonna start we're gonna make it another variable hit respess a counter equal zero I'm gonna say for X in Li and then what you do is you increment counter plus equals 1 every time you run the for loop on and I can be print for example at counter and X so that you could know what index your elements at um I'm just gonna move this actually below print because that doesn't make sense what element your is like the index for your element and then you also won't know what the element is so you ID print them here so I'm printing the counter and then I'm printing X so you can see if I run program I get 0 a 1 B 2 C now that's great but you had to use this counter what python does it actually allows you to do this without using this counter variable in to shorten an upper limit so I'm going to show you how we do that here so free first of all it goes for I and then item in and now this is the keyword enumerate like that okay and then you just put your listing here so in this case Li and now what its gonna happen is I is gonna be assigned index of your element so in this case when we're going through first it's gonna be assigned 0 for a item is gonna be assigned to a so now you have both of them with two separate variables and you didn't have to make this counter variable so I'll show you how it works out again we'll print I and then item like that see if we run the program we get the same thing and we just shortened up two lines we no longer need to count your variable and we no longer need to we'll define that we're incremented at top so that's really useful you're gonna notice you use this a lot especially when you're trying to solve problems so that's a really cool one the next one I'm gonna talk about and a lot of you probably will know this but this is really cool as well especially if you're trying to print stuff to the console is you can actually do something called string multiplication in Python now it seems weird in most cases you can only add strings together called concatenation but you can actually multiply them in Python so I'll show you an example I have a string like Hello if you wanted to print this string like 4 times to the screen in other languages what you do is you do something like this plus S oh I have a capital S at the end there so let's just print it four times and you get hello hello hello right but what if you wanted to print this a hundred times you don't want to constantly keep adding maybe you go through a four loop to add all the esses together anyways in Python it's a lot easier all you have to do is s x and then an integer in this case I'm gonna do for now yet hello hello hello hello so that's really cool you can multiply strings together and that's not a useful trick in Python so the next one is a variable swap in this one you'll use a lot especially if you solve I don't know if you solve a lot of problems do you like programming exercises and stuff but you want to change two variables around so you want to change I don't know you want to change a to equal B and B to equal a now what you typically have to do and I'll show you here in any other programming language is what you want to do is you're going to temp ain't have to make a temporary we're gonna say temp equals a a equals B & B heated a like that so now you've effectively changed a to be B and you've changed B so see this I've even made a mistake here this should not be a should be equals temp because after you change a now it's equal to B you still want the value of a so you're gonna have to call that temp variable here that we just created so B equals temp so I'm just gonna do this so that we can kind of see a little bit better okay so now what you want to do in python is it actually makes it a lot easier so you can do is you can just go a comma B equals B comma K now this looks really weird in any of the programming languages probably give you an error but this actually works fine so you can say a equals B and B equals a now I'm just gonna do it one more time because since we already changed B and a up there they're gonna be different and then I if I print to the screen on each go a you can see it's equal to 2 when I print B it's equal to 1 so we had two and one up here but then by running this line it actually changed them around and they're just the reason I ran it twice in case do you understand it's because I changed it up here I just wanted to change it back so you could see from my original variables okay next trick and this one is kind of a similar trick and it's you can actually sign multiple variables to the value of a list so for if I want to make a new list I'm just gonna say Li it goes we'll just go yeah a B and C once again now I can do something like this which looks really weird but actually we're it's fine XYZ equals L I now if I print X I get a print B oh sorry print Y I get B and I print Z I get C so by just running these three variables here it assigns to the same the ones corresponding in the list which again any other programming language you think is like what the heck you can actually do that but yes that is something you can do now I'm just gonna restart this idea leaks I don't like working at the bottom it what about but I want it to be easier and you can see at the top so the next trick that I have here and this is one you might know about and it's really useful if you're trying to use like someone's else's modules or you want to figure out what a function does without having to look it up and it's called help function now it seems like oh why would I need to use this but it's actually extremely useful so you can call this on any function so for example I call help on the function Len then you see we get help on builtin function Len in module builtins it says length it gives you the parameters so we need an object and then it returns the number of items in a container and that tells you what that oh so if I go help on function range for example then it goes through all the stuff that the range function does that you probably didn't even know so it runs through that pretty much the doc string of this function and it tells you all the things that you can do with well with that function so I'm just gonna open it again because I don't like working at the bottom I'm sure there's a way to clear it but I don't really know so we're just gonna do this for now the next one is similar and this one is actually called dirt now what this is gonna do is is actually gonna list all of the methods that you can use on a certain class so for example the class string has a ton of different methods like dot um I don't know what's a string method dot strip something like that right dot upper dot lower so if you run this it prints all of the different methods that exist on this class so we have our strip split split lines and then if you don't know what one of these does you can just go ahead and call the help function on that so you do I think it's like STR and then dot and then whatever one you want something it's our split well that should give us something maybe let's see yeah so then it says help on the method and it goes through and tells us exactly what our split does and that's really useful ok the next trick in Python and this is pretty well known but I just wanted to show in case some of you guys didn't know what it's called list comprehension and it's a way to create a list within one line without having to use a for loop so I'll show you what I mean here so we can actually do is you can do something like Li and that's just stands for list by the way I'm gonna say it is equal to X for X and range ten if X modulus two equals equals zero and now I'll break this down on what this actually does for us so it's gonna say the list is equal to X so an element X for X in range 10 so now what this is gonna do is gonna run X 10 so zero to nine and now I'm just saying I'm only gonna add this element X if it's divisible by two so if it's an even number pretty well and I'll just show you what if I print a lie like this we get zero two four six eight and you can do this with multiple statements you can change this around so for example I can say 1 for X and range 10 now if I just wanted to create a list of ones so 10 ones then that's what I'm doing here I get 1 1 1 1 1 and so on like that so that Driscoll I didn't say Li equals it just gave me that list you can see how that works and you can do multiple lists you can you can do a list inside of the list so you could say for X and range let's see oops nice and I'm like typing here and then we get 5 MP lists inside of another list and that's really useful in Python because in other languages if you want to create a list you'd have to do something like 4x in range 10 and then you'd have to do list dot append and so on so this gonna crash just cuz you can't use lists like that but anyways then you have to end the list and that means you need at least three lines cuz you have to create the list up there whereas in Python you can just do it in one and that saves a lot of time so the last two that I'm gonna get in here into here are just some functions that you can use on strings which are really really useful and they save a lot of effort so I'm just gonna copy a list that I've already have typed out here just to save us some time let me say hello ABC so on just a bunch of random words and letters and now there's a function called reversed and python now what this allows us to do is pretty well just reverse the list so I'm gonna say reversed Li and then if I it's cuz I didn't print it to the screen my bad we reversed Li hmm interesting why this isn't working to this it's cuz it's an object print list reversed Ella and they said look there we go so now we get a list that's reversed and so is tech Tim and so on like that what was happening here is I was literally just printing the actual function I wasn't converting it into a list so yeah that's why that wasn't working so anyways reversed Li it reverses the list next one is gonna be sorted so I'm gonna do the same thing here so I'm just gonna say print sorted and I'll just put a list around it in case this gives gives us an error again and then I'm gonna sort that list that I have a bit should I say sort Li and there we go now we get a sorted list based on alphabetical order now with this sorted function you can actually use something called keys which are again really useful so I'm just gonna do the same thing here just print this again and in this sordid function which can do a comma and I'm gonna say key is equal to Len now I'll give you a second to guess what this is gonna do just think about it if I add something called key equals Len you might be kind of confused but think at what this might give us so I'm gonna run the function and you can see now it actually gives us a list not sorted alphabetically but sorted by length so we go shortest to longest and again say you wanted it to go longest to shortest then you could just reverse this list using the reversed function and you would get that sorted list in the opposite order okay so now the last one that I'm gonna show you is this cool thing that you can do in IDL you might have seen me use it once so pretty much when we're ever running something on the console I want to save some time we don't keep using copy and paste if you put your cursor on any line in here so for example I'm gonna go print and just before right after the arrows and then you just click enter it's actually gonna copy whatever was on that line so after your cursor on to the next like the next running line in the editor which is really useful if you're trying to run the same thing over and over and test a program or just change like the argument so you don't have to keep typing it or copying and pasting and another thing that you can do is you could do something and this is kind of goes with that is if I just click underscore like this it's going to actually give me the last output here so let's do a better example I do a equals F and I'd do it hey gives me F like that right now if I just type an underscore and hit enter it gives me the last output that I got from my from my console here from my like ID le whatever you're running so again if I do something like B equals four nice type b and i do an underscore it's just gonna print simply what we just last have i don't know why that's useful but it's something that's cool I didn't say all these tricks were super useful but that's just another cool one that you can use like that so anyways that has been it for part one of this tips and tricks video in Python and the next one I'm gonna go over some more advanced tips and maybe some more useful tips these ones are kind of like the generic ones the cool ones people typically learn when they first start out in Python the next ones I'm going to be using collection types and these ones are seriously gonna save you a lot of time so make sure you look out for that video if you're more advanced with Python and you already knew some of these tricks anyways I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in another one
