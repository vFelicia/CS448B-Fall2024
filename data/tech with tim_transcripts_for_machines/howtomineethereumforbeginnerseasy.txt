hey guys welcome back to another video in today's video I'm gonna be talking about mining and more specifically mining aetherium so today we're just gonna go through the very basics on how to actually start mining and I'm just gonna explain a little bit of what mining is right now before we get started so pretty much what mining is is using computational power so using graphics cards it's more specifically in your computer to secure transactions so whenever a transaction is sent on the blockchain which is how aetherium works it's built on the blockchain all of those transactions go through a bunch of different computers where they then secure that transaction and they are given a very small reward for doing so so just like a fee at a bank that's the same thing that you're getting on your computer for doing amount of work okay so that's really basics of how mining works I'm not gonna explain exactly how to do that if you want to see that go look up another video where I'll make another one on my channel another day okay so the first thing we need to do when we have to start mining is we have to make sure we have the right hardware so pretty much any computer will work as long as it has a graphics card or multiple graphics cards that have 4 gigabytes or more of video RAM so for example the 1050 Ti has 4 gigabytes of video RAM so that will work the RX 480 has 8 gigabytes of video RAM that will work anything that has less than that so if you have a three gigabyte card that will not work for mining ok so now that we've got that over with let's download our miners so what we're gonna actually have to do if we're mining and we're just starting out we don't have a huge factory yet of mining rings we're gonna have to mind with a pool so if you mind with a pool that means you're gonna get more and more transactions going through your computer and the only downfall of mining with a pool is that they actually take a 1% fee but really that's not that much you can see the 1% fee is here it's a lot faster than doing it alone so you're gonna want to mind with a pool ok so how to connect we're just gonna scroll down this page it's on ether mine org I'm gonna leave that in the description there's a lot of different pools you can use if you want but this is the one I'm gonna be doing a tutorial and is this one that I use personally ok so now we're gonna look for claymores miner this miner works with AMD cards and NVIDIA cards and that's why I use it because I have a combination of both so this one also will work if you have two AMD cards two Nvidia cards whatever this is the one that most people use okay so we're just gonna go to this windows link right here it says Bitcoin talk thread now my Internet's quite slow so actually already have the link opened up here and now you're gonna see this huge thing features whatever all you want to look for is Google right here or mega either way that you want to download it I personally just go with Google you click on that link and it should bring you to a page that looks like this and it is a shared Google Drive right here that has all the different versions of Claim worst miner so all you're gonna do is you can click on one and then you're gonna go up here and you're gonna click on the download button now obviously I already have it downloaded so I'm not gonna do that but you just pick whatever version you want and then download it try to look for the most recent one okay now that we've done that we can put this aside and we should have our miner so you're gonna get a folder that has a bunch of different things and it's gonna be this exact name it's gonna say claymores dual aetherium minor I personally I just renamed it to minor because it looks cleaner on my desktop okay so now that you've done that you want to open it up and now inside you're gonna see a bunch of different stuff and there is something we need to do here so we actually need to create a new text file so we're gonna go new and then text document now I just like to name this ether mine or start or go so in this case I'm just going to name it go doesn't really matter what you name it as long as it's different from everything else in the folder so I'm just gonna name it go then I'm gonna click Edit it's gonna load us up into the text document here and now we're gonna refer back to the first website we were on ether mind don't work now underneath claymores here there is a white box that has all this different stuff here you don't have to worry about what any of this means all you have to do is copy it like that so ctrl C and paste it into your text document now the last line is what we're gonna be associating ourselves with in just a minute so for right now we're just gonna save and we're gonna move over and create an aetherium wallet so if you do not already have an aetherium wallet you need to follow these steps in making one if you do just fast forward the video a little bit and you'll see when we're using our aetherium wallet okay so I personally like to use a website called my ether wallet comm I'm gonna put that link in the description again you can use any etherium wallet you want any etherion website however you like to do it but this is the version and the website that I use personally so what we need to do is we need to create a new wallet so we're right here it says new wallet just make sure that's selected and now we're gonna create a password obviously you want to make sure this is very secure as this gonna encrypt you one of your files that you need to use to open your wallet so in this case I'm gonna do the most secure password I know one two three four five six seven eight because I already have a wallet so doesn't matter alright we're gonna create our new wallet oh it has to be at least nine characters okay there we go one two three four five six seven eight nine now what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to download this keystore file so make sure you keep this safe I'm gonna click it right now to download to show you make sure you keep it on multiple devices so maybe a laptop and your desktop or you have an offline location like a USB Drive because you do need that to access your wallet now your private key same thing with this you're gonna want to copy this and put it in a text document I don't really need this because I'm not actually gonna use this wallet but this is another way that you can access your wallet okay so save that and then move on so now if you want to unlock your wallet you can use the keystore file that you just downloaded so from your downloads if I can find my downloads and you have to type in the password alright like that and then you should be able to unlock your wallet and see your balance okay so that's it that's all I'm going to show you for your wallet now what you need to do is you need to actually take your private key so just if you scroll down after opening up your wallet there's something that says your address so sorry not your private key this is your public key is what it's known as you're just gonna copy this to your clipboard is we're gonna need to use this for the next step so this is actually what you can send all your aetherium to so this is how the miner is gonna recognize you and how you're gonna be sent aetherium okay so copy that and then we're gonna go back to that notepad that we made I hope you didn't close it yeah so right here we can see in these greaterthan signs and less than signs it says your aetherium address so obviously our address is what we just copied so what we're gonna do is we're gonna paste it right in there and we can get rid of the greater than and less than signs okay and now your rig name so you can call this whatever you want the only reason they have this is for people that have multiple rigs so they can know if one goes offline if one is online and so on so in this case I'm just gonna call mine bedroom because guess where my computer's all right and now the last step is choosing what pool we want to go with so this is our pool right here but there is different pools within this pool at different servers right here so there is us1 us2 EU and then Asia one so according to where you live you're gonna choose the appropriate one so in this case I live in Canada but the closest one to me would be US one so I'm gonna use u.s. one now the numbers at the end here indicate which one is the correct like key that you need to put in kind of I don't know how to exactly know how to explain it I just pick one of these numbers so for us one you can use either one four four four four or four four four four in this case we're just gonna stick with what we have here so four four four four actually you know what we'll put the one there just because all right and then if you're using Asia you can use the other ones like this okay so here it says you either mind or all right now all we need to do is we need to change the file extension here so that this runs as a batch file so we need to do is we do file save as and now you're gonna change this save type to all files and you're going to do instead of go dot text you're gonna do go dot bat so that stands for batch file and you're just gonna save it in the same directory as where your miner folder was so where you made that text document okay so we go ahead we've saved that so now all we need to do to start mining is we actually need to find that file so go to about and double click it now you can see it loads up a bunch of different text here it's going to be slow especially the first time you run of configuring some files so just let it run so here it's detected my two graphics cards that's good if it doesn't do that you can have to play around with some of the settings you've got going on your computer to make sure that that happens now it's creating the buffer so we're just going to wait a second to see when it starts mining okay so just give it a minute just creating all these buffers this does take a minute or two and while we're doing that we can actually go to the ether mind website to get ready to see if our miner is actually working now this is a good website you can use to track your miners progress say you're out and you want to make sure that your miner is still online it's still running you can do so from that website so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just paste my address into the address thing up here and click enter like so uh now I'm gonna click accept and close and you can see obviously nothing is running right now because I haven't started running now there you go you can see that we've loaded up here and we see the speed so our mega hashes per second for each of the GPUs like so now I'm just gonna close mine because I am recording a video right now so I want to make sure that the frames stay okay now when you do that you should be able to see in a few minutes so it does take a minute or two once your miners running you'll hear the fans on your GPUs run up and then once you've punched in your address here you should if by refreshing the page be able to see the hash rate come up and the active workers and then down here it'll give you a bunch of graphs and it'll tell you all your workers and your estimated payout so if you go to payouts and rounds you can see how much your estimated to make per month obviously it's zero right now because my minor is not run and yeah that's pretty much it for how to mine aetherium
