in this video i'll show you how to generate a random number in python to do this we need to import the random module then we can say num is equal to random dot rand int and then the start and stop of our range so if i start at 0 and end at 10 then i can generate a random number between 1 and 10 including both 1 and 10. let's print out num and do it a few times and notice we get a bunch of random numbers now another way to do this is using rand range if you use rand range it will start at this number stop at this number meaning this is not included in the possible numbers so right now we'll generate a number between zero to nine and then you can also include what's known as a step now the step by default is one but if you put a step here it will only generate numbers within the range that have this step so what i mean by that is we'll have zero two 6 8 as possible numbers for this so if i run this now we only get even numbers because we're only generating numbers by stepping by 2. hopefully you found this helpful if you did then follow for more
