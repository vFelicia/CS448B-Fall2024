hello everybody and welcome back to the youtube video so in today's video i'm gonna be walking you through my buying guide for a programming laptop now i get asked the question all the time is four gigs of ram enough it's eight gigs of ram enough do i need an i5 do i need an i7 and so in this video i'm going to focus heavily on the specs of a computer and just kind of what you should look for in terms of specs and features in any laptop that you're going to buy for programming so i'm going to start with the bare minimum requirements the absolute minimum i would recommend for any device that you're going to use for programming then i'll give you kind of my recommended configuration for a decent experience i'll talk about some nice to have features and then we'll get in and talk about some specific exceptions so say you're working with you know 3d games you're doing ios apps what kind of machines you might need for that and finally i'll end off by just walking through a few laptops that look good to me that i would personally recommend so that being said let's go ahead and get started and talk about what you should look for in a programming laptop so i'm going to get started by discussing the bare minimum requirements that i would recommend for a programming laptop of course you could go lower than these if you're really on a budget but i would personally recommend saving up until you can buy a device that has these kind of specs just because your experience is going to be much better and you're going to be using that really cheap device maybe for a year or two before you decide to upgrade anyways when all of the new software can no longer run on it anyways let me go through the specs so starting with system memory i'm gonna recommend you have at least four gigabytes of system ram this is because a lot of programs require at minimum four gigabytes of ram to run and if you want to run multiple programs at the same time without having them be drastically slower than they usually would be you're gonna want four gigs of ram even in today's age that's a little bit low but for some basic programming tasks that's totally fine and four gigs should be fine next i'm going to recommend you get a quad core processor so this is going to bring the price up on the computer that you're going to be purchasing it's going to push it you know over a few hundred dollars probably but buying something like a pentium or celeron processor which are dual core processors they're just gonna be very slow and for programming it's just not gonna be a good experience whatsoever i'd highly recommend saving up to get a quad core processor something like an i3 or an i3 equivalent on the amd side i'm not quite sure exactly what that model number would be after that i would recommend having about 120 gigabytes of disk space yes you could go with something like 60 gigs disk space but there is some quite large packages and applications when you're programming and combined with say a windows install or a linux installer whatever operating system it is you're going to be running out of storage quite quickly if you don't have at least 100 gigabytes after that we're going to be talking about operating system what you're going to want to look for typically is windows mac or linux those are kind of the three options you have yes you could use something like ios so you could buy maybe a cheap mobile phone and try to use that for programming or maybe an ipad or a tablet or something like that but you're going to be highly limited to what you can download what programs you can use and what code you can run if you don't get one of those three mentioned operating systems another thing to be careful with is look out for devices that are running running windows s mode that is kind of like the mobile version of windows it comes with a lot less features than your standard windows and only allows you to download things from the windows store you can turn off windows s mode and put it to a fullfledged windows install but that uses a lot more system resources is going to be very slow on that device if it's meant to run windows s mode so personally i would recommend going with linux if you are comfortable with that operating system something like ubuntu is really easy to get used to if you're not coming from a linux background and it will be much faster on a device like this so that's kind of what i'm recommending for the bare minimum essentials of course if you can't afford that you can definitely code simply using any kind of web browser so whatever device you have if it has a web browser you can write code and you can actually start learning and experimenting and that's totally fine but to start doing anything locally you're going to want the specs that i just mentioned so i'm going to quickly list three websites here that i think you should consider if you're someone who has a lower end machine or just want to experiment with coding and don't want to worry about installing and downloading anything first one is called replit this is a browserbased ide so repl it totally free you can write and test code in the cloud next one is google collaboratory this is specifically for python users but you can actually run a jupyter notebook and execute that in the cloud with hardware acceleration as all as well for free so that's like having access to a gpu to train a machine learning model or something like that and then finally there's vs code code spaces i actually don't know how new this is and how accessible it is but i do know that this is visual studio code in the cloud and that essentially means you can use a fullfledged code editor on the cloud on another device totally for free so check those three things out if you have a lower tier machine or you're just looking to kind of get started without needing to download install and set everything up on your own machine so now time for my recommendation for kind of a decent pc that's going to give you a good experience that's not going to be super fast but it's definitely not going to be slow and it's going to be able to achieve kind of all the programming stuff that you want so i'll start by recommending eight gigabytes of system memory you really don't need any more than this eight gigabytes is plenty when you're doing programming and i personally can't think of many situations where i've been doing some kind of programming stuff and needed more than eight gigabytes of memory now of course if you're doing something with machine learning loading large data sets where you want just a ton of different things open at once maybe you're running like three instances of android studio then you might want some more system memory but eight gigabytes is enough you definitely do not need more then i would recommend a i5 processor or higher you also probably could get away with an i3 but sticking with kind of the last recommendation just a quad core processor something modern and something that's just going to be kind of fast right that's what we're looking for so an i5 equivalent or an i5 i don't know what all the amd model numbers are otherwise i would list them next you're going to want to go with probably about 250 gigabytes of storage or more again really depends on what you're going to be using this for and how much you're going to be downloading but i feel like 250 gigs is enough for most people if you have a ton of different applications you might want to go up to 500 gigabytes and a nice feature to look for here would be an ssd so not all computers come with ssds i know it's much more common now but looking for some kind of ssd just means your storage is going to be a little bit faster and that's just going to make for a better experience especially kind of in your daytoday use on the operating system loading things up moving files around so on i also like to mention here to look for stuff that has a usbc port this is kind of a newer port i guess but this is pretty important if you want to think about future proofing your device a lot of the accessories that are coming out now are usbc of course you could dongle stuff but it's just nice to have a really fast port on the computer and i always recommend people look out for usbc next i would recommend that you look for something that has a large screen if this is going to be the only device you use so if you don't have a desktop at home if you're not planning on plugging in an external monitor i'd really recommend you go with something that's 14 inches or larger yes you can go with the 12 inch screens or the 11 inch screens but i find programming at least for myself if i want to have multiple things open on the screen it's really nice to have that extra inch or two of screen screen real estate especially when you're scrolling through large code files i find it can actually make you a bit more efficient and of course it's just nicer to have that extra bit of space so i always recommend that and then of course you're going to want to look for a decent keyboard on the laptop of course if you're working at home you know you can plug into a monitor you can buy an external keyboard and mouse and you can just use the laptop but if this is going to be something where you're on the go all the time you're actually using the laptop keyboard look for something that you're going to enjoy typing on i know i've heard that lenovo has a really good keyboard and i've had a lenovo laptop that i've used and i can definitely say it's probably the best keyboard i've seen on a laptop other than that that's really all you're looking for for a laptop for programming there's nothing special that you need you don't need a graphics card just eight gigs of ram modern processor enough storage big screen and a nice keyboard that's really what you're looking for you can get all of that for probably under 800. so that is kind of my recommendation for the midtier um you know midtier programming laptop no you're not going to be able to game a ton on this um you know it's not going to be the best thing ever but for programming that's really all you need now last thing i'll say here if you're looking for something that's a bit better kind of some nice to have features maybe you've got an extra few hundred bucks in the budget looking for something that has a lower end graphics card maybe with two gigabytes of video memory or four gigabytes will definitely be great if you want to do something like a little bit of video editing content creation maybe you want to play a few video games whatever it may be having some kind of dedicated graphics card is going to be a great investment and it just you know something to look out for in a nice to have feature also looking for some things that have higher than a 9 19 20 by 1080 display so higher than 1080p like a 2k display or 4k display it's just gonna make the screen that much nicer to look at and again a nice to have if you have the extra bit of budget finally you could go to up to 16 gigabytes of ram definitely not necessary but if you have the money 16 gigs is probably worth it and you will see a little bit of a speed increase so that is kind of my recommendation for the midtier pc now i'm going to talk about some exceptions or sorry midtier laptop i'm going to talk about some exceptions now and things you might want to consider if you're doing some specific programrelated tasks so i'll quickly list a few exceptions here to keep in mind if you're a specific type of developer first if you want to develop anything for ios so you want to make ios apps you want to make mac applications you're going to need a mac operating system unfortunately that's just the way it is that's what we have to deal with and you just need a mac if you want to develop anything or actually push it sorry to the app store for ios for ipad whatever any you know mac related operating system next if you're doing anything related to 3d modeling 3d graphics 3d games you're going to want a graphics card and probably a decent one in your system this is simply because you probably will not be able to test the code that you write unless you have something that can actually run it and depending on how intensive the 3d stuff is that you're doing you're probably going to want a graphics card next if you are a data scientist or someone is dealing with extremely large data sets and you don't want to deal with having to batch everything out you probably want more ram in your system now that is simply because if you're loading really large data sets or doing data preprocessing or whatever it may be it's just helpful to have at least say 16 gigs of ram or 32 gigs of ram although i'm sure you're probably dealing with files much larger than that but just keep that in mind that if you want to be able to load that much into ram well you're going to need that much ram next if you're doing machine learning and you want to do model training locally on your machine you're going to want a graphics card in there that's cuda enabled so a nvidia graphics card that is simply because the major frameworks like pi torch tensorflow can utilize cuda and that graphics card to actually accelerate training and well if you want to do it locally you should have a graphics card of course a lot of these things you can mitigate by just you know running virtual machines or going in the cloud and renting out compute power but if you want to avoid that then keep those few things in mind so what i'm going to do now is just show you a few laptops that i found on amazon and just browsing the web that look to me to be decent value now keep in mind that i have not used any of these laptops and i'm very hesitant to recommend them simply because i don't have them in front of me and i'm not actually able to test and try them out but these are just ones i saw that look to be decent value so i figured i'd show you and you can kind of get an idea of the price range of these machines and what i would consider purchasing had i not already had my own laptop so first i'll tell you guys i use a macbook pro 16inch as my main laptop this is a very expensive laptop for me and canadian dollars it was just over three thousand dollars i'm not recommending that to anyone but i just wanted a very highend laptop and that's what i've used but in the past i've used laptops that were two hundred dollars three hundred dollars five hundred dollars and honestly most of them have been perfectly fine for a lot of the stuff that i needed to do related to programming anyways the first machine that i found here on amazon is coming in at 879 canadian dollars i think that's probably somewhere around 600 650 us dollars and this is the lenovo ideapad flex 5 14 inch laptop so this is a touch panel as well so it actually folds all the way over into a tablet eight gigabytes of ddr4 ram it has an i5 quad core processor 128 gig ssd runs full windows 10 and that's pretty much all it's showing me right here in the listing this looks like a great machine it's got a lenovo keyboard which are known to be really good and this is something that i would definitely think would be good value just you know quickly br looking at the ratings here five and four star looks to be a fine machine and something that i think would be perfect for people with kind of a midrange budget so next i have a bit of a higher end laptop this one is lenovo legion 5. this is a 15.6 inch gaming laptop the main difference here when it says gaming i believe is that it has a high refresh rate display you don't need to look for this for programming at all but 120 hertz display just means that the pixels refresh faster so if you're gaming it's a better experience this has a ryzen 7 processor in it eight gigabytes of ram 512 gigabyte ssd and a graphics card with four gigabytes of vram and this is coming in at 1029 canadian dollars which is probably about 750 800 us dollars so again this looks like a great machine if you had a bit of a bigger budget this would be something i would recommend has the graphics card so you could do a little machine learning a little gaming content creation as well as a very fast processor eight gigs of ram and that high refresh rate display of course is nice next i have something that's a little bit cheaper again this is the hp envy x360 two in one laptop so this is a tablet as well comes with 15.6 inch display ryzen 5 processor 8 gigabytes of memory 256 gigabyte ssd uh it has a backlit keyboard and it runs full windows 10. again good reviews and these are the kind of laptops that i would be looking for and that i would personally recommend in kind of that midtier range of course there's definitely lower end laptops i don't know much about the kind of low end spectrum so i'm not going to recommend any specific machines in that range but i do know that following the recommendations i made earlier you can probably find something that's about 400 500 canadian dollars so maybe like 300 us that will be perfectly fine for programming especially if you're just getting started and not doing anything crazy so anyways that has been this video i would love to hear from you guys what you would recommend any specific models what machine you started to learn programming on and if you found any mistakes in this video of course leave them down below with that being said if you enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe and i will see you all in another youtube video
