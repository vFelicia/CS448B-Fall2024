so moving on to my final recommendation I have something that is very complementary to Python and that is Javascript now JavaScript is my recommendation here because it meshes really well with python now with python you kind of have the back end you can create a web server you can hook up a database you can do all of that with python relatively easily then what you need is some frontend user interface so rather than using python to do that you can use JavaScript you can spin up a simple react server you can use something like angular it's very easy to go and build a project when you know languages like Python and JavaScript you kind of already are a full stack developer when you know these two languages they're the most popular there's tons of resources for them it's very easy to kind of get started with this quite quick
