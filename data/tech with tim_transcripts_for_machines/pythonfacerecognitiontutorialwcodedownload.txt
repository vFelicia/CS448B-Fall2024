hey guys and welcome back to the YouTube video so in today's video I'm gonna be showing you how to perform base and recognition and detection on any image in Python that you want now this script that I wrote that I'm gonna be allowing you guys to download for free in the description down below will show you how you can detect any faces that you want so not just Donald Trump it could be a face of you it could be a face of your friend it could be a face of celebrities any faces that you want and as many as you want in any image that you want to use so a very useful script and I'm going to be walking you guys through first of all just how to install and actually run the script because it does have a few dependencies and then how you can modify it to work in your own setting for your own projects so a little bit less of a tutorial and more of kind of a showcase and how to use the script but hopefully you guys get some value from this and if you do definitely hit the like button and let me know any comments down below so anyways right now you can see I have this script and what it does is just draw boxes around faces and then tries to identify which ones they are based on a list of faces that it's given so you can see that right now if you go to the link in the description there'll be a link it should be titled like download code or something like that and once you do that if you download the zip file that'll be there you'll get a zip file called face rec SEP if you extract that and open up the folder you should see four files that look like this now what you're gonna do is you're gonna place any image inside of this main directory here so instead of face recognition called test jpg and this will be the B file or the image that your program is going to try to find the faces in and detect which ones they are now inside of this faces folder is where you're gonna put your known faces so whatever faces you want to try to detect or recognize you're gonna put them in here and you're just gonna label them whatever face they are so in this case you can see that mine says Bill Gates and if I were to rename this what all you essentially do is you just call them bill gates at whatever the name of the image is here Donald Trump you know musk Jeff Bezos Obama so currently my program that I have can detect these five people and no one else so just put all of the people in here that you want to try to detect and then if it sees something that looks similar to that person well it will detect it and it will put it up on the screen otherwise like you've seen before it'll just show unknown but it will still you wear the face in the image is all right now you can also see that I have a script here which is what you're actually gonna run to run this program and there's a requirements txt file which shows you the Python modules that you need to install now before we can install this and it's very easy the way that I've set this up for you guys we just need to install a C++ compiler for our computer so the way that we do this is you're gonna go to another link I have in the description description and you're gonna download Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition so this free version here so I'm just gonna click free download and I already have this downloaded but I'm gonna walk through the steps with you guys to make sure that you get this correct so once you download this click keep run this installer wait for it to go through this install process and then it's gonna bring you to a menu where it's gonna ask you to install some specific packages and you're gonna have to choose which ones so once we get to there I'm going to show you which ones to pick and then we'll move on to actually looking at the code after that alright so now I mean here since I already have mine installed it looks a little bit different but if I click modify it should bring up a similar menu to what you guys are gonna see and what you need to select here is simply desktop development with C++ so this is the only package you guys need for this program to work this is about 6 gigabytes of file so it will take a few minutes to install but just click on this and then click install now I already have mine installed so obviously I'm not gonna do that but once you finish that you're gonna restart your computer and then you're gonna follow the steps that I'm about to outline now all right so let's close these and now what we're gonna do is we need to get inside of this directory right here so wherever face recognition is where you've extracted this file from and you're just gonna type CMD now it's gonna pop up a command prompt window and what we're gonna do is now try to install the Python modules that this project needs now before we do this we have to make sure that we're running a 64bit version of Python if you if you don't know to check what version you're using just go to uninstall so how to remove programs my bad sorry on windows 10 you can scroll down to wherever it says P so python here and just check what bit version of python you're using again it must be a 64bit if you're not using a 64bit version of python you can uninstall your current version of python and install a 64bit version or just install 64 version and use that or installing all your packages into that alright so once you've done that now you're just gonna type pip install R and then requirements dot txt again since we're in this directory facerecognition and you can see that by just looking here to make sure this is the correct folder what its gonna do is just automatically install all of those modules that I've listed making it really easy for you guys so gonna hit enter enter like that now I already have them installed so mine just kind of whiz through this but yours will take a few minutes to install now if you have any issues with this leave a comment down below as there is a few problems that you could run into but as long as you have that C++ installed and you have a 64bit version of Python you shouldn't run into any issues alright so now that we've done that it's actually time to just run the code now to run the code is really easy all you do is just type Python and then the name of that file so face recognition PI and then it will load up the file for you and start doing that face recognition now it does take a second to boot up but there you go we get Donald Trump and it's recognizing that face now if you want it to change the face again all you do is you go here and just modify this file name to or modify this file so you put a new file called test JPEG and then it will load up that file the next time and do the face recognition on that alright so now that you've I've showed you guys how to use this program I'm gonna show you how this code works just very minimally so that if you want them to try to modify it or use it in your own Python projects you'll have an idea of how to do that so right now I'm just gonna run through some of the functions so what this first function does here is get encoded faces essentially it reads through all of the faces if I can find them here inside of this faces folder and it simply encodes all those faces into a format that the machine learning model that's inside a face recognition can use and actually well yeah used to detect our faces essentially now it's important that you just name these faces in here what they are so in this case I've named this Obama jpg jeff bezos jpg Elon Musk jpg because that's how it's actually gonna label your faces based on whatever labels you put here all right so that's what encoded faces does it just reads through that in title tire folder unknown image encoding simply gets whatever the image name is given and encodes that into a format that again our machine learning model can read and we'll return that same with this returning that as well now what classify face does is all it does is take the name of an image so in this case you can see it down here I'm calling it and giving it test on JPEG so that's the name of the file that I want to do the face recognition for and then is gonna bring up that box and do the detection and show you what face is which but it's also gonna return to you a list of faces so if you see here when I ran this it gave me Donald Trump and unknown so I can actually see which faces are in my image now in here what's happening is we start by getting all the encoded faces as faces so we call this function then we start by actually turning these into a list and into all of the names because this is returned as a dictionary so we say face is encoded is all the values and the names of all those faces are all of the keys then what we do is we read in the image that we've been given so in this case test JPEG if we wanted to we could resize it by using these two lines which I've just commented out because I'm not doing that right now then we find all of the locations of the face in our images in our image by simply passing IMG which again is read in by OpenCV and it's gonna find all of those locations for our faces then what we do is we encode our unknown face which is gonna be that test JPEG image again and now what we do is simply compare all of the faces that we know against the faces in the images and see if any of them are the same now if they are what we do is we draw that little box and we write the name of the face otherwise we're just gonna write unknown and that is simply how this works now this part right here this for loop is responsible for actually drawing on the image if you were to remove this your program would still work it just wouldn't draw anything on the image it would simply just return to you that names of the faces that are in that image and that is essentially how this works I'm not gonna go through much more of it but if you guys have any questions feel free to let me know I hope that you guys can get this script working and it's super useful and kind of interesting to be able to play with and see where it's limited and how works but a massive thank you to ever wrote this face recognition module because it's super useful and simply allows people like me who maybe aren't machine learning experts to use face recognition in all their programs and something that I'm personally using this for is a security system where what it's doing is tracking when certain people come in to certain areas and kind of comparing those video footages and storing that and all that fun stuff so anyways if you guys enjoyed this video
