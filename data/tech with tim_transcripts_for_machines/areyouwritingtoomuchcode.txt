what is the ideal amount of time to spend coding in a day now my answer for this is going to be between five and six hours I find that five to six is really good and I'm getting quite a bit of work done while still staying productive and not really burning myself out or being too fatigued so by the time I'm getting to four four and a half hours there is some drop off in productivity for me that I noticed I start to get a bit tired I'm less focused it's not until I get to that six hour mark where I start to see a more significant drop off and by the time I'm at seven eight Etc I'm now at maybe sixty percent fifty percent productivity and at that point my time is probably better spent doing something else
