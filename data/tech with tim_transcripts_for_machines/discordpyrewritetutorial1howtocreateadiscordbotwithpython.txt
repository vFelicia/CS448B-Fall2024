hey guys and welcome to the first discord rewrite tutorial on my channel just to make this clear really quickly discord rewrite is the new version of discord pie if you've heard of that so if you guys already have discord on PI installed please make sure you watch this entire video because installing discord rewrite is different and the syntax is different and that's we're gonna be using from now on so essentially what we're gonna be doing and what I'm gonna do in this tutorial is I'm first gonna show you the bots that we're gonna work to create and I'll do that in just a second once I get through kind of this intro stuff and then we're gonna be setting up our Python or environment our discord server so that we can connect a bot to that and then we can write some code for that BOTS and get interacting with users so near the end of the video we'll be writing a bit of code that'll only be like two or three minutes just to make sure everything's working do it the rest of the video we're gonna be setting everything up and it actually is quite a few steps to to set this up so please if you don't already have your environment set up and you don't have a discord bog connected please make sure you watched the entire video because I know I'm gonna get tons of questions asking why things didn't work and I'm gonna have to ask you if you watch the video and if you say no I'm just gonna direct you to watch it again so if you guys have any questions and you watched the entire thing you can obviously well contact me on discord on my discord server or you can leave a comment down below but I'm more likely to answer you if you want discord because I check that more often all right so I guess let's get started so essentially I'm gonna use pine charm and and econo to do this now if you already have it set up with IDL e which is just again like the default install that's fine you can use that the code is gonna be the exact same but for my purpose I'm going to use PI charm an anaconda so if you don't use that I'm not gonna promise that it's gonna work now obviously we need a discord server so I have my actual discord server and you can see I already have a bot kind of going in here so I'll show you quickly I'm actually just gonna run my bot I gotta open it up here I'll show you what it looks like when it's actually running and on the server so you guys kind of get an idea so just go with Python um YouTube and discord up I open that up and then we can just run our bots by just clicking this little run icon and now you should see that we have bought and it shows a little Tim bot that's online now I want to see a list of commands I do Tim god help and then it just goes through kind of all the commands as I've set up and you can obviously add more this is just me like messing around with it for an hour I can check my amount of messages and it's tim dot i underscore messages to see how many messages i've sent in the server since I've set the baud up so 33 if I want to see the top users on the server it should be me it'll just say who has the most amount of messages yeah so I have 34 messages and then we can be like the server stats so server stats like that and says users messages days recorded and then average messages per day and we are actually going to go through and probably like graph this information do some cool stuff with this so these are the commands they've set up I can do the member count I won't go through all of them but you guys kind of get the idea and I'm gonna be showing you how to do all of this and more in this tutorial series now I'm not gonna mess with this bot because I already got it working but I'm actually just gonna use a test server for this especially cuz I if you guys steal my like token and all that and I don't care if you mess up my test server but anyways if you don't have a server yet just go ahead and click this plus and click create a server and that's literally all eaten to do give it a name add like at least one text channel should come up with general and then we can actually get to working with a bawd here so now that we've done that what we gonna want to do actually is open up our discord developer portal now you can see here if you so all you have to do to do this is just go to just scored developer portal like that alright and then I'm just doing Stabila / slash or applications I'll leave the link in the description and all this will be up on my website tech with Tim done that you can go look at that as well all the code and everything and if you you shouldn't have anything here so you gonna sign in with your discord so what did I do yeah I've signed it with my discord so do that and then just click create new application like this now you can just give it a name I just named my test server and I already have it here so I'm not gonna do that but just create a new one if you haven't and then you can open this up and so it gives you your client ID and then you're gonna see this thing that says bought so for bought what we're gonna do is we're gonna create a new bot so it should say here I already have one it should say I can add a bot just click yes confirm that and then should give you a bot and I just named mine let's just name this okay that'll be the name of our bot number 4380 now it's gonna ask you to give some permission to this bot now you might not want to make it a minister but you want to make sure that it's able to at least send and see messages so let's do with view channels send messages maybe delete messages read message history mention out everyone and you can pick through which ones you want here but at least give it enough that it's gonna be able to send and look at messages because it needs to do that so we'll do that I'm Save Changes and then we're almost good to go on setting up kind of the discord this point of things so what we're gonna do now actually set up our environment now before I keep going I just want to say quickly this is actually a sponsored video people have Pro xbn they reached out to me and I said hey we're a VPN company and we want to give you and your viewers to discount so I'll actually have a 50% off code if you guys want to want to use this VPN it works on your phone it works on Mac it works on Windows and one account actually will work for everything so they gave me a free account and I've actually been using it for the past like two months I don't have it set up right now but on my Mac and my phone because I'm on university WiFi and I want to make sure that all my stuff is like encrypted and like people can't look through all my information so I use Pro xbn to do that it's actually been like a pretty decent VPN considering a lot of the other ones so this one is 625 a month us but with my discount code you're able to get it for an what's half of that 360 something a month and that's like you don't it's not just the first month like every month you only pay that amount so for 3 bucks to have your information secure and have access to all these features I'll let you guys read through it um go to the link in the description and just you know if you do actually purchase this you're supporting me because I get what do you call it like referral money if you uh if you use this so write this that's about that so we need to do now actually set up our environment so to do that we're gonna use anaconda this is just like a package manager in the conveyor it manager for Python you don't have to use this but again that's what I'm using for the tutorial just click downloads on anaconda again links will be in the description I'm just downloaded 3 7 version if you're on Windows Mac same thing I already have it downloaded but just go through that and it will ask you to add and kondeh two paths so make sure you select like add two paths when it does that and yes okay so now we got anaconda now what we need to do is set up a virtual environment with anaconda so what we're gonna do is going to go to CMD so our command prompt just drag this over here and just type Conda first of all so if you get something like this and this works you did everything correctly if this doesn't work make sure you add Conda to path so reinstall it and make sure you check that add to path button and if you know it added to the path manually you can do that okay so now we're going to do is gonna create a new environment so we gonna do Conda create n and then we're gonna give this a name I'm just gonna call mine discord or actually I don't know if that's gonna work let's just I'm just gonna call mine uh let's see here tutorial okay for tutorial and then we're gonna have to do and this is important make sure you python equals three point six because the current version of Python three seven is not supported for discord rewrite so make sure you do Python equals three point six okay so we'll do that it's gonna go through solving the environment setting it up just click yes and then once that's done we're actually to install some packages into this environment and set it up into pycharm so I'll just wait one second once finishes okay so now that our environment is set up we're gonna have to do is actually activate it and we're going to install some packages into it so if you haven't used this before essentially all we're doing is creating a virtual environment to store a bunch of packages so that that way um what do you call it's we have everything kind of organized into this environment and we don't clutter our like main Python file and that's what an account is used for it's like a package manager and a virtual environment manager so I'm just gonna activate my environment so I just called this tutorial so you jump to you activate and then the name of your environment that you just created so we'll do that and you should see these little brackets popping up it's the left of your path okay now don't do what I'm about to do do not to do this if you do this is just gonna kind of be a headache okay so pip installed this way don't do that if you do that you're gonna install the old version of discord pi which does not have the same syntax as what I'm gonna be using so you're just gonna be all messed up and yeah so just don't do that we're actually gonna have to install this off of the github so essentially discord rewrite which is what we're using isn't it's not fully released yet so it's not like pip like you can't just you can't pip install it so so what we have to do is get it from github so we can select use pip but we have to just give a certain command so I have it in a notepad here we're just gonna grab it from the github so I'll put this link in the description again it'll be on my website as well in case I forget to put it on there and then all we're gonna do is just copy this in here and says pip install how do you get a decision it means we're getting it from github okay and then we're just gonna click enter enter there we go and it's gonna clone the repository and install that for us so once that's done we'll be back okay so we finished doing that so now I think that's actually about it that we need for our bots now if you guys want to go ahead and stir like numpy and pandas or some other module is you think you're gonna use you can do that now or you can always come back later you can activate your environment and then reinstall it into there so there's no rush you don't have to install all the packages now again this will be in the description okay all right so now we're done with our command prompt and now it's time to move to PyCharm okay so that's my bot I'm just gonna end this and you can see was actually logging like all the messages that it sent to you as well I'm just gonna close this project and just start fresh that I'm with you guys okay so we're gonna create a new project and I'm just gonna name this C Python will name this discord and then tutorial like that okay now for the project interpreter you can mess with it here if you want or you can just wait till after all just mess with it here what you gonna do is you're gonna go to existing interpreter you're gonna go to click these dot dot dots and we're going to find this Condit environment that we just created so you can select Kannada environment I'm going to go to instead of no interpreter we're gonna click these three dots we're gonna go to our C Drive we're going to go to users we're going to go to our user and then we're gonna go to anaconda three okay again you can look at the path up here if you're getting lost and where I'm typing but this is the default install location for anaconda if you installed it somewhere else then you're obviously gonna have to find where that is but mine is just and this is the default one and C Drive okay you know open and Akhanda and this should be the same no matter where your anaconda is you're gonna click env standing for environments and you're gonna find your environment so mines tutorial on but you can see my other environments here I have discord our disk new web tensor tensorflow for the machine learning stuff at it so we're going to put tutorial and then we're gonna go and we're gonna click Python W Exe and this is gonna be the interpreter that we use we'll click OK and now we have you can see three point six this should be popping up and you've now configured the interpreter so we're almost actually ready to go insert tightness of code so let's click create and now we're loaded up and let's just make a new Python file okay so I shut to restart my webcam quickly because whenever I launch pycharm it kind of glitches out but essentially all we messed here is we're just gonna go here and go new python file so I said that by rightclicking and just name it whatever you want I'm just gonna de menthe bought and there we go so now let's just quickly set up a configuration so we can run this fast and we'll add configuration plus Python and then we're just gonna do what do you call it let's call it BOTS and then we're just going to go to script path and we'll go to discord tutorial box okay make sure the correct environment so three six discord dump I think this is the right one maybe when we were using Python three six or is it yeah project default sorry Python three six that's when we want project default again you can setup your interpreter here if you know to do that but I'm pretty sure if you just do project default that should work at least we'll test that out in a second okay so now we're good with that and what we're gonna do is we're just gonna import discord here and make sure that this is working so essentially I forgot to mention this but if you guys don't have this it just just called PI tram right it's it's like one of the best like what do you call it ID east for Python you can really just type PyCharm on the internet go here and download it there's not really anything you have to do to set it up I just pick like an install location and click download and then all you're gonna do is launch it again like you can just type I charm to launch that and just follow along with the steps that I showed you sorry I always forget that people don't use PyCharm because I always use it but anyways so now I'm just gonna run this configuration by clicking this little arrow up here and what I did essentially if you're confused was I just created a new way to run my file because I'm PyCharm you need to use configurations if you guys want PyCharm tutorials how to use this thing it's pretty useful I have some of my channel that you can check out as well but we'll just click this run icon and no errors so we're actually good okay so we've imported discord okay so now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna create a new text file in here so I'm just gonna call this actually token dot txt because what I'm about to do is get the token for my BOTS now I don't want to give you guys my token because if I give it to you then you're gonna be able to code with my bought and well mess with it so essentially to get your token what you're gonna do is go back to this developer portal I hope you didn't close it yet and you're just gonna click on click to reveal token now I'm gonna do this offcamera but essentially gonna click on this okay and then just make sure you have the token you don't have to put it in a text file because you'll see what we're gonna do with it just like copy just copy it in here okay just copy like whatever the token is it's gonna be a bunch of letters and copy it into your file just so you have it okay so I'm gonna pause quickly do that and then I'll be back okay so I'm back so all I've done essentially is copied my token into this token dot txt file I believe I saved that and then all I'm doing is I just made this function that's just gonna read the token in again you guys don't have to do this you'll see what I'm gonna do in just a second okay so essentially what we need to do now is we need to just set up a client for discord so this is um the beginning steps are just gonna say client equals discord dot clients like okay and we'll put brackets and now we need to do is we need to run our client now this is where we need the token right so from that developer page we got the token and what this is gonna do is gonna connect us with our bot okay and since our bot is we have two out so associate that bot with the server so we'll do that in just a second but essentially we're gonna do is we're gonna do client dot run okay and then here we're gonna put our token so in this case my token is well token alright so actually I think I better close this I didn't need to do this so let's go back to the discord developer portal quickly I know what a test server okay so to link this up I was trying to find like the easiest way to do this but essentially we just need this client ID okay now what you guys gonna have to do is I have a link in the description alright and you're just gonna copy that link now the link is going to look I have it in a text file just so I can show you exactly what it looks like but essentially it is this okay so it's gonna look like this this is what the link is now notice that it says here C which says bought client ID and like the greater than sign lesson sign like encapsulating this you're gonna delete this okay from the link so you're gonna copy into a text file what are you gonna do and then delete that what we're gonna do is you're gonna paste your client ID here now the client ID is this right you're gonna copy that so we'll copy it we'll go to the text file and this is exactly what you need to do paste it right there so you notice that it's not late it's not in between the the we put the tag it's just like ID equals and then you're gonna take this link okay so it's a web link we'll copy it now we're gonna put it up here and I already did it here but I'll just I'll paste it when we're trying to show you so ctrl V click enter it's gonna load up a page that looks like this now it's gonna say add a bot to a server so what I'm gonna do is we're gonna select test server like that okay and I'm gonna click authorize all right so now because you were signing with your Dischord right when you did this it's gonna allow you to add that to your server so you're gonna click I'm not a robot go through all these these steps and then you can see about us here and it's letting me know that in the the text channel okay so if I go to discord and open this back up then you could see now we have an offline bought now if you're not getting this offline bought you are you made a mistake is it should be showing up in offline okay now what I'm gonna do actually so I'm gonna close this but I remember these links are in the description and you just have to replace that with the client ID that you're getting from your discord developer portal I know this is a lot of work but it's authorized so I can actually go ahead and I can close this because we don't need that anymore now the bots added all we need to do is just run it so we have the bot token right and the bot token I'm storing the token dot txt file but you guys gonna have it in here now just to show you here if you don't have the token in a string like say it's like token token here just put quotation marks around it because it's not gonna work if you just have like a bunch of letters and numbers Python doesn't know what to do with that so if your tokens here and it's like not from a text file then just put it like that so it comes in as a string okay just to make sure in because I'm sure someone's probably make the mistake alright so now what we're gonna do is we run this and see if everything's actually working so I'm gonna run my bought because we're client dot run right now I'm gonna go to my discord server you should see the bot is online if you've got to this point you've done everything successful congratulations we're almost ready to start like seeing if the bots can get our messages or not okay so now the bot is online so just to show you this is old this mod is only going to be online when you're running the the script so if you are like hosting a bot for example on your computer it's only gonna be online when first of all your computer's on and second of all you're running that BOTS script on your computer so show in later videos how we can host our bot using like like web services like Amazon Web Services and stuff so we don't have to constantly have it running on our computer but for now that's what we're gonna do especially for testing so now notice if I stop this script I go back here just wait a second it should go offline I think it just takes a second let's see here if I change servers and go back okay well it's gonna go offline in a second just just trust me on that okay okay so now we've got our token that we ran the bot everything seems to be working so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna try to get a message from the user and just like print that message back so this all can go actually we're gonna go in between these two lines is we're gonna run after and what we're gonna do is we're gonna set up events now this kind of system works on a bents so I'm gonna do at client dot event okay and there's a reason that's why I need this client here so that this is gonna work and is there brackets no there's not so let's do a client event and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna state define on underscore message okay and then in here we're just got a type message because what's essentially gonna happen is whenever a message is sent this function is gonna be run so by putting this what's known as a decorator here it's saying that when the event of on message is triggered this function runs so then we're gonna grab the message from the user and then we can start doing things with it now I don't think I can actually do define I have to do like a sink or something let's have a look here a sink define but it should help stop working yeah a sink define so you need this async thing I'm not gonna go through exactly what that does but this way you need to do a sink define on message message and now whenever a message is sent this function is gonna run so how do we get the message how do we check how do we send messages oh there's a lot of stuff so essentially what we're gonna do first of all is let's just print to our actual con so what the message is and make sure that this is working so we'll say message dot content and I believe that's what it is message dot content yes miss check message I got that I'm just looking at the documentation right now so I don't forget okay so I'm gonna click run and now let's test and see if we're getting messages okay so we running this no errors let's go to our discord server I'll make it smaller and then let's just say hi now look at my console to the left here it's printing out exactly what I'm typing hello what's up Tim okay so we're getting those messages so we know that this is working the bot is working that's awesome okay so we're getting messages so now what we want to do is we want to check what these messages are and based on that we want to send messages back to the user after I do this I'm going to end this tutorial but I just want to show you so you guys can mess around with it at least a little bit so what do we do now who say if message content don't find okay and what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna do like an exclamation point and then hello so all I'm gonna do essentially is say if we find this so if this is greater than or if it's not equal to negative one because the way find is gonna work its gonna find to get negative one if it doesn't find this we're just see if dot or exclamation point hello is in the message if it is we're gonna say hi back so how do we do this well to say hi back we're actually undo a weight message dot channel dot send and then in here we'll just say hi now we double check this but I think that is correct message to channel don't send yes so what we're doing now is we're checking that if this exclamation point hello is contained anywhere in the message okay we're choosing a really basic Python find function and do this now find returns a negative one if it doesn't find it so if it finds it at any point then it's not gonna be negative one so we'll say hi back so let's now end the ball and run it again let's go to discord which apparently I keep closing and then let's just type let's type hi and see it's not printing anything out nothing's happening but now if I type exclamation point below our bot responds and it says hi so that's all I'm going to show you guys for today if you had any trouble with this again please join my discord server or let me know in the comments down below also I have a Twitter if you guys want to follow that I kind of released some updates and exclusive stuff on there so that'd be awesome if you guys followed and if you enjoyed the video and excited for the next one please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again there
