hey guys and welcome to a brand new tutorial series so in this series I'm going to be teaching you Java from the beginning so starting at the abso basic setting up an environment how to create variables methods like all that stuff and then move it all the way up into the advanced stuff so I'm projecting this tutorial series is probably gonna be somewhere around 20 videos not exactly sure in that after that tutorial series just so you're aware I will be going into a Java game development series so make sure you're subscribed for that anyways let's just get started with Java actually quickly I'm just going to say that this is a beginner tutorial series so I'm gonna treat this as if you have never learned any programming language before so if you're someone who does have a programming language and you just want to learn job and kind of go through it quickly watch the first few minutes of the video wait until you understand the content and move to the next one if you're an absolute beginner I'd recommend sticking through the whole video and making sure you really understand everything that I'm saying before you move on okay so let's go ahead and get started the first thing we need to do is download a IDE and this is where we're gonna be writing our java code okay so it's called eclipse this one I'm gonna use use whatever you want but if you're a beginner I recommend you just follow along with this because the some of the things I'm gonna do are specific to eclipse so go to this link it's in the description down below and just click on download and then obviously 32 or 64bit I recommend 64bit as most TV you probably have a 64bit machine once you download this if we go sorry I've already got an open here but if we go to our downloads we will see that it should give us something like this double click on it wait for this to boot up might take a second ok it's going it's going let's see and once we're in here we're simply going to select Eclipse IDE for Java developers we don't need to be using any of this other stuff just this one right here ok so we're going to install this I already have it installed so I'm not going to do that now it is gonna ask you for a project directory something like that so if it asked you for that just choose wherever on your computer it doesn't really matter ok so once you've had that installed you chose your project directory now we're gonna be in Eclipse now to start a new projects what we need to do so it should look something like the you know click on file new and then Java project now here I'm just gonna name mine tutorial and then let's see here you can just leave all the rest of this stuff blank if you want to change the location go ahead alright click finish and there we are so once we have this it's gonna pop up at our left bar the package Explorer I'm just gonna shrink this a little bit and what we're gonna do is are gonna go down to source or oh I already have a package name tutorial one second I'm just gonna create a new one really quickly and then walk you through this so it's fresh tutorial one okay finish all right we got two toriel one and we get source okay now inside of the source what we're gonna do is we're going to rightclick on this we're gonna click new and we're going to click on package now I recommend you just leave this package name the same as your project so I'm gonna do that and click finish and then inside of your package name I'm going to click new and class ok so once I click class it's gonna pop up here it's gonna lie to select the package and the source will to just leave those blank and the name you can name this whatever you want in my case I'm gonna name it main ok type name is discouraged okay so let's name it main with a capital M alright just because you have a likes that and then we're gonna do is make sure you check on this public static void main we need to check mark this because we're gonna need this function created us so that we can start all right I inherited abstract method you can uncheck that you are actually will check that does really matter if right now okay so now we're in and we've got a little bit of code going here and I'm gonna explain what this is and then we'll get into just coding like a really basic thing just printing a few things to the screen before we move into the next tutorial where we talk about datatypes so Java is an object orientated program language meaning that everything happens inside of something called classes and everything is known as like objects alright now you're not gonna understand very much about of this right now if you're beginner but for some of you guys that are more advanced you should kind of understand what this means so classes are these okay and everything in Java is written in a class or an interface or something else but in our purpose just think everything is written in a class right now okay now inside of this class we have a special method is what it's called and these methods are what I'm highlighting right now inside these curly brackets like static void main okay you don't have to know what all that those words mean just know this method is important and this is we're gonna be writing all of our Java code in for right now so if you try to write code outside of these little curly braces not inside of this method that's what we're calling it right now okay your code is not gonna execute properly unless you know what you're doing which in our case we don't yet so all the code we're writing goes inside of this public static void main inside of these curly braces all right now the first thing I'm gonna get us to do is just print something to the screen so to print something in Java we're gonna type system dot out dot my computer vlogging one second dot println and this simply stands for print line okay now inside of these brackets here we can print a string or whatever we want to print so a string in Java is anything encapsulated by two quotation marks whenever we're printing something we want to do it in two quotation marks at least for right now and in this case I'm going to say the classic hello world with an exclamation point okay now at the end of every line we write in Java with exception of lines that start or end with curly braces we need to put a semicolon and now you can see once I put the semicolon that our system dot out dot println gets highlighted and we can see that it now has syntax highlighting and syntax pretty much means any code that we write in the program so we have to make sure that whenever we're done writing a line we terminate that with a semicolon okay so now we've officially written our first program all it does is print hello world to the screen but how can we run this so first we're gonna have to saves I'm gonna hackin troll s and to run this there's a little green button up here and it says run main dot Java so we're gonna click that and you can see that down here a little thing popped up called console and we printed to the screen hello world now that we've officially created our first java application very simple and that is how we go about setting up a new class and everything that we write for right now again remember is gonna happen inside this method that's what we're calling it I'm gonna explain that later public static void main we have to put in here now if you want to print another line you want print something else after we can do that I'll show you how that we're so I'm gonna say system dot out dot println and I'll say like hello world too and if I save this and run again we get hello world and hello world too now that has been the introduction tutorial in the next video i'm gonna go into datatypes and probe datatypes and we're gonna talk about like integers and strings and all of that fun stuff so if you guys enjoy the video and you're excited for the next one make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you there
