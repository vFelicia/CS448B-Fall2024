if I was starting completely from zero and wanted to learn to code as quickly as possible this is exactly what I would do the first thing is to figure out my goal it's impossible to make progress and understand why you're doing all of this work if you don't have an end goal in sight you need to ask yourself why do I want to learn to code maybe you want to make $100,000 a year you want to work at a tech company like Google maybe you want to start your own tech company or you just want to have Financial time and location freedom and work anywhere around the world that you want it's up to you but you need to write that goal down and remind yourself of it every single day so right now get a pen get a piece of paper and write down what you actually want why do you want to learn to code and how is that going to help you achieve your goal put this in a place where you can see it every single day and constantly remind yourself of that goal because I promise you this is a tough Journey things get difficult and you need that reminder and motivation to keep going and remember why you're doing all of this work now once you have your goal in mind this will help inform step number two which is to follow a curriculum you absolutely need to have a plan and you need to know exactly what you're learning and the order in which you're learning it this is crucial and this is going to help make sure that you know you're making progress and you're learning The Right Stuff half the battle when it comes to learning something new is knowing what to learn you don't yet know what you don't know and you don't know the topics that you actually need to figure out so I highly recommend finding a reputable curriculum or going through some kind of course or boot camp where you have a structured learning environment you're staying on track and you have a bit of accountability now for those of you that don't want to invest in something like that what I recommend doing is still finding one that you would have been interested in if it was free and simply copying the curriculum they have and then learning it on your own now I won't lie to you this will be a lot more difficult than if you actually went through the program but at least you have something that you can keep track of your progress with and you know the order of topics you should be learning now before you actually go and pick one of these curriculums you need to have a sense of what it is that you want to do in your development Journey so do you want to be a mobile app developer do you want to build websites do you not care do you just want to get a job as quickly as possible this will help inform the type of curriculum you enroll in so I recommend spending a day or two in just getting a general sense of what might interest you this can definitely change but you want to know maybe you're more interested in data science or you want to do machine learning or maybe you really just want to build mobile apps if you know that it's going to help direct you and really accelerate your progress when you're just starting out if you are someone where your sole goal is to raise your income or land a job as quickly as possible I do recommend checking out the curriculum from my software development course with course careers now whether or not you purchase this course you can see exactly what we run students through and how we help them be the best candidates for the job for an entry level position we do this by running you through software development fundamentals then a specialization in frontend backend or devops so by the time you're actually interviewing for jobs you're highly qualified and you have that specialized knowledge that quite a few candidates don't have have we also give you a Resume Builder interview tips you can connect directly with me and other coaches for help assistance Etc we show you how to set up your LinkedIn tons of stuff in there but let's move on to the next tip so now that you found your curriculum it's time to practice and you need to practice as much as you possibly can this is really what sets apart the okay developers from the great developers it's the amount of volume and the amount of practice that you've done you will not be a good developer you will not even feel confident to write code if you don't put in hundreds of hours of practice practice you need to sit at your computer you need to struggle you need to solve problems and you need to practice every single day when you're just getting started out especially if you want to do this really quickly what I highly recommend is setting aside longer time periods for doing your practice in a lot of people when they learn a new skill they maybe do 30 minutes a day or 45 minutes a day with coding it is possible to learn that way but it's going to take quite a bit longer and you really want to give yourself 2 or three hour long periods where you're able to really get focused you're able to have concentrated deep work and really feel like you're productive and efficient so that means no checking your phone no going on Instagram no putting a YouTube video on when I actually need to do serious coding work I have no volume on I put noise cancelling headphones no music and I sit at my computer and by the time I'm in 30 45 minutes worth of work that's when I really feel like I'm focused I'm dialed in and I get quite a bit done you need to be as focused and concentrated as possible you need to eliminate all distractions I know this is difficult but this is one of these tasks that really requires your complete Focus so practice every single day practice as often as you possibly can and give yourself longer time periods to allow yourself to really get dialed really get focused and be in that deep state where nothing's distracting you and all you're focused on is the task at hand which is learning to code so while you're doing your practice I want to remind you to be curious one of the best ways to get good at software development is to constantly ask questions and to try to mess with things break things try things on your own and ask why people are doing what they're doing this allows you to really get a deep understanding of what's going on and to make sure you're not skipping over things that you don't fully comprehend it's very difficult to get good at programming if you can't first Master those fundamentals and basic skills but a lot of times when you're watching videos or tutorials there's going to be a bunch of questions you have that just aren't answered so you need to go out of your way to answer those questions for yourself whether you do that in a community whether you ask like a course instructor or something or you go on stack Overflow or use chat gbt or you look it up it doesn't matter but you want to constantly be curious if you're watching a video tutorial and they do something that doesn't make sense copy that code mess around with it in your code editor see if you can figure out how it works ask yourself well if they did it this way doesn't that mean I could also do it this way right try Alternatives mess around break things get error messages this is really how you learn you need to constantly ask questions and wonder why is it working this way why did that happen why are they doing it like this if you can keep asking those questions this is building a really good habit and when you actually get into doing professional level programming that's almost always what other developers are doing they'll read your code and they'll ask the same question why did he do it this way I think it would be better to do this way and developers constantly have conversations about why code is written the way it was and if there's ways it could be improved if it could be done differently if it could be optimized Etc so get in that habit early be curious ask questions I promise it will teach you a lot now the next thing that's important especially in 2024 and Beyond is to utilize tools and resources there's so many great AI tools and resources online that can really help speed up your learning and answer questions for you way faster than I ever could have got the answer when I was learning how to code so chat gbt is one that I'll recommend to everyone while you're learning how to code you should have a chat gbt window open and you should use this as your personal assistant and personal tutor that means yeah now you want to try things on your own you don't want to just rely on this for everything but if you have a question and you're really stuck go and ask chat GPT especially for basic concepts this is great it will answer stuff super fast and it will allow you to paste in blocks of code and actually ask questions about it so let's say you're doing some practice exercise and you see my official solution and it makes no sense to you well you can take that solution paste that into chat gbt give it the problem as well and say hey this is the official solution I don't really understand how this works could you explain it to me line by line it will then go ahead and do that for you so continuing what's really going to bring everything full circle for you is when you actually start applying your knowledge by working on projects now I'm sure you've heard this before but it's so important I need to mention it and I do mention it and pretty much every single video at the beginning of your coding Journey you're going to get bombarded with Theory you're going to go through so much stuff it's going to feel overwhelming and it's going to feel like you're forgetting everything the only way to really nail that into your brain to remember it understand why it's important is to apply this into some type of project so you do need to get through those theoretical Parts before you can build something meaningful but once you learn a block of content or you've gone through a section or you've done a few lessons try to put that into a real world project a lot of courses at least if they're good they'll include projects for you they'll give you projects you can try on your own they'll show you how to build them but you really want to try being completely by yourself in a code editor with a goal your goal is to build this specific project once you have that you're going to ask yourself okay where do I start what do I even do here and you're going to start having so many questions that you need to now go and figure out and that is really what good developers are good at doing figuring things out so it's going to be hard it's going to be daunting it's going to be overwhelming but this is where you're going to learn and grow the most and you're going to be able to take those theoretical Concepts and apply them into a real world project so I'm just warning you your first few projects are going to seem impossible going to seem really really hard that's the point that's the goal and you need to have that perseverance to go and figure out how to solve them use your resources use AI tools use stack Overflow Google uh join a community ask for help whatever it may be you are the one who needs to figure out how to do this and you have the resources or should have the resources from the theory that you've learned now lastly I do recommend joining some type of community this is important because when you're going on this journey it's tough It's daunting you're going to lose motivation you're going to feel stuck and it's nice to have other people that are on the same Journey as you that you can relate to ask questions and just feel like you're not alone when you're learning this you're not sure if you're the worst if you're the best if you're even going at a decent pace or if you're making any progress when you have other people that are doing the same thing it kind of just gives you that peace of mind to know hey I'm not alone they're struggling with this too they found this difficult but they pushed forward and actually gives you quite a bit of motivation that's why in my software development course of course we have a community you can message directly with me what I find people often do in there is actually post their struggles and they'll say hey I'm having a lot of trouble with this module here do you guys have any advice I'm just feeling really down and other students will go in there and say hey I had the exact same thing I found this really really hard I did this this and this and I was able to progress forward keep going keep pushing you got this don't give up that's what 90% of the messages are and I find a lot of people really get that extra bit of motivation and are just able to push forward by having that nice community of people doing the same thing that they are so with that said guys I will wrap up the video here if you enjoyed make sure leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next one
