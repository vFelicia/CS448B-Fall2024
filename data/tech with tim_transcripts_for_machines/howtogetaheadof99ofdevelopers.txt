this is how you get ahead of 99% of developers step one be language agnostic the top developers can write code in any language even if they've never used that language before the reason for that is they have experience with multiple programming languages specifically languages of different styles and paradigms they understand strong typing static typing Dynamic typing weak typing and they know the different paradigms of language anges like procedural logical functional objectoriented and really how programming languages are designed and the different features that are similar across languages of different types this means that it doesn't matter what language they need to use they can very quickly learn it adapt and be very flexible this is exactly who you want to be that means you should get experience with as many languages as you possibly can you don't need to be an expert in them but if you know different types of languages it's really going to set you apart that's exact exactly why we teach multiple programming languages in my brand new software development course which you can check out from the link in the description now step two is to specialize if you want to stand out you really need to be an expert in one certain area of programming now that could be a language but more specifically probably a framework a certain type of development like backend frontend devops Etc if you can be really really good in one area it's going to set you apart and there's going to be lot of roles that you'll actually be the ideal candidate for that's exactly why in my software development course after you go through the fundamentals course Top by myself you pick a specialization in front end backend or devops if you want to check it out again from the link in the description now step three is to stay current if you want to be a top developer you constantly need to be on top of what's going on in the industry you need to know the new languages and Frameworks you need to be up to date with things like Ai and new tools tools and development strategies if you can do this it's going to set you apart and if you don't do this you're really just going to fall slowly behind think about a developer who doesn't utilize chat gbt today they just can't keep up with developers that do that's why if you want to be a top 1% developer you need to stay current and up todate with what's going on in the industry step number four is to have a strong portfolio but even more importantly to have a portfolio that's easy to navigate easy to understand it doesn't matter if you have the most complex backend library that you've written if people can't understand that clearly and they can't access it view it install it Etc it's not going to matter right that's why some of the best portfolios are just a really clean landing page a great portfolio website obviously stands out a bit more if you're a frontend web developer but even if you're a backend developer you do devop stuff doesn't matter I'd highly recommend having a really slick clean website or at least something that has a huge wow factor to it right in my case it's a YouTube channel I'll Point people to my YouTube they'll see I have 1.3 million subscribers wow right that's an immediate thing that makes me stand out and shows okay this guy probably knows what he's talking about in your case you need to have something like that it can take any form you want but if I were to click on some link that you sent me I should immediately be blown away and know without a shadow of a doubt that you're a great developer because of the work or the portfolio that you've just showed me step number five time management I think this is pretty obvious but as you climb the ranks it's going to be expected that you can manage your own time you can prioritize tasks you can delegate when you need to and you can put your energy to the most productive and most efficient thing you can possibly be doing the worst case scenario is your manager has to constantly remind you of deadlines ask you when things are getting done you want to be proactive you want to be telling people how much time you need when something's going to be done and you want to be able to estimate that and manage it very very well so that you can be as efficient and productive as possible step number six business knowledge if you're someone who can take your engineering hat off and actually look at what you're doing from a business perspective whether that be marketing accounting profit raising money whatever the specific field is that's really going to set you apart because many developers can't do that and they only look at things purely from an engineering lens at the end of the day you're working for company what you're doing is helping the company achieve some type of goal typically at the end of the day that means driving revenue or driving profit and if you want to move up the ranks in the company and eventually be a manager director executive you're going to have to have that Baseline business knowledge I know for me what's really helped in a lot of things that I've done is that I have the business knowledge as well as the development knowledge and I can speak both languages I can talk about the engineering challenges while at the same time being able to talk to my CEO and and say hey this is how this is going to support the business objectives from what I've seen a lot of companies actually end up promoting the more kind of middle level Engineers the guys that aren't necessarily the best because they have more of that hybrid understanding they're good enough at engineering and good enough at business that you can actually bring them up to a higher level whereas some of the best software Engineers you want to just keep them as software Engineers you don't really want to move them into a management position or a more business oriented position because that's not where their skill set lies so it's really up to what you want to be doing but I've found in my life that business knowledge has really helped me quite a bit and it's allowed me to stand out as a developer in many different roles that I've been in now speaking of business knowledge I wouldn't be taking my own advice if I didn't share with you my new software development course the main goal of this course is to actually help you land a job that's how the course is designed from the very beginning and it's meant to do this as quickly as possible without leaving any gaps in your knowledge not only do we teach you all of the fundamental software development skills we allow you to pick a specialization in frontend devops or backend which is included in the price of the course this is taught by an industry expert and we give you career advice mentorship oneonone support access to all of the instructors like myself literally everything we do is so that by the time you finish this program you are better qualified than all of the other Junior developers and you're going to stand out for any type of job you apply for I'm super pumped about this course we even have a free introduction course that tells you everything you need to do to break into s development you can sign up for that with no obligation from the link in the description I hope you guys like it with that said let's get into our last point the last Point here guys is soft skills this is a big Topic in the course as well but is so important because if you want to move up the ranks as a developer or just not get fired from your job you need to be a friendly person you need to know how to communicate you need to be confident speak clearly concisely and understand how you actually work with the team of people that's really what you're doing as a software developer you're working in a team very rarely are you working completely by yourself and communication is as important as the code that you write even if you're the best developer in the world if you can't communicate no one's going to want to work with you and I can say from experience even not being the best developer since I had strong communication skills I was always considered for raises and promotions versus some of the better developers simply because I was more wellrounded that's what you want to aim to be not just the absolute expert in one certain area but wellrounded so you have that business knowledge you have those communication skills you have those development skills if you have that you're going to stand out and you're going to be that top 1% developer anyways if you guys enjoyed this video make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next one
