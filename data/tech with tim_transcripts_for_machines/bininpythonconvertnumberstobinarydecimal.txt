sometimes when you're writing code in python you want to convert a number to binary fortunately there's a function that does that for us in python we can say x is equal to bin this is the binary number function this takes in a number and converts it to binary so if i print out x i'll actually get a string that represents the binary number now notice it always starts with zero b if you want to remove this zero b then you can take a slice of this so two colon that will strip off the first two characters now you just have the binary number now in case you want to go from binary back to decimal you can do the following y is equal to and then int and you can pass in your binary number make sure you do not have the zero b on it though you take the slice and then you put two here this represents that you're going to use a base two numbering system and so when you go here and you print out y then you will get 162 back hopefully this was helpful if it was follow for more
