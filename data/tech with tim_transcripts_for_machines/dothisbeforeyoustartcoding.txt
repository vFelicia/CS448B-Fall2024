you need to really narrow down why it is you want to learn how to code and specifically what you want to learn how to code what do you want to make what do you want to do with code why are you learning this maybe you want to do machine learning and AI maybe you want to get into data science maybe you want to do game development maybe you don't care and you just want to be a software engineer and get paid six figures these are kind of the general disciplines and domains that you're going to be picking between and so do some research figure out what really interests you and what you'd like to start with you can always change later on but the language you're going to learn first is going to be the one that's based on what you're actually going to want to make right what you want to complete what you want to do with your coding knowledge
