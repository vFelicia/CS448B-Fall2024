it's 2024 and despite the advancements with AI developers are still in extreme demand they're getting paid an insane amount of money and whether you're an experienced developer or a complete beginner one of the best things you can do to level up your skills in this year is learn a new language that's why in this video I'm going to share with you my top five programming languages that I recommend you learn in 2024 starting off our list we have JavaScript now this consistently ranks in the top five most in demand and popular program in languages in the world it's really a language you can't go wrong learning and something I recommend everyone has at least a little bit of understanding of now the great thing with JavaScript is that it's beginner friendly it's easy to learn and allows you to build a ton of different applications very quickly not only can you build websites frontend user interfaces but you can also work on the back end you can use Frameworks like node.js you can build mobile apps with things like react and react native and you can even go ahead and learn typescript on top of JavaScript and give yourself a more flexible language for working on larger systems this is something that I recommend specifically to beginners or people just starting out in your career if you don't yet know any programming languages JavaScript is a great one to start with and it's going to give you probably the most flexible language that you're starting with allowing you to build the most number of applications possible so if you don't really know where to start you don't know exactly what you want to do in the tech field or programming industry I definitely recommend starting with JavaScript there's all kinds of free courses online but if you do want something a bit more premium I do have a software development course which teaches JavaScript in depth which you can check out from the link in the description moving on the second item on our list is python now this is personally my favorite programming language and one I recommend to pretty much all beginner programmers I personally think every programmer should have some basic Python and that's because it's very versatile very easy to write in and very easy to learn now just like JavaScript python is extremely popular it's right up there in terms of demand and popularity it just has some different use cases and I'll kind of tell you which you should learn JavaScript or python based on your interest so python is more suited towards automation backend and data science related tasks if you're someone who's really interested in working on the front end you want to be a full stack developer you want to design websites frontend interfaces Etc javascript's going to be better for you if you're someone who's more interested in working with data creating automation projects you want to do machine learning apps you want to work with AI python is going to be a better choice for you with that said you can still create things like websites and games with python it's just not quite as flexible as a language like JavaScript and often times you'll end up actually using a bit of JavaScript with your python applications to get the full functionality that you're looking for with that said there is still great Frameworks like Jango and flask where you can build fullfledged websites and many have been built using languages like python so with that said quickly summarize here if you're more interested in websites frontend development and actually creating user interfaces highly recommend JavaScript if you're someone someone who is more interested in automation backend you don't really care that much about the graphics or the front end component of things then Python's probably a better choice also if you want to do anything with data working with machine learning AI definitely pick up python rather than JavaScript either way both great options both easy to learn and both beginner friendly languages I'd recommend one of those two if you're just starting out moving on the third language on my list is go or goang now this is a relatively new modern programming language at least compared to something like python this is very performant and something I'd highly recommend as your second language so once you've learned something like python or JavaScript you're comfortable with coding and you want to be a bit more of a wellrounded developer picking up a statically typed language like go is really going to help you do that and it's going to teach you a lot of features that you just don't need to know and learn when you're working with languages like JavaScript or python go is a much more highly performance language it's again more going to be focused on the back end but allows you to learn features like threading concurrency pointers references Etc and gives you a different style of language which will show you the contrast between dynamically typed languages and statically typed languages and also give you some more information or force you to learn about things like compilers interpreters Etc I won't get into this too much I don't want to confuse anyone if you're just a complete beginner but if you are someone who already knows JavaScript or python I highly recommend learning go now in terms of some of its strengths and use cases go has a very simple and readable syntax and brings you the performance of a language like C++ with the Simplicity of a language like python or JavaScript that's actually specifically how it was designed when it was designed at Google it's a pretty new language and it's very performant and specifically designed for building infrastructure cloud services backend Services Etc so if you are someone who is at all concerned about performance efficiency you like building distributed systems larger scale systems or you want to get into that field of computer science and just programming in general definitely pick up go you're going to see immediately that it has a bunch of features that you just probably didn't know exist because you wouldn't have seen them in languages like JavaScript and Python and most of all this is going to make you a better more rounded developer because you're going to learn how to work with a statically typed language this is actually the second language that we teach in my software development course if you're interested check it out from the link in the description moving on the fourth language on my list is rust now this is a language that's been gaining a ton of popularity over the past few years and it's specifically targeted at developers that are building performance critical applications so if you're working on a game engine an operating system systems level programming and you need something that's safe secure and reliable rust is the language for you this wouldn't be something I'd recommend to beginners it's a great second or third language in my opinion and something that you'd probably learn once you picked up the fundamentals of programming from a bit of an easier language similar to learning something like go this is going to teach you a lot of features in development and programming in general that you just didn't need to know in more simple languages like python or JavaScript and it's going to give you some flexibility to really create some more performant applications if you are interested in using concurrency this is also what rust is loved for overall the main feature that many people talk about related to rust is its memory safety with a lack of a garbage collector and this makes it a great language for building reliable and secure applications moving on the fifth language or languages on my list are going to be specifically targeted for mobile app Developers and that's going to be swift for the iOS side or for the Apple side and cotlin for the Android side I'm not going to talk about these languages too much but if you are someone who wants to create mobile apps so you want to be in the Apple ecosystem creating Mac apps iOS apps uh watch apps TV apps whatever you're going to want to learn Swift you can pretty much skip everything else I said in this video and just go directly over to that because that's all you're going to need to know that's the most native language you can learn it's pretty new it's pretty modern it's actually relatively easy to pick up and it's something again that you will do if you want to do any iOS or apple development on the other side we have cotlin now this is another modern language kind of similar to Swift in terms of what it accomplishes relatively easy to pick up has a lot of resources related to it and a bit easier on my opinion to use than something like Java now Java is also something you can do to build Android applications but cotlin is kind of the new way or has been for a while now to build Android applications so if you do want to do mobile apps skip what I said above and just go right into Swift or right into cotland those are going to be the only languages that you need to know and if you need to pick up some small scripting language on the side you can do that afterwards so to quickly summarize here if you are a complete beginner I recommend going with python or JavaScript for your first language once you've learned one of those you can diversify a bit and learn a statically typed language like go or rust if you're really focused on performance optimizations you think you might want to build things like operating systems and work with those lowlevel features definitely go with rust as an additional language and if you are someone interested in iOS or Android development then you can go with swift or cotlin respectively now at the end of the day guys programming languages really just our tools you should always select the best tool for the job and many of those tools are not listed in this video that doesn't mean they're not great languages doesn't mean you shouldn't learn them I simply put what I thought were the most popular flexible and versatile languages that you can't really go wrong learning so with that said I'll wrap it up here if you want to become a software developer as fast as possible then check out my software development course from the link in the description there is a free intro course there that tells you all the information you need to know before you make a commitment I hope you guys enjoyed if you did leave a like subscribe and I will see you in the next one
