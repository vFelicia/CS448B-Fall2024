hello this is John from cave of programming comm and this is another video in the JavaScript to note note is for complete beginners course so in this video we're going to look at declaring variables in the last video we saw how you could create variables so what we're doing here is here I've got a variable called message and we say that I'm assigning it the value hello world notice that text is in quotes because it's what we call a string and then later on after outputting that on a on the console after printing hello world I create another variable and assign it value 7 notice the 7 is not in quotes and that's because it's a number we don't put numbers in quotes when we want to use them actually as a number so if I want to add and subtract things or whatever with this day's value down we don't put it in quotes so again we've got here we've got a while here we've were signing assigning the value 7 to a variable called days and were outputting it now we're going to be looking at this and if you're a complete beginner you'll probably this is you know and this is totally new to you it might seem confusing probably it will but you develop fluency with it just by using these ideas and it will become clearer later on what I want to show you here is we want to start off using best practice and there's a problem with what we did in the last video so supposing I wrote message equals hello we can use double quotes or single quotes it doesn't matter it's just switch at whichever you prefer there's no difference between them in JavaScript hello world let's write that and console log message notice variables don't get put in double quotes either as a mistake beginners sometimes may only text values get put in in quotes here all right so later on in my program I might write message with only one s as a mistake and I might say equals I don't know how are you and then write console dot log message let's run this program or maybe clear my console it's my least less confusing all right so this kind of does what you expect really this second variable with the misspelling is a completely different variable to this one now if you've got a big program and it can be very easy to misspell a variable name so it might have been my intention here to change the value of this variable which you can do you can give it a different value later on but what I've done instead is I've basically created and completely new variable with a different name just because I misspelt it so it perhaps it was my intention to do this just to change the value of this variable which you can do but because I miss spelt it I created an entirely new variable now the the upshot of this is that it's not good practice to simply create variables by directly assigning a value to them like this there are two things that we should do so we're going to do this in every JavaScript program that we create firstly at the top we're going to write this in double or single quotes we're going to write use space strict and then a semicolon at the end of it now if we write message equals let's say hello and then try to output message console.log message let's try this we get an error and that's actually a good thing what you straight forces is to do is it forces us to use a keyword to declare our variables on a keyword that we usually use is let so I say let's message equal hello and then I output message and if we run this program now it says hello it actually works okay so if you've been using JavaScript for a while and you're not a beginner then you will have also seen the keyword var so we could also also use var like this VAR message equals hello var you might guess is short for variable and this also works what's the difference between them well let is kind of a later introduction to JavaScript we're going to be using that for various reasons I'll go into later on but for now you just have to know that when we create a variable we should write let so let's message equals hello and you can change it later if you want to let's take a look so I can later I can say message equals how are you question mark and now let's output it again to see how it's changed console dot log message and we'll run it and it says how are you so if we look at this what we've done here when we say let message we call this declaring a variable now you can put comments in your JavaScript if you want a single line comment if you write two forward slashes like this everything that you write after that will be a comment so let's write here declare the variable message and assign the value hello to it alright and then what we're doing here is were print the variable let's write print let's just write print message and here what we're doing notice is no let keyword here we've declared the variable and we only have to declare the variable once in our program here what we're doing is just assigning a new value to an existing variable so here we're saying assign a new value to the variable message so we declare a variable we assign a value to it with the assignment operator equals we display it will print it on the console later on we assign a different value to it to the same variable how are you and we print that again on the console and if we run this program it does this so don't worry about this too much again if you are a complete beginner this will be confusing I've seen people try to learn programming by writing loads and loads of notes and that's the wrong way to learn it in my view the right way is just to practice it so the thing to do now is type this program out of yourself if you're a beginner especially and get it working and run it and don't sweat too much over what it's doing but look at it and think is it's the only way you could change this that wouldn't break it and if you can think of any way then try that out I'm sure you can think of some changes at least that you can make to this program that wouldn't break it have a go see if you can change this without breaking it once you've got it working but get this working first so type it out get it working and then try to experiment with it and see how you get on and you'll find that as you keep typing stuff and experimenting with it gradually your confusion will go away and your nc will build up and it will all begin to make sense but really learning programming I always say it's kind of in the fingers you got a type stuff and experiment with it it's it's useless in my view to make loads of notes and to really stir it something and agonize over it and try to understand what it means a lot of the time that's useless it's much better to actually type it out and practice it and play around with it okay so we'll leave it there for this video until next time happy coding
