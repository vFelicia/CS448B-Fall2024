hello this is John from cave of programming comm and this is another video in my no js' and JavaScript for complete beginners course in this video I'm going to give you an exercise and I'm going to give you some tips and suggestions for how to tackle the exercise and how to tackle like programming tests in general so if you're a like seasoned programmer in another language this might be too simple for you but if you're a beginner it might be too complicated but I'm gonna as I say give you some tips for dealing with it so let's go to a browser and I'm going to search for the liveness approximation of Pi so liveness was a kind of mathematician physicist I think he was Dutch and he found a way of approximating the value pi now pi is just a number it's a floatingpoint number and what we want to do is find an approximation for it so pi itself as digits that go on forever like it is an irrational number so we can't write it down precisely but what we can do is approximate it and we can make a value for pi this is accurate as we want it to be before we take a look at this let's go back to our code here and I'm just going to start my program with you strict I'm gonna write console.log and if we write math dot pi capital letters math dot pi will actually it is actually a value and approximation of pi so it kind of shows us what we're aiming at math here is what we call a class and we'll look at those later pi is a constant so if I run this program let's write node and PI J s we get this value 3.14159 what we're trying to do is produce this value approximately so we want to get it right to at least some of the initial digits it is literally just a value and we can do that using this formula so we start with the value 1 which notice is the same as 1 divided by 1 and then we subtract 1/3 and then we add 1 divided by 5 we subtract 1 divided by 7 and we keep doing this let's say if we do it for maybe I don't know how many a thousand or five thousand terms eventually we'll get a value that's equal to 1/4 of Pi so if we then take that value and multiply it by 4 we should get a reasonable approximation of pi if we've done this you know like I don't know five thousand times so how are we going to tackle this program well if you feel confident and this doesn't look too offputting ly difficult to you then do pause the video and have a go at it I'm going to show you how to actually write the program in the next video but we're going to look at how to tackle it here so the thing is when you have some kind of test that you have to do with programming I think the thing is to tackle whatever bits you can do so you know now how to create a hello world programming Java Script that but you can do you can already do that so or I would say already do that you know there's no need to think about how to do the whole thing necessarily in advance just do the bits you can to start with and now we can start breaking this down well what do we need here well we need a series of numbers which if we think of the first one as being 1 divided by 1 we need these numbers on the bottom here so the question is can you write a program that outputs the numbers 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 and so on because if you can do that you've taken a big step towards it what we also need is we need to we need to take one and divide it by each number so if you can write a program that outputs 1 3 5 7 9 and so on it's not too hard to write a program outputs the values 1/1 which is one 1/3 1/5 1/7 and so on that shouldn't be too hard and then this is tricky bit we've got to have alternating minus and plus signs so what you could do is take each of these values and multiply them ultimately by one or minus one so then the question becomes can you write a program that outputs 1 minus 1 1 minus 1 1 minus 1 so on alternate alternating and you could do that by taking a variable setting equal to 1 and in your loop multiply it by minus 1 every time you go through a loop because 1 times minus 1 is minus 1 minus 1 times minus 1 is 1 1 times minus 1 is minus 1 multiplying by minus 1 will cause your value initially set to 1 to alternate so I'm going through this a bit first but that will give you all the building blocks that you need here and what you'd need to do after that is you need a variable that can just accumulate all those values so you take your 1 or minus 1 and multiply it by a third or a fifth or whatever you you outputting at that point in the loop and just add those values to your variable every time you go through the loop then at the end take that variable multiply it by 4 and you should get a value for pi so especially if you're if you really are a beginner have a go at this and write whatever bits you can break it down in the way that I've just specified break it down and see what bits of that you can write if you can even write a program outputs 1 3 5 7 9 11 and so on adding 2 every time then that's really a good step so I think the thing is you learn a tremendous lot a tremendous amount by trying to write programs in a way it doesn't much matter what you try to write as long as you keep trying to write programs your programming ability will improve and this is just one suggestion of something you can do and if you try to write it even if you don't succeed in the end then you'll get some really good practice I think by doing this you know so just just just have a go at it and see if you can break it down into different bits output the values as you go along let's see that's a really important thing and see if you're a lot on the right track or not see see what you get with it and in the next video I'm going to show you an example implementation of this we're actually going to write this program okay so until next time happy coding
