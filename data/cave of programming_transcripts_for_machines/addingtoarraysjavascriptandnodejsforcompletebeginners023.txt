hello this is John from cave of programming calm we're continuing my free course here on nodejs and JavaScript for beginners and in this video we're going to look at adding two arrays so so far we've seen how to create arrays including twodimensional arrays but we've initialized them when we declare the variable we've been declaring them and initializing them with data at the same time but what we can also do is we can add data to existing arrays or we can even just declare an empty array and then add data to that so first of all let's take a look at what we would do for onedimensional arrays in other words lists because that's simpler than twodimensional arrays so let's declare out an empty array let's say let fruits equal and I'll use square brackets here to indicate just an empty array so one way that you can add items to an array is just to use an index to set items and the index that you use is the first index that's off the end of the array so if I were to refer to fruits 0 here because this has no items in it fruit 0 which would normally be the first item doesn't exist is off the end of the array already but I can actually set the item to expand the array so if I write fruits 0 equals orange that will actually expand the array and add one item to it let's do let's do console dot log fruits 0 to check that it works and this is well supported by all browsers and as far as I know all major browsers and has been for a long time so here I'm going to run my programs check that I'm in the right place yeah so let's do node and adding two arrays ojs and we can see we've got orange in that array so let's do another one what's what's the first item what's the index of the first item that would now be off the end of the array now that would now be one so we've got an array here with one item in it so their maximum index that we can use to access items is zero so if I pick the next index it's just off the end of the array one I can set that to expand the array let's write fruits one equals Apple and we could also output the length of the array console.log fruit stop length and if we try this then we find we've got an array with two items in it we're displaying only the first one let's display the second as well second item which is that index one there we go we've got orange and apple now this can seem counterintuitive if you've been programming in other languages because many programming languages would not let you do this javascript is in many ways unusually flexible for example if you did this in a c program or a java program it would cause problems you can't access or set elements of an array usually that are off the end of the array but javascript lets you do it however there is another way of doing this that is more similar to how you would usually do this in in probably most other programming languages and that's to use a method called push so a method is a subroutine it's a kind of function it's a collection of code that is associated with an object and an array here is isn't is what we call an object in JavaScript so you don't you don't really need to know that yet we're going to cover that later but what you need what you need to know is just how you actually do this so let's write fruits and we use them a method called push so push adds items to the end of an array let's do push and banana and then I'm gonna actually move this code up so you can get the new length of the array and that's it's also out put this new item which is now going to be at index two so if we take a look at this then we see we've now got banana in the array why is it called push well we're kind of thinking of an array here as it's kind of a bit like a stack a stack data structure is is a data structure where the first item that we room we remove is the last one we added so if you think of like a stack of cards a deck of cards you can put a card on the top and you can take it off again in computer programming those kinds of data structures are called stacks now an array is not a stack because you know we can read items from anywhere within the array but this terminology posh is used with stacks and it indicates basically pushing something onto the top of a stack in this case we've got an array if you think of it like a deck of cards were like putting a card on on top of the cards like pushing a card on top of the cards it's a bit like that I don't know if that information really helps but we talked about pushing things onto the end of the array and that terminal terminology I think really comes from stack data structures okay so we can iterate through our array as well of course we could do we could do that in various ways so let's maybe just use a for loop conventional for loop which is we've already seen that in the course so let's do four let I equals 0 I less than fruit dot length I plus plus and we're going to see other ways of iterating through arrays later on in the course and will access fruits pi because this is not necessarily the most convenient way to do this let's also output a blank line to kind of create some separation in that in our output so if we look at the output now here we can see we're iterating through the array and you want to become really fluent with creating arrays adding items to them and iterating through them with a for loop is something you can just learn through practice so how would we deal with a two dimensional array well with a two dimensional array the elements are themselves arrays so let's create a two dimensional array now we need kind of a table of something so let's maybe write let animals equal and again I'll set it equal to an empty array now there are various subtleties around this and various things you can do but for our purposes here this this will be good to get us started so we could add to the end of animals for example by using push and what do we want to add we want to add a raise so let's say animals dot posh and let's add the first row of this table now the thing that we want to push is itself going to be an array so to denote an array we write square brackets like this and in there we can add some a list of animals let's write dog cat and mouse and that will add items to our two dimensional array and we could iterate through it using the technique that we saw in a previous tutorial or for now I could just iterate through the outer array let's maybe put a blank line again console dot log and then do four let's I equals zero I less than animals dot length now I plus plus and we'll iterate through this array and output the elements in it just just as we did up here and notice this I the scope of it in other words the region where it exists is just here outside of that it doesn't exist and that's why we can create a new eye here so I'm going to output animals I and now we're outputting one row at a time we've only got one row in it so far so if I run this program then we can see we've got an array of animals coming out because the the array is the eye sorry the elements in this animals array are themselves arrays we can of course add more to it so let's have another row in the table and this time I'll put animals that that are not familiar with because we don't really have them in England like Tiger I am familiar with them we we just don't have them roaming about okay lion and elephant kind of be nice if there are elephants in England probably a bit destructive but anyway okay so let's run this and we can see down here if you can see this we've got two rows now and second row is my sort of tropical type or animals that we don't have in England okay so that's it for this video I'm going to give you an exercise in the next video which you can do to kind of improve your fluency with this if you want main thing to do though is just practice it and you know practice typing it out probably if you're a complete beginner inevitably you'll make mistakes but that's the point of practice you'll correct your mistakes and eventually you'll stop making them so much okay so until next time happy coding
