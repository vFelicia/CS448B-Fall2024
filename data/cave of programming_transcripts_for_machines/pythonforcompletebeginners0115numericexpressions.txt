in this video we're going to take a look at numeric expressions in Python now here's an example where I think using the python console could actually be useful let's type python here and we get this python prompt in Python we can form arbitrarily complicated numerical expressions so for example we could do 7 * 4 + 3 and that will be evaluated by the python interpreter and we could assign the value of that in a program to a variable or we could print it out directly or whatever of course we can use floating Point numbers so we can say 1 2 * 4 or 1.2 * 4.3 or whatever and the result is now a a float a floating Point type instead of an INT so it's a type that has a decimal point in it some parts of the world use a comma here instead of a point I think much of Europe here would use a comma but in the UK and in the USA for example we use a point there we can also do division so let's try 5 / 3 and we get that 1. 666 notice that the division operator is this forward slash and of course you can do subtraction let's try 4.2 minus 2 in some programming languages if you divide an integer by an integer the remainder by default will just get discarded so this would then give us one and it would discard the remainder of two you can see that python doesn't do that if you want integer division in Python you want the kind of division where you actually want to discard the remainder you have to use a double slash like this so 7 / 3 that gives us two and it just discards the remainder the ordinary kind of division works like You' expect now we can also use brackets so let's try doing 2 * 3 + 2 that gives us 8 we could also try 2 + 2 * 3 which also gives us eight so these expressions are both seemingly ambiguous because this could mean 2 * 3 and then add on two it could also mean 2 * 3 + 2 which would be well 3 + 2 is is 5 and 2 * 5 is 10 that would give us a different result however some operators have higher precedence in programming languages generally than other operators so this multiplication operator has a higher precedence than plus division also has a higher precedence than plus or minus and that means these Expressions actually aren't ambiguous because because in ambiguous looking expressions like this the higher precedence operator will be evaluated first so that means in these Expressions the multiplication gets evaluated before you do the addition however I would recommend trying not to create ambiguous Expressions it makes the code easier to read if you put brackets in so that it's really clear what you intended so instead of writing 2 plus 2 * 3 I could put brackets around the multiplication to show that that's actually what I intend they aren't necessary but they they can make Expressions easier to read especially for new programmers so you can see that if I put the brackets in a different place then of course I get a different result so if I put them around 2 + 2 I would get 12 instead there are some more arithmetical operators and logical operators that we will see as we go through the course for the moment I would recommend just practicing this create some expressions using the two types of division operator subtraction multiplication and addition and try putting brackets into more complicated Expressions just to see what they do if you just try everything out once or twice that's enough practice of this for the moment I think and of course the point of this is that you can use these in actual programs you could set a variable equal to 2 + 2 * 3 for example and as we'll see these values could also be variables instead of numeric literals this is a free video from my Python and machine learning course I'm uploading some videos from the start of the course to get you started with python the full course is absolutely huge and teaches you python and a basics of machine learning and artificial intelligence with a ton of exercises and solutions please click the link in the description for the full course
