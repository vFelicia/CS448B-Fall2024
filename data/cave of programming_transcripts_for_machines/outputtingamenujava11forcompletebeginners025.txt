hello in this video we're going to work through a possible solution to the exercise I gave you in the last video do watch this video even if you successfully did the exercise because I'm going to make a few remarks here if you've managed to output this text by any means at all then basically you've you've done the exercise and you solved the problem if you couldn't manage to do it then maybe watch this video and try again try to get that working you should be able to do this especially you might need to watch the previous video again but you should be able to manage it okay so I'm going to store all the text here in strings so the first one let's call it prompt and set it equal to select an option and then we'll have also a string option 1 equals add an entry now you can use numbers in variable names like I've used one here you just can't put them at the start of a variables putting them at the start as a variable gives you an error but you can use some of other positions in your variable and we'll have two more of those which I'll call option two and option three option two is going to be viewed the database and option three is going to be exit we'll also have some numbers in here just we'll separate those out just to make it as complicated as possible let's call this value one we set it equal to one notice that this is a number and we're assigning it to a variable of type int which is an integer if I had and one in double quotes like that so this gives us an error because he would need type string because this is text so whatever you put in quotes it doesn't matter even if it's digits and it looks like a number it's not a number it's some text so stuff in quotes is treated as text whereas this without the quotes is a number and those things are there from numbers and text are treated differently in Java so it doesn't matter if you've got text that just looks like a number it's not number it's not a number here it's text because it's in quotes anyway we'll get rid of those and we'll copy this and we'll have another two of them so value 1 2 3 2 3 so we could just output those we could also store them in another string let's call it menu so what do we have we have prompt and then we've got option we've got value 1 and then we've got option 1 and I could just type these out in a massive long line I could add them all together but I'm going to do something slightly different let's let's in fact start this off as just being an empty string alright and then we're gonna say menu plus equals what does plus equal do well this is the same as writing menu equals menu plus this other stuff so in the context of a string what plus equals does is it takes the existing string whatever is already in it which here is nothing and then it adds small stuff onto it so by this means we can build up the menu without having a hugely long line we're going to see another way of doing this later on but for here let's carry on like this in fact let's let's set this initially equal to prompt and then I can add on the values and the options and what I'm striving for here is I'm striving for elegance and trying to make this look beautiful because I want it to be clear and easy to read I want it to be very logical so I can see what's happening here the more beautiful your program is in general these are is to modify it and remember what it's actually doing and that sort of thing let's try outputting that so at each stage I'm using plus equals to add more text to the existing string it starts off as prompt and then it's prompt plus one add an entry yeah there we go then it's we take that string and we do plus equals and then join this on so we're using plus equals to keep we keep adding more texts to the menu so if we output that what's it look like terrible because it's all on one line there's no tabs or anything let's add in some tabs so to do that we could just we could just put them literally in in here that would work or here let's try it so here I'm going to say I'm going to put it in double quotes slash T plus do I need anything else I don't think I do at that point so the others are going to start with two slash T's so I'm gonna have slash t / t plus and we also actually want a dot and a space after the option so I need to add that in as well so let's put that here dot space plus okay so it looks like this let's go through and add all of these in so I'm going to copy that and paste it I'm trying to use as few keystrokes as possible as well because it saves typing let's run that and still not working because we need the newline it looks better though so let's add in some new lines let's say here plus slash n need double quotes there all right and I need to add these to the end of every line so now I finally I run this and I've got my menu here okay so now this is really a horrible program I would never normally write a program like that it's the best we can do if we on the one hand divide everything up putting everything into separate variables but on the other hand we stick to things that we've seen so far we don't use programming constructs that we haven't seen yet but with some more knowledge we could reduce this down to a much smaller program and at the very least a more elegant program that doesn't have all this repetition in it there's a lot of repetition in here which we could eliminate and we're going to see how to do that in a future tutorial so if you did something that output this text correctly then give yourself a pat on about if you did something horrendously complex like this and that's amazing that's really wonderful if you didn't then I suggest typing this out try typing it out for yourself to see what it does you can even output the menu like here before you've completed making it so you can see what that does so if I run this and I should have two menus I've got this menu fragment at this point and then I carried on adding two more options to it and I create this second menu which I output here okay so try typing this out if you can be bothered at least I know it's a bit verbose and see what it does maybe experiment with it check that you understand this check you understand the idea of adding more text onto an existing string okay so we're going to go on to look at some things that would make this a lot more elegant and have a lot less duplication in it but we'll leave it there for a moment so until next time happy coding
