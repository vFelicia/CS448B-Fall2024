hello this is John from Cave of programming. comom this is a beginners tutorial for Java and we're going to be creating a hello world Java program in this which is the free Eclipse integrated development environment for Java I'm going to assume that you've already installed the jdk the JRE and Eclipse itself go to the workbench which is where we'll do our work appropriately enough and go to file new Java project and give your project a a name I'm going to call this tutorial one but you can call it anything you like click next and we can accept the defaults again on this screen click finish and now we've got this tutorial folder here and you can see that you've got the the Java system libraries included and you've got this empty Source folder if you right click on the the project folder you can then go to new class and we need um a class here that will be the only class that our hello world program contains and um I'm going to you can call it anything you like but I'm going to call it application and here you can see a box which you can tick to get Eclipse to create a main method for you that will be the the actual starting point of our program the entry point and um you need to have one of these in in every program that you create somewhere so I'll take this box just to save as a bit of typing and then click finish and now we've got our our class it's called application and we've got a main method standard main method which every program has and which will fire off your program code if you look at this stuff this is um this is just a Java comment this is actually formatted for the Java do pro program but you don't need to worry about that just get rid of it for the moment and I'll get rid of this comment as well um just by hitting the back key and here I'm going to type sis out and press control space and Eclipse autoc completes and you can see here I've got a print Ln method um which is Java's way of writing to the console in there I'm going to type uh two speech marks speech marks so double quotes what is going on with my computer okay there we go um and uh I'll just put some text in there hello world which is traditional and this this blank line under there I'm going to get rid of by selecting it and pressing contrl D which is a handy shortcut and this is a finished Java program and I can run it by clicking the Run button this green button here it Eclipse might ask you if you want to save your files and of course say yes and then you can see the output down here hello world if this is your first Java program then congratulations you are now a Java programmer and uh I hope you find this useful you can find more tutorials and information on Cave of programming. comom and until the next tutorial happy coding
