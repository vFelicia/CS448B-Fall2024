hello in this video we're going to take a look at how to terminate our while loops from our program so in the last video we saw an example of a nonterminating while loop so a loop that just keeps going forever an infinite loop uh in this video we're going to make it actually terminate so let's start by here i've got a new i've got a new project which i've called loop conditions and i'm gonna i'm gonna recreate a while loop so it's worth typing this a few times yourself so you get into the swing of typing it let's write while true open a curly bracket and then make sure that kelly bracket's closed and let's output a system.out.printline hello i'd strongly recommend typing this out several times because it'll really help you you've got to sort of memorize these constructs but not by just looking at them and thinking but rather than by by typing them a few times that really helps okay so um what we'll do here is above the while loop and it's really important that we do this above the while loop i'm going to declare an integer variable i'm going to call it int counter and i'll set it equal to zero to start with let's output the counter in our system.out.print a light print line in fact let's write in here well let's use print printf just for some practice using it so here instead of hello i'm going to write counter colon just for some text and then i'm going to put percent d and then let's finish it with a backslash n to create a new line after each time this is this runs so that the first argument is this string with a format specifier in it percent d and after that i'm going to write comma counter all right so if we run that as it is we're just gonna see zero printed over and over again so let's look terminate it with the red button there so it just says counter zero but now within the loop i'm going to go underneath where i wrote system.out.printf and i'm going to say counter i'm going to assign a new value to counter so i want to use the assignment operator and a new value is going to be the original value counter plus one so now every time the loop goes round it'll give this new value to counter and the new value will be the original value with one added to it and that's going to mean that the counter is going to increase one by one let's run it and we can see we've now got huge values very quickly being output here you might have a lower value if your computer's a bit slower if you've got an even faster computer than me you're going to get more numbers being output there probably all right um we can use this to terminate our loop and by the way this is not the only way we can do this but for the moment we'll we'll leave it at this because it's already quite puzzling by itself uh it's not an equation remember we're literally saying okay take take this value so it's best really in a way to read it from right to left so we're saying take counter whatever the value is add one to it and then we're going to assign that that value back to the variable counter so if counter is zero we add one and we get one and then we assign the value one well don't mean to do that we're going to assign the value one to the variable counter so counter is now one that's why it's incrementing like that that's why it's increasing we can use that to terminate the loop if we change this to while counter less than ten all right so this is a less than symbol and what this is saying is do the loop while it's true that the value of counter is less than 10. all right so i'm going to make some more remarks about this in the next video but for now just type this out and even if it's puzzling now it will gradually start to make sense but typing is really you know it's almost like 90 of the challenge in a way because you type these and you become familiar and gradually i suppose the thing is it's a lot easier to understand a program if it's already in your memory if you already remember what the program looks like it becomes a lot easier to understand it than if you're also struggling to remember what different bits it has and when you type it out that forces you to pay attention to every single character in the program and that really helps so you notice here we've got a semicolon you could easily forget that easily forget these semicolons but by typing them over and over again you just get used to putting them in you remember that they're there so typing is typing programs and running them it's really really important so now if we run this we see in the console we can actually make this console bigger if i drag it up we've got counter zero one two three four five six seven eight nine uh so we've got ten iterations in total so there's one to nine but there's also zero so we've looped 10 times and we carried on looping as long as the value of counter was less than 10. so when it was equal to 10 what happened was uh the program said okay while 10 because counter eventually equal 10 is less than 10 do the loop and it said well it's not true that 10 is less than 10 so i'm not going to run this so ev when this is true if if while finds that this condition is true so that the counter is less than 10 it will run whatsoever in brackets once and then it goes back to the beginning and checks the condition again and if it's still true it runs it again eventually here in this program it's finding that this condition is not true and then it just does nothing then your program carries on to the lines after the while loop don't puzzle about that too much for now the important thing is type this out and get it working and if you want a little challenge try to write a program that outputs let's say the word hello or whatever you like exactly five times no more and no less exactly five times uh you could also make it output some number but you don't forget you're going to need this in order to stop the loop to stop the loop you need that and you need that and you also another place that beginners often go wrong is they put this variable declaration and assignment to zero that in initial variable declaration they put it inside the loop so inside these curly brackets and if you do that counter will always be zero and it will never stop running you've got to have this outside the loop you use it in this condition and very important you increment it which means increase it basically within this within this block and that's where your system.out is also going or system.out.printf in this case so try that for yourself and then try to create a program that outputs some text exactly five times just for an exercise okay so until next time happy coding
