hello this is John from cave of programming calm this is the third tutorial in our series of tutorials for beginners in Java in the last tutorial we looked at Java's primitive types there are eight primitive types in Java and in this tutorial we're gonna look at our first non primitive type the string type and then in the next tutorial we can look at loops but before you do anything with loops we need to know how to represent texts in Java so I'm in Eclipse as usual and I'm gonna create a new Java project and I'm gonna give it a name let's call it tutorial 3 and click Next and finish now as in the first tutorial we're going to create a class which will be the only class in our little test program here I'm gonna right click on the project folder and go to new class and this time I'm not gonna take public static void main I'm not gonna ask it to create the main method just because I want to show you a different way of doing that I'll give the class a name I'm gonna call this application click finish and here is my application class now every program in Java as we saw in the first tutorial must have a main method and that's where the program starts and one way of creating one of course you could type it yourself here but just to show you another Eclipse shortcut I'll type main and press control space and hit return and hey presto I've got a main method the only thing is the indentation all wrong here and I'm gonna select that and press tab once because every time you have brackets like these everything inside them should be indented one tab otherwise you won't be able to keep track of what belongs to what so we saw in the last tutorial that you can create an integer variable which is kind of just a box that you can put integers into like this so int my int equals seven semicolon for example and in the same way you can create a string type which holds text except that it's string with an uppercase s because string is not a primitive type it's actually a class and I'll call this text for example it could be anything and I'll set that equal to some text hello so what's going on here I'm going to labor this point a little bit because gradually I want to introduce you to the concept of objects and classes and so string is a class which means it's just a type for example in a real world we have cats but the concept cats isn't doesn't refer to a particular card it's it's a general type of of something it's a type of animal in fact and in the same way string here is a type of object that can hold text this is a variable which is which is capable of not of holding or storing a string instance but it's capable of referring to a thing that has the type string and don't worry if this sounds like Greek because we'll keep coming back to it and you'll gradually get used to it and this is actually a text object so you've got class string and particular instance of the class in other words an object here and I can output that just by typing sis out control space and put text in there and if I click run we should get hello if my computer wasn't so horrendously slow and you can do a lot of some interesting things with strings for example you can add them together let's create a string called blank and I'll set that equal to just some empty space like that I'll create another string called name Oh so that equal to Bob I can add all these strings together I can say okay here's a string greeting and with greeting and I'm gonna put that equal to text plus blank plus name semicolon and remember that every statement must end in a semicolon now if I put greeting in here it's gonna output hello and space and Bob and in fact you can add string objects together directly because I can achieve the same thing if I type system.out.println and I could write for example Bob plus some space plus hello no no actually I wanted to type hello space and Bob and then semicolon at the end of the line and we'll get the same thing again and you can also if you've got for example an int you can you can output you can concatenate that with a string when we add strings we speak about concatenating I'll types this out control space and for some like say my integer is and add my int and if I run that my integer is seven hey presto notice this is a very labored way of doing this because I got to just type one long string and said hello space Bob but I've just to show you addition of strings concatenation I've created three separate strings here lots of other things you can do with strings and we will look at some more things in the next tutorial but for now I just wanted to show you how you can output some text and you can work variables into it and one last thing is yeah supposing you have some variable as to Clara a double variable double precision floating point number seven point eight and of course I can put that in the middle of string as well I could say my number is plus well I missed off the variable name my double my double plus and it's just have a full stop and that will also work my number is seven point eight that's all for this tutorial pretty simple have fun try adding strings together and see where you get and in the next tutorial we'll look at loops and we'll start really leveraging the power of Java to do things that would be incredibly tedious to do by hand that's all for this time you can find more information and tutorials on cave of programming com I hope you will join me again for the next tutorial my name is John and until next time happy coding you you
