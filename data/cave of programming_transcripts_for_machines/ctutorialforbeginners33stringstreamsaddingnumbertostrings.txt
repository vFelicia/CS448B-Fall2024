hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to look at string streams in C++ I I wanted to show you constructor parameters in this tutorial but I realized that we really could do with looking at string strings first string strings that you concatenate disparate types of data like for example a double and a and a string into a single string so I've created this program here and I've got rid of everything apart from just the main function and the return method so that we can look at this from scratch so to speak so I'm going to start by declaring int which I'll call age and let's set that equal to 32 and I'll also declare string here which I'll call name and we'll set that equal to Bob now supposing we want a single string here that includes both of these bits of information well we could output them both using a see out statement but that's only good if we want to output these immediately we could output these with a single C out statement or some put two operators we're seeing that before but what if we want to build up a string containing both of these bits of information so that we can use it elsewhere in the program well the first thing here is that I need to include iostream so that I can use string so let's go ahead and do that include iostream and it might be i stream dot H on your system you might need string dot H or something different but if you do you'll find out at this point and consuming to Google flat information for your compiler and we also say using names name space standard just some STD just so that we can use the string now what we'd like to do is something like this string info equals age less a name colon plus name plus and some punctuation and let's say age plus age and of course we could output that with C out if it worked we could say CL info info endler now that doesn't work we don't see any errors here in Eclipse at least not for the canoe compiler that I'm using but let's try to build it and what we find is we get a load of errors here and if we just go to the top we see that is telling me the the problem is this plus sign here it's the plus sign this one here and the reason for that is that plus it's not defined for a string which this law is and an age of an asari on an int which this is so we could add two ends together that's no problem we can concatenate two strings with a plus sign that's no problem but we can't concatenate an INT with a string and to get around that we can use a class code string stream the first thing we need to do is include at the top here and we need to include string I think is called this SS s stream line SS dream so this I'm pretty sure it is called different things on different compilers maybe not but it's worth just putting the including commenting out anything else that gives you an error for the moment and just checking that you can compile the project make sure it's saved and compile it just with that include that stream we've also got some error here that's just a warning yes so it actually the build has actually been successful and we can run it we just got a warning because we're not using these variables I suppose now if you can't build and run this program with with no output like this then and you have an error that's pointing to this line then it may be caused something different on your system like s stream dot H or even I don't know even string stream by H or something and you just you just need to Google that for your compiler know Google string stream visual C++ or whatever but here it's fine and what I can do now is declare an object of the type string stream which are called SS string screen and again I'm going to save that one I'm gonna build it and I'd recommend you do the same and just chat we don't get any errors we're getting getting this warning about these unused variables but I could just comment those out made it us that's better you just build it and it should look pretty good yeah so we've got no errors if you do get an error again just Google string stream for your compiler and see if it's called something different there you need to make sure that you've got using namespace standard because not only strings see out but also string stream or in this namespace and we'll look at namespaces in future so once you've got this working with that include and with the actual variable declared a type string stream and go ahead and use it so streams in programming are the streams of data basically the things that you can send data to or get data from so this represents a kind of stream that is used to build a per stream so now instead of this which doesn't work what we can do is we can say SS use the put two operator just as we do out with this which is the console output stream so SS put 2 and say age is and then we'll use another line and assess putt to age and actually let's put at the start here SS putt to name is and SS putt to name and then just before 8 are putting some Center some punctuation just to split it up visually and now finally in our C out we can do C out SS dot strobe and a dot stret method of string stream converts it to an actual string let's run that and see if it works so now we've got name is Bob 8 is 32 so now we could pass this this object around or even we could convert it to a string let's say we could say string info equals ssstop stro and then we could to start put info in RCL so that the object of all of this here was just to get this information in a single string info and we can then do what we like with it in this case we're just gonna help put it down here so to practice this and it's important to practice and just again declare some variables you can use doubles in strings whatever comes to mind really try it with anything that you feel like trying it with and then use a string stream to turn it all into a single string and then output it and we'll use that later and if anything doesn't work don't hesitate to Google for how to do this for your particular compiler so we'll leave it there for this tutorial and until next time happy coding you
