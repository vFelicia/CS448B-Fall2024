hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to learn creating tables with multiple columns and we're also going to look at a new data type int so at the moment I've got a table called users if I do desc users we can see that table that's just got one column in at the moment one thing to note at this point is that if you're using the my sequel workbench you can click on the commands in this output pane right at the bottom right click them and go to replace sequel with selected items and that will actually override what's currently in the sequel pane query pane and replace it with that query you selected so it's a really useful feature if you want to reuse some sequel that you read that you executed previously and if you're using a command line often command lines have a feature where you can just press the up arrow to get back to previous queries usually a command line will give you some way of doing that even if you you have you might have to configure something sometimes to get it to work okay so let's take a look at this I'm going to actually drop this table in other words delete it I'm going to say drop table users and let's let's just check let's do a double check let's do show tables we can see that the users table is now gone so obviously you have to be careful with this query and I'm going to say create table users so we're going to recreate it and I'm going to create it with two columns I'm going to say ID that's going to be the name of the first column and I'm going to make it an int and an int is a numerical value in my sequel it can store integers and so not floatingpoint numbers you know with a decimal point in them just integer values and we'll put a comma in and make the second column now use the name Tex so now we've got two columns ID and username so in this in this statement here where you specify the columns at the table you can provide a comma separated list with there can be lots of columns in there to add multiple columns to your table let's execute this and where are we in fact if you guys selected that and executed it which only executes a part of it by one the whole thing so deselect that run again and yes it's run fine now and let's do a desk users so though we've got two values they are both allowed to be null at this point I'm going to look at that a bit more shortly let's just insert some data in there so this you can probably guess how this works in fact if you want to pause the recording pause the video and have a go at yourself you can probably figure it out let's try it say insert into users ID user name values and we'll put in let's put in one for the ID and the text goes in quotes the text values have to be in quotes and let's say username Bob so once again we can we can just replace where we previously had a single column we can replace it with comma separated list we'll run that and let's put another one in if it run okay which I see that it did let's put Vicki in run that and now let's do select star from users so we've got Bob and Vicki so that's it for this tutorial do have a go at like yourself you can even create tables with multiple columns you can have multiple pets columns multiple integer columns whatever you like and then one thing probably that's worth mentioning already at this point is if you search in Google or your favorite search engine for my sequel types you can find a list of the different data types that you can use we've seen int and text so far but there's a lot of different types here if we go to numeric types for instance and then we go to integer types so we can see that an in it can store integers between these two big values but sometimes you want smaller integer value it's better to use a smaller one if you know you're only going to small store small values of integers because that takes up less space in your database so you might use small in tinyint or conversely if you need a really massive integer in there you might want to use big int okay so that's it for this tutorial have a go to that because we're going to build on it in the next tutorial so until next time happy coding
