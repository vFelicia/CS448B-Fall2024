in this video I just want to talk about a few things we can do with this hello world program and I want to give you a few tips for working with Visual Studio code well on my machine the menu is called code it could be called something different or this menu option could be somewhere else on your system but you'll find it pretty easily there is an option called preferences and in there we've got an option of for keyboard shortcuts and it's worth getting a bit familiar with this or at least having a look at it so for example if I want to duplicate a line let's type line we can see that there is a command for doing exactly that we can this is going to look different on your system if you're using Windows but on the Mac I can press shift alt and the down arrow to duplicate a line downwards and you can also duplicate the line upwards and there are lots of other useful commands that you can find in here by searching and it's very easy to set your own custom commands so you don't need to memorize these but if you find yourself doing something a lot some kind of editing action it is worth having a look in here and seeing if there's an existing shortcut or if you can create one to an existing command so let's try that out I'm going to just duplicate this line and you can do this just by copying it and pasting it or you can do it using the shortcut command so if I save this and then run it then of course it prints hello world twice by the way there is a peculiar thing I've noticed about Powershell at least on my system which is that if I don't go through this step of modifying the file to be executable so I can run it just by typing the name of it it actually fails silently which is unusual behavior for a shell and that can be confusing so if you don't see any output and you're using Mac or Linux then maybe you just got to add executable permissions for it but I can also run that of course like this and you can put pretty much whatever text you want in here let's try that so what I would suggest is that you try playing around with this really basic program just try putting more lines in there try putting different text between these double quotes and see what happens you can put almost any text in here so what we're doing here is we're calling the print function so we're running some code called print in other words and we're supplying it with a string so in other words a string of letters some characters and you can put more or less any character in here there are just one or two things that might cause you problems in particular a backslash like that has a special meaning within python strings so I'm not sure what will happen if I try to run that well actually it works anyway so Python's pretty forgiving with things that could go wrong but maybe something like this does that work it actually does okay so you can type more or less anything in here but it's possible you could come across something that you can't type but generally most things are going to work another thing that I want to mention about Visual Studio code is that it has this thing called the command palette so on my system this is in the view menu and I go to view command palette and then let's type code in here and I find this option shell command install code command in path so things that are in what we call the path in your shell those are commands that are accessible in the shell like for example the python command so if I do that then in my shell here in Powershell I can actually open files by typing code and then the name of the file so of course this is already open but let's try closing it and do that and you can see it works and that's I find that really useful sometimes but the normal way to open a file would be to use well file open or use the Explorer here which you can toggle with this icon and you can see that there I'm able to open hello.pi and I've got this files.txt just because I created it but actually I'm not going to use this and I can also delete it from here as well if I want and of course this VM directory that contains your virtual environment stuff so you don't want to mess with that this is a folder I've created you don't need to create it but I'm trying to reorganize source code a bit so it's going to look nice when you when you finally see this so at the moment you probably only have hello Pi present here plus the VM directory okay so have a go create a few new new lines a few new lines of print statements as we call them and and try putting other text in it and just see what happens this is a free video from my course Python and machine learning for complete beginners I'm releasing the first couple of chapters of this course completely for free on YouTube to get you started with python I plan to upload new videos here to YouTube every Monday and every Thursday for at least a couple of months if you're interested in the complete course which teaches you python from scratch and eventually progresses to things like creating graphical user interfaces and using neural networks principal component analysis cluster analysis all that stuff and much more besides then you can find a link in the description or just go to this URL on the screen right here if you finish the whole course you'll be able to write all kinds of general purpose programs in Python and use Python to do machine learning and artificial intelligence as well thank you for watching until next time happy coding
