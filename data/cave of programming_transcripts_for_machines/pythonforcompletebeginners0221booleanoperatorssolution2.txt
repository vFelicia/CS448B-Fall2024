in this video I want to show you another approach to this exercise which some people might find simpler and clearer obviously you have to be a bit practiced with Boolean logic to be able to dash this stuff off quickly but there is another way we could tackle this that may be more intuitive to some people let's get rid of this logic bit here and leave in place only the code that acquires the Boolean inputs that we need then I'm going to say at the start can rent equals false so we have that already declared and assigned a value and now we just want to figure out if that should be changed or how it should be changed so we can break this down into two cases as before either they're a student or they're not and different rules apply for students than non students in this exercise so let's say if is student colon and then I'm going to say okay well students cannot rent the property see if they smoke or have pets so let's say here and I I have a nested if if does smoke or has pets in that case can rent equals false which is the default anyway else can rent equals true so we solved the same problem for the case where they're a student I've just used if statements in here I've used a nested if statement nested within the other if statement let's tackle the case where they're not a student so that's going to be else because there's nothing else they can be other than a student if they're not a student then we put them in the general category of person and the rules that apply then are they can rent the property if they smoke or have pets but not both so then we can say if does smoke and has pets can rent equals false else so in this case they're not a student and it's not true that they smoke and have pets as well so in this other case we can say can rent equals true and there we've solved the problem right and I've simply used more if statements and less sort of concentrated Boolean logic it is ultimately still the same logic it's just written in a different way using nested ifs so let's see if it works are you a student let's say I am a student do you have pets yes and then do you smoke no so I can't rent in that that case so what if I'm a student and I don't have pets but I do smoke still can't rent if I'm a student I have to answer no to both of these questions before I can rent it now if I'm not a student if I have pets and I don't smoke it's fine if I'm not a student and I don't have pets but I do smoke it's fine if I'm not a student I have pets and smoke then it's not fine so you can't do both if you're not a student what about if I'm not a student and I don't do either of those things then of course I can rent it so it works and I would suggest if you haven't already written your program in this way then put this code way and see if you can write it like this yourself it requires a little bit of thought but that's good for you so basically the more time you spent thinking about this stuff and trying out Solutions the better that's what's going to make you a good programmer ultimately but if you're already bored with this particular topic there's no harm in just moving on from it but it is a good idea to be practicing this stuff at some stage somehow hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
