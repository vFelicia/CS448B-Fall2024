in this video we're going to look at some more comparison operators in Python we're going to look at these if you start a line in Python with a hash sign like this or if you put that anywhere on a line in Python whatever comes after it on that line is a comment so you can use this hash symbol to add comments to your code some programs go overboard with this but it's probably much more common that programmers don't put enough comments into their code as a beginner you might feel like putting a lot of comments into your code or not it's up to you I would suggest in general that comments should be added to code in cases where you're writing a block of code and it's really not obvious what it does so you maybe want to make a note to say what that code is supposed to be doing but of course you have to keep your comments up to date if you change the code or otherwise they'll get misleading so let's take a look at these operators we've already seen the equality test operator equals equals we could write for example print let's try cat equals equals cat now on the face of it this looks useless but of course one or both of these strings would normally be a variable so it wouldn't be obvious what the result is going to be if I run this since they're both string literals of course we get true if I change one of them to something else then we're going to get false pretty straightforward and we've seen also that you can use this operator with integers so if I write here 5al equal 6 what's that going to return well this is going to evaluate to false and so we print false it's not a good idea to use equals equals with floating Point values because floating Point values are not stored precisely in the computer's memory so you can get misleading results from doing that with floating Point values the question you would want to be asking instead is is this floating point value close to this other floating point value rather than asking if they're equal which is not necessary as meaningful as you might think under the circumstances here but with integers equals equals works really well we've also got less than so we could write print five less than six well that should be true right so it says true and we've got greater than so 5 greater than 6 of course that's false now useful trick for remembering the difference between greater than and less than if you're not used to them they are found in mathematics as well is let's just zoom in a bit if you look at these symbols they both have a sort of big end to them and a small end right there's a big end there a small end if the smaller value is at the smaller end and the bigger value is at the bigger end then the whole thing evaluates to true if it's the other way around so in this case you've got the smaller value at the big end and a bigger value at the small end then these Expressions evaluate to false and you can see that works we've got true and false here it's the right way round so to speak and here it's the wrong way round surprisingly these also work with strings so we could say print cat greater than dog of course this is a topic that brings out strong opinions but leaving that aside is this going to be true or false let's run it and see so it's false why well this is basically doing an alphabetical comparison and dog occurs later in the alphabet than cat so in a sense dog is greater than cat here on the other hand watch what happens if I give dog a capital letter at the start so we did get false remember now we get true why is that well strictly speaking this isn't exactly an alphabetical comparison in fact every letter has a number in the Unicode table of characters and it's using those numbers to do the comparison you can find out what the numbers of letters are using the OD function let's print OD this is a builtin function and let's try it on C and we'll also try it on D and what we find is that the number of C in the Unicode character set is 99 and the number of D is only 68 so if we go to a browser and we search for Unicode table or something like that so we've got a table at this site unic cod.com it's pretty good and we can see here that in fact the capital letters occur in this table before the lowercase letters which explains why the capital letters have lower numbers associated with them than the lowercase letters so you can use less than and greater than with strings as well as with integers we've also got not equals so let's do print cat not equal to dog is that true or false well it's true because uh cat the text is not equal to this text dog so we get true there and we've got less than or equal to and greater than or equal to let's try we'll try numbers this time so five greater than or equal to 6 is that true or false it's false five is not greater than six it's also not equal to six so this is false let's try five less than or equal to five is this true or false well five is not less than five but it is equal to five so 5 less than or equal to 5 is actually true and that comes back true now what I'd suggest you do with these is as always I don't recommend stressing about memorizing this stuff but I do very strongly recommend trying it out try this out try out all of these operators with your own integers and strings check if they behave as you expect and if you find anything unexpected try to figure out why it doesn't work quite as you expect you can always come back to this code right here and if you're really unsure about this stuff then a good way to start is just literally typing out this it's really surprising how typing code out helps you become familiar with it it's as if a lot of the learning really does take place in your finger I find that once I've typed code it's then much easier to understand it after I've typed it so try all these out for yourself don't stress about memorizing them we're going to be using them as we go through the course but definitely do try them out hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
