hello my name's John and I'm the creator of the website Cave of programming comm and this is the first video in a complete course on I hope it will be a complete course by the time I finished it on JavaScript and node J s so I started web programming I think it was in like 1997 or something was a long time ago and I couldn't have anticipated that JavaScript would end up turning into this powerful fully fledged language that you could actually have a whole career in because when I started web programming and well for a long time afterwards JavaScript was really a thing that he used to add a little bit of interactivity to websites I can't even remember really when JavaScript came out but for a long time it was a pain in the neck because it ran differently on different browsers and it was a language that ran within a browser it wasn't some freestanding programming language but with no js' all that has changed javascript has changed into a powerful independent fully fledged programming language in its own right you can create websites with it you can create web servers you can create desktop applications in this course my intention is that we're going to learn the JavaScript language itself so we're going to be doing a lot of stuff on the command line but I want to eventually at the end of the course to show you at least one example of how you could use JavaScript to create let's say maybe a simple website something like that so my plan is actually to make this course and then I'm going to make a course that isn't going to be free on react probably but this is a selfcontained course in the next video of course I'm hoping that you eventually buy my paid course in the next video we're going to look at what you have to install to get going with JavaScript and node.js
