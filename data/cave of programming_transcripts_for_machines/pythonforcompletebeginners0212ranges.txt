in this video we're going to take a look at some more advanced uses of the range function supposing we want a loop that prints out the values 0 1 2 and 3 if you practiced Maybe by now you can already do that from memory if not don't worry I remember when I was learning this stuff myself I did have to type out four Loops a whole bunch of times before I could remember how to do them that was when I was originally learning to program and python wasn't the first thing that I learned so let's write 4 I in range 4 colon and then under that indented let's write print I so what's this going to do we're creating a range which Remember by default starts at zero and it's going to iterate up to four so this range is going going to be the numbers 0 1 2 3 it's not going to include four at the end of the range there and if we run this we get 01 2 3 now there are more arguments that we can pass to the range function so one thing we can do is specify the start of the range so let's say I don't want my range to start at zero I want it to start at one I could put one here it has to go before the four so we need one comma four this is the start of the range which is included in the range of numbers this is the end of the range which is not included in the range of numbers that we will Loop over so if I run this we get 1 2 3 we can also specify a step size as the third argument to this function if I copy this let's have here a print that's not indented just to create a new line in the output and I'm going to paste a copy of that so supposing we want the numbers 4 6 8 10 so what do we want to start on we want to start on four and what do we want to end on 10 but remember the range of numbers that we produce will not include the end here so we want to put 11 and now we don't want 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 we only want 4 6 8 10 so we want to skip every other number in other words we want a step size of two instead of the default step size of one so I can put two here and then if we run this we get 4 6 8 10 now we can call this the loop counter it count counts which iteration of the loop we're on it tells you where you are in the loop from a certain point of view and you can use it in whatever way you like sometimes you want to repeat some code though and you're not interested in the value of any Loop counter and if you want to do that let's just copy that what you can do is just use an underscore here instead of a variable name so this could be whatever you want I could write hello there that's a strange name for a variable but I could do that and I could print the value of hello and if we run this we get 468 10 as before but supposing I'm not interested in what this value is I can just put underscore right there and this is just a common convention if I could still print the underscore that's a perfectly legitimate variable name but the point of using an underscore variable name is to indicate that you're not actually interested in the value of it that's purely there so that this four statement actually works so let's say I want to print hello three times I could just write this so for underscore in range three print hello I'm ignoring the value of the loop counter and I'm just printing hello three times try this out for yourself and it's pretty easy to make up exercises with this so for example can you create a loop that prints hello 5 hello 10 hello 15 and hello 20 and then stops try it out and see what you can come up with hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
