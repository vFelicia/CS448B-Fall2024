by the end of this section of the course you'll be able to write programs like this one here first let me demonstrate the program to you so I'll run it and it asked me to enter my password if I enter the password incorrectly it says incorrect password and it will do that for a maximum of three times after which the program terminates and it says access denied if I enter the password correctly hello 1 2 3 it says greetings Professor Falcon I chose this just because a long time ago there was a film and a book called war games and according to my memory which is dubious at the best of times there's a computer in that owned by the United States military and a boy hacks into it please don't do that and when he logs in successfully as a hacker it says greetings Professor Falcon because it's Professor Falcon who usually uses it and designed it so in the course of learning how this program works we're going to be learning about conditionals those are things that can execute code selectively depending on whether some condition is true or not and also Loops which enable us to run a block of code multiple times and by the end of this section of the course you will understand everything in this little program so let's set to work figuring out how this is put together hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
