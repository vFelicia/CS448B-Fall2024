hello in this video we're going to look at while loops in java so looping is where we really start to leverage the power of programming to change what would otherwise be extremely repetitive or even impossibly repetitive tasks into something we can just get the computer to do automatically so uh what i'll do here since i'm using eclipse and since i don't want to see all these projects um i've created a new project called while loops for this video i'm just going to click this little down arrow by the package explorer go to select working set i'm going to select projects 2 which doesn't have any projects in it at the moment this is what i created in the last video click edit and i'm going to say that i want while loops in this working set click add for that click finish and i just want to see the projects two working set so i click ok and there we go that's cleared things up a lot okay so i've got a blank project here and i'm gonna output some text so sis out control space and hello and let's run this project so it just says hello nothing spectacular there now a while loop looks like this so i use a java key word a reserved word so it's a special word in the java language and there aren't all that many reserved words in the java language but this is one of them and we can already see some others for example public and class and package so let's type while and next we've got two round brackets like this and then we've got an opening curly bracket on the same line uh it's on the same line because because of the code formatting convention that i'm using you could be using a different one but i wouldn't recommend it and then hit return and eclipse is actually put in the closing curly bracket for me now what what's this going to do well we're going to put stuff between these curly brackets so in this code block between these two curly brackets we're going to put statements that we want to run repeatedly over and over again and we have to have some way of saying how many times we're going to run them repeatedly and in this case what i'm going to do is something that you uh you don't usually do in a computer program but we're just learning here so it's fine i'm gonna make it run forever or rather until we stop the program and to do that i'm going to say while and in the round brackets i'm going to put true what's true well it's um that's a good question you know what we'll we'll tackle that in a future video but we have a primitive type in java called boolean and it can take the values true and false so like an integer can take the values we can take whole number values boolean the boolean type boolean types of variables can take these values true or false just one of these two values and here we're using true so that's saying while true is true in other words keep looping and the value true is always true so it will loop forever don't worry too much about this if this sounds baffling i'm almost managing to confuse myself don't worry about it for the moment but we'll be looking at much more sophisticated while loops later on for some reason i've got an aeroplane going past it always happens when i make videos okay so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to select this system.out.printline hello and i'm gonna just cut it so ctrl x or command x on the map and i'm gonna paste it between these curly brackets that didn't go so well let me try again there we go and just to make sure the formatting is okay i'm going to run the auto format ctrl shift f okay that removed a few plant lines so we're saying while true is true in other words while forever um output hello and if we run this little program now then it outputs hello over and over again it's going to keep doing that until i stop it and probably my computer fan will start going pretty quickly because it's going to be using up too much processing power i'm going to stop it by clicking this red button in the console that stops your programs so it's it's now stopped and i don't know if you can hear it but my computer fan is kicking in so it's not good to let these programs run for too long better if you just look for the sort of grayed out run terminate button in the console there and run it and then quickly stop it again i'm not actually sure if this can be stopped if i click in the console no i do control c in a normal con console typically control c might stop that program but here it's doing nothing so i'm just going to click use the terminate button okay so uh try that out for yourself um try creating this little program and before you run it so you don't end up having to forcibly quit eclipse or something uh make sure you can see this gray it's grayed out at the moment terminate button in the console and then when you start seeing hello being output hit that terminate button because you don't want to you don't want this to overheat your computer okay try that out for yourself and verify it works and we'll be looking at some more stuff relevant to this in the next video okay so until next time happy coding
