in this video we're going to take a look at if statements in Python these allow us to conditionally execute code depending on whether something is true or false let's start off this program by getting the name from the user so I'm going to say here name equals input and enter your name now we'll use that in a minute but first we'll tackle something a little bit simpler so I'm going to type if if is a key word in Python it's part of the Python language after if I'm going to leave a space and for the moment let's type here true don't forget you need a capital letter and after that we're going to type a colon immediately after the true now we go to the next line now notice when I go to the next line let's try that again Visual Studio code or at least the python plugin automatically puts my cursor somewhat indented underneath this the if statement we need to indent code to say that the code that we're typing is now part of the if statement its execution will be controlled by the if statement so here I've got actually four spaces and you can see that these are actually four spaces because there are four dots there if you don't see that there is a setting in one of these menus which on my system on my version of Visual Studio code is in the view menu an appearance called render white space if you've got that turned on it will replace spaces with dots so you can see when I go to the next line here Visual Studio code automatically puts four spaces here we need those four spaces to tell python that what I'm about to type should be controlled by the if statement let's write here print true just to print something out now notice this isn't the Boolean value true it's just a string that says true it's just some text enclosed in double quotes I can write anything I want there it doesn't matter I just want to print something to see if it actually runs and then underneath that let's go down a bit further and I'm going to erase those four white spaces with the back key and write print let's say program finished now let's run this and see what happens it says enter your name I'm going to write John cuz that's my name and then it says true and program finished so it is actually doing this print it's doing the print because this is true if I write false here and I run it let's write my name it doesn't print true anymore because the condition is false so you can see that this if statement is conditionally controlling whether this code is executed or not now even to get this to work is a little bit tricky you absolutely need to practice it you need to have the Cod on there remember and you need to have four spaces here in fact if you actually want to put those four spaces in yourself the easiest thing to do in Visual Studio code and probably most editors is just to use the Tab Key and notice that Visual Studio code turns my tab into four spaces this is controlled from the settings in Visual Studio code if I go to the preferences menu which on my version of code is in the code menu and I go to settings I can search for something like space Tab and we can see we've got a setting here insert spaces when pressing Tab and that's turned on so you want that to be turned on there's also this detect indentation setting I've apparently got that turned off but the replacement of tabs with spaces is working so I'm content with my set settings in Python indentation is used to indicate a block of code that may be controlled by some statement for example like an if statement you don't have to use four spaces but whatever you start off using in your program for indentation you have to then consistently use it in the rest of that file otherwise you'll get an error in Python so I could decide that I want to use three spaces or I want to use a tab an actual Tab and that would work but the most common convention is probably to use four spaces and that's why Visual Studio code here is indenting my print statement by four spaces let's go back to the settings again so I'm going to go to code preferences settings might be in a different menu on your version of code and if I search again for tabs space we can see here that tab size is set to four and that's controlling how many spaces a tab is turned into if I use a tab there instead so I would suggest that you want this to be set to four if you're getting a tab replaced by two spaces or something I don't think that's really enough it looks a bit messy I would change this setting to four and whichever editor you're using if it's a programmer's editor it's going to have settings like these so now let's change this program to something a little bit more interesting let's change this Boolean here this condition to name equals equals and I'm going to type John because that is my name you can put what you want there and now let's run the program so it says enter your name and if I type John it's going to Output true let's put something more descriptive in there your name is is John like this okay now we'll try it again enter your name John and it says your name is John and then program finished notice that program finished is not part of this if statement because it's not indented so this will always run but this bit will only run if this condition evaluates to True let's try it again and this time enter some other name and now we don't get this printing because the condition evaluated to false you can put more lines in here if you want they all have to be indented and they have to be indented by the same number of spaces that you previously used in the program let's try print hello and now so if I enter something that isn't my name so the conditions false then that stuff doesn't print but if I enter John it prints and again program finished always prints because it's not indented so it's not part of this code block which is controlled by the if statement try this out for yourself it is a little bit tricky to get right when you first do it you've got to get that IND indentation right there mustn't be any indentation anywhere else in your program because we don't want anything else to be indented in this particular program and you've got to have that colon there remember I like to leave a blank line after my if statements but it doesn't actually make any difference let's type John you can see it works the same as before but that blank line I think helps make it clearer which bit is the actual if statement hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy
