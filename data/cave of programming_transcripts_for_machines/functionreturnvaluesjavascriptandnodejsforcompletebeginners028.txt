hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this video we're going to look at function return values continuing my course on JavaScript and no js' for complete beginners so in the last video we took a lot about function parameters and passing arguments to functions now we're going to look at getting values out of functions with return values let's create a new file here and call it function I don't know I just call it return a s actually for the moment okay so start with you strict supposing we want to create a function that lets us pass a value in and get a value out of it so we've seen that functions are basically collections of statements which we can call or in other words call to X caused to execute whenever we want but we can also pass values to them whether those are strings arrays whatever they are numbers and here we're going to look at getting values out of functions again there's create a function I'm going to call this square so if I just put for the moment console dot log square that does that defines a function and to actually make the function run we have to write Square and we can run it wherever you want here in our program now let's write node return is to actually run the program and it says square so we can pass a value to it if we want let's let's create a function that allows us to pass in a single argument I'm going to call this number and we're going to pass in 7 as the argument this is a parameter remember it's a function parameter and we're going to pass 7 as an as an argument to the function so 7 is going to end up in this parameter and we can output if we want that's right number there this is like a variable basically and if I run this we see it says square seven now we will what happen there let's just close that I don't know what happen so now we can also get values out of functions you might in that we want this function to square this number in other words multiply it by itself we can do that like this so let's get rid of this console dot log and write return so we need we need the return keyword here and then we type what we're going to return so actually let's calculate that first let's write let Square equal number times number so just squaring the number multiplying it by itself in other words and then to actually return a value we rights right the value that we want to return this could be a string or a number or anything and how do we actually get that well when we call the function it effectively it kind of returns a variable so we write let let's call it value value equal square seven and then our output here value and if we run that it says 49 which is 7 times 7 we could write this more succinctly because we don't we don't really need to have two statements here we could just say return number times number we could put here we turn number times number and that would do the trick but I've just written out a bit more and a bit more of a complicated way here just to kind of highlight the fact that we could we could have all sorts of calculations or all kinds of processing here we could be doing all kinds of things who knows opening files reading them who knows but at some point in the function well at the end in this case we return some results of all our processing or calculations and we can get it like this so it's as if this this function is sort of you know to go back to my sort of shoot analogy from them from the last video sort of throwing seven down a chute here and it's emerging here and it's getting put into this variable and here were kind of don't really know how this fits with my analogy but were we're kind of returning or spitting out this value square and when we actually call the function when we actually execute it we can say let value equals square or let whatever we want equals Square and then we get the actual value that we've returned so this can look confusing because it looks as though we're getting a variable and we're setting it equal to a function and that's not what is happening what is happening here is that we are declaring a variable and setting equal to the return value of a function which happens to be in this case a number so as always the thing to do is type this out practice it a bit yourself let's take another example here or maybe get rid of this blank line let's go down and create another function so supposing we want to create a function that returns a greeting let's write function I'll call it greet do we want to pass it any arguments well we could pass in for example a name so let's just write name there and and again this is just like value and like yeah like value and like number this is just a variable name that I've made up could be anything within reason and let's create a string here let's say let greeting we don't want to we wouldn't want to say here let greet equal we don't want to get confused by using the function name for a variable give it a different name let's say let greeting equal and we'll have a string hello and let's add on to that name this is an idea that we'll see in a second but we'll leave it for that for a minute and then what should what should we return from the function let's return this greeting so I'm going to say here return greeting let's call this function so I need to say if I just write greet and then pass it a name like Neptune perfectly reasonable name and run this it doesn't do anything apart from what I've already told it to do above but I can now get the return value of the function so this function it's not outputting anything directly it's is only returning something so when we talk about returning a value in programming we mean a very specific thing we don't mean that were for example printing the value like displaying it on the console we mean we've got this return keyword and we're actually returning a value from a function so to access that value I need a variable well we could actually just write conte well I don't mean to do that let's do control said undo undo there we go right we could actually do this console dot log and this would this would actually use console dot log to output the return value of this function let's try it so it says hello Neptune you can see that this is not ideal because Hello is run together with Neptune what we need to do is is have a space after hello so I can put that inside the quotes like that and then it looks a lot better so now we've got hello Neptune but perhaps more often we would be storing the return value of a function in a variable and then using it further in our program so that's right let I'll call this greeting again let greeting equals greet and we passed the argument Neptune and that's right console dot log greeting and I run that and it outputs hello Neptune now in this case the variable name happens to have the same name is what we were what we were as the variable we were returning but this is an entirely different variable to this one here this variable because it's declared inside these curly brackets is we can only access it actually within the curly brackets this is an entirely different variable so I couldn't write lots of let greeting here let's set that equal to something let's see what that does that gives us an error it tells me that identifier greeting has already been declared but here we say that the scope of this variable is restricted to this code block it's not visible outside this code block that's why I'm able to declare another variable with the name greeting here outside the code block where this one is no longer visible and there's no reason why this has to have the same name as this there's no connection between them other than that this is being used to get a return value of this function so I could call it something else let's write message and we'll run this and if any of this seems unclear to you it will become clearer with practice you do just need to practice this it's like learning a musical instrument watching videos is not enough you've got to actually do it yourself the video is only a source of information to guide your practice so it says hello Neptune okay we'll leave it there for this video I think maybe one last thing by the way if you've got a function that returns a value you don't have to pass it any arguments you could happily have a function that accepts no arguments and returns a value those are two separate things all together if you wanted to really quickly square a number you don't actually need a function to do it so you could just write let's write console dot log and math dot Pao short for power 7 ^ in other words 7 squared and that would give us 49 again let's maybe pick a different number like 8 there should be 64 there we go so if you look at this this is actually calling a function and passing it to arguments in this case the function is part of what we call the math class we haven't looked at classes yet we'll be looking at them later on but by looking at functions we've taken a step big step towards actually understanding what's going on here ok so do try this out for yourself don't forget you can find my git
