hello in this video we're going to talk a little bit about the main method and we're going to add some more statements to our main method so far we've got this program here all it does is when you run it and output some text hello world in this case let's recreate that program and it's it's a really good idea to try yourself creating basic Java HelloWorld programs from scratch because you want to sort of drill that into your mind and memorize it so we go to file new Java project and give it a name let's call this main method so I'm going to check that I'm using Java 11 in this case click Next I don't need a module salt on tick this and we'll click finish then without even expanding that the project I can just rightclick it and go to new class let's call the class app we can call it more or less anything as long as it's got a first case an upper case first letter and no spaces or punctuation or anything like that the package I'm going to call it application this has to have a lower case first letter and I'm going to tick to say that I want a public static void main and I'm going to click finish then finally I can add some code to my main method so between these two inner brackets here I'm going to delete the comment I'm going to type this out and I'm going to type well hello world again let's say so notice I'm indenting and the code within brackets so this code is indented within these brackets using a tab in this case and this this code here is indented within these brackets we're going to talk more about that in the next video let's just run it and check it works it's a good idea always to try running your java projects early on to make sure there's not some miss configuration or anything and there we go it says hello world just like the other program so let's have a look at this so I want to focus in this video on this the main method so a method in well in what we're doing here is objectoriented programming so Java is an objectoriented language and it's hard to understand what that is until you know what an object is so we'll leave that for a moment and tackle it later but in objectoriented programming languages subroutines are known as methods this is an example of a method it's a method called main and what a method is it's it's a block of code so it's a collection of statements like this one this is a statement in ends in a semicolon and in this case the main method is very special because it's where our Java program starts executing starts running in other words so when you run a Java program what gets run is the content of the main method now we can put more statements in here have a go this yourself maybe there pause the video or after the video let's add a new line and Eclipse helpfully puts the cursor in an appropriate place usually we want to make sure that the statements that we write here are lined up with this system dot out dot print line statement let's add another one so sysout controlspace this is another line of text don't forget those speech marks there so if you type one Eclipse puts in the other automatically usually and don't forget a semicolon either because it won't work without this semicolon at the end let's run that and we should get two lines of text like this here we are we can put more in let's put one more in that's right sisal and final line of text you can type what you want within reason really and we'll run that again so let's run it there we go and it looks like this try that out it might not seem like much but we're building up gradually and it's gonna get hard enough later on so you want to really get these basics down notice I've left a blank line there I don't have to we'll talk about that more in the next video but space within a Java program is not important we could also write it like this and that would that would work just as well let's run this so the important sort of takeaway message for this video is when your Java program runs and the the Java runtime environment will search for a main method a method called main and that's what this is in other words a subroutine which has the sort of correct syntax and is called main and then it's gonna run the statements within main and it's going to run them in the order that you see them and this this can get a lot more complicated as we'll see later on but for a simple program like this we're just going to step down the statements here they're going to get run one after the other so first that then that and so on in the sort of initial part of this course we'll stick with just writing code here and later on we'll see what else you can do with methods and classes and objects and all that sort of thing so try that for yourself try putting space in or no space have a go at it put some more lines in your main method and run it okay so that's it for this video in and until next time happy coding
