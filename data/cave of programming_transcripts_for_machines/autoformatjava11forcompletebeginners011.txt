hello in this video we're going to take a look at Auto format which is really important and very very useful so hopefully by now you've created a program yourself with three lines in it or more however many like and we'll use that to talk about formatting so we've seen that if you have curly brackets like this an opening and closing curly bracket that's known as a code block so we have a code block here and there's another code block here now when we put one code block inside another so this code block is inside this code block and here we have statements within a code block and when you put when you put code inside a code block or you put yeah one code block inside another it's really important to indent it so you see that all the code within these curly brackets is indented by one tab and all the code within these curly brackets is indented by another tab and that's that although that's cosmetic so the program works without it let's try this it's nevertheless extremely important to get this right because if you don't have correct formatting in your code it will be very very difficult to read it will look a mess so always strive to to format your code nicely and pay particular attention to indentation make sure that you indent one block of code within another like this you might have seen a American TV series called Silicon Valley and in that the protagonist is a computer programmer and at one point he has a girlfriend who's also a computer programmer and they they have an argument and they end up sort of splitting up because they can't agree about whether it's better to use spaces or tabs to indentation so twin indent some code within a code block let's take this as an example you could use four spaces typically or before one two three four and you can also use a tab like this I just press the tab key there there are pros and cons to both of these so it can get annoying to have to keep typing spaces and even hearing people typing spaces you know that can get quite annoying by itself but spaces tend to have a consistent appearance across different editors this is probably less important now than it used to be in the past blur I think it's still true that spaces give you better consistency when you write code in one editor and load it into another on the other hand they're annoying to type and that's why I greatly prefer tabs because just one tab can indent your code so this will be indented two tabs because it's within two code blocks it's within that and within that so I recommend using taps to indent your code but if you're working with a team of programmers and they were all using spaces you should use spaces instead because the worst thing you can do is mix tabs and spaces and that tends to mean that when you load code written in one editor into another editor it will it will lose its formatting and it will get out of line so pick one of these four four spaces or a tab to do the end into indentation and stick to it many editors these days will allow you to change spaces into tabs if you want so I'm sure you can conflict configure that in Eclipse you can make it change a tab into a space and also into four spaces sorry and also Eclipse helps you so if you type a line so if I'm at the end of this line here and I hit return it puts the cursor in the right place so that we don't have worry too much about indenting so that's very helpful now here's the most important sort of takeaway message for this video you can automatically format your code so let's put maybe a bracket in the wrong place here and put excessive spaces in and maybe indent this too much if I write if I select Java rightclick it and go to source and irori source and format it automatically formats my code for me it will take out duplicated blank lines and it will line up brackets and stuff like that and that's incredibly helpful not only because it makes the code a lot easier to read but also because if you made a mistake there so if you've maybe missed off a bracket and you try to format it then it will it won't format or the formatting will go a bit strange and that's that's really helpful for spotting where you've gone wrong let's pull out bracket in again also you can see an arrow down there there's a red arrow marker that appears if you've done something wrong this says insert and brackets a complete class body in this particular case let's pull that back in now you can also format using a keyboard shortcut I strongly recommend that you memorize this shortcut and you use it constantly some people think that beginners are better off using a text editor that doesn't have Auto formatting and the reasoning is that that forces people to really learn to do the formatting themselves but in my experience if beginners use auto format a lot they gradually become used to the formatting I think that's the quickest way to learn it so I'm going to be suggesting that you auto format your code constantly do it all the time and the way that we do it as we've seen we could right click and go to source format but it's quicker to use a keyboard shortcut and on the Mac that's command shift F and on the windows on Windows it's ctrl shift F so here I'm using a Mac so I'm gonna with one hand my left hand I'm gonna hold down command and shift and with my right hand I'm gonna just press F and that's formatted my code for me let's try that again so control shift F or command shift F on the Mac great so it's important to do that all the time do it constantly try to write code in the first place that's formatted nicely but also use auto format constantly to check that your formatting is OK and eventually this will become second nature to you because you'll be doing it all the time and that really really helps to make code that's easy to read and it really really helps to keep basic errors out of your code ok so until next time happy coding
