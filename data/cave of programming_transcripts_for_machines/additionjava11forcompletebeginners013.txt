hello in this video we're going to take a further look at variables and we're going to look at adding numbers together if you feel confused at this stage that's absolutely normal you probably should feel confused but things are going to get clearer as you go through the course as long as you practice what we're doing it's very important that you try try this out for yourself incidentally you might wonder what kinds of variables there are in Java and we're going to be looking at looking at that in the course but for now I just want to direct your attention to a page if you type into a search engine Java primitive primitive types and maybe click on one of these links let's go to the sort of official Oracle documentation primitive data types in Java and you can see here don't you don't have to read this or anything but you can see that there's there are various types listed and int is one of them you can also see that it has a maximum value that we can put in it that's 2 to the power of 31 minus 1 there's a reason why such a strange kind of value but we needn't go into that and the minimum value you can put in is minus 2 to the power of 31 okay don't worry about that though let's have a look Len so what can we do with this well one thing we can do is edition and in fact the way I've written this here is unnecessarily verbose we can do this more briefly more quickly so I've declared a variable here I've declared a variable called caps and here I've assigned the value 7 to the variable cats we can do that in one single step before we do that let's create a duplicate of our project and if you're working on code and you've got something that works and then you don't want to disturb that or it's possible that you might mess it up with how you're about to change it it's a really good idea to take a copy of it either that or you could use a version control system like git for example but we're just going to make a copy so I'm going to right click my project and go to copy I'm just going to click in a blank space in Eclipse in the package Explorer rightclick and go to paste and we can give this a new name now let's call it edition and click copy so now we've got a new project and I would recommend creating projects from scratch until you're you feel completely familiar with that rather than just copying projects but anyway so let's run that so I'm going to select my app click run and it runs just as before but now let's delete this int cats and so now we've got an error why have we got an error it's because let's hover over the error it says cats cannot be resolved to a variable that's because I'm trying to output the value contained in this cat's variable but I haven't declared the cat's variable and I haven't assign the value to it what we're gonna do now is declare it and assign a value in a single step now this has to be above where you're using the variable so wherever you use a variable that both that somewhere in your code you have to declare it so let's write int cats equals 7 so I'm declaring it and I'm assigning a value to it in one single step remember your program is going to execute line by line so it's going to go down your code your code block here and that's why we first got to declare a variable before we can use it it has to be above because this is going to get read by the Java Runtime environment before this is read and executed okay so that that will do the same as a program we had before we can run it and it just outputs seven now let's say we've also got dogs so let's write int dogs equals let's say we've got five dogs and by some miracle we can stop the dogs eating the cats again we've got a warning because we'd not use the value of dogs yet what I'm going to do is add these together and to do that I need a third variable I'm going to type int total equals cats plus dogs and then using my system dot out dot print line I'm going to output the value of total should be 12 so let's let's run this and down here we have 12 what have we done here so we declare a variable called cats and assign the value 7 to it we declare a variable called dogs assign the value 5 to it and then we declare a variable called total and the value that we assign to total is the number of cats plus the number of dogs and then we output it try that for yourself if you it is easy to make mistakes here so for example you can't have two variables called cats in in your code block here if we try that we get an error if we hover over the error it says duplicate local variable cats let's delete the second one in fact ik in Eclipse if I just put my cursor on a line and then in the Mac if I do command D or in Windows I think it would be ctrl D that deletes the line so it's quite a handy shortcut ctrl D or command D to delete a line if I'm giving them any of the wrong sort cuts for windows you can always type into a search engine something like eclipse shortcuts Eclipse shortcutkeys something like that and you'll find a whole list quite easily okay so try replicating this program try changing these numbers to different numbers and see if it still works you can also try giving them different names so they don't have to be cats dogs in total you might run into problems you can't have spaces in variable names you can't have punctuation in there you should always start them with a lowercase first letter that is very important without that your program will work so I could write total here with a capital T and it would still run probably well it will do if I I have to change both of them of course well that's not obvious let me explain that let's run this so that works with a capital T on total for example or I could put a capital C cats or a capital D on dogs but it's very bad practice the standard in Java is that variables start with a lowercase first letter so if you're using the conventional coding style in Java which we are you should always start your variables with a lowercase first letter don't do anything crazy with them for a moment just keep them all lowercase and notice that Java is casesensitive so a variable called dogs with a capital D is different to a variable called dogs with a lowercase D see that's only a warning whereas if I had lowercase D I get an error seems to be some streetcleaning taking place outside apologies for the noise okay anyway so let's get rid of that what we what we want to aim for at the moment is creating legal reasonable code written in the standard style so create something that looks like this and try it out and try to eking it change the numbers change the variable names see if you can get it to work and don't don't forget that if you change cats here you have to change the name of it here as well the same for all of these variables you have to be consistent okay have a go at that and until next time happy coding
