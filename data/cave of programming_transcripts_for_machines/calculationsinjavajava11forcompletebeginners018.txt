hello in this video we're going to take a look at doing calculations so let's say I've got some people and their average height is one point let's say six seven meters so double height equals one point six seven now let's say I want to know I've got seven of these people and they're they're performing acrobats and they're going to all stand on each of those shoulders and I want to know how high seven of them will be standing on each other's shoulders so I could just write this out height times seven or if I if I like I could write seven point naught here it makes no difference and if I run that I find that the answer is seven of them on top of each other are going to be eleven point six nine meters high now what I could also do is I could write double let's say result equals height times seven and then I could output the result let's run this and we should get the same well the same result okay now there is one thing that beginners often tend to do which is a bad idea which is that beginners are liable to give variable names really short letters like are occasionally that's appropriate typically when you're using mathematical equations and a convention is that you would use for example an X or a Y then it makes sense to just use one letter but most of the time don't give variables one letter names because it gets very confusing another thing is in general don't give variables vague names so here I've written result what does that mean it really tells me nothing about what I'm actually doing here so it will be better to give it a more specific name give it the most meaningful name that you can you can also even use multiple words in your variables so I could create a variable called total Haight and what I do is by convention in the convention that Java usually uses the first word in your variable has a lowercase first letter so the variable starts with a lowercase first letter but any word after that has an uppercase first letter so total height will be written like this that makes it easy to read and it's also meaningful so it if okay if you don't know exactly what you're calculating and just kind of making something up to see how it goes then it might make sense to write result here but if you possibly can give your variable and meaningful name it's better to make it excessively long than to make it excessively cryptic by making it too short and too meaningless it makes your programs a lot easier to read okay so we're we're here creating the total height of seven people stood on top of each other now supposing they also have a flagpole the height of the flagpole are defining another variable so like this double flagpole height let's call it equals let's say the flagpole is two meters high I'll write to point naught and in fact this height here well that's not very meaningful because now I've got multiple Heights in my program I want to change it so that we have this site and this site wherever I've used height I want it to say person height rather than do that by hand since I've got multiple versions of it I'm going to right click and I'm going to go to source and I'll go to no sorry I'm going to go to refactor so right click it go to refactor rename and type a new name so I'm going to type here person height and it corrects all of all of my variables that are called height it it corrects the specific variable that I want to change okay so we've got the height of a person we've got a flagpole height we're calculating the total height of seven people on top of each other and I also want to add the height of the flagpole on toques I want to know how high the whole thing is seven people on top of each other and the top on is waving a flag pole holding it presumably by the very end of it using his or her fingertips let's run this I've got to save it first and so this this is what we originally have at eleven point six nine so if I add the flagpole height we should get thirteen point six nine let's add that in plus flagpole and to save me typing out the variable I can hold down control and press space and then it brings up a list of suggestions and I can hit return to select the first one okay let's let's run this and now we get thirteen point six nine one last thing I want to bring to your attention is that this looks ambiguous this expression because does it mean person height times seven and then add the flagpole height or does it mean person height times 7 plus the flagpole height so you could add 7 to the float pole height and then multiply the person height by that or you could add 7 to person height and then add the flagpole height there are things there are rules called operator precedence rules which we're going to talk about a bit but for now when you have an expression like this and this is really good practice anyway put round brackets in to make it less ambiguous so if I put round brackets around this part that makes it clear that I'm adding multiplying the person height by 7 and after that I'm adding the float pole height hopefully you understand what I mean because the other the other thing that we could have done instead is I could add 7 to the flagpole height and multiply the person height by that but that gives us something else it's not what we want in this here we get 15 point zero three but what I want is to add the person hi what sorry multiply it by seven and then add the flagpole height let's run this okay soon I'm going to give you an exercise with this but there was a lot in that video so what I would recommend is that type this out yourself and run it and get it working and then make up your own little program think of something you could calculate no matter how silly we're not standing on pride here it's good to experiment with silly ideas think of something you could calculate and try to calculate it and let's put a comment on here in here with two slashes and I'm gonna write calculate height of seven people plus a flagpole there we go okay try it out for yourself and then try to make up a little program that does a calculation and see how you get on and until next time happy coding
