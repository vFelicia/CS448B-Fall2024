in this video we're going to look at Boolean operators in Python specifically we're going to look at the keywords and not and or and these are keywords that can be used with things that evaluate to a Boolean value so true or false and the simplest things that evaluate to true or false are just Boolean variables so let's look at those with these I'm going to create two here let's have is reigning and we'll set that equal to true and we'll have is windy equals false now supposing you want to stay inside if it's raining and it's also windy you can combine those two Boolean values with and so let's write stay inside equals is raining and is windy and we'll print that out so print stay inside and we can cast that to a string from Boolean so stay inside and take a look at it what do you think this is going to be let's have a look so I'm going to run this and it says stay inside fults so and we'll return a boot value which will only be true if this is true and also this is true otherwise it's false so if we change is windy to True stay inside becomes true if either one of these is false or if they're both fals for that matter then the and operator will return false it's pretty intuitive I think now supposing you want to take a coat if it's raining or if it's windy so if either one of those are true you want to take a coat now we can combine these using the or operator so let's say take coat equals is raining or is windy typical weather for Britain and let's print this out so I'll actually just copy this and we'll change this to take a coat and I'll put take coat in there let just copy that let's take a look so take a coat is false because they're both false but if either one of these is true take a coat will now be true the and it's also true if they're both true so the or Boolean operator evaluates to true if either one of the conditions that it applies to are true now let's take a look at not so what not does is it just flips a Boolean value to its opposite so it flips true to false and it flips false to True we'll take a look let's write here not windy not windy and then here so the expression that I'm going to pass to strau will be not is windy so it goes in front of the thing that you want it to apply to and we run this and it says false because it's flipped this True Value to false if this is false then it will flip it to true so not windy is true because windy is windy is false and you can combine these in all kinds of complicated ways it's best not to go too over the top with it so let's say that we want to take an umbrella only if it's raining and it's not windy we could combine them like this take umbrella equals is raining and not is windy and then if we print this out take umbrella and plra take umbrella let's take a look so it says true why because it is raining and it's not windy so if it is windy we don't take an umbrella because it might blow away definitely get damaged with a cheap one anyway and so that's false if it's windy let's say it's not windy and it's also not raining then we don't want an umbrella we only want an umbrella if it's raining and it's not windy and there we go true so I think all of this is fairly intuitive you can create really long Expressions you know like is this and not that or not this and this and so on and you want to try to avoid doing that you can always break down Boolean Expressions into a simplest series of expressions using Boolean variables if you do have to create a long expression and it's a bit hard to read you can put brackets in like we can with arithmetical Expressions so here for example we could put brackets around there but it's such a simple expression for this one I wouldn't bother but you can do then it says through in the next video I'll give you an exercise with Boolean variables hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but o some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
