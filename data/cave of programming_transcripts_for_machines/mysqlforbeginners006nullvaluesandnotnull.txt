hello this is John from Cave of programming. comom in this tutorial we're going to take a look at null in my SQL that's Nu LL null so null is a special value that means that a field in your table doesn't have any value if we look at the table we've got now the users table if we do a desk on it desk users we see it has two columns and we see in the results grid here that they are they are both allowed to be null that's cuz we created them in the default way which would allow them normally to be null so we can do the following for example we can say and let's actually just bring up a uh a query that I already run here um so let's let's insert a row into the table I'll give it an idea of two but for the username I'll specify null and that means that for the username there's not going to be any value for this row so I'm going to insert that and yeah yes it went okay we can see down here and I'll do a select and run that so now we can see we've got a row with the IDE of two but I set the username to null it has no value we can do the same thing with the other column as well because that's also allowed to be null and we could even if we wanted make them both null like this and now if we do a select star from users we see we've got a row with two null values in it now often you don't don't want that often what you want is to specify that a particular value in a particular uh field it can't be null so you want to say that all the values in a certain column can't be null so we'll look at how to do this but first let's just take um let's try something a little bit different so I'm going to I'm going to do another insert into this table let's try this and this time in my Fields list here the list of columns I'm only going to specify one one column so I'm going to delete username just as a random choice and I'm going to specify the value three for that column so we can easily see which which column it is so here I'm doing an insert where we're only inserting a value for one particular column and if I run this and then I do a select star from users what we see is that we've inserted a row with the ID equal to three but again we've got null for the username uh so you don't have to specify all the columns when you do an insert if you've got columns that are allowed to be null which they are if you create them in a default way you don't have to specify those columns when you do an insert and then the value will be null it will have no value for the row that you inserted sometimes we want to as I say we want to say that um values in the common can't be null this is really common uh it's probably the the most frequent case because um often we don't want data with sort of missing values in our database let's drop this table let's say drop table users so that's going to delete the table and the table should be gone we can check with show tables if we like and we see there's no tables in this database and let's recreate it so I'm going to say uh create table users let's say ID um we'll just use the same as before ID is going to be a int and let's make a username field which is going to be text a username column I should say so if we create a table like this both of the columns are allowed to be null but we can put not null after any column to say that it can't be null so you can do that on any of the columns that you want to not be null all Let's uh let's try it with let's try it with both of them I think we'll make both of the columns not null and then if we do a desk users we see that now they're not allowed to be null so now if I try doing stuff like let's bring up an insert here um so I let's try well we'll try this let's just run this this is going to give an error we can't insert null values for either of the either of these columns now even if I specify an ID because I said also username not null when I created the table this went wrong because even the username by itself can't be null so again we get an error down here now it's interesting to see what happens if you insert um a if you try to insert a row in a table with fields that are not allowed to be null but then you don't mention those names in your insert so let's try it um I will try getting rid of username here and I'll try to insert a row with the IDE of nine now if I run this on this particular version of my SQL uh configured the way it is what I find is that I get a warning icon down here and if I do now a so it's not an error that SQL has run it's just giving me a warning if I do select star from users we see that what's happened is we did insert the row the username appears to be blank so the username is is not null it does have a value but this value is actually a blank string uh that's the default value for a text type I'm calling it a string because this is kind of a technical lingo for some characters you know a piece of text we call it a string so the default value for a text type is is a is a blank string a string of zero length which is not the same as null if you try this on your database you might find that you get different results and we're going to talk about that a bit in the next tutorial let's just try this again so this time what I'll do is I will try missing out the ID in the field list and just specify username which I'll set to um someone I don't know can't think of a name let's let's just run this so now again we've got a warning icon down there at the bottom in the output um Pane and if we try doing a select now we see that we've inserted a value we've inserted a row where the username is someone as I specified and again ID has a default value for its type and since ID is an INT it the default value for an in is zero now this this Behavior you might get different Behavior with your version of MySQL or it might be just that you if someone else installed it especially or if if the MySQL developers decide to change the default options you might find that you can't do this that it won't let you uh not specify a value in an insert when the when the value is we've said it's not null when we create a table and we're going to look in the next tutorial at some configuration options that affect this so uh to practice this um certainly give this a go try creating a table with two or more columns and make some or even all of them not null and then try doing inserts in there try inserting explicitly inserting null values as I did near the beginning of the tutorial and try also just missing those fields out of your field list in your insert statement um miss miss them out so try to insert a row where you're only speing specifying values for certain columns and see what results you get with not null Fields does my SQL insert a default uh value for a field that you haven't specify a value for or does it do something else does it throw an error do have a go at that and then in the next tutorial we'll look at some config options so until next time happy coding
