in this video we're going to look at multiple function parameters in python as an example I'm going to create a function that calculates the volume of a box I'm not actually sure what the mathematical term is for a box shape but if I say a box I think you'll know what kind of shape I'm talking about so the formula for calculating the volume of a box is like this you just multiply the width by the height and the length and that gives you the volume so if these are in centim for example you're going to get a volume in cubic cenm if they are in inches the volumes in cubic inches and so on so can we create a function which we can pass withth height and length two of a box and it will tell us the volume of the Box let's create a main function and I'll put pass there for the moment and we'll try to create our function so let's call it calculate box volume and we'll have a pass there just for the moment and a def keyword so this is going to need three parameters it's going to need a width a height and a length and we can have functions that accept multiple arguments so we can have multiple function parameters let's create them here width comma I usually put a space in as well although it's not strictly necessary width height comma and length so these are called positional parameters because they get matched to arguments via their position I'll show you what I mean so we could already call that function although it doesn't do anything yet I can say calculate box volume and we could pass in let's say five for the width two for the height and 10 for the length so these get matched up to the positional parameters via their position so the five is going to go into this width variable the two is going to go into the height variable the 10 is going to go into the length variable now we can do the calculation with these and we could print the result of that calculation or we could also return it let's return it so here I'll say return width time height time length where is this calculated value going to end up well here we need a variable to store it so let's say volume equals the return value of calculate box volume and then we can print it let's say box volume is colon and now I could do this I could cast that volume to a string and then display it there actually let's run this because it should work first I'm going to have to remember to call Main somewhere otherwise it's not going to do anything okay now let's try this and it says box volume is 100 but actually the print function can also accept multiple positional parameters so another way of doing this which is a better way is to put a comma here and then volume and then we don't actually need the space either because print will put a space in automatically let's run it and you can see it looks the same so this is the way I would normally use print to display multiple values the only reason I was using concatenation before is because I think that will help you to get to grips with different types in Python but by now you probably basically got to grips with that so I'm going to start using multiple parameters with print you just have to separate them with commas and notice that when you call the function the parameters are separated with commas and when you list multiple parameters in a function header they are also separated with commas also you have to remember that when you supply multiple arguments to the print function it automatically prints them with spaces in between as you can see here so try this out for yourself type this out get it working and I am going to give you an exercise with this and you might want to first practice with some exercises you make up yourself for example you could easily now write a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa or does some other conversion you know how to pass data to functions and you know how to return data from functions one thing you might wonder is what happens if you supply the wrong number of arguments calculate box volume here has three parameters so we have to pass in three arguments what happens if we only pass in two let's try it in fact we get an error and you can see it says it's missing one required positional argument length so we have to put in the right number of arguments python does actually check that they match and that raises the question of how does print know how many arguments to accept and that's something that we're going to look at later on but for now all you need to know is you have to supply the right number of arguments to match up with the number of parameters and they have to be of course in the right order because they get matched up via that order in this case hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
