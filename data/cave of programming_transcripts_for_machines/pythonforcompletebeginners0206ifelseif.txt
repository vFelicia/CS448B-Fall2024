in this video we're going to take a look at a more complicated and general version of if else we're going to look at if else if you could call it so again as with many of the constructs that we're going to be studying in fact almost all of them or certainly many of them there are equivalents to what we're about to see in other programming languages so yes at the moment you're learning the syntax of python but you are also learning General programming principles which you could apply in other languages if you wanted to learn other languages as well although plenty of people know one programming language and you might easily work for your entire life on writing software in one programming language if that is what you want to do okay so at the top here let's create some more constants actually I'm going to rename this let's have this changed to worker one we can imagine we've got some workers in some kind of facility let's say it's a factory or a research laboratory or something we'll have another worker here and let's call this second worker Rachel and we'll have someone else this can be the supervisor let's let's write professor and uh he can be called Falcon okay so we're going to start off by checking to see if the name entered is John so that's worker one now if the name entered isn't John we want to check well is it Rachel or is it Falcon so what I'm going to do is put another clause in here above the else so we need to delete that indent go right flush to the left hand margin and I'm going to Type L if and we're going to have another condition name equals equals worker 2 and then we'll have a customized greeting let's suppose Rachel prefers to be addressed in Italian we'll say Chia Rachel and here let's just say hello John and maybe I'll get rid of the second line so what is this El if this is short for Els if so we're saying if name is worker one you know whatever that is happens to be John we're going to print hello John else so if that's not true else if the name is worker 2 which is Rachel we're going to print CH Rachel else we're going to print something down here let's print name not recognized we want one more Clause here so I'm going to go to the next line again above else delete the indent with backspace and we'll have LF name equals equals Professor colon then print greetings Professor Falcon so let's see what this program does I'm going to run it so it says enter your name if I enter John it's going to say hello John run it again if I enter Rachel it's going to say chiao Rachel if I enter Falcon it's going to say Greetings greetings Professor Falcon let's put an S in there if I enter something else it's going to say name not recognized let's get rid of this program finished as well CU I just put that in to show you that you can have things after the if Els that are not part of the if Els so this is a mechanism for for selectively executing one of multiple possible code blocks depending on a condition it's important to realize that only one of these code blocks will ever be executed either this one or this one or this one or that one now the python interpreter will read this from the top to the bottom the python interpreter Python program always read your code from the top to the bottom so it's going to check through these different Clauses and it's going to say is this true if it is it's going to print hello John and in that case it's then finished and it will go on to whatever code is found after the if statement if there is any if this is not true it will check the second condition here if that's true it will print char Rachel and then it will go on to any code that's after the if statement here if this isn't true it will check the next condition down if that's true it prints this and then goes on to whatever is after the if block if this isn't true then it's going to execute this else Clause so you're always going to have one of these different code blocks executing it's just a question of which one now in each case you can have multiple lines in each code block I've only got one line in each one but each one can consist of multiple lines as long as all the lines are correctly indented and all the bits of this are optional apart from the first if so you could have an if by itself you could have an if L if or you could have all this bit by itself without the Els you could also just have if else as we've already seen so try this out for yourself type this out get it working and experiment with it try adding more lines into one or all of the code blocks you could add another worker in here and have another condition you could try it without the Els experiment with it a little bit we're going to be using this later on now as I say all programming languages pretty much have some equivalent to this they don't all have the same keywords like often you have to write out else if and since I do use several different programming languages you don't have to but I I happen to do so I do get confused a little bit sometimes but generally I find that once you settle into programming with a particular language then confusion tends not to arise it's really not a big problem and in fact when you you learn these constructs in one programming language it is much easier to learn another programming language if if you want to do that for some reason don't forget you've got to have these colons in the right place and you've got to get the indentation exactly right as well for this to work hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
