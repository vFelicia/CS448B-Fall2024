hello in this video we are actually going to run a program okay so we've so far we've created what we call a class and the class is a text file with the extension dot it's uh in a particular location in our project you should have something that looks kind of like this hello there is the package and in the package is a class called in this case app.java i'm going to add some code in this class here and then we're going to be able to run it so here it says to do autogenerated method stub so it's telling me that this is automatically generated and i can replace this thing here with some code this is actually a comment it starts with two slashes if you don't have that don't worry the the really important thing is that you need to write some code and you need to write it in the correct place between these two brackets we'll talk a little bit about the structure of this class i think in the next video um but for now notice it says at the top it's got package and your package name then we've got public class and the name of the class which is app we've got two curly brackets now within those two curly brackets we've got this public static void main string array args we'll be talking about this i know it's all horribly complicated looking at the moment and within those two brackets here that's where we need to write our own code i'm going to get rid of this comment it's not doing anything so i'll just delete it and in there i'm going to write sis out i'm going to hold down on a mac command key and probably on windows a control key and i'm going to press the space bar actually what am i saying on a mac it's also control hold down the ctrl key and press the spacebar and what should happen is it auto completes to this it says system.out.println and there's a couple of round brackets and a semicolon if for some reason autocomplete is not working in your eclipse you can maybe google autocomplete eclipse try and find out why it's not working hopefully it should work you should be control and spacebar i think uh pretty much on any operating system so what that what i did it was it it simply takes a shortcut a shortcut phrase sis out sys sysout and it changes it into a bit of actual legitimate java code so it's just that's just a way of avoiding typing this out because we'll probably have to type this a lot and it's just quicker to type cis out but if you can be bothered if you have the patience you can just type system.out.println two round brackets and then a semicolon now i'm going to click inside these two round brackets and put in two speech marks and in fact if i type one speech mark eclipse automatically puts in the other one for me now inside those two speech marks i'm going to type hello world and this is just text and i can put what i like but you have to be aware that there are some special characters some kinds of punctuation uh for example like the backslash character which if you type that in here it won't work you just need some ordinary text in there and if you want you can have a full stop or period as you call it in america and uh you know or an exclamation mark or whatever okay that'll do the trick now i want to make sure that that is saved so i'm going to go up to the top left here and click this save all button then it sort of goes grey okay so i've got my my program and it's saved there are several different ways you can run it one way is make sure the file is selected app.java and click this green run button another way is to right click app.java and go to run as hopefully you can see that java application just scroll down a bit here so run as java application and i get that menu by right clicking it but what i'm going to do is just select app.java and click the green run button in the top left here and if you do that you should see some output at the bottom and it should say hello world or whatever you've typed in those speech marks um if you don't see this console tab you should you should see it when you run your program and if you don't in window and show view you can click to make sure the console is actually showing so that catches some people out but if you just installed eclipse the console should be visible so you see there's a bunch of tabs here one of them is console and that's where your program output appears okay so if you try that you should find that you can run the program by clicking that run button and it should say hello world if you if anything goes wrong um go over the video carefully make sure you've done every step correctly if you get any error messages type them into google or an internet search engine and um just search for the error message and see what comes up see what people suggest about how to fix the problem hopefully this will go smoothly and when you've done that you've run your first java program and i know you're you're going to be totally confused and in the next video i think we'll talk a little bit about this program and what what it is and how it works okay so if you can actually get it to run that's a major step forward it's really really fantastic and it is normal at this stage to feel very confused expect to feel confused that's normal okay until next time happy coding
