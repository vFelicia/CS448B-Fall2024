hello in this video we're going to talk a little bit about what Java actually is so Java is a powerful generalpurpose programming language it's very widely used it's been around quite a long time now and it will be around for a long time into the future so it's a really great language to learn as your first programming language or as your only programming language because people certainly do make careers entitled entirely out of Java and whatever kind of program you want to write there's a good chance that you can write it in Java just for fun I googled something like programs written in Java and I found this reddit page what are some of the biggest and wellknown well no wellknown Java applications used in this in the world and you can see just from me scrolling through this that there are an awful lot of things written in Java and it covers an awful lot of different areas so what is a programming language in general well basically programming languages can be divided into two types interpreted and compiled in both cases you write text files in your programming language so Java is a language in a way in the same sort of way that English or Greek or Italian are languages that is you can write down Java you can write down text in the Java programming language in any kind of text editor you know it's just some text then together to run on your computer you need some other step has to happen in order to actually run that text as a computer program so with interpreted programming languages what happens is your text gets fed to a thing called an interpreter which is just a computer program and that actually does whatever the text tells it to do now Java is not interpreted it's a compiled programming language that means that we take our text and we use some software to turn it into a or binary computer program which can then run and actually do things on your computer so quite often in this course I might mention compiling or building compiling means taking your java text and turning it into binary files which are actual computer programs that your computer can understand building means taking all the different binary files that you've created and building them or combining them into a single computer program so I might like tend to use these terms a little bit interchangeably compiling and building although they do mean different things don't worry about memorizing this at the moment all I'm trying to do is reduce your confusion not increase it so I just want to run some of these ideas past you so that you've got a bit of an idea about what's going on here so basically we write Java programs as some text and we compile them and build them into a program and usually that's more or less as simple as clicking a button after we've written the actual text most of what we're doing is just going to be writing that text in the java programming language if you want to create a particular type of program with Java so let's say you want to create Android program so you want to create websites or web applications or games maybe even you can create games in Java whatever you want to do first you would have to learn basically the java programming language and then later on you could learn how to use Java to do the particular type of thing that you want to do so if you wanted to create websites first you've got to learn Java and then you'd have to learn about creating websites with Java there may be other things that you have to learn so in the case of websites you'd have to learn more about web programming generally but basically that's the idea this course teaches you the java programming language so we'll be creating mostly textmode programs which might not sound very exciting but the thing is you'll be learning the Java language itself and that will give you a very very powerful sort of platform from which to then go and then particular areas of Java that may interest you many people build careers just entirely out of Java so beginners often think that they've got to learn fifteen different programming languages but you really don't lots of people just know basically one programming language like it like Java or C++ or something and they just stick to that programming language and it build a whole career out of it so although in this course I'm not going to teach you how to create Android apps or desktop apps we may touch on some specific things you can do with Java and I may show you some basic little examples to get you start started but we're not actually going to be looking at any particular speciality we are going to be looking at the java programming language itself writing text mode or console mode programs we call them but even so you're going to be learning a very very valuable skill here and it's hopefully gonna set you on a whole journey and enable you to do whatever you want to do with computer programming okay so until next time happy coding
