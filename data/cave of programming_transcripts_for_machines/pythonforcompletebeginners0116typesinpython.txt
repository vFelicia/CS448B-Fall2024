in this video we're going to look at types in Python so in Python variables can point at different kinds of things you could have a variable called width and you could assign a value to it like an integer value and later on you could assign instead a string value to it if you want in some programming languages variables themselves have types so you could have a variable that is an INT type and can only refer to ins to whole numbers and you could have a variable that's a string type for example but it doesn't work like that in python python has something called Dynamic typing which basically means in very basic terms that variables don't have Types on the other hand it is important to know what type of a thing a variable actually refers to and if you forget what type of thing a variable refers to you can find out using the builtin type function and by the way before I forget I've called this file python types. py rather than just types. py and that's because I found out through bitter experience that if I call it types. py that actually conflicts with some builtin python package and causes problems in certain kinds of prr programs that's not a problem you'll often encounter though so let's take a look at this width variable I'm going to use print to print something out and what I want to print is the return value of the type function and to the type function I'm going to pass width as an argument arguments being just things that we pass to functions so I'm passing width to the type function and that returns a value it gives us a value back which I then print using print we're not somehow printing the type function itself here we're only printing what it gives us back we're printing its return value in technical terms so if I run this we see we get some text here that says class int we'll be talking about classes and objects in depth later on in this course but for now the important point is that it's telling us that width refers to an INT value an integer value we can also try this with length let's try it and you can probably get guess what we'll get back that's also an INT but watch what happens if we change 22 to let's say 22.5 for length now what we've got is a float so this is another possible builtin python type of object that is used to store floating Point numbers numbers with a decimal point in them now if we do this calculation so 15 * 22.5 five that's going to give us a floating point value so area is also going to be floating point now let's take a look and we can see that area also has class float now basically everything in Python is an object and one of the things that means is that we can use the type function on practically everything so for example we could find out what is the type of this text here which is a kind of an object let's run it object has a technical definition which we'll look out later and you can see here that the type of this string literal is stru that's its type meaning it's a string type it's some text a string of characters we can even try the type function on functions which are themselves also objects so let's take a look and try type on print now in this case I'm only going to type print by itself I'm not going to put round brackets after it if I put round brackets here like an open and close round bracket directly after print that would actually run the print function and with empty round brackets after it it would just just simply create a new line in the console an empty line if I run the type function and I Supply the name print to it then we can actually get something sensible back we can see that print is a kind of builtin function or method a method is a function that's attached to an object but we haven't covered that yet so don't worry about it what this is basically telling us is that print is a function so again there's no need to memorize anything here but what it is important to do is try this out for yourself you can use this program or some other program and try printing out the types of things and see what they are in your program this is a free video from my Python and machine learning course I'm uploading some videos from the start of the course to get you started with python the full course is absolutely huge and teaches you Python and the basics of machine learning and artificial intellig Ence with a ton of exercises and solutions please click the link in the description for the full course
