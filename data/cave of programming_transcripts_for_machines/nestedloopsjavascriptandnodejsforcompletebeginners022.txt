hello this is john from caveofprogramming.com in this video we're going to take a look at nested loops continuing my series on node.js and javascript for complete beginners so a nested loop is a loop within a loop and we can use a nested loop to visit each element in a 2d array one after the other let's start with use strict as as usual and i'm going to copy the 2d array that i created in the last video so i'm gonna copy this animal table so i've got let animal table equal and i've set this variable equal to a two two dimensional array so an array where each element is itself an array and the challenge is uh the challenge that we're going to do is can we visit each of these items in turn either setting them or outputting them with console.log so how would we use a for loop to access these two inner arrays so the two elements in this outer array here well we could do it like this for let i equals zero i less than animal table dot length so the length of it is 2 and i plus plus and then we can just output console.log animal table and i so if we run this code we are visiting the two elements of this sort of outer array that zero element zero and element 1 element index 0 element index 1 and we're outputting them here but each of those elements is itself an array let's maybe get each element in a variable so i'm going to say let row equal animal table i like this so now i'm i'm this variable row i'm setting first to that and then when the loop goes around again it gets set to this so row is an array and we can actually iterate over row using another loop so i can write four let now we can't use the name i again here the scope of this i variable in other words the variable the area where it exists is basically from here to here so anywhere within there we can't declare another variable called i we could do afterwards but within here we can't so let's give this another name like j i'm going to set j equal to 0 we're going to keep looping while j is less than row.length and we're going to say j plus and then here we can write console dot log let's output i and j so we can see what they are and then i'm going to write row j take a look so now we've got all the elements within this 2d array dog cat giraffe element rhino and you can see that the values of i and j are taking well all the values that we need them to so we've got um row zero row zero column zero is dog row zero column one is cat row one column zero is giraffe row one column one elephant and row one so this one column two which is that rhino is rhino we could also set the values in the array if we wanted like this so if i had another one of these i could set each element in turn and javascript is weakly typed so we could even set them to numbers you know we could do what we want with them really we could say for example um let's say row j equals i times j see what that does so we had strings in this 2d array we're changing them all to numbers where each number is equal to the row index times the color index column index and then we get this sort of strange looking table here um so the point that i want to make there is really just that we can change the elements in the array via this mechanism as well as well as accessing them let's set them all to hello and then they're all hello but anyways comment that out so if you're a complete beginner especially or any sort of beginner you need to practice this um so ideally try to get to the point where um you can define let's just move that down a bit actually move it out of the way there we go with alt or option and down arrow so you want to get to the point ideally where you can write this out from memory not this exact code but so first practice this type it out get it working and then see if you can without referring to other code after a bit of practice because at first you will probably need to refer to this code or other code examples um see if you can eventually get to a point where you can declare a 2d array and iterate through it using a nested loop incidentally we could also write here we could write animal table i j and here we could write animal animal table i and then we don't need this so that's another way to do it let's try that so you can see that works as well i'm going to just copy that and then just undo i wanted to show you this way first because i think it's sort of simpler and it makes it clearer what's going on i'll put this in a comment and you can find this on github.comcaverprogramming and my node.js public repository if you want to browse the code there so ideally get to the point where you can do it from memory if you get bored and get sick of it just move on to something else eventually with practice you'll be able to do this sort of thing and it'll seem um clear to you it just takes it just takes some practice i don't think it's very helpful to make notes it's you just need to practice it type it get used to typing this sort of thing really and in fact after you've typed things a few times i find it's a lot easier to understand them uh than to do that the other way around in other words it's a lot easier a lot easier to type stuff and then understand it than it is to understand stuff and then type but typing stuff out is and getting working is vital to the process of learning with programming absolutely vital so worth worth trying this out i'll give you an exercise with this i think probably in the next video possibly but for now this is just enough in itself so do try this out see how you get on until next time happy coding
