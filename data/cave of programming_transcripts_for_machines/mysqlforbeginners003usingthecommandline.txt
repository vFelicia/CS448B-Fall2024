hello this is John from cave of programming calm now this is kind of a optional tutorial because I'm going to show you how to use my sequel on the command line if you don't know the command line for your system if you don't know command line console commands then you're going to get lost in this tutorial but I would advise watching it anyway because it will give you a little bit more insight into how my sequel works but don't worry about it because we're going to be using the workbench in subsequent tutorials so now that I've installed my sequel and I've made sure that it's stopped it's not started at the moment I'm going to go to terminal on my Mac so Windows has a Windows console and of course you have a terminal in whatever version of Linux you're using as well now my my sequel is actually installed I tracked it down to the following directory this is just for my particular system I'm going to go to slash user local my sequel and of course on Windows the commands that you see here are going to be different so you know you could either learn Windows console commands or just skip this tutorial as well as I say let's go to that directory here's my actual my sequel installation now if we go to bin here we'll see there are lots of programs in there and there are two really important ones one is called my sequel D and that's the actual server program it's your actual database itself so we could start that from a commandline if we added this directory the directory I'm in to the path environment variable and again if you google file to do that for example Windows 7 path environment variable or you know Linux add to path environment variable then you could add that directory there and then you'll be able to type these commands these programs that you see here from any location in your terminal otherwise you're going to have to change to that this directory before you can run these so let's try and run the my sequel my sequel server on the command line so to do that on a Mac and probably on Windows I have to use the sudo command to run this as admin and again this is not going to apply to Windows let's run sudo slash my sequel my sequel D and I'm going to specify new root this specifies use the root user which is the kind of default user for my sequel if you specify the password you'll also need to say P and your password like let me in for example with no spaces afterlife and P but I haven't specified a password so I just need this let's run this you'll have to enter yours your admin password you'll use a password if you haven't already run sudo if you're using Linux or Mac that is so now we can see it started up successfully I'm going to start a new terminal let's go to Shell new window with basic settings again this is just much stuff but this is standard UNIX UNIX command line stuff so this will be the same or very similar on Linux again I'll go to that directory so it's less user local my sequel bin and now I can connect with the my sequel commandline tool so I'm going to just type mice well I have to type dot slash my sequel on Windows it would just be the command name without the dot slash or at least last time I use Windows that was the case new root and I run that now I've gotten my sequel command line so there are two programs here my sequel D the actual server itself the actual database and there's also that my sequel commandline tool which enables you to connect like database as a client as we say you're a client connecting to that database server and we're going to be issuing these commands in the workbench in future but I just wanted to show you this to help explain how this all works now I can issue a my sequel command and on the command line you have to terminate your commands with a semicolon so the simplest command that we can start off with is Shou space databases semicolon and ahead return and these are the different databases that I've got already by default in my my sequel server so you'll probably see something there hopefully you will and so although we've got one database server program we can have different databases in that so the different databases can be used for example by different programs or we can create a new database in there whenever we want to practice my sequel now I'm going to just quit that now so I'll type quit and it just says bye and we can close this to actually shut down this server from a terminal and you could like on Windows you could use your process manager or I forget what it's called on Windows but you have something that you can bring got to just shut down force processes to quit I'm going to use kind of UNIX command line here again and I'm going to go to shell new window on my Mac and so this if you're not familiar with this don't worry at all but I'm gonna type PS EF give me a list of processes in UNIX and I can then actually modify that by saying a pipe character and in same grep of my sequel and I will narrow down the list of processes in the UNIX type system to show you which ones are running that I have my sequel in the name so if I do that we can see that my sequel D is running here and that's the process ID a57 so I'm gonna say sudo to run as admin kill eight five seven and we've hopefully shut it down well it doesn't look very shutdown so let's try this ya fit actually we need this one here 909 let's try that the first one was the actual finger I'm typing now I just run that and with a bit of luck yeah it shut down so if you have if you do try this and you get lost then you problems shutting it down the thing to do would be just restart your computer hopefully after that it will work as normal and I will repeat my advice that if you do get into any difficulties with this you can't resolve them don't be afraid to Google it varies from system to system what you'll have to do but someone will have run into the error almost certainly that you're encountering and you can find that usually via Google searches so this all looks good and in the next tutorial we're going to connect via to my sequel workbench instead of via the my sequel client and we're going to start issuing commands so until next time happy coding
