in this video we're going to take a look at the continue keyword which is closely related to the break keyword let's change break to continue once again this is a keyword in Python and it's a keyword in most programing languages I can think of one there's a programming language called Pearl where it's not called continue in Pearl it's called next if I remember correctly but it does the same thing even in that case so what does it actually do well break will cause the looping the iteration just to stop and execute whatever's after that in the program so break will actually stop your Loop continue doesn't stop the iteration it just skips whatever's next in this particular iteration I'll show you what I mean so let's run this so if I hit return here of course it carries on as normal we print starting Loop number whatever it is we ask the user if they want to stop the loop we print ending Loop number whatever it is and then we go to the next iteration of the loop supposing I press y here and enter do you see the difference we again we've gone to the next iteration of the loop but what's happened is we've skipped this so we're going to skip whatever remains after this continue keyword in the rest of that particular iteration of the loop so we've got starting Loop number zero and ending Loop number zero but then we've got starting Loop Number One there is no ending Loop number one here we've gone straight to starting Loop Number Two so do try this out for yourself I would just suggest trying it out and making sure that you understand what effect this has on your program it is a keyword that you're going to find useful later on hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
