hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial will kind of look at what you need to install to get started with this tutorial so I'm in Google here and for reasons that I don't fully understand I've got Hungarian version of Google but the first thing we need to install is the my sequel community server this is a free database which you can install and which will sort of enable you to create tables and store data in there and do all kinds of things like that so if you search for the my sequel community server just go to the download link and most of the time all you have to do is select your operating system download the right installer and just run it like any normal installation program let's just click this download link they do have this slightly sneaky thing where they try to get you to create an account but at the moment of these fails that give you this no fence just start my download option here so you can do that so download the version for your operating system and install it they have versions for for Linux for Windows I'm using Mac but you can install it on more or less any reasonable desktop computer if the installation program asks you to enter a password for your root user which is as we'll see later on this is the user that you'll be connecting us initially it's really important that you remember the password that you entered it's very important but in my just not ask you this installation program used to be a bit flaky and a long time ago that didn't even used to be a program but now usually and that installers for the various platforms they pretty much work out the box if you do run into any problems then we'll make sure you are running the installer and not a zip download and don't be afraid to Google for further information if you have to I can't show you the installation for your platform because it depends on your platform and it even depends on version of my sequel and the version of the Installer but if you run into any problems don't be afraid to Google for that like can't install my sequel windows 7 or whatever and if any error messages come up don't be afraid to copy those and or just type them out paste them into Google do a search and see what comes up there because probably other people have encountered your problem as well if you have a problem if you really get stuck with this you can just search for online my sequel database something like that and you will find versions that you can use on the Internet and some of these are just meant for learning my sequel and others require you to create a account and maybe create a database with a few clicks and possibly even pay but you can find various free versions on here that you can use to practice your sequel if you really run into problems now in this tutorial we'll focus on using the my sequel workbench which is another free tools that you also need to install that for your system search for my sequel workbench and go to that and install that so again all the same things apply it's probably going to install pretty smoothly if you run into any problems don't be afraid to Google if you if you want to use an online my sequel database instead should be no problem because we won't be getting too tied up with the work bench here I'm gonna focus on learning my sequel of the sort that you'd also type on a commandline if you wanted to but this is a really handy tool to have because it just makes it much easier and nicer to work with the my sequel database when you've installed it you'll you will well you probably have a choice between running the my sequel server when you when your operating system starts thought when your computer starts which is the easiest option that's gonna run your app at your database itself when it starts and then you can start the my sequel workbench to connect to it or you cannot to start it via some kind of tool that they supply so for example in my mug here if I go to my mark system preferences I've got this my sequel administration tool and there so I'm gonna now that I've installed this I've installed my sequel I can click start my sequel server and I've just got a and to my operating system password to start that usually again it will start up pretty smoothly might also want to restart your computer if you have any problems and then when you've done that you should be able to run the my sequel workbench let's try to run that and you should be able to open a connection so this is how it looks at the moment it does change from version to version but you should be able to figure out how to create a new connection I've created one already here but I'll create a new one click the plus sign by my sequel connections this could be slightly different in your version and it's already prefilled in the details here I didn't say a password my Newser name is root which is a default this host name means basically just the computer whether my sequel server the database itself is running and this 3306 is the default port for my sequel so then i can click the test connection and it says successfully made the my sequel connection so you want to get to that point where you can see that your my sequel workbench can successfully connect your server don't forget you might have to start your server via your control panel or preferences or whatever you're using if you didn't select target start when you start your computer when you installed it okay so that's it for this tutorial good luck with that and as I say if you run into any problems google it and as a last resort you can use just an online my sequel database to follow this tutorial and in the next tutorial we'll look at actually setting up a connection and issuing commands so until next time happy coding
