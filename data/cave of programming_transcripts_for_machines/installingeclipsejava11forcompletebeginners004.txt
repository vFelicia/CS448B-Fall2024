hello in this video we're going to take a look at installing eclipse which is a integrated development environment so hopefully by now you've installed the Java SDK and what you need is some kind of editor to work in because Java programming is basically about creating text files and in those text files instead of writing in a human language for example like English you write in the Java programming language and then the software development kit that you've already installed will behindthescenes turn those into actual Java programs now you can write Java code in any kind of text editor even in sort of Windows notepad or Mac TextEdit or whatever you like but there is specialized software designed to make it easy to work with Java code so one option would be one good option for example would be to use a an editor that's actually designed for programmers to work with like a programmers editor and at the moment I'm here at the end of 2019 Visual Studio code is actually a great option but we won't be using it in this course and I will explain why well if you search for Visual Studio code so this this is not Visual Studio Visual Studio is a is what we call an IDE an integrated development environment but we're not going to be using that either although I think you can so if you search for Visual Studio code you'll find that there's a this is actually a an opensource programmers editor from Microsoft and it's really really good it's really excellent I highly recommend it and you can install all kinds of plugins in it that make it work with various languages including Java now the problem with using a code editor to do your programming is that you've still got to somehow compile your programs that is you've got to take the text that you write and turn it into an actual piece of software and then actually run it so one thing that probably a fair few Java programmers actually do is they will use a programmers text editor like Visual Studio code like Emacs or even vim something like this and then they'll on the command line they'll actually compile and run their programs I'm not going to be using the command line in this course I don't think and a reason for that is that I'm using a Mac and you may be using Windows or Linux or a Mac I don't know and the actual sort of command line commands that you would need to write in a console to compile your Java programs would be slightly different between different operating systems I want to make this course in a way that it's good for anyone using any operating system within reason and another reason that I'm not going to be using a command line is that most professional Java Java programmers do actually use a thing called an IDE now IDE stands for integrated development environment and that's a fancy way of saying a text editor that specialized for usually for a particular programming language and it will also have buttons to do things like compile your programs in other words take take the text and turn it into a program an actual piece of software and run the programs so that we don't have to mess around with the command line at all and one that we are going to use in this tutorial is a very excellent very popular completely free IDE called Eclipse so I'm going to ask you to search for Eclipse for Java developers because that's what what we will be using Eclipse you can use it to write code in various programming languages and of course we want the one there specifically configured to develop Java programs so if you search for the Eclipse IDE for Java developers and go to that at eclipse.org and then download the one for your operating system I can see here it says a newer version of this is available is available here so I'll just click on that link get latest version of it you really want the absolute latest in this case and download the version for your operating system and install that and then all you have to do is start it up sometimes people find that there are error messages when eclipse starts Eclipse does depend on you already having installed the Java SDK so you have to do that first if you've done that and then you install eclipse and you get an error message again don't be afraid to put that error message into Google so if it says you know no matter how obscure it is if it says something like cannot find Java then type into Google Eclipse cannot find Java or whatever the error message says and see what the solution to it is this this initial few steps up is particularly frustrating or they can be hopefully everything will go smoothly but some people are going to find that this doesn't go smoothly and at that stage it's really easy to just give up and say I don't know what's going on here it's too confusing it's normal to feel confused at this stage especially if you do encounter an error message but you just have to get through this particular bit and once we got to the point where we can actually run run Eclipse write a program and run the program and that's all working then we'll have a lot smoother journey so just this initial bit that's a bit tricky so after you've installed Eclipse start it up and you should see something that looks like this and Eclipse usually starts up with with the scream that looks similar to this when eclipse starts it might ask you to set your workspace directory and what that is it's just a folder where eclipse is going to put your code so you can create that folder in advance if you like put it in your your Documents folder or whatever call it workspace call it anything you like it doesn't matter and then you have to just tell eclipse to put your code in that folder so in other words you set your Eclipse workspace to that folder and if you change your mind later in one of the menus here in the file menu there's this option to switch workspace and you can use that option to switch to a different folder by default it will be called workspace but it doesn't have to be that's that's not important at all so you can set that to wherever you like because I'm on a Mac here my directory structure looks like this it starts with a slash on windows it will probably look a little different but that does that doesn't matter okay so hopefully you can get to this point where you can see Eclipse running and then we don't need this we don't need this whole screen here so I'm just going to close it with the sort of cross in the corner here or however you close windows on your system and then we'll see something that looks like this quite intimidating but as you'll see it's not so bad we're going to learn it bit by bit and by the end of this course you'll feel I think fairly familiar with using Eclipse Eclipse has an absolute ton of features and you can even install more fire plugins but we won't need most of those features so there's no need to be frightened of it it is a bit intimidating when it starts up but you'll see it it's not so bad ok in the next video we will look at actually creating a Java program and until then happy coding
