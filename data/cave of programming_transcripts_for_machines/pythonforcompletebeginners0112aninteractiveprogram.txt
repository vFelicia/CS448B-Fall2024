in this video we're going to create our first interactive program I'm going to take a copy of this file I'm always going to be doing that or almost always when I create a new program I'm going to save this I'll just do it by using file and save as this time and we'll call it interactive dot pi okay so using interactive.pi here the first thing that I'm going to do is I want to change this program a little bit to get rid of world let's get rid of world here and I want to create a new variable which I'll call name and set that equal to some name like Joe for example so what I what I type here is is just stuff I've made up there's nothing special about it but notice that variable names like these they don't go in quotes the theme that goes in quotes is just text literal text like these strings here now supposing I want to Output all of this on a single line here's one way to do it I can type greeting comma name comma question and if we run this we see all that text on one single line however I'm going to suggest that for the moment you forget that you've seen this so this this does work we've just got the variables or strings separated by commas between the two round brackets of the print function but I think if we do it another way it'll help you better to learn how to work with variables so I'm going to do it do this a different way instead of commas I'm going to separate these with plus signs now when we use plus signs with a string on either side so these are string variables yes but we can use them wherever we might otherwise use a string then it basically performs concatenation in other words joining together so in this context we call things like plus and equals operators and in this context this is a concatenation operator for joining strings together and if we try this out it works it is even worse than using commas because we've lost some spaces here but you can see it basically joins these strings together via the variables and outputs them now let's try to format this a bit more nicely we want some spaces and punctuation in there so I can actually put spaces inside strings so I could put a space here as long as it's within these quotes then we're fine and if I run this now you see a space after hello we probably want a full stop after hello Joe as well to do that I'm just going to add in a string literal so let's put in quotes a DOT and a space and another quote and then I need another plus sign here so I'm joining together four different strings here three of them I'm referring to with variables and the other one is a string literal we can mix and match like that they all behave just like string literals basically if I run that we have some pretty nicely formatted text so you you're definitely going to want to try this out because if it does seem at all confusing or mysterious now which will be normal if you are an absolute beginner it will stop seeming confusing if you just practice doing this a bit now the reason I separated our name here is because I want to get that from the user I want the user to enter their own name to tell me what their name is and I want to Output that in this text so to do that firstly I'm going to go above where I create the name variable and I'm going to say let's print a prompt so let's say enter your name colon maybe space and how do I collect what the user enters on the terminal I can do it like this instead of saying name equals Joe so I'm assigning the value of the string literal Joe to this variable name instead of doing that I can type input and then open and close round bracket so this is what we call the input function and the round brackets there clue you in that it is a function in other words it's some code that's going to do something it's not just another variable or something let's maybe try to arrange this a bit nicely to help us understand the program better now let's run this and see what it does so I run it and it says enter your name and let's enter John which is my name and it says hello John how are you so now we've got a program that's actually Interactive try this out for yourself so you want to definitely type this out and see if you can change it to do something maybe a little bit different it is normal to feel confused at this stage but the answer to confusion here is is always going to be practice by the end of this course if you follow it all the way through and you practice honestly the whole idea of variables and string literals and functions and all this stuff and much much more besides is gonna seem like second nature to you this is a free video from my course Python and machine learning for complete beginners I'm releasing the first couple of chapters of this course completely for free on YouTube to get you started with python I plan to upload new videos here to YouTube every Monday and every Thursday for at least a couple of months if you're interested in the complete course which teaches you python from scratch and eventually progresses to things like creating graphical user interfaces and using neural networks principal component analysis cluster analysis all that stuff and much more besides then you can find a link in the description or just go to this URL on the screen right here if you finish the whole course you'll be able to write all kinds of general purpose programs in Python and use Python to do machine learning and artificial intelligence as well thank you for watching until next time happy coding
