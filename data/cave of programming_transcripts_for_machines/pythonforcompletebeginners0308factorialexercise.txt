in this video I'm going to give you an exercise which you can try if you want the exercise is to write a function that calculates and Returns the factorial of a number so what is the factorial of a number well factorial of a number this is something that only applies to positive integers so we're only going to be passing positive whole numbers to the function that we write and the mathematical definition of it goes something like this let me explain this firstly we would read this as n factorial so let's say n is 3 we write three factorial like this we just put an exclamation mark after the whole positive number and we read that as 3 factorial or five factorial or whatever the number is and the definition of the factorial of a number is that it's the number multiplied successively by all the numbers that are one less than a current number so for example 3 factorial is defined as being equal to 3 * 2 * 1 5 factorial is equal to 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 so 4 factorial will be 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 I think you get the idea right now there is a bit of a twist which is the factorial of0 which you might expect to be zero is actually defined as being equal to one so your function is going to have to take that into account so you need to write a function which you could call factorial and you want to be able to pass a whole integer positive number to that function and it will return the factorial of that number and then use your function to calculate the factorial of seven now since this is quite a difficult problem at this stage I'm going to give you a hint about how to do this I would recommend using a loop this is not the only way to do this but that's what I would recommend at this stage and you're going to want to create a variable so declare a variable before the loop starts and then the loop needs to repeatedly modify the number that that variable refers to so I think even with the hint it's a bit of a tricky exercise but I would recommend having a go make sure you understand the definition of factorial hopefully it's pretty clear and then see how far you can get with writing a function that calculates and Returns the factorial of a number you're going to want to have practiced defining functions with parameters and returning values from functions before you attend this for sure and if you find you get stuck and you just feel you can't do it don't worry because we're going to look at a possible solution in the next video but I strongly recommend at least doing as much as you can of this exercise before going on to the next video so try to do as much of this as you can maybe you'll get the solution in the end or maybe you won't but have a go at it and I just want to give you a quick justification for why this factorial thing exists the factorial of a number is actually the number of ways you can arrange that number of objects and when I say object I mean object in the ordinary everyday sense of the word so for example supposing we have three letters a b and c how many different ways can you arrange those letters well we can arrange them like this ABC we could have ACB we could have B A or BCA and we could have c a and CBA that's all the different number of ways I can arrange these letters there are six different ways and notice that 3 factorial is six so the factorial of a number actually gives us the number of different ways we could arrange that number of objects and that kind of explains why zero factorial is defined as one because how many different ways can you arrange nothing arguably there's only one way to arrange nothing you could quibble about that but that's kind of justification for it have a go and see where you get and remember that the important thing at this stage is just to be practicing and trying to do things if you don't get it in the end don't tear your hair out we'll look at it in the next video hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
