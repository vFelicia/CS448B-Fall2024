in this video we're going to look at Loops in Python we're going to see how we can run code repeatedly specifically we're going to look at for Loops for Loops are called for Loops because they usually use the keyword for in most programming languages and python is no exception so supposing I have some code like this I want to write hello but I want to print hello multiple times okay I can duplicate it and if we run this we know what that's going to do we get hello printed three times but now supposing I decide I want it to print something different like goodbye then well now I've got to change all of them and I'm already getting frustrated this is boring but now we've done it in fact repeated code is usually a sign that you're doing something wrong there's usually a better way to do it if you've got the selfsame code repeated multiple times whether it's one line of code or whole blocks of code that are repeated you want to avoid that in general let's get rid of this and instead of doing that I'm going to write for I in range and this is actually a function and I'm going to pass the value three to the function and at the end of this we have a colon and underneath that indented I'm going to write print hello and if we run this it prints hello three times now there's a lot to remember here when you first encounter this but the secret to remembering it is just to type it out a few times yourself and experiment with it of course you can change this number to whatever you like and have python print hello or whatever you prefer multiple times as many times as you like we can break this down a bit further so what's this I what's that doing there well that's actually a variable it's the name of a variable that I just made up in general we want variable names to be more than one letter we usually want them to describe what their purpose is we want to ER on the side of having excessively long variable names if anything that's preferable usually to having variable names that are too short and too cryptic we want them to be descriptive but in the context of Loops it's common to give a variable a onlet name and the most common choice is I so this actually does create a variable called I now this range function creates a range object which is used by this four syntax to obtain the values 0 1 2 and three in this particular case and it sets I to each of those values in turn so we could print I out here as well let's maybe put a space there and would like to do something like this except I of course is an integer and this is a string so let's cast I to a string like this and now if we run this it prints hello 0 hello one hello 2 hello 3 so this for Loop syntax is running this code block which at the moment consists of only one line repeatedly four times and every time it runs I is set to a different value it's set to the values 0 1 2 and three the four here you might think that specifies how many times the loop should run and in these simple cases you can think of it like that but really it's specifying the end of the range so the range is going to start by default at zero and it's going to go up to but not including whatever number you write here so this is basically creating a range of numbers 0 1 2 and 3 and we're setting I equal to each of the numbers in that range that's why in is there one after the other and then we can do what we want with I one possibility is we can just print it so try this out for yourself you can experiment with it a little bit I always recommend that you can try adding more lines in here you can try printing different things you could print the value of I just by itself without the hello you could even try doing arithmetic with I if you're feeling really adventurous but the main thing is just to type this out a couple of times and verify for yourself what this actually does there's actually a lot in this small bit of syntax and we will explore it more later on but for the moment you just need to get a little bit used to using this so that you know how to execute a block of code repeatedly a specified number of times hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
