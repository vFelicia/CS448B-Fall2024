in this video we're going to take a look at the break keyword let's create a loop to start with so I'm going to say four I in range maybe five and then here we're going to print something let's print Loop number and cast that to a string and use I so let's in fact say here starting Loop number whatever it is and then we'll also have ending Loop number whatever it is now if I just run this as it is of course we get just a load of print statements executing basically starting loot number zero ending loot number zero and then 1 2 3 all the way through to four remember this specifies the end of the range and the end is not included in the range now supposing every time we go around the loop here so all the code that I'm writing here is indented because it's part of this Loop code block supposing we get some feedback from the user let's say stop equals so that's just a variable that I'm creating stop equals input Stop the Loop brackets yes or no question mark so every time we go around the loop now we're going to ask the user if we should stop the loop and the idea is that they should be able to enter y if they want to stop the loop and N if they don't and we're going to store whatever they type in this variable stop let's try it just to see what it does at the moment so it asks me if I want to stop the loop after printing starting Loop number zero and it doesn't matter what I type here whatever I type type it's just then going to carry on looping again so after I type something or just hit return for that matter it's going to say ending Loop number whatever it is and then it goes to the next iteration of the loop starting Loop number one here and then it ask me again do I want to stop it or not I can just hit return and go all the way through all the loops until they finally finish now supposing I actually want to make this work so if the user types y the loop should actually stop how should I do that well I'm probably going to need some kind of if statement because I need to check if something's true or not I need to check if they've entered Y in this case so within the loop code block we can have an if statement notice this is indented like everything else here so if stop that's the text that the user has entered equals y colon and now how do we stop the loop well the answer is a good way to do it is we can use the break keyword so this is a keyword that's found in most programming languages I think and it's used in exactly the same way in all the ones that I've seen sometimes it might be called something else but I can't actually think of an example of that probably it's always called Break actually and what it does is it terminates the loop immediately so it will cause the looping to stop and whatever's after that in the loop code block won't be executed actually to make this a bit clearer at the bottom here let's print program finished so this isn't indented so it isn't part of the code that's going to actually be looped okay now let's try this Stop the Loop if I just Type n or if I just hit return or type anything apart from y it carries on looping but if I type y we go straight to program finished and notice that after I typed y so this was then true and this executed we didn't execute this this whole thing is the code block that we're actually looping we're actually making that run repeatedly but as soon as we hit break it goes straight out of this whole code block and executes anything after that in the program break here is a keyword in the Python language and it is important and very useful so I would recommend typing this out for yourself I'm going to give you an exercise later on but for a moment try out the break keyword yourself with your own piece of code using a loop of course if I didn't have this if here and if I just put the break right here instead then we would only get one Loop actually executing I can probably show you that if I just comment out if so if I put a hash sign there this just becomes a comment and now I've got a sort of squiggly red error because the indentation is wrong so I just need to unindent break and if I just run this it doesn't matter what I type now that just going to finish the loop straight away but that isn't much use it's much more useful to only execute break under certain conditions to stop the loop hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
