hello in this and a next video I'm just going to talk a little bit about what we've actually created and I'm not going to be able to explain all of it at the moment because there's just too much going on here for you to understand at this stage in the course you will understand it later on but for now I just want to talk a little bit just to familiarize just just to sort of familiarize you a little bit with what's going on here so you'll feel hopefully a little bit less confused and if you've actually created your own program here and you've run it and it says hello world or whatever then that's really a great achievement so you should be proud of that that's a fantastic start ok so let's take a look at what eclipse is generated in this video so if you click your project and you you rightclick it so I should say click click the project name in the package Explorer here and then right click it and go to properties and if on this dialog if you've got resource selected on the top left here then where it says location that will show you where your project is located and of course it's located in whatever folder you set the workspace to be so actually let's take a look at that on the disk so we'll go to it and my workspace folder is this I called it workspace and you don't have to but I did and in though we've got a folder for the project and it's called hello world it's named after a project we click on that and in there we've got a bin and a source folder now you don't have to have these folders in the Java project so if you have decided for some reason to follow this using for example visual studio code and you're you've looked up how to compile and run Java programs on the command line then maybe you haven't created these it is good practice to create them bin and source but they're not a part of the java language that more like a sort of traditional standard in Java the bin folder is were Eclipse puts your compiled programs so when you take text files that contain text written in a programming language and you turn them into a program some software does that and the software is in your Java development kit that process of turning text files into an actual runnable program that your computer understands is called building the program or compiling the program these these are technically different but for the moment we'll just talk about compiling the program so you're taking text files turning them into an actual computer program and that stuff gets put in the bin folder and you can look at it if you want and you'll see an app dot class file in there that's what's actually being run when you run your program now in the source folder here that's where we put our source code the source code is the stuff that we're writing and in there there's a folder called hello the reason I've got a folder called hello is because I called my package hello when I created this app dot Java class which is what this is this app dot Java is a class I put it in a package called hello so there's a folder called hello don't worry about these terms at the moment I'm just beginning to use them so you get a feeling of familiarity with them but you don't need to know exactly what they are at the moment is ok so if we go into the hello folder there's my app dot Java text file that's what we've actually written and that's this text file here ok so what we've got is we've got a project located in the workspace the project has one package in it called hello so that that's in its own folder and inside that folder is a text file at Java and a text file Java code in it that defines a class and that that at Java gets turned into a class file which is located in our bin folder so it's worth having a look at that in Windows Explorer or Mac finder or whatever you're using your file explorer just have a look at this just to feel a bit more familiar with it in the next video we'll talk a little bit about the code that we've actually written and all of this stuff I'm just giving you a very rough overview you don't have to really understand what I'm saying in any depth I'm just beginning to familiarize you with it but we will be going over a lot more in the rest of the course okay so until next time happy coding
