hello this is John from cave of programming calm this is the second tutorial in our series of Java tutorials for complete beginners and today we're going to look at variables in Java don't worry if you don't understand every absolutely every single last thing in this tutorial because learning a programming language is like learning an ordinary language and you just have to practice it and gradually it sort of sinks into your head I'm gonna use the hello world program from the last tutorial as as a starting point here so what is a variable I'll give you an example I'm going to type int and I'm gonna make up a name here my number variables are like boxes that you can put values in and we've got different sizes of boxes in Java that can hold different kinds of things different types of boxes I should say and what we've done here is I've made up a name my number a notice I've given it a lowercase initial letter but I've capitalized the second word of it and that's that's a sort of a convention in Java and my number is a type int which means integer meaning that this box can hold a an integral number a whole number in other words negative or positive so here I've I've created the box and we say I've declared the variable and I can now put a value into the box I can say my number equals 88 or whatever and I'm now initializing the variable so I've declared the variable here now I'm initializing the variable and I can output this by the same method that we used in the first tutorial I'll types this out I'll press control space and Eclipse creates this system dot out dot print Ln print line for me I think put my number in there and if I click the green runbutton it outputs 88 now here I've I've declared I've declared and initialized the variable in two separate steps but I can declare it and initialize it at the same time I can say equals 88 up here I can get rid of this line and that is just the same thing now in Java there are eight primitive types of variables and we're going to go through these really quickly and then in the next tutorial we'll look at classes a little bit classes and objects so we've got an inch here and it's a 32bit value in Java if you don't really know what that means don't worry it doesn't really matter basically if you want an integral number a whole number then using in usually sometimes you'll see short which is four well it's a 16bit value so it can hold slightly smaller numbers still you can fit quite a lot into it probably up to I don't know maybe 30 mm I think and we can output that the same way sis out I short and there's also a long version of an in for really long numbers by long and these these names here by the way it could be anything I could call these Apple cat you know absolutely anything at all so I'm just making up names for variables let's up on that this out this out my long this is a 64bit value for really big numbers you can put a lot a lot bigger numbers than than this in there it's also what if you want a floatingpoint number you usually use a double this means kind of double precision extra precision sort of thing so I can put like you know some some number in there this out my double a presto and there's there's no long version of double but there is a short version called float and there's a slight complication here which is if you type a floating point number in in Java like this by default it's a double so you have to put an F on the end of it to get a float but these doubles and intz are the most commonly used values here my lonliness a bit less common in addition in addition to these five there's also three other other interesting types there's a char type which can hold a Unicode character and you can specify a character by putting it in single quotes like this it could be any character on your keyboard I just put Y as I say that's that's Unicode 16bit Unicode just means you can represent basically a whole bunch of crazy characters using this there's a very useful boolean site which i guess is named after I think it was George Boole or possibly Boulos and I'm sure who invented boolean logic and this can just hold true or false this how I true or I could change that default and that's all you can put in that and finally we've got the white type which can hold just eight bits of data so it's the number negative or positive but it's it can only go up to about 127 I think and often that's quite useful sometimes you want to represent a whole load of data by an array of bytes and you can use this and you know precisely how much space it will take up okay so we just starts it for declaring boxes and shoving stuff into them in the next tutorial we'll we will look at some non primitive types classes and objects so I don't forget it's more info and tutorials on cave of programming calm and I'll catch you next time I hope that's all then happy coding you
