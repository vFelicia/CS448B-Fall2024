hello in this video we're going to take a look at another type called double so you might wonder what you're supposed to do if you have a floating point value so instead of having seven or five or 1329 or whatever you have something like let's say at 8 2.3 something with a point in it and for that there's another type that you can use called double in fact there are at least two different types well in a way there are a number of different types you can use to do all of these things but we're we're just covering the most some of the most basic most common most fundamental types here and incidentally before I get started I just want to point something out which I'm going to return to later which is that if you have multiple projects like this then you you want to make sure that you're always running what you think you're running it's a bit easy to get into the habit of clicking that Run button and then running the wrong thing by accident and to be sure and select the class so app Java in this case containing your main method before you hit the Run button and if you want to be absolutely sure select it right click it go to run as java application and then you absolutely know what you're running otherwise you can get quite confused quite easily also by the way you can not only can you sort of contract projects like this but you can rightclick them and close them like this go to close project and then you can open them again later when you want to we're going to look at this stuff more later on anyway I just wanted to mention that okay so doubles if you want a floating point value you can't use a type int so I can't write int what should we have here maybe height equals 1.8 so that's not going to work we get an error here and if I hover over the error it says type mismatch cannot cannot convert from double to int so this is a what we call a literal value here it's some we can also say that it's hardcoded it's a value that have actually coded into my computer program a literal hardcoded value and intrinsically by default it has the double type because it's got a point in it we need to use a double type just to store it incidentally in the USA and the UK and some other places we use a point so we say one point eight that sort of thing to indicate fractional values like point eight large parts of Europe apparently use a comma so but we don't do that in Java as far as I know or all versions of Java are the same we use a point to indicate a fractional value okay so let's write here double now we've got something that will actually work now we've only now we've we've just got a warning which is saying that we're not using it and we can output that out just as we did with integers so let's say height is plus height and let's try running that there we go height is 1.8 we're going to start doing some stuff with this but I'm going to leave it there for this tutorial try that out check you can declare double values you can always put more of them in the same program as long as you give them different names but do have a go at it and we're going to look later on also at some general tips that you should use when programming and some tips are following this course but at the moment I'm just concentrating on getting you started with the most important things okay so until next time happy coding
