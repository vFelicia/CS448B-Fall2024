in this video we're going to look at a solution to the exercise I gave you last time how did you do with it I think it's a difficult problem for a beginner so don't feel bad if you couldn't finish it hopefully after you've seen this you will be able to firstly let's create a main so we'll have def Main and let's do pass here for the moment and I need to remember to call Main then we can define a function factorial which is going to accept some value so I'll just call that value I'll put pass there now we can already call this function what we want to be able to do is collect a result from it so result equals factorial and pass in some value here like three or whatever and then we want to be able to say print result and let's print result there so we can break this down into two steps really one step is to use a loop to obtain the actual numbers that we want to multiply together and the other step is to add in code that can collect those numbers by multiplying them all together so firstly let's have a loop here let's say four I in range now what should this Loop be well let's say we pass in three then we want to get the numbers 1 2 and three so the start of the range should be one ex except we're going to multiply the numbers together and multiplying by one makes no difference so we might as well start on Two And what should the end of the range be well remember the end of the range as we specify it here will not include the number that I actually write there so I don't exactly want value I want value + one so if value is three now the end of the range will be four and that means we'll get the numbers 2 three let's actually check this by printing out I and see what it does so I haven't returned anything yet just to make this work let's just return zero for the moment then I can run it and you can see we've got the numbers two and three let's try a different number like five and then we've got 2 3 4 5 so if we multiply those numbers together we will get a factorial of five how can we multiply them all together well I need a variable up here let's call it result and set it initially equal to one and down here I'm going to return result now we can use result together with I to calculate a new result every time we go around the loop so I can say result equals result time I so to a beginner this often would look as though it's not legitimate it looks like we're saying for example 4 equal 4 * 2 which clearly isn't true but of course this is not an equals sign as such well it is an equals sign but it doesn't mean equals in the mathematical sense it is an assignment operator it's taking the value that we calculate here and assigning it to this variable and you can use the variable itself to calculate a new result which will then assign back to the original variable so I think this will actually work if we run it we get 120 is that correct let's try a smaller number let's try zero for a start and see if it handles zero remember this should be one so we do get one so it handles this the factorial of zero let's try one and that should be one two that should be two three should give us six that's right four should be well 6 * 4 is 24 5 should be 24 * 5 which is 120 and we do factorial of 6 6 * 120 I make that 720 and if we try seven so 7 * 720 that's 4,900 + 140 which is 540 so factorial 7 is 540 that's equal to 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 times one which makes no difference so I think the trickiest bit here is perhaps this but it is a tricky problem as a whole if you couldn't figure out how to do it I would recommend look at this result a little bit don't spend too long looking at it and then put this code away and try to write this program yourself until you can get it working another thing you can do if that's still too difficult is just write out this code type it all out for yourself believe me that will usually help and then once you've got it working put the code away and see if you can write it again via a combination of remembering what was there and figuring out as you go along what you should write at each stage now that you've seen how I did it if you can get to the place where you can write a function like this that calculates a factorial and you understand how it works then I think you're doing very well at this stage hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
