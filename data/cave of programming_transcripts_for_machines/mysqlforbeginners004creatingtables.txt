hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to create a simple database in my sequel workbench we'll add a table to the database add some data to it and then query the table so my my sequel server is already running as I can tell if I go to this little utility for stopping and starting it so I'm going to go to my sequel workbench and on the home screen here so if you're not on a home screen already pretty properly are you need to click this home button in the top left corner here's a connection I've already created I'm just gonna delete that for the moment so we can start from scratch I'm going to click the plus button buy my sequel connections and we'll give this a name so let's call that tutorial alright I'll just call it default because this is the only my sequel instance that I'm going to connect to with this workbench so we've got the user name in there we've got an IP address here which is the kind of local IP address of this particular machine so this isn't on the internet if it was on the internet in this database my database server this IP address will be different and this is a port which we're going to connect on is the default for my sequel 3 3 0 6 and again if you are on the internet somewhere you use this information to connect your database but the defaults here which were already filled in for me apart from the connection name they're good for connecting to my local server so I'm going to click test connection it says it's ok so we'll click OK and now I've got this icon here so if your version of my sequel workbench works a bit differently don't worry about it you just need to go through this sort of equivalent steps whatever they are on your version to get this working and it will be something similar to this let's double click this connection though so now it's opened a tab where I can write sequel commands I'm going to start with show databases and I'm going to execute that I could use the lightning strike button bhangra news command and turn command and enter and on Windows I guess it would be control and enter but that will execute the command if you've got the cursor on this Lions let's do that so we can see these are the databases I've got at the moment and I'm going to delete this command that I've just typed and bad create database let's call it tutorial 1 and execute that the same way and then I can delete that and we can go back to show databases show databases so now we see and that we've got the tutorial one database created and we also see in the lower pane here which is really important that all the commands executed successfully so if you type something incorrectly then you'll see red arrow icons down here but these are all green showing me that all my commands are running it's really important to keeping an eye on that pane down here let's make it a bit bigger too to cheder your sequel commands are running correctly now I can go ahead and create the table but first I need to tell my sequel that I want to work with this particular database that I've just created so I'm going to type use tutorial 1 which is the name of my database and execute that and again we see from the lower pane that it's executed successfully so you'd normally have like one database per different application that you're going to use to connect to it so if I'd if I have some application that I want to use a database I want it to be a shared database that I'm going to put on the internet for example then I create a different database within the my sequel database server like this for every application and everyone using that application could connect to the same database so we've created the database and we're using this database now I'm going to create a table so I'll say create table and let's give it a name let's call it users and after another space I'm going to put two round brackets and in here I need to specify what columns might has so we'll just give this one column to start with I'm gonna call the column username it doesn't really matter whether you make this uppercase or lowercase I prefer lowercase myself in the early days of sequel uppercase was more common and we're going to have to say what type this column is so what type of thing does it store I just want this to store text and I don't know what the length of the text is going to be so I'm going to just say text here textures have built in my sequel type so this is one of the types of things that you can store in a date in a table column let's execute that and again we see the green icon at the bottom here showing me that my syntax was correct then it's type show tables and execute that so now we can see in this sort of middle pane that is showing me the results of that query and it's saying we've got this table called users so we've just got one table in our database called users I can also if I want to see more information about that table because I've forgotten what's actually in it I can type desc users and execute that and then we see that we've got one column in there called username of type text they thought it also tells me that it's allowed to be null so we could put like no empty values in there if we wanted and sequel the syntax of secret verse vary a bit between different databases and the commands that you use to switch to a database or view a table these in particular tend to vary between databases so desc users this might be different in a different database and also things like create database and show tables but the sequel commands you use to create tables they're fairly standard but again there's going to be minor differences between different types of database like Oracle or my sequel and in particular the types that you can use text or infer integers or whatever they're going to differ a bit between different kinds of databases so let's let's actually add some data to this table so we know we've got one column called username I'm going to type here insert into and the name of the table which is users and we're going to put round brackets in there and specify the columns that were inserting into so we just want to insert until the username column so I put that in your own brackets then after the brackets and then its height values and another pair of round brackets and in the second pair of round bucket round brackets I can specify what values I want to insert and what I can only insert one value at a time here so let's in double quotes means double quotes because this is a string it's some natural text rather than being say a numerical value so we put it in double quotes and that's I didn't air a user name like Bob I'm gonna just execute that again we see that it's executed successfully and now well we could change this and add another value in there so we'll have two rows and information in our table then let's change Bob to Vicki and execute that again so now we've got two users in our database and to see all the values in this table in our database he can add multiple tables in a database and you usually do but we've just got this one so I want to I want to look at all the values in this table now that I've inserted into it and to do that I'm going to type select star as asterisk from and the table name which is users and if I execute that we can now see here in the middle pane two values Bob and Vicki so when you see all of this stuff at first it seems really complicated and some people have a tendency to make a lot of notice and really agonize over it intellectually but the thing you have to do is just type this type nice commands don't worry about the fact that you don't understand them fully at the moment perhaps just type them out and get them working make sure you can actually type these and execute it so have a go this yourself create your own database call it whatever you like the database name and table names they will probably have to not have spaces in them in any case it's good practice certainly not to put spaces in database or table names but you can make it whatever name you like for your database or your tables in the database so try creating a table add some data to it and select the data from it so you can actually see it follow through the steps that I've actually done here because that's the really most effective way to learn and in the next tutorial we'll look at what else we can do we'll look at doing some more complex inserts and selects probably so until next time happy coding
