hello in this video we're going to talk a bit about formatting and this isn't an incredibly important topic we're soon going to look on we're going to go on to look at the really the fundamental nuts and bolts of programming but it's important that we get this right at the start there are some things that we must get right before we really even begin and this is one of them so let's create a new project let's go to file new Java project I won't keep doing this with every video but I'm doing this just a few times because it is important that you remember it and do try it yourself let's let's call this formatting and make sure I've got jari 11 selected click Next on tick create module in folks we're not going to use that now click finish and rightclick the project that's been generated and go to new class let's give it a class called app and put it in a package called application and tick to say that I want a public static void main click finish ok so we can add some statements to this now I want to just point out Java is Java is a programming language that has been influenced by various other programming languages and two particular influences on Java were C and C++ so in Java if we create a statement let's write this out hello so this is a statement it's kind of one piece of code that does something and it finishes in a semicolon and that idea of finishing statements with a semicolon comes from C and C++ maybe there were other languages that use the idea earlier but as far as Java is concerned this is a C or C++ thing and C and C++ were too Pro or 2 programming languages that have been around for absolutely ages and are still extremely widely used similarly these curly brackets Darcy and also a C++ thing so he come from these other programming languages as do many other things in Java now there are fundamentally basically two different ways of formatting your brackets in these programming languages so one way is when you open a curly bracket like this like this one here or this one here here and one style puts each opening curly bracket on its own line like this now you can use that in Java but I don't recommend it because by far the most popular style in Java is to put the opening curly brackets on the same line as the sort of code that identifies what's about to happen in these curly brackets so the curly brackets and the code within them we call it a code block and code blocks usually have something written before them that basically says what they are or what they do so we put the the opening curly bracket on the same line is that bit of code that says basically what's going to happen essentially in in the code block so I recommend you use this uses style and Eclipse makes it easy to type code like this anyway space doesn't really matter in a java program you can you can put blank lines in let's type Sissel how are you you can put them in where you want them and you basically just add blank lines for readability I am a computer so that will run and we could also do it without those without so many blank lines on the Mac here I can use command D to delete an entire line and I think on Windows probably ctrl D will do the trick that's a handy shortcut so put blank lines in and you use space generally to make your program readable try to strive always to make your program look beautiful you know and look logical and readable ok so we're going to talk about Auto formatting in the next video and we're going to talk about indentation which is a very important aspect of formatting so until next time happy coding
