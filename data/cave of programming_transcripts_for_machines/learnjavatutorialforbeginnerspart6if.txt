hello this is John from cave of programming Tonkin this is part six of their beginner's Java tutorial and in this tutorial we are going to look at if statements in the last tutorial we saw for loops and in the next tutorial we're going to look at getting user input but before we do that we're going to look at if so go to file new Java project as usual in Eclipse and I'll call this tutorial six next finish let's create a new class as usual by now you will hopefully remember how to do this pretty well I'll call it application and just for kicks I'm going to type the main method out I'm from scratch public static void main string array hogs which might sound like Chinese too or if you are Chinese it might sound like Greek but don't worry about that so if we've already seen one or two examples of conditional statements for example if I type bool boolean boolean what should we call it cond for condition maybe equals 1 less than 6 and then I can do sis out this out control space cons and this will display true when I run it true another possibility would be I could say let's say 3 greater than 8 which is false there's also a not equal to I could say five not equal to two which is of course true we're using that exclamation mark for not symbol here true or let's say five not equal to five which is false and there is of course a test for equality for equals equals three which is false it's really important to note here that a single equal sign means assignment it means you're setting something equal to something to test for equality you need equals equals it's not immediately obvious that the two things are different but if you think about it a bit they are two completely different things assigning equality and testing equality that is let's try five equals equals seven okay great false let's use these conditions in an if statement and if statement looks like this you type if which is the keyword and then you need a condition in round brackets after that and then you have curly brackets which enclose some code that you want to run if the condition is true so for the condition let's try four equals 4 which is true of course this out let's say yes it's true so I will run this code if this condition is true and if it isn't I won't do anything well what I do is I've got to get rid of this of course I use control D to get rid of whole lines which is an D shortcut yes it's true or if I give a condition isn't true let's say 5 not equal to 5 1 equal to 5 then nothing happens now of course I can use variables in there which is sort of the whole point let's say I've got a variable integer maybe int in my int equals 20 let's say I can say if my int is less than 30 which it is then I'll do the print now often I want to take some kind of action and if the condition isn't true I want to take a different action so let's say my in less than 10 okay this is false so at the moment nothing happens because this condition is false so it doesn't do the code but I could put a else statement so I type the keyword else and then I have curly brackets as well notice that Eclipse is automatically adding the second curly bracket when I type the first one and hit return and they are alt here I will type system to out dot println no it no it's false okay no it's false so or if I set this equal to something that is true my int less than 100 then I get the first bit but the else doesn't do anything there is also a else if for example I can say else if and then round brackets and I can put another condition in here so here I could say for example if mind is less than 100 I want to do this else if my int is greater than yes oh here I've got my in less than ten sorry and here I can say if mind is greater than 20 I'll do this so and I'll set my end to 15 and then nothing happens because this is false so it doesn't do this and this else else if condition is also false so it doesn't do this but if I set it to less than 10 this will be true so I'll get this and if I set it to less than to greater than 20 I'll set this equal to 30 then I get this condition what happens if I say else if my int less than 20 and set it equal to 5 now both conditions are true but if I run it as you can see these are kind of mutually exclusive so it's saying if it's less than 10 yes do this forget about everything else and that's the idea behind else if this is an alternative so if one of these if this clause is true and it does this it's not going to do this this only happens if else if this this isn't true and this is I can combine if else if and else of course so I can say else this out none of the above and I can say so this says it's less than 10 let's make this say it's greater than 20 and that this be 15 now this isn't true this isn't true so it will just do this because this is what it does if none of these conditions are true none of the above as usual if this seems complex just have a play around with it and try grating if some else ifs and else's and see what happens and of course usually you probably use this with some kind of importance on all the results of some kind of calculation and in as a sender next tutorial we'll get onto looking at user input for now let me just show you one more thing we've seen while loops before so a while loop could look like this I can say int loop for example equals zero so I have a loop counter which usually you set to zero to start with but doesn't it doesn't have to be while loop is less than 5 let's say do loop this out and I'll write looping plus loop now so this the moment is an infinite loop if I run this it just loops and loops and loops and because loop is always less than 5 so it will always do the loop and I could stop that by incrementing the loop here loop plus plus will add one to the loop as we saw last time he will add one to the loop counter and in this case every time the loop executes so now we have naught 1 2 3 4 but another interesting way of doing it which is sometimes useful is I could say if loop equals 5 then break and the break statement just immediately stops the loop executing so this will just jump out of a loop if I type yeah let's let's types this out here and I'll type running okay so well why isn't this working if loop is equal to five break oh I've got to increment loop right let's put loop plus plus here okay so I'm setting loop equal to zero I'm saying do the loop while loop is less than five but screw that I'm going to just put true and have an infinite loop here and then here I'll say if loop equals five break out of the loop and here I increment the loop so now if I run this you can see what's happening is it's printing looping zero running looping one running and so on till we get to five and then as soon as the loop is equal to five so it still does this but then the if says if loop equals five break and at that point it jumps out of the loop completely jumps out and it doesn't even get to these statements here there's no running down here okay that's it for this tutorial and I hope you'll join me again next time you can find more information and tutorials on cave of programming comm and until then happy coding you
