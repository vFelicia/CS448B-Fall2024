hello in this video we're going to continue looking at format specifiers and I'll show you an answer to the last exercise that we looked at so the exercise was to change this to have nice round pot so we don't want it to say thirty two point seven seven seven we want maybe one or two decimal places there let's let's maybe get rid of this because I don't think we're going to need it these are some examples from the last video of using printf and format specifiers so to change this so that it outputs Celsius to two decimal places the first step is to change this to printf now if you try to do the exercise on the last video and you couldn't do it feel free to pause this video at any moment and then try to do it when you feel you've got enough hints of how to do it okay so I'm changing this to printf and then because I want a new line at the end I'm going to put a backslash n in it although that doesn't make any visible difference here because I've only got one line being output so if I change this to printf you can't tell that it's there's no new line at the end of it because there's only one line anyway but let's put that in in case we output more lines so I'm going to put backslash n at the end and that doesn't look any different so far okay so instead of putting Celsius here instead of concatenating it into the string I'm going to just have one string and I'm going to put percent F in it and then after so then this is one complete argument to printf it's it's one single string because i'm concatenating this string sorry this double value or yeah it's double value i'm concatenating that with this string to make one single string so now I'm going to put a comma in and I'm going to supply a second argument the second argument is going to be the value in Celsius converted value so that's going to be substituted into this percent F here let's run it okay so now it looks how it did originally but the value of doing this is that we can now specify how many decimal places we want so we can say percent let's say point one I just have one decimal place percent point one F and if we run that now it looks a lot nicer in fact it looks like is even rounded up the value it's a thirty two point eight which is great I could also do that with Fahrenheit so I could get rid of this concatenation here and here I could at the start I could put percent yeah let's say point one again percent point one F so now the first format specifier is that the value in Fahrenheit so that's going to be my first argument after this argument so the second argument I'm gonna write far n height and then the third argument is Celsius and it's going to replace this so that they're replacing these these arguments here second and third arguments to this printf method or replacing the format specifiers in order you know so the first first one is Fahrenheit second one is Celsius okay let's run that and well it looks great ninety one point zero degrees Fahrenheit is 32 point eight degrees Celsius hopefully that's correct I'm just wondering whether I should put anything else in this video there are other things I can tell you here we will perhaps leave it there for this video try that out yourself and get it working and see how it looks okay so until next time happy coding
