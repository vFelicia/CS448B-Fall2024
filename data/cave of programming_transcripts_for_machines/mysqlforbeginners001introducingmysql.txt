hello this is John from cave of programming calm welcome to my my sequel course this is a course that takes you right from the absolute basics of my sequel all the way up to pretty advanced so hopefully whether you you are learning this from scratch and you just have some basic computing knowledge or whether you already know some my sequel and you want to improve your knowledge and maybe learn about transactions and store procedures and that sort of thing hopefully this is the course for you so in this introductory video I just want to talk a little bit about what my sequel actually is so my sequel it's technically it's a database management system although we often refer to it as just a database but really it's a database management system and it's is some software that can manage a collection of databases so sequel it is actually it actually stands for structured query language so structured query that's a very unhelpful spellcheck I've got a structured query language and sequel is the language that you use to issue commands to relational databases like my sequel so in the next video we're going to be look at what looking at what you have to download but if I search for my sequel downloads here and let's maybe check this page my sequel community downloads we're going to be installing the my sequel community server and we're also going to be installing something called the my sequel workbench and they're crossplatform I'm using a Mac but fine on Windows or Linux as well so why is it called a community server well a database is is actually a collection of tables so in a database you store data in tables at least this is true in a in a relational database like my sequel so my sequel is this database management system that manages a bunch of different bases each one you can give a name to and you can add tables to it and add data to those tables but the database management system needs some way of allowing you to communicate with it so what happens is it runs there's some software that runs continuously is what we call a server in fact if I look at my installation in my sequel I can see down here somewhere we've got a program called my sequel D and that's a program that's now running continuously on my system and it's a server which means that if I go to a URL let's go to localhost and a default URL is lo is the name and a machine that the server is running on and the port 3306 so via this URL we can communicate with the database if I actually go to it we don't get anything useful in my cases seems to have downloaded something that's because the server's is not producing data in a format that my browser my web browser understands it's it's producing data and accepting data in a format that's understood by what we call clients of my sequel clients that connect to this server which is a database management system so an example of a my sequel Kline would be that PHP myadmin program which you you may be familiar with and we've also got another example of such a program right here it's the my sequel program so in here in my installation in my sequel is a program that's just called my sequel and that's a program that I can use on a commandline if I want to to connect to my running server my running database management system and I can use this program to issue commands to my sequel in a language called sequel structured query language now in this course we're going to be using a client called the my sequel workbench and this is a really nice sort of fully feature tool that as we'll see it also allows you to design databases visually but one thing we can do is we can just connect and then we can see what databases we've got already so I've already created a date a bunch of databases at this point and we can use particular databases and we can see what tables are in those databases don't worry about memorizing these commands because we're going to see them as we go through the course and I can see what I can see what data is in these tables and this command is an example of sequel structured query language and we'll be looking at that in this course so in a nutshell we've got this program which is database management system it manages databases which are collections of tables containing data and it's also a server and the factor is the server allows client programs like the my sequel workbench here to communicate with it and we can then issue commands using sequel structured query language ok so in the next video we'll look at what we have to install to get started with all this stuff my sequel is a great database to learn you can install it even on a you know a small old laptop it will run pretty well usually it's so it's relatively lightweight you can store like huge amounts of data in it as long as you've got disk space and enough memory to cope with all this software which most computers will have and because it's free because the Community Edition is free it's not restricted in any way and it's very powerful because of that probably in the majority of websites in the world to use my sequel to store their data like it's something like a utility company or a bank is going to stump up a lot of hard cash for probably for Oracle and also for like life support with Oracle so something that's got to be ultra secure may not use my sequel but then again there's no reason probably why it couldn't it's just a matter of maybe getting some support with I recall that Oracle is just the established kind of big database in the field but my sequel is used for all kinds of things you know all kinds of needs for online applications if you want to make a social network or you know you want to just have a like a WordPress website or something that just stores data my sequel is that is a really good choice of database very very widely used okay so I'll shut up and we'll get on in the next video to actually installing some software here so until next time happy coding
