hello in this video we're going to look at various different ways of incrementing and decrementing variables so we've seen that in our video on while loops uh that we had to increment a variable and that's such an important thing to do and there are various ways to do it so we're going to look at some of them here and that's going to sort of although it might not seem very important now we're going to find that this is going to be quite enlightening as we progress through the course so let's start off with a variable here i'm going to make to type int and i'm going to let's call it just count and set it equal to zero so what we did to incr increment our variable for our while loop was we wrote this something like this count plus count sorry count equals count plus one and we've already gone over that so i won't go over it again um and then if we output it then okay it started at zero and so it's going to be one now and if we just run that then we can see the value one in the console of course if i started it at something else like 11 and i increment it it will be 12 so there's no great mysteries there nothing special about zero here now there are various other ways we can do that so um one way is we can um we can use the same operator that we previously used with strings plus equals so i could say here let's increment it further so i could say here count plus equals one and then we'll output it so what we're doing here is um we start off with count at zero and then we're adding one to it by the most basic kind of simple method we're outputting it and then we're adding one to it by another method and outputting it again so we expect to see one and two in the console now what this does is plus equals is exactly equivalent to count equals count plus one it's equivalent to that it's like a sort of synonym for it the plus equals operator takes the existing value of a variable and adds something to it or it kind of looks like it does that at least with with strings with strings you use it to concatenate more text to an existing string basically and in fact with strings what you're really doing is creating completely new string and create and assigning the original string reference to refer to a new string but that's not important we'll leave that aside for now but i just wanted to mention that um so yeah we're taking count and we're adding one to its existing value using plus equals and we'll just run that let's run it so uh we've got one and two uh coming out in the console there so let's increment it by yet another uh way of incrementing variables let's do count plus plus semicolon so this is um is the well it's the increment operator um it's uh yeah there's there's some subtleties to this but i'm going to leave them aside just for this minute let's just output this already so that does it in this case it does the same thing as these other statements that we've got it's just going to increase the value of count by one so now with with these statements here you don't have to increase the value of count by one you could increase it by anything you like we're just specifying one here as it happens in this case it specifically increases the values of integers by one so you can't use it to increase them by 10 or something is is going to be one so what we expect now is to see that after we've done that and we if we print it out again its value will now at this point in a program it will be three so if we run this we see it's three so we've got one two three another thing we can do is this plus plus count and don't forget the semicolon of course as usual and if we output that this does almost the same thing as this so if we run it indeed it's increased the value of count to four now this is called the postfix version of this operator postfix meaning after you know it's kind of fixed on after the variable this is the prefix version prefix meaning well a prefix you know it's fixed in place before the variable uh there is a difference between the this and this but we won't look at it in this video um we'll talk about it in another video so we see here that there are four different ways um that spring to my mind at least that we could increase or increment the value of this of a variable of an integer variable first way is this count equals count plus one we can also do count plus equals one or count plus equals whatever other number we want and then we can use a postfix increment operator count plus plus or we could use a prefix increment operator plus plus count um so i would suggest trying those out but actually before you do that let's look at decrementing the variable as well so i can do the same thing in reverse for every increment operator there's a kind of well for every way of incrementing this there's also a way of decrementing it so if i say count equals count minus one that's going to that's going to take the value of count subtract one from that value and at the moment we're then holding that new value temporarily in memory and then assign that new value to the original variable so this has the effect of subtracting one from the value of calm i'm giving you explanations here but that is to try to hopefully you'll understand bits of my explanations at least but the real learning will take place when you type this out and try it and even experiment with it so if we now run this then we get one two three four and then we decremented it and we've got down to three again we can also decrement using this kind of a technique so instead of plus equals we can do minus equals let's do count minus equals one and sis out let's run this so now it's down to two uh so this this is precisely equivalent to this let's just format that to get rid of that blank line well that doesn't work oh yeah it does okay so this and this mean exactly the same thing we can also do count negative negative or count minus minus so that's the postfix decrement operator and that works just fine so if we run this now it's down to one and finally we can do a prefix decrement operator we could do this count minus minus count we could have used any of these methods in our for loop in our while loop sorry uh well any of the methods that increment it at least so let's run this and we get finally we get down to zero which is what it was to start with and to make that clearer actually after i initially uh assign a value zero to count let's put an initial sis out in there so it starts off at zero we increment it one two three four and then we're decrementing it by various methods three two one zero now what i'd suggest is that you type all of these yourself um either one after the other or just try them just create a program increment a variable in it like this run it check that it works and then change that to this so get this to work once you've tried them all out try to write this program from memory that is start with a variable that has some value for example zero and then increment it by each of the four different methods and then outputting it every time afterwards and then decrement it by each of the four methods outputting it every time if you can be bothered to do that that will help fix all these different operators in your mind and then uh you'll you'll feel more confident when we actually start using them so in other words try to replicate this program from memory but i probably suggest unless you're feeling confident that you try each of them out individually before you try to do it all without referring back to this code have a go at it and see how far you get okay so until next time happy coding
