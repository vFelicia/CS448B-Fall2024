hello this is John from cave of programming comm and this is another video in my series on JavaScript and node.js for beginners in this video we're going to take a look at the identity test operator then in the next video we'll talk a little bit about the Jarvis about the history of JavaScript and following that we're going to get into actually using these for some basic nuts and bolts programming that is using the kind of equality test operators that we've been looking at so as always I'm going to start with writing you strict doesn't matter if I use single or double quotes and that forces me to declare variables and that's how they're very well called days which are set equal to seven and alright console.log and seven equals equals seven let's write days equals equals seven so of course this this will give us true actually I'm going to use a terminal here that's built into visual studio code because that's probably easier than switching to another external Basch terminal all the time if I go to the View menu here and terminal I can open a terminal okay so if I write node and a name of my file this gives me true now there's also a equals equals equals operator let's first actually put this in double quotes just so that I can keep track of what I'm doing here we're just sort of a comment so there's also a version of this operator that has three equal signs and we can we can call that the identity test operator and in this case it it does the same thing it gives us true in this particular case now the difference is that equals equals we'll do all kinds of tight conversions to try to ensure that you get what it thinks you want whereas equals equals equals is a stricter kind of operator is it tests not only equality of also type you could think of it as an identity test operator it won't do any conversions so you see the difference if you put the seven let's say in quotes so if I put a number in quotes it becomes texts now equals equals will actually convert this text to two the number that it it seems to represent helpfully does this conversion for me and it will give true here let's try it so you can see true the identity test operator with three equal signs gives me false because it doesn't do any conversion so it says is days which is a number equal to 7 is that equal is that equivalent or identical to the text seven and the answer's no because okay they might both represent the number seven in one way or another but the fact is this is text and this isn't this is referring to a number so they're different things so this is the Equality test operator and this is the identity test operator and the identity test operator it will not helpfully convert one thing to another to try to get at your meaning or to put it another way it will test both where the two two values are equal and also whether they have the same type and if they don't have the same type it's going to tell you false so it's a stricter operator there's also a not version of this so if I were to write not here and also so not equal here and here we've got not identical and let's just change these comments here what are these going to give me what about this one will this return true or false well is is days which is the number seven is it is it not equal to the text seven that danced the question and in this case I would say well that's false they are equal okay one's texts and ones are number but this single this single equals version of the Equality test we won't worry about that it will convert them it will convert one thing to another so it's as if we're doing seven not equal to seven and that's that's false because 7 is equal to 7 whereas this will give us true 7 not identical to the text 7 that's true they aren't identical let's just prove that that is the case and I'm not lying to you so first one is false 7 is not equal to the text 7 is false because they are equal and second one is true so of course these these two are just flipping what these two are doing so here we get true and false and here we get false and true all right so if you're happy with that then do feel free to move on to the next video if it's puzzling though then please do try this out especially if you're a big if you are literally a complete beginning with this try out for yourself and try to get your head around what's going on here it's a really good idea and in the next video I'm gonna talk a little bit about some relevant history here which might help explain why we have two different operators for testing what seems like equality okay so until next time happy coding
