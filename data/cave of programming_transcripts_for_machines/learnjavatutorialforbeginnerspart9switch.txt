hello this is John from cave of programming calm this is tutorial number 9 in our series of beginners Java tutorials and in this tutorial we're gonna look at the switch keyword in Java switch allows you to take different actions depending on the value of a variable a bit like if except that switch is more efficient under some circumstances now switch perhaps isn't used all that much by some professional developers including myself but it's it's certainly something that you'll get quizzed about on courses and tests and it's a handy thing to know about so let's say I'm going to create a scanner object here so I can read user input and I'll say scanner input equals new scanner system dot in and an eclipse or press ctrl shift o to add the java.util.scanner importer and then I'm gonna get a value now you can only use switch to check certain types of variables and the most common to that you'll check are probably int and string so let's try a string here I'll say string text equals input tart get line so we're getting some text on the user and I'm also going to sorry not get line but next line and I'm also going to put a prompt here this out control space please enter some text actually let's say please enter a command because I'm going to pretend that I'm operating some kind of machine here via text commands so here I've got my text that the user has entered and I'm gonna say switch brackets text excuse me and so let's say text has the value start the user type start I want to take some action execute some code and if they type stop I want to execute other code and if they type you know runs mother code and so on and I can use a switch to do exactly that so I'll say case and then I have to say the thing that I want to check against text so let's say case start and then some code that you want to execute for example our same machine started and then underneath that you need a break keyword so for every value of text that you want to check you need a case statement starting with the case keyword the value that you want to particularly check the variable for and a colon and underneath that you type some lines of code that you want to execute if your variable happens to have this value an any half break so let's have another one you could have as many as many of these as you like I'll just put in two I think stop sucess out machine stopped okay don't forget the break and then you can also have a default case which is optional but if I say default this is the code that will get executed if none of these alternatives are matched and you can have as I say as many as you like yet it can be 10 or 20 or whatever so I'll say here commands not Rick cog nice recognized and the default bit has to go to the bottom and I'm going to press ctrl shift F here for format which will just reform up my code slightly in Eclipse I don't know what happened there okay and now yeah windows thank you thanks Bill Gates and now I'm going to just I'm gonna just run this this is a complete program so I'll click the green runbutton and we will see it will say in a minute please enter a command here we go if I enter something like some rubbish like this it's gonna say command not recognized because this is what it does if none of these are matched but if I run it again and I type start for example machine started or of course stop machine stopped now as I say you can only switch on certain kinds of variables and in turn in and string or the most common two that you will use here anything else or most most other things you would want to use like an if statement and the other thing to note is that these must be constants you can't have case case blocks that's try to check a variable here you're the only variable can be this variable here and these must be constant values strings or integers or whatever okay well that's the switch statement covered have fun with that and in the next tutorial we're gonna start looking at classes and objects if you've been following this series of tutorials we've covered all the really basic building blocks of Java programs now and you can already write pretty complex programs and we're going to get on some slightly more advanced concepts in the next tutorial which will be number 10 so I hope you'll join me then and you can find this code on cave or programming comm and until next time happy you
