hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this video we're going to take a look at ifelse in JavaScript so I'm continuing here my series of videos for complete beginners on JavaScript and nodejs and in the last video we looked at if statements we looked at this so I would suggest typing this out and getting it working before you tackle this video and we saw that we saw that with an if statement it will execute code conditionally so this if statement will only run what's in these curly brackets if this condition is true and the same for this one of course so what we've done here is created something which will say activating Heating if the temperature supplied on the command line is less than 20 and it will say deactivating heating if the temperature is greater than 21 otherwise you'll do nothing at all now we can combine these into a single statement because the fact is that it's not very efficient to have two separate checks like this on temperature because if if the temperature is less than 20 then if if this is true there's no need to then check if it's over 21 if it's less than 20 it can't be over 21 and yet here we are we're checking it again so we do this check and we find it's less than 20 so we run this when we say activating heating and then we're checking it again is it is it over 21 but it can't be so we can combine this into a more efficient statement before the second if we write else so we have else if and we move move this up to get rid of the blank space here and now we've got a single if else if statement and the way this works is if elseif is going to execute one of its alternatives and only one but it doesn't bother doing all necessary checking so now if we find that the temperature is less than 20 it won't bother checking this because there is no point if elseif will only execute one of these two alternatives if if either of them at all and it's a question of which one so this works kind of like the program that we had before except it's very slightly more efficient if I type something above 21 it says deactivating eating and if I type something below 20 it says activating eating and if I type something in the middle like twenty point five it just doesn't do anything at all it just finishes all right now that we can make this even a bit more complicated because I could write on the end else let's put it in the right place though else and this is something that will be executed if none of the alternatives above were executed so that's right console dot log temperature is normal so if if none of the conditions above it are executed in a sort of compound ifelsif statement like this else will be executed that means that in this statement we're always going to execute one of these three alternatives the question is only which one so any job JavaScript's gonna start reading this from the top down so the first one that it finds that matches is going to execute that one and only that one and if it goes all the way down and gets to the else and finds that none of the above conditions have been executed then it will execute the else so now the difference says if I type in twenty point five which doesn't trigger either of these two conditions then it says temperature is normal if I put if I were to put 19 let's say activating heating and 30 will be deactivating eating you can have multiple elsif clauses in here so I could put another elseif in here and I could say if temperature is greater than 30 let's say room is overheating danger this may be put 35 that's really quite hot at least where I come from so any works as you'd expect so if I put 30 in that triggers only deactivating heating if I put like 40 in there that's going to say yeah well now we've got a problem because if I put 40 in there then and this is going to get executed first so we JavaScript will read this down from the top and it comes to here and it says okay you put 40 in so this condition is true the temperature is greater than 21 and it runs this and then it won't run any of the others because with this if elseif statement you're only going to be out you're going to be you're only going to be running one of these clauses only one of them so in this in this case I can never actually execute this but supposing I move that up so I'm going to hold down the option key and use the arrow to move it up I've got to pay attention to formatting here now I can run any of these different clauses so now if I run if I run the program with the temperature of 40 it's going to say room is overheating danger if I run it with the temperature of let's say 30 it just says deactivating heating so hopefully you can see why why that works and why it didn't work when I put 35 down where 21 is because it's going to read from the top it's going to say is this true it's only going you have to remember it's only going to do one of these things is this true and if not it will take a look at this is if is is true and if not it will do this as soon as it finds one that's true it will execute it and if none of them are true it's going to execute this so if we were to put in here like what's the normal temperature now according to this twenty point five that says temperature is normal okay so if you're a beginner definitely try this out this this works the same in a whole bunch of programming languages it's the same in Java C C++ a whole bunch of others that I can't even really remember but it's it's a really common sort of construction and yeah so try it out for yourself and experiment with it a little bit and then we're going to move on soon to looking at loops and in this in this bit of the course we're just really looking at the absolute most important nuts and bolts of programming which are by the way generally either the same or extremely similar in a whole variety of different programming languages there are some languages that they do have this if elseif type of idea but they just have slight spelling variations in there like in Perl if I remember rightly Perl practical extraction and report language you would write Elif there instead of else if so you get minor variations like that but generally even programming languages that don't use the exact same spelling for all the keywords they have a lot of these constructions in common and you will you will usually find in a programming language some way of doing this if else if else type of construction all right so until next time happy coding
