hello in this video we're going to talk a little bit about how Java works and once again don't stress there's no need to really memorize this but you'll you will gradually become familiar with these ideas I think as you continue to use Java so I've already said that Java is a compiled programming language we take text files written in the Java language we turn them into binary files and that's called compilation we combine them together if there's multiple files this is called building and then we run them on a computer as a computer program but actually it's a little bit even more interesting than that because Java does something rather interesting that many programming languages don't exactly do and that is this is thing called the Java runtime environment or JRE and what this does this is it's some software that creates effectively kind of like a simulated computer on your computer and your Java program runs on that simulated computer now I'm simplifying a bit various optimizations mean that Java doesn't precisely run like that bits of Java code run kind of almost directly on your computer but basically to simplify a bit it's as though your Java programs are running on a simulated virtual computer which runs on your computer and that simulated computer is created by the JRE the Java runtime environment now the advantage of this is that Java is a compiled once run anywhere programming language so with some computer languages like C++ you compile your your source code the code that you've actually written and then it will only run on one particular type of computer if you want to run it on a different type of computer you have to recompile it and maybe you even have to change it a bit to run on a different type of computer the idea behind Java is that you compile it once and that will run on any kind of computer that's running a java runtime environment so the java runtime environment gives the java program a kind of consistent environment to run in regardless at the underlying type of computer this is a very clever idea so if you want to run a java computer a java program on your computer then you need to have a JRE installed we will need to specifically install this because later on we're going to install a Java development kit the Java development kit includes a JRE a Java runtime environment so you can run programs once it's once this is installed but also if it allows you to develop Java programs yourself and all of these things are free completely free so we're going to move on to be to install a Java development kit among other things because we'll also need something to write our java code in okay that's it for this video until next time happy coding
