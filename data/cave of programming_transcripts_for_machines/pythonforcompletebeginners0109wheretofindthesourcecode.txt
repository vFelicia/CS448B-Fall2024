in this video we're going to look at where you can find the source code for this course since building the course I've reorganized the source code neatly into folders and subfolders so you should be able to easily find any source code from the course that you're looking for so go to github.com Cave of programming you click my repositories tab you can see that there is this python course link and that's the one that you want the direct URL is github.com Cave of programming slash python course so you can just go there directly if you want as you can see the source code is organized into course sections and within any particular section there are a bunch of folders containing the source code for all the different lectures for that course so it's probably easiest and most convenient just to look at the source code in here but you can also download it if you want there's a Code button here and you can download as a zip or if you install the git program you can clone it with Git clone and this URL now I don't particularly recommend trying to download this code and running it because you just don't gain anything by doing that anything you want to learn it's really important to type it yourself but nevertheless while you are typing code yourself you might want to check out the source code without having to refer back to the video and so you can find it all here I think it's mainly useful for that purpose if you do download it and run it sometimes you'll need to move data files into the right folder or install modules and to be honest you just won't gain much from that I strongly recommend watching the videos and then trying to type the code yourself experimenting with it a little bit doing any exercises I give you the most important thing is to practice this is a free video from my course Python and machine learning for complete beginners I'm releasing the first couple of chapters of this course completely for free on YouTube to get you started with python I plan to upload new videos here to YouTube every Monday and every Thursday for at least a couple of months if you're interested in the complete course which teaches you python from scratch and eventually progresses to things like creating graphical user interfaces and using neural networks principal component analysis cluster analysis all that stuff and much more besides then you can find a link in the description or just go to this URL on the screen right here if you finish the whole course you'll be able to write all kinds of general purpose programs in Python and use Python to do machine learning and artificial intelligence as well thank you for watching until next time happy coding
