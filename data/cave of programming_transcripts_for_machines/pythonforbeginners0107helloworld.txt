now we can write our very first Python program so in visual code let's create a new file I can do that from the file new text file menu or I can expand my folder here and click this either way we need to call it something with a py extension I'm going to call this hello.py so hello.py now I'm going to make sure there's no Extra Space on the left here and I'm going to type print round brackets so a pair of round brackets and open a close bracket and inside those round brackets I'm going to put a pair of speech marks notice Visual Studio code is actually putting the closing pairs in for me and between these speech marks I'm going to type hello world or whatever text I like then I'm going to save this with file save or maybe control s on Windows command s Mac whatever you prefer now I need a terminal to run this it is actually possible to run it within Visual Studio code there's a run button here but I'm not going to normally be using this you can see it did run actually it does say hello world here but what I'm going to do instead normally is I'm going to go to a terminal so I can use either the console on my system or I can open a terminal from the terminal menu in Visual Studio code but either way what I really need to do is make sure I've got Powershell activated if I'm going to use that so I'll type pwsh and above all make sure the python environment is activated so we run this with the right version of python so I'm going to type here/ fm/ bin SL activate press the Tab Key to auto complete and P S1 for the Powershell activate script for the virtual environment so since this is a Unix type system I can type clear now to clear the screen that might not work on Windows CLS might work but you don't really need to do that now I'm going to type python let's maybe just get rid of this sidebar just by clicking the icon up there python and a space and then the name of the file I created so hello.py and I click return and it says hello world so a couple of points about this firstly space does matter in Python so you can't have Extra Spaces here it's not going to work if you have space there you can have space above it if you want that still works just fine with the up Arrow here I can actually bring back that command and run it again and when I type something that comes in purs like a round bracket or a curly bracket or a square bracket or speech marks or single quote marks I'm usually going to type the per before I type anything else so notice I type the open and the close round bracket then I went back and filled in the open and close speech mark and then I went and put the text in the middle of the speech marks the reason for this is that there are a lot of pairs of things in computer program not as much in python as in many other languages but you still get a lot of them and I think generally it's better to type a full pair of anything so you know you definitely got the closing bracket or the closing speech mark or whatever before you fill in whatever goes in the middle of them so try that out for yourself to get a Hello World program working is a huge achievement and honestly it's all downhill from here in a good way well that might be a slight exaggeration we're going to look at some tricky things but if you can do this you can do anything I think in the world of coding this is a free video from my course Python and machine learning for complete beginners I'm releasing the first couple of chapters of this course completely for free on YouTube to get you started with python I plan to upload new videos here to YouTube every Monday and every Thursday for at least a couple of months if you're interested in the complete course which teaches you python from scratch and eventually progresses to things like creating graphical user interfaces and using neural networks principal component analysis cluster analysis all that stuff and much more besides then you can find a link in the description or just go to this URL on the screen right here if you finish the whole course you'll be able to write all kinds of general purpose programs in Python and use Python to do machine learning and artificial intelligence as well thank you for watching until next time happy coding
