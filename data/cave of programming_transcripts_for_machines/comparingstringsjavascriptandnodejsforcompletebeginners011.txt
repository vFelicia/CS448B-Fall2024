hello in this video we're going to talk about basic string comparison in JavaScript so let's write use strict here and I'll have a string that's right text equals cat so we can check if two strings are equal with equals equals so let's write console dot log and text equals equals cat so these these two strings are equal so this equality test operator here should return true let's maybe put this in a kind of a comment which I start put this text so that we know what we've done here then if I run this so node and comparing strings to Jess we see that this indicates that the two strings are the same by returning true or by evaluating to true we can also use the slightly longer version of this operator so this that's the equality test operator this is the identity test operator what's the difference well we'll look at that in the next video but in a nutshell basically you probably some people think that you shouldn't use this short version it's kind of an older feature of JavaScript here this equals equals and some people call it the evil twin of the identity test operator so if in doubt use the longer versions so if you run this now again that says there they're the same it returns true we've got not equals as well so we've got and that also works with strings just as you'd expect so is it true that this test which contains the word cat is not equal to cat as that's going to be false in in all of these cases not equal and it's false that it's not equal it's false that it's not identical it is identical it is equal now surprisingly we can also use less than or equal to whist with strings so we can write texts for example this variable text less than dog is that true or is it false let's maybe just put this in a comment as well not exactly a comment but just some text to remind us of what we're doing here well this is actually going to evaluate to true because it just checks the alphabetical ordering of the strings involved so cat sorts earlier in the alphabet in the alphabet and dog because it begins with a C so if you think about the ordering of it it's true that cat is less than dog so if I run this now it's not a comment on cats or dogs but it says true cat is is less than dog in the alphabetical sense so of course you can use greater than you can use greater than or equal to with strings as well let's just check that so I could write text greater than or equal to dog is it true or is it false well cat is it's sort so earlier in the alphabet then dog so that's going to be false what else I think I think that's probably it's less than greater than notice that they're less than a greater than are are sort of case sensitive so here we've got yeah let's let's try comparing cat with cat with a capital C or dog maybe that's right dog with a capital D and I'll just replace the text in this string here as well so is this true or false that dog is greater than or equal to dog is false I think because in the character set that we're using here unicode character set capital letters are actually ordered earlier than lowercase letters so I think this is false let's just try it yeah false so dog is not greater than or equal to dog with a lowercase D all right that's it for this video and there are other ways to compare strings as well but most of the time these operators will will do the trick for you so until next time oh yeah if you're a beginner the important thing is I'll just say it again you've got to just try this out for yourself try them all out and make sure you understand them and pretty soon we're going to get onto practically using them with loops and conditionals these are we're still working at the moment with the absolute nuts and bolts the real building blocks of programming languages so until next time happy coding
