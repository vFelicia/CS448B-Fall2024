in this video we're going to look at a possible solution to the exercise I gave you last time hopefully there were at least some bits of this that you could figure out how to do if you are going to follow the exercises in this course if you didn't manage to do all of it don't worry about it okay so first we need to get the temperature and we've already seen how to ask the user to enter a number with age for example so let's try to do this temperature we we need a very equals input and enter the fridge temperature so we've already seen this maybe you've already practiced this a bit so I'm not going to run the program just yet so I'm confident this will work now let's say if the temperature is less than Z colon and then with an indent print fridge is too cold okay that's the first bit right now what do you think will that actually work no it doesn't work why not well let's try it so Python and fridge solution. Pi enter the fridge temperature well this bit seems okay five and we get a trace B the problem is on line 16 and we're trying to compare a string with an INT right so the temperature that we've got here is a string because it came back from this input function we need to convert it to a int or a float now we could do that right here but we're going to be using temperature over and over again so here's something else that we could do we can say temperature equals so let's say that this is going to be a float because if you've got an INT if the user enters an INT like five that can be cast to a float it can be interpreted as 5.0 but if the user enters a float and you try to cast that to an INT like they enter 5.5 how are you going to interpret that as an in so let's take the most General option and use the float function to cast this to a float so what am I actually doing here I'm taking temperature I'm passing it to the float function that returns a floating point value an actual numerical value and then I'm assigning that back to this temperature variable you could have also use a different variable here if you want here I'm just reusing the same variable so here I'm assigning to the variable a string and here I'm assigning to the variable a floating point value this might not look legitimate to you but it totally is we can pass temperature to this float function and then store the return value of that back in temperature or maybe it's better to say technically I can make temperature refer to this new numerical value you could have also instead just put float here that would be maybe more in keep with with what we've already done if you do this then you don't need that but we are going to end up in that case doing this over and over again and this bit here well this is like the if statements we've previously seen it's just that remember here we need a condition that evaluates to either true or false and for that condition I've used the less than binary operator to compare temperature with the value zero so let's see if this works now enter the fridge temperature five okay it doesn't print anything and that's what I expect now let's try it again enter the fridge temperature minus 4 Fridge is too cold so so far it works now if you did attempt the exercise and you couldn't figure it out then you might want to consider pausing the video at this point and seeing if you can now complete the rest of this program we're going to carry on and take a look at the rest of it now so if the temperature is 0 to 4 print fridge okay so we want L if now L if temperature now we already know that the temperature is not less than zero if it was less than zero this would have run and then we won't get to this bit so the temperature is not less than zero all we have to do is check is it less than four and then we can say print fridge okay then we want to see if the temperature is between four and six now we already know if we get down here that the temperature is not less than four so let's say l if temperature is less than six print fridge too warm now the temperature could be four which is probably the ideal temperature for a fridge actually and this would actually execute let's just try it and prove it so if I run it and I say the temperature is four it says fridge too warm so you could of course you could alter the actual temperature cut off points here and we could also say less than or equal to four if we want and then if I enter four it's going to say fridge okay now what else okay if the temperature is greater than six print fridge broken well if we get to this point down here in this sort of compound if statement we know that the temperature can't be less than six it must be at least six so we might as well just say else here and say print fridge is broken let's see if this works so I want to test all these different options yeah and I forgot the colon don't forget the colon all right let's try it enter the fridge temperature minus 4 Fridge is too cold let's try zero fridge is okay because it only says fridge is too cold if the temperature is less than zero so 0 to 4 I want Frid okay so that's correct let's try four still fridge okay now let's try five fridge too warm what about six fridge is broken now and it's going to be the same for higher temperatures like 110 or whatever so this is working now I think whether you found this really complicated or not it's probably going to depend on how much you practice the stuff you've seen so far and it probably depends a little bit on aptitude some people think in these kind of very rigid logical terms that you have to think in to an extent as a programmer more easily than others but do not be discouraged if you didn't manage to do this it was a little bit tricky and there are multiple different ways that you could do it as well if you got it working by any means then give yourself a pat on the back I think and if you didn't get it working the thing to do now is type this out try it out for yourself and then try experimenting with it see if you can alter it maybe to add in some different temperature ranges or something and then see if it works as you expect when you alter it so you just need to play around with this a little bit if you didn't manage to get this so far if you can get to the point where you can write this code without looking at it then that's a really great point to be at I don't say it's absolutely necessary to continue with the course but if you want some way some concrete way of gauging your progress so far if you can get to the point where you can write this program without referring back to the code and just by looking at the specification here then I think you're doing an extremely good job hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desk top programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
