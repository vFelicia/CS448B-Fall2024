hello this is John from cave of programming comm and this is another video in my series on JavaScript and no js' for complete beginners so in this video we're going to take a look at the if statement if you've done any programming before this will be probably too simple for you and if you are a complete beginner this is for you so if if you have done some programming before you probably want to skip ahead in this course a little bit maybe to the bit where we start discussing objects and classes or I'll see how the course goes so I haven't created those videos yet at this point in time but by the time you watch this I may have okay so I've got a crater the file here called conditioned stock j/s and I'm going to just write you strict here semicolon you may have noticed if you've been following this course that often in JavaScript it will work just fine without the semicolons but I feel it's good practice to put them in occasionally they are absolutely needed and other times JavaScript will just kind of automatically kind of put them in behind the scenes so it will just infer that you meant a semicolon semicolons are used to end statements basically it's the the kind of program it programming equivalent and a full stop or a period as you say in the USA but because JavaScript was used for such a long time in browsers it's kind of got this free and easy thing whereby it will try to correct your mistakes to a certain extent okay so let's get a commandline argument and we'll say that that's going to be a temperature so let's right let temperature so I'm declaring a variable and I'm going to assign it the value of process to arg v2 which if you've been following this course you might remember it's how we get the first thing that someone types after the name of the program when they run it so in other words it's the first commandline argument and then now well let's actually use echo that bad just to see it so let's print it so if I run no two conditions Jas it says undefined but what I can do is after the name of the script I can write for example 21 and then it's going to echo that back to me now console dot log is is printing why I just typed so supposing we've got some sort of heating system and we want to take some kind of action if the temperature is let's say below 20 so we imagine that while I'm typing here is a temperature in Celsius and if it's 20 if it's below 20 it's too cold and I want to turn the heating on I can do that with an if statement and if statement looks like this so I'm going to write the keyword if then I'm going to have to round brackets and I'm going to have two curly brackets and notice I've put the opening curly bracket on the same line as the if and around brackets and then the closing curly bracket goes on a line further down and it's kind of aligned with the if they sort of line up I'm following the most common coding convention in JavaScript here there are others like some people put this bracket down here but that's that's less common I believe at the moment now in JavaScript so I'm going to follow the most common formatting for this and it is important to follow a convention for your code formatting is very important now in these round brackets I can put a condition so for example temperature less than 20 and I can put code in these curly brackets which will only be executed if this condition is true so let's just output some text there with console dot log and I'm going to print activating Heating so if I run this now if I put 21 there on the command line it's not going to do anything if I put 20 it's still not going to do anything because I've said do this only if temperature is less than 20 so 20 is not less than 20 it's equal to 20 let's run it with for example nineteen point five and now it says activating heating so this is an if statement it's hopefully it's fairly clear what it does it will it will run the code in curly brackets only if this condition in around brackets after the if keyword only if that's true we could put another one in there let's just copy that and put another one in and we can say if temperature is greater than 21 let's say deactivating heating so now if I run this with let's say something less than 20 it's going to say activating eating 420 it does nothing 21 it does nothing but if I type in some value above 21 like 21 point two it says deactivating eating so now it's too hot and switching eating off so this is these are just a very couple of very simple if statements and if you haven't seen these before it's really important to practice them in the next video we'll look at more complicated versions of these if statements and we'll leave it there for for this video do try it out if you're a beginner especially and until next time happy coding
