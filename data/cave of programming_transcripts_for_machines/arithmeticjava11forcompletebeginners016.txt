hello in this video we're going to take a look at arithmetic in Java so we're gradually beginning to get towards writing something that really looks like a computer program and might actually be useful so let's let's delete this this is a copy of the program I was working on in the last video and we've got in arithmetic obviously we've got well four operators that are very commonly used we've got we've got plus plus operator these are called binary operators because they work on two values together you know like three plus four there's two values so it's a binary operator and in the general name for these things is they're called operators we've also got divided and in Java this symbol for divide is a slash like that you have to get the right kind of slash if you're going from left to right it's you'd have to go up up a hill if you imagine sort of I'm gesturing with my fingers which of course you can't see but it's like a hill sloping upwards from left to right we've also got multiply and in Java that's an asterisk and in fact these conventions are common in very many programming languages and we have subtract subtract which is the normal sign it expect it's a short dash like that let's try these out a little bit so we'll have some variables in fact you can't just use sis outs maybe we should also just do that to start with and then we'll take a bit more of an extended look at this in the next video I think so if I write system dot out dot print line seven plus three we expect to see 10 and of course we do see 10 there we go we'll try some try some other things we'll try all of them so if we try 9/3 we should see three so we try this so we say it says three here's a surprise if we do let's say ten divided by three we run this we still get three why is that well if you divide one integer by another integer the remainder will be discarded so you won't you won't get back a floatingpoint value you'll still get back an integer value so for example 5 divided by 2 would be 2 because we're just discarding the remainder of 1 if you divide an integer by an integer then the result will also be an integer but you can use floating point values so if I divide 10 point zero by let's say well let's say 3.0 then we'll get the answer that you might expect 3 point 3 3 3 recurring so you can see that with floating point values it works and you'll get a floating point answer even if only one of your values is floating point so for example if we divide let's say let's try dividing nine by four point naught let's try that so if we do that we should get yeah we get two point two five two and a quarter so that that works because one of the values is floating point one floating point value gives floating point result now what I've just done what I'm actually doing here which actually I should have mentioned and I think I've maybe touched on it briefly I have but if you write two forward slashes like this everything else that you write on that line is a comment it's very useful to write comments in your code but it's better to use them to describe kind of what you what you're intending to do overall or what you've done overall there's not much point putting a comment saying output 10/3 because you should learn that you should learn that you should learn to understand that just from seeing this code and also if you write a comment and then you change the code and you don't change the comment you can seriously mislead yourself so comments are important but generally better saved for blocks of code where otherwise it wouldn't be clear what the intention of it is for that sort of thing we'll take another look at this at least in a video shortly actually okay let's carry on with this so if I write this out let's try so we've got we've got plus we got divided and let's try multiply so three times four we expect out to be twelve there we go it works and of course subtraction so let's let's do 3 minus 4 because that should give us minus 1 and if we actually run this we see that indeed we get minus 1 so try all of those out for yourself and put some comments in as well just to kind of describe what you're doing although they may be a bit overly precise unnecessary at the moment it's good to get into the habit of using comments a little bit try them all out and don't forget to try into integer division like this one and assure yourself that it doesn't it discards the remainder it doesn't work quite as you might otherwise expect okay and try floating point division as well you can try all of these with floating points and integers if you can be bothered okay so until next time happy coding
