hello in this video we're going to take a look at a worked example of converting temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit so generally these days in the UK we use Celsius to measure temperature so we consider room temperature to be about 21 whereas in the USA as far as I know Fahrenheit is used and well what we're going to do is convert Fahrenheit to Celsius so I would suggest pausing the video at this point and having a go at it yourself if you go to Google and you type something like convert Fahrenheit to Celsius then you can find a formula for how to do it so what this is telling us is that you take the temperature in Fahrenheit subtract 32 from it then you've got to take that and multiply it by five divided by nine but don't forget that you can't divide one integer by another in Java or rather you can but it discards the remainder so you want to use doubles there okay so pause the video and have a go at yourself if you find yourself sort of struggling a bit that's actually good you know is obviously it's great if you can just write the program but if it takes you a little while you have to think about it that's good because all the while you're looking at this program and typing stuff and trying to get it to work you're learning so okay pause the video now all right so hopefully you had a go at that let's see how to do this so zoom out here and then here the first thing to do is we'll declare our temperature in Fahrenheit so double fahren height and let's set it to some temperature to start with so let's say we want to convert 91 Fahrenheit to a temperature in Celsius I don't know what that is feeling it's quite hot we'll see let's also have a variable for storing Celsius so let's say double Celsius and what Celsius going to be assigned what value will we assign it well we're going to take the temperature in Fahrenheit and we're going to subtract 32 from it now in order to make sure that we do the calculations in a right order here let's put that in round brackets because that's that's the first thing we want to do we want to take temperature in Fahrenheit subtract 32 and then we're going to work with that the next thing we want to do is we want want to multiply that by 5 divided by 9 so let's do that let's multiply it so that's an asterisk by and we can't say 5 divided by 9 that would be integer division it would discard the remainder so in this case that will give us 0 but we can say 5 point naught divided by 9 or we can also say 5 point naught divided by 9 point naught or 5/9 point or as long as there's a double in there we get double division that should do the trick so now we can type this out and let's write temperature well actually let's write the whole thing out let's say far n height and I'm going to add to that some text concatenate some text Fahrenheit let's say so this is going to say that that's going to say so far like for example 91 so let's say 91 degrees far n height I think I should have a capital F naught on the variables because they have to have a lowercase the first letter so if 91 degrees Fahrenheit is plus Celsius plus degrees Celsius let's run that I think I had this street cleaner running past so sorry about the noise we'll try running this and there we've got 91 degrees Fahrenheit is thirty two point seven seven seven eight degrees Celsius so by British standards at least that's very hot a temperature we rarely encounter in fact so what have I done here well you see that I basically just join numbers and text together and when I when I join the text to the number I started off so inside the double quotes here I started off with his space and that gives us this nice space here so after is we've also got a space and that's that's this space here and so then we've got the temperature in Celsius and we've got finally some more text to finish it off and we've got a space there as well so the whole thing comes out nicely spaced one thing that isn't good is that we've got a lot of digits here and we're gonna look at how to deal with that in a next session when we take a look at strings and texts I don't think there's anything else to say about this it should be fairly straightforward but if you found it confusing you couldn't deal whatever don't worry too much but if you couldn't do the exercise definitely type this out yourself and try playing around with it a bit you know to see if you can change the formatting or whatever if there's anything in it that bothers you try to guess how it works and maybe make changes and see if your changes work as you expect you know just but definitely type it out whatever you do unless you successfully wrote the program okay we'll leave it there for now and until next time happy coding
