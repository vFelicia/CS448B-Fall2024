hello we're going to finish this section by I'm just going to show you some Eclipse tips and tricks a few things you can do with eclipse so hopefully you've created that last program you've got it all working you put in the scanner close and or maybe you've created a similar program of your own there are lots of other things that we can do with strings and we're going to be seeing more of them in the course but rather than overload you with a massive list of everything you can possibly do with a string I'm going to introduce them more try try to introduce them more sort of organically as we go through the course and what I'm going to show you in this video is just a few Eclipse tips and tricks so one thing you can do in Eclipse is I'm using the dark theme here which in this version of Eclipse seemed to be the default and I sort of decided just to go with it but the default used to be and the light theme but you can switch between them and select which one you prefer so if you go to eclipse preferences so maybe that menu is different on windows I'm not completely sure might be in file or something on the Mac I get a particular menu called Eclipse but regardless however you usually go to the Preferences in programs in your operating system go to that you should be able to find the sort of Eclipse preferences somewhere and in this dialog if I type theme and just click appearance here so I've got theming enabled and the dark theme is selected if I want I can select the light theme and I'm going to click apply in close well and then I'm going to restart eclipse because otherwise there's sort of the change from one thing to another might not exactly be complete so I'm going to restart it so there are a few builtin themes and you can find many more on the internet so that's that's completely up to you you can get Eclipse to look sort of more how you want it to look here we go so it's very light now I'll use this for the rest of this video although it's hurting my eyes because I want to show you some things that don't seem to work one of them doesn't work too well in a dark theme something else I want to show you is working sets so you see we've got a lot of programs open here a lot of projects I should say it's becoming a bit cluttered and I can make that more manageable using working sets so this worked fine in a dark theme when I tried it but if you look at a packet Explorer on the left here and if it's not showing you can go to Windows Show view and package Explorer sometimes strangely the console disappears and you can make it reappear by going to window show view console and if you manage to completely scrub your windows in Eclipse you can go to window perspective reset perspective those are all good things to know actually I should also mention that on the top right here these are perspectives so if I click this button we can open other perspectives and what a perspective is is it's just a collection of windows that are geared to a particular task let's cancel that and we are using the sort of Java development perspective and that's what we want for the moment so working sets if I look at a package Explorer there's a little down arrow just there the View menu if I click that I can go to select working set and here I'm going to I'm going to click new and I'm going to select Java I mean make sure that's actually showing on the video here click Next and I'm going to create a working set name called projects projects 1 I'm going to click the add all button to say that all the projects that are open should be part of this working set so a working set or at least the way I use it is really nothing but a collection of projects let's click Add all and click finish so I'm back on this dialog here if I click OK nothing's changed but let's let's do that again and create another working set let's click the down arrow and go to select working set and again I'm going to click new select Java click Next and I'll create another working set called projects 2 and I won't add any projects to that I'll just click finish and click OK now I've got two working sets of projects so if I click the little down arrow another time and click select working set I can select projects 2 or 1 or both so let's try projects 1 and that's got all the projects in it because I added all the projects to work in set 1 if I click the down arrow and go to select working set projects 2 and on tick projects 1 then it's blank now it's sort of cleaned it all up let's close that so my projects are all still there it's just that they're hidden so that that's really useful because if you've got lots of projects open you can decide which ones show at any given moment don't forget you can also just rightclick them and close them but then the the icon would still be there in that case so this this just helps you organize your projects and one last thing that I want to show you quickly which didn't work so well in the dark theme unfortunately it was usable but only just due to sort of clashes of font colors is this task list so I can add tasks for myself here if I click hopefully I can remember this new task let's try that and select local and click finish I get this view coming up this task view let's create a task for myself so I want to make another video about primitive types video let's say that's a task for me to do I want to make later on and I could select a date when it when it's to be completed among other things so here but I won't do that you can do it if you want and and this is what I found currently didn't work very well in the dark theme you could use it but you couldn't see these numbers unless you clicked on them or any of this so that was quite confusing but I won't use that anyway what I'm going to do is just save that and you can see it's here in the task view it's appeared there I can add categories as well so if I click this little down arrow and we get out into the middle by the new icon I can go new category I'll create myself a category called videos click OK maybe I can drag this task into that category let's try yeah that worked or you can you can select it when you create a new task you can select category a few crated categories and you can mark tasks this complete so you can probably one of these buttons does it I don't usually use this a lot let's rightclick here we can go mark as complete and then it gets a line through it or we can rightclick mark as incomplete so it's quite useful quite a handy thing and if you don't like that you can just get rid of it if you want you can just click that arrow it's gone get rid of the outline as well if you're not using that let's go to this task view and go back to the console it's maybe open a file and if you do all of this and then you get confused and you want your default windows back you can go to window perspective reset perspective and it will bring them all back ok we'll leave it there for this video try those out for yourself so we've got working sets and tasks and themes if you're interested in themes ok so until next time happy coding
