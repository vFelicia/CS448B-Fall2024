hello this is John from cave of programming calm and in this video we're going to talk about what you need to install to get started with JavaScript and node J s so installation instructions are not really my thing and they're going to vary from operating system to operating system so my aim is here to give you enough information that you know what to install even if you have to look up installation instructions for your particular system so if you're a if you've already been programming for a while you this will be easy for you if you're a complete beginner you might have to do a bit of googling a bit of searching on the internet so the first thing that we need is we need some kind of terminal where we can write commands so if you're using Mac by default Mac cast this program called terminal and you start it up and the the language of the terminal is what we call bash and I can highly recommend bash so if you if you have a map you can just start up a bash terminal it's just there already if you're using Linux then you probably know what you're doing with terminals anyway and you probably also have a bash terminal available to you if you're using Windows it's possible that you're more of a beginner and then you need to look up some instructions now there are two different things you could do here for Windows one is to use the typical windows console but the other is you could install or enable a bash terminal for windows because bash is just so much nicer and more powerful than what's being coming with windows over the year in Windows 10 there is I believe a bash shell we call it a bash shell included with it you've simply got to enable it so if you just search for Windows 10 bash shell you'll find instructions for doing that if you're using some other versions of Windows another possibility is there is this get bash as google get bash get for windows so you can download and install that and that gives you a I believe a basic bash shell that you should probably can use for this tutorial you probably won't need that but it's another possibility now once you've decided on what terminal you're gonna use whether it's bash or a Windows console or whatever it is you need some software that you need to be able to run within the terminal specifically we need to install node.js so if you search for nodejs you can find an installation package or program for your platform pretty easily just download it and install it and we need to get to the point where we can type two commands we type node let's try it note V actually we can tie it node V in a terminal and instead of saying command not found it actually returns a version number so the V says we turn the version number we also want a command NPM V which should also work should also return a version number that's the point that you want to get to where you can type these two commands in your terminal and and they give you version numbers so probably just installing them is is generally enough if you have if you have any problems don't be afraid to search for your operating system and you know something like install node J s that's what we're really talking about here a technology called nodejs windows for example you search for that you can find detailed instructions various pages on exactly how to install it you could also search for things like install nodejs windows bash or whatever your operating system is or whatever terminal shell language that you intend to use but bash is a good choice and again you can find instructions once you've got to the point where you can open a terminal terminal of some kind and you can type node and NPM and it does something rather than saying command not found then that's it you've got it installed ok so we're also going to need an editor we need a programmers text editor and the one that I'm going to be use using is called Visual Studio code now facial studio is a massive we call it an integrated development environment for what it's crossplatform but it's a massive piece of software which I used to use I haven't used to in ages is good but if you want certain features you have to pay for them visual studio code is a completely different thing confusingly I don't know maybe Microsoft wanted to just help promote Visual Studio by calling it Visual Studio code there's a studio code has nothing discernibly to do with Visual Studio Visual Studio code is a lightweight partly opensource programmers text editor I highly recommend it I definitely recommend installing this so again it's crossplatform you can use it on Windows wherever you like so that's Visual Studio code and if you search like you'll find it you can just download it and install it finally this is completely optional it's not central to the course at all but you might want to install git if you search for get not get to hang on and get and you look at that so this is git SCM comm you can install this get software now git is there's a version of get integrated into Visual Studio code anyway you can use it from there but the ideal thing is if you want to follow along exactly with what I'm going to do including the get bits which are completely optional and nothing to do with JavaScript then you want to get to the point where you can also type let's try to get there's not an option fee but get if you type that in your console it should also do something rather than saying command not found just get it's called get and what that is it's just a version control system it enables you to store the code that you're creating and store different versions of it and is it although it seems like unnecessary extra thing or it might seem like like that I threw a complete beginner it's so useful to be able to store your code in a way that you you're not going to lose it and still have different versions of it and so I'm going to actually create a video on next I think on how you would use how you're going to use get in this course so it's not a course don't get but we are going to use get if you can't be bothered with that really I do recommend it but if you really don't want to use it it's fine you can follow this course without using it at all okay I think that's it so basically you need to install nodejs you need to install Visual Studio code and ideally still get as well and you need a you need to terminal so you need to be able to go to a terminal and at the very least you need to be able to type note V and P M V and they need to do something you might need to Google for instructions on how to get those working ideally you should get get working there as well and you'll have Visual Studio code as your editor I think that's it so if you can install all that lot one way or another don't give up if you're a complete beginner it believe me it's not that difficult you just need to find instructions and ideally a Bosch terminal but you can use Windows console as well okay so until next time happy coding
