hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this video we're going to take a look at variables in JavaScript so I'm going to start by creating another file here let's go to the file menu and new file or I can just use this icon here in there in the Explorer in visual studio code so either way is good let's take a look so I create a new file I'm gonna start giving my files names that have section numbers and file numbers in just to help me organize this course and so that you can find my code more easily on github but you don't need to do that of course so you could call this variables J s but I'm gonna give it a number and call it o 105 o space variables da Jas alright now let's let's write out let's basically recreate the hello world program that we had last time so I'm going to write console dot log and single quotes and hello world and at the end we should really put a semicolon it will work without that but I you know semicolon is kind of used to define the end of a statement a complete sort of bit of little bit of code in JavaScript and I think it's good practice to put it in generally okay so now we can go to the terminal zoom out a bit here and if I do LS in this directory I can see my new file and I can run it with node and filename so I've used a tab key to autocomplete the file name here and because I've got a space in mine in order to stop the the bash shell interpreting this is to two file names one called a 105 oh and the other variables but yes Bosch has helped the Bosch autocomplete helpfully put a backslash in front of the space and that stops it being treated as a separator character if you just called your file variables dot J s and it's not got spaces in the file name though you won't have to worry about any of that all right so let's run it and check that it works it says hello world okay now we could we could use what we call a variable to refer to this hello world message and you'll see as we go along through the course that the variables are a key part of computer programming they're absolutely a fundamental building block that we use here so let's write this I'm going to make up a name I'm gonna create a variable called message although a case and I'm going to set that equal to in single quotes hello world and I'll put a semicolon at the end and then we're going to output this variable border value of this variable in console dot log I'm going to write console dot log and in the round bracket so I'm going to put message so what have we actually done here well first of all let's just see it running if I run it it doesn't seem to do anything different to before it just says hello world so this is what we call a string in computer programming this bit of text and message it's like a label that I've devised so if you think about it okay this this text here when the program runs it must be somewhere in the computer's memory and it's as if we put a label on that bit of memory called message so that we can use the label message to refer to this piece of text later on and then we say console dot log message we can also do this with numbers let's go down and create another variable let's call this I don't know let's call it days and set it equal to seven just like the number of days in a week so days equals seven semicolon and then if I write console dot log days like this and then let's go back and to the terminal and run this and it says hello world and then it says seven so we've output seven so some people that get confused because at this point it looks as though we're saying days equals seven and what does that even mean that's not really what we're doing this equals here is what we call the assignment operator so these are variables message and days are variables and we're using equals to assign a value to them you can think of it as though we're storing a value in them although I think in JavaScript arguably it's more accurate really to say that these variables are like labels that we used to refer to these these values these literal values we call them but basically where we say here that we we are assigning values to variables so I've assigned the value hello world to the variable message and I've assigned the value seven to the variable days and then we can output those try those for yourself and we'll discuss this more and look at some refinements to this in the next video
