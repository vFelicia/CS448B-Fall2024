hello in this video we're going to take a look at a few things you can do with strings in Java so let's create a string for a start let's say string name equals John and we've already seen it you can display this so if I just type this out name we can't we could display that string we can also join strings together so insists out here I could do this my name is let's put a space in and then a plus what so what's this actually doing well here we've got a string variable a variable of the string type and we're assigning it this string value so this text in quotes is called a string literal it's it is a string itself and that's why we can assign it to a variable of type string which is effectively also a string so this is a string and this is a variable that's capable of referring to a string now when we were looking at primitive variables I said they're a primitive variable is a bit like a bucket that you've put a label on and you've put some value into that bucket this isn't a primitive type of variable because string is not a primitive type it's what we call a class in Java so this works a little bit differently this this is a bit like it's a bit like like if you write down an address on a piece of paper what you know the address of a house what is that thing that you've written it so it's a kind of an instruction for where you can find a particular house and with non primitive variable types that's similar to what you get so by assigning a value this name variable it's as if we're were telling name remember where this string literal is so this is what actually creates the string and this assignment operation here is saying make name kind of store the location of this string so you can find it again and they were actually using it and we're using name to refer to this existing string there already too much about that it'll become clearer to you as we go through the course what we're doing here is we're taking a string literal and we're joining it or concatenating it with another string so when we run this program it says my name is John we could also put that we could also mate well we could define a variable declare a variable I should say trying to use the exact right language here we could declare a variable that refers to a string literal like this so let's do that let's say string text I'll just call it text so I'm just making up names for my strings here equals let's do something a little bit different I'm gonna write I am called alright so I've made I've declared this variable of type string and I've assigned it the value of this string literal so really I'm telling it to refer I'm making it refer to this string literal here which is just some text it's a string and let's do sysout like this and then I'm going to write text plus name so here I'm joining two strings together essentially I'm joining this this variable with this variable so really what I'm doing is I'm joining this string literal with this string literal yeah because I'm joining that with that okay let's run this and we will see that it works I am called John and you can join multiple strings together for example I could define another string here let's call it end of end of sentence so here I've got a variable name that's made up of multiple words and I'm following the convention as usual first letter is lower case and we upper case the first letter of each subsequent word I'm going to set that equal just simply to a full stop like that and then in my system dial dot print line I can add on end of sentence and here to save me typing I'm going to type the first bit and then press control and in space so control space at the same time and hit return to select the first option and it autocompletes for me okay let's run this and you see that we've got a full stop on the end so we've concatenated three strings together here and try that off yourself try try this little program and check you can get it working and then try to make up some combination of strings and just output them yourself so make up some program that involves let's say three strings and join them together and output them something like that makes something up okay so until next time happy coding
