hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to look at a my sequel setting that effects how inserts are allowed to run when the insert is trying to insert into a table with not null volumes so we're going to look at another useful setting option to know about and in this course we're probably going to see at least one more very useful my sequel specific setting that you should know about so there's this setting called sequel mode and settings in my sequel in general can have global and local values so let's take a look at what that actually means and to start with I'm going to say select and this this following syntax is very very specific to my sequel so it's not a general sequel thing but I'm going to type to kind of add signs and let's put in here global dot sequel underscore mode so if we take a look at the value of this we see it set to strict all tables so if you want to read about what this actually does and I will explain in just a moment excuse me then we can search let's say in google for my sequel sequel underscore mode and in the first document that's linked to here you get there my sequel documentation page and there you can see various ways of setting the sequel mode and you can see the most important sequel modes and just general various things you can set it to you can also see how to set it how to set this value in your configuration file to set it sort of permanently so we'll take a look at what this actually does in a minute and we'll see that it can affect how our queries run but I also want to mention that there is also a session sequel mode so let's take a look at that and I appreciate that it is going to a bit cryptic at the moment but all will become hopefully clear shortly so let's say 2 up signs and a session sequel mode so we can run this select statement with multiple values as long as they're separated by commas and if we run this we find that my global and sequel global and session sequel modes are actually set to different values and that's just because I've been playing around with it a bit so when I when I installed my sequel the default for both of them was no engine substitution now the global version of any setting in general that's that's going to set the value for any connection that's made to the server so if someone else connected to the server or you you ran an app that also connected to the server in addition to this my sequel workbench if you've set the global mode that's going to affect these other connections as well whereas if you set the session mode that's only going to affect this particular session in other words it's going to affect this connection that you've made now and if you drop the connection in the workbench and start it again then the session sequel mode is going to default back to the global sequel mode so there's sessions here but are also global values that you can step for any connection that's made your server if you restart the server you're going to lose both of these and they're going to default either to the default values or to whatever you set in the config file so if you want to set a variable like one of these permanently you need to set high in the config file so this will be sequel mode equals suchandsuch so what actually are these values so the session sequel mode is the one that's it's actually going to affect this session and I've got it set to no engine substitution which was the default when I run my sequel now according to the documentation what this value actually does no engine substitution is that if you specify when you create the table if you specify an engine we saw in the last tutorial but you misspelled the engine or something or you specify an engine that's not available then if this variable is not set my sequel is going to substitute some available engine whatever the default engine is set to for that misspelled unavailable engine if this is if this is set it's not going to do that so if you specify an engine that doesn't exist then it's not going to substitute it with some default value so if we do for example crate let's get rid of this asset grades table test long ID int engine equals some gobbledygook if no engine substitution is set then it's not going to execute that query now the one what we're really interested in here is setting a mode called strict or tables and let's see what effect that actually has so if I I've got less let's go to use tutorial one I'm already using this database we're just want to show you from beginning case case it's confusing one out so we're gonna say use the tutorial one database I'm gonna say show tables these are commands that I do use a lot and we see regardless users table in here I don't actually need this test table so I'm just gonna do drop table test while I think about it and now if we do show tables the test table will have disappeared we just got users let's do desk users and we can see that we created this table so that both of the fields can't be null now with the default setting at least the default setting I got when I installed my sequel outofthebox and that this is something that you should try for yourself if we do insert into users and set into our table we only specify one column in there so we don't specify all of the columns that are not null now we say values let's specify for this just nine or something and we run this and we look at a query it has actually run but with a warning and so if we do select star from users we see that we've inserted that row and my sequel has inserted a default value for username which for a string type a text type is an empty blank string so it's not know but my sequel has made up a value for it which is the default value now that may be the behavior you want and in this tutorial I'm going to just carry on like that I'm gonna stick with this option because I want to try to use the settings that you most likely got out of the box and this is how my version of my sequel came to me when I just installed it this time around but sometimes you might want to change that you might want to say okay if I've got not null values in my table values that can't be no if someone tries to do an insert on that table and they don't specify your value for the nominal columns for all of the Naughton or columns then the query should fail you might want to say that rather than let my sequel make up a default value for it and if you want to do that you can change the sequel mode so we could do for example set let's say global set wellthat's sessions may be the most useful let's say set session sequel mode equals and we could set it to some value in here and you can see the most important values in the my sequel document but an easy way to do this we've set both the local and global values of a setting at the same time in this case the sequel mode setting is just to say set sequel on the school node equals and I'm going to set this to I set it to strict or tables I'm using single quotes here but in sequel it doesn't matter so that I could just use double quotes and should be fine let's run this and we see that the query I don't like not so much a query but a statement ran successfully and now let's do select in fact I'll just bring up this query that I used previously so we'll look at the global and session values of this sequel note variable and we see they've both been set to strict or strict or tables if I now try to insert into a table and I don't specify a value for one or more of the columns that are not allowed to be null let's try this with the value 10 for ID and I won't give a value for username which is not null let's run this now we see that it gives an error and although errors don't seem like a good thing sometimes that's what you want if you have a program that's executing sequel statements it can be really bad if they run silently but they and they appear to succeed but they don't actually do what you want so if you run a sequel statement in your program it's good practice to check somehow that that hasn't run and created an error and the same applies kind of if you run a sequel statement by hand like we're doing here sometimes it can fail silently you think it's work but it hasn't actually done what you want so sometimes you want to make sure that queries fail when you do something that you don't really want them to do and by setting this equal mode variable we've made sure that we have to specify values for all the fields that are specified as not null in our table so it's worth having a go at this yourself take a look at your global and local session modes like this see what they're set to they should be set to the default to both the same thing you know unless you change one of them they should be set to both the same thing and you you might want to try changing sequel mode as I just did so that's this one too strict or tables and then try to insert into a table as I just did not specifying a value for it and not not column and check that it it does fail if you set strict or tables but I'm gonna set this back to no engine substitution for the purpose that this purposes of this tutorial although really if I was running some sort of production database that actually really mattered I probably would like to turn strict or tables on just to give me a bit of extra sort of error checking and also if you just stop your server and restart it then you'll get whatever default values are specified in your configuration file and a couple of little things I just want to mention one thing is that if you didn't find a configuration file in your my sequel directory install directory at all I should have mentioned this in the last tutorial really you can just Google for like a default one on the internet and just copy that or even just write it out yourself just Google for what should be in a typical my sequel configuration file remember you have to put it in the right location if you actually want to use it and you have to restart your server but my download of my sequel did include a dummy sort of default configuration file my dot CNF or it could be my top any on Windows it's just that it wasn't in the right place and also with queries in general because I use different databases from time to time even though I've been using my sequel for a very long time I can still get confused because sequel syntax does vary between different databases and also if you don't if you don't use a particular database for a few months things can start to get confused in your mind and you forget the exact database the syntax for sequel queries so one good place to look is certainly the my sequel documentation but often this is sort of a little bit cryptic and often it's easier just to do something like my sequel select query query example so if you forget for example how to do a select query then you can pretty easily find just examples of what that actually looks like that concrete examples and that's sometimes better than looking at the documentation okay we'll leave it there for this tutorial do have a go at selling strict tool tables and see what effect that has for you on your system and check what mode you're currently using as well so until next time happy coding
