hello this is John from K programming. comom I wanted to kind of come back and added uh maybe one or two kind of bonus videos to this course with little things that I um probably have have in many cases touched on but um didn't really go into explicitly and in this tutorial I just want to mention the postfix and prefix increment and DEC and and decrement operators we've seen that if you've got uh let's say a an integer like this well it has to be an integer really or some kind of integer type let's set that to eight we can we can type stuff like value Plus+ uh that's the that's called the postfix increment operator and then we can do see out value like this so if we run this of course we get nine okay we've got to build it first that would probably help so um this this isn't any anything unexpected we've seen this before it's pretty simple and we get nine uh but we can also use this in prefix form so that was post fix but we can also type this prefix whoops so if we run this once again we get nine and the same is true of the um of the decrement operator we can type this to decrement decrease the value of value by one so now it's seven and that also exists in a prefix form like this which will also give us seven so what's the difference between prefix and postfix so the answer is that if you have an expression let's um well here here for example we we do have an expression uh with postfix the value is going to be used U and then incremented with prefix it's incremented and then used so if we look at this now what we're going to get is eight so we see that's eight that's because it used the value and then incremented it if we did this on the other hand it's going to increment the value and then use it so now we actually see nine and with this version it was actually incremented so if we output this again now then you can see that it was incremented so the second one's going to be nine here it's just that on the first one because it's postfix it used the value and then it incremented it whereas prefix would increment it and then use it so you can see exp Expressions um like for example int uh number equals uh value Plus+ and let's do see out on number so what's what's value going to be here so we see that U we incremented value started off eight we incremented it so it was nine and we output nine here to confirm that so now uh can can you guess what this what this is going to be well let's let's see if your guess is right it's actually going to be still nine but of course if we if we um if we did a prefix version here so it it has incremented value if if we actually output value here let's let's output value and let's also say value is now and let's say here number is so value is being incremented to 10 but um so here it's 10 you see but number is nine because it's postfix and we actually used it before incrementing it but if we if we use prefix then we're going to increment it and use it so now number and value are going to be the same they're going to end up the same both as 10 so that's really important to know and sometimes some people use prefix and Pro postfix in really complicated expressions and uh it can get really con confusing it's important to know about it but really um the majority of the time in my view unless you really need it it's better not to rely on prefix and postfix uh it's it's better to um to try to make your Expressions a bit simpler but people do use it in Expressions so it is important to know about it okay so that's it for this tutorial until next time happy chosing
