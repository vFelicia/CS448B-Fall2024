hello this is John from cave of programming calm welcome back to C++ for complete beginners and in this tutorial we're going to talk about what you need to install on your computer to get started with C++ development unfortunately I can't give you exact instructions because exactly what you have to install depends on your platform your operating system your type of computer and it depends on your personal preferences for that matter and what you prefer to use to develop C++ but I'm gonna give you some pointers so I'm going to explain what I recommend you to install and where to find it and and here by the way you can see a little C++ program in Eclipse which is gonna look completely puzzling to you at the moment probably but we're gonna look at that in the next tutorial so as I explained in the last video we need an IDE and a compiler so the first thing to do is to install your compiler now if you're on Windows you can use Visual C++ Express which I believe is free of Visual C++ the paid version to follow this tutorial but there are gonna be some differences between what I show you and what you need to type in or do in Visual Studio but you probably can't follow that tutorial with this also on windows if you want a really simple solution to get started with you can use code blocks and I believe that can automatically download a compiler for you so visual C++ comes with its own compiler and I believe I think that code blocks can also download a compiler for you these are actually integrated development environments so those are two possibilities and there are others but what I recommend you to do is that firstly installed a compiler and now if you're on let's say Mac or another Linux type operating system like Linux or UNIX then you need to search for the canoes C++ compiler and search for this for your system so I'm using a Mac sort search for Anu C++ compiler for Mac and install that on your system and you may already have it so I'm not sure what the best link is here but you'll find it if you look around Mac OS X install GCC compiler ya the canoe compiler for C++ is also known as GCC and it's also known as G plus plus so you need to install C++ or GCC on your machine and if you're using like a Linux type operating system then you'll look for G plus plus or GCC or you know whatever if you're using Windows search form in GW mingw and that's minimalist the new for Windows so that's a GCC compiler for Windows so if you're using Windows I'd recommend that you install mingw so hopefully you can do that you're gonna have to search a little bit in Google to find exact instructions for your operating system but this is the first challenge to install GCC or mingw if you're on Windows and then you've got a compiler on your system the second thing that you need to do is you need to install an IDE and again visual C++ is an IDE which comes with a compiler code blocks is an IDE which comes with a compiler but I'd recommend the use clips so if you search for Eclipse cplus plus let's say then you can find the Eclipse CDT and that is version of Eclipse for C++ eclipses a kind of generic development environment and the specific version of Eclipse for C++ is called Eclipse CDT so this is a second thing you need to install so just download and install that you might have to do some configuration after this to link to what it tells Eclipse why your compiler is and if you do if you do need need to you'll find that out certainly in the next tutorial because it won't work and you'll need to just google for instructions for your system on how to tell Eclipse CDT where to find your compiler so this is going to be a little bit challenging you're gonna have to probably do a little bit of googling perhaps some configuration depending on your system and you might have to but it's worth persisting with and believe me I well I've always thought anyway that getting your sit first C++ program running the first minimal HelloWorld C++ program you know installing everything and getting the code in there and getting to that point it's the most difficult thing about C++ so give this some time and be patient try to install the compiler go new or mingw of its windows and install an IDE and I recommend CDT which will work on Windows or pretty much any system if you've already got Eclipse installed what you can do is you can go to the marketplace you go to help eclipse mock in place oops that's the wrong one cancel that help eclipse marketplace and just search for CDT in here you should be able to install it here I just type CDT in that box and just search for it CDT I've already got it installed so I don't know if this will actually find anything but you can install it into an existing Eclipse like that and you can also another way of doing that if you've already got eclipse is just go to this Eclipse CDT site type Eclipse CDT into Google go to download and then you can just put this URL here into eclipse so if you go to let's say let's get rid of that wizard cannot be closed okay that's nice but if you go to that's really annoying if you go to the Eclipse I think it's a help or Windows menu there's a option in that menu for installing software updates and you can just put this URL into a box if you select that menu option and you can install CDT there that's an alternative to using the marketplace but it's easier to use the marketplace and easier still just to download the CDT as a kind of standalone package yeah and so once you've done that then you'll have everything you need to get started with developing C++ programs and in the next tutorial we're gonna look at creating a really simple hello world C++ program so if you install everything you think it's working move onto the next video and that's where you'll find out if it really is working or not so until next time happy coding you
