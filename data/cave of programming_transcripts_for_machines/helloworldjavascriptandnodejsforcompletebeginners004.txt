hello this is John from cave of programming calm and in this video we're going to create a hello world JavaScript program so we haven't really quite finished installing things here so I'm gonna win I'm going to assume that by now you have got some terminal installed that you're happy with using I'm going to assume you're using bash but if you can use you know Windows terminal or whatever you just need to make sure you're okay with using it and you understand it and you should have got git installed ideally and you should have you'll definitely need node and NPM a needle that and you'll need a program is text editor and I will assume that you've got facial studio code installed by now or out some of the text editor that you're familiar with and you know how to use ok so one thing is Visual Studio code out of the box doesn't necessarily support JavaScript programming well what we need is two things we need a syntax highlighter which will color different parts of the code that we're going to write in meaningful ways to help us understand it and we need a kind of a pretty fire or formatter that will automatically format or arrange the code in a way that makes sense so what I recommend is when you start Visual Studio code for the first time usually you'll get this welcome screen and it says customize here install support for JavaScript you'll probably want to click that and just do it if you don't see that in Visual Studio code you can also just search on the internet for something like Visual Studio code JavaScript plugins something like that because you need to install plugins that will enable you to work well which I have a script go to maybe this page at code for our studio comm install you know whichever of these seem like they might be useful I prettier I think will be definitely a good one to install and you'll figure out pretty quickly if you've got the right support that you need in facial studio code or not and you can also if you look at visual studio code on the moment on the left at least in this version I'm using 2020 there's like this icon it looks like a sort of some building bricks and if you click that it opens an extensions panel where if you've got an internet connection which you have because you're watching this video unless you've downloaded it and you're watching it later then you can search for extensions here like you could search for JavaScript and install them here so I've installed some extensions basically and but the bottom line is you've got to have a formatter and a syntax highlighter let's take a look all right so I'm going to get rid of this now and I'm going to open the Explorer File Explorer with this thing here in the top in the top left this icon and if I click that it I can open a folder so I'm going to open that folder we created in the last video you can either just create that manually or even better create it by cloning your remote git repository like I did in the last video so I'm going to click open folder navigate to that video and just select it click open and then it it shows me what's what's in that video actually I've opened the wrong one here I don't think I wanted to open that let's go to file and closed folder and then I'm going to make sure I open the right one click open folder and what I want is this folder that I just created in the last video using git using git clone so I click open and there we go this is the folder so it's got a don't get ignoring it and a license file in and readme MD which is just a text file and I'm going to create a new file in there you can either do that by going to file new file like any reasonable text editor well that's a bit of an exaggeration because VIN for example is a reasonable text editor but doesn't work like this but anyway like most text editors that have a GUI graphical user interface you can go to file a new file or if you look in this file explorer above the fault if you hover over the folder name there's a new file icon there's also a new folder icon let's click the new file icon and give it a name and I'm going to create a file called hello world j/s you can call it what you want but I would recommend giving it a J's extension and because I've installed various plugins the fact that I give it a dot J s extension means visual studio code will recognize that this is supposed to be a JavaScript file and that's why it's suddenly popped up yellow J s there it may or may not do that on yours depends what extensions you've installed ok now let's type a program so I'm going to type so I'm going to show you what to type here I'm not going to explain it that much you're going to come to it to understand it more as you go through the course if you've already got programming experience if this won't be a mystery to you if you're a complete beginner it will be more of a mystery but that's alright the important thing at the moment is to actually type this yourself so you can't learn programming just by watching videos that's like trying to learn to play the piano by watching videos about people playing the piano you have to actually watch the video and try the thing yourself whether you try it now or afterwards you got to do it yourself if you really want to learn this I don't know whether I'm going to give you suggestions for exercises I probably will as we go along but the really important thing is you try out what you see me doing and also experiment with it a little bit yourself so I'm going to type here console.log and then to round brackets and then a semicolon like that you got to get it exactly correct it will actually work without the semicolon in JavaScript but I usually try to put it in I feel it's good practice and then I'm going to put the cursor inside these two round brackets and type a quotes like this a quote mark and because I've got various plugins installed Visual Studio code put the closing quote in for me so I've got a pair of single quotes there it's not a speech mark it's two single quotes notice also that console is a different color to log if you can see that I've got syntax highlighting going on here again that's because I installed syntax highlight lighting extensions like prettier for example you want that working ideally it makes programming much easier so I'm going to click within just within between these two single quotes and type hello space world exclamation mark and save that file alright so this is a really simple basic JavaScript a standalone program and now I'm going to I'm going to run that and to do that you probably can run it from within visual studio code there's also by the way you can also open a terminal within Visual Studio code but I'm just gonna run it from my freestanding terminal program so I'm going to assume that you have a terminal that you're happy with and you know how to use or else you're using bash and you can just follow along with me here let's go to the terminal so I'm going to type PWD in bash to see where I am and I'm not in the right place here so I'm going to do CD space dot to go up a level CD space dot dot dot to go up another level and I'm gonna do PWD and then let's do LS to see what's in here okay I'm gonna CD space into my note J's folder this is going to be different for you you know it just depends what folders you've got I just wanted to show you a bit of how you navigate in bash I use the tab key to autocomplete which will probably work for you as well depends what operating system you're using maybe unwish or and then hit return LS I'm going to do CD space basically I'm going to change into that directory that we created in the last video I hit return an LS to see what's in it and okay there's my hello world dot J s LS is short for list by the way CDs short for change directory PWD I can remember that what that's short for but it shows you where you are if you're using a bash terminal now to run this I just type no to space HelloWorld dot J s and hit return again I was using the tab key to autocomplete the file name there hit return and it says hello world okay so what have we done here well node is a interpreter that is it can take a file containing instructions in the JavaScript language and it can carry out those instructions and the instructions that I wrote here basically say we call it printing so print the text hello world in other words display that on the console and that's the result so my node program has run the instructions in my hello world dot J's file written in the JavaScript language and it's done what I told it to do is print it hello world printing here has nothing to do with printers its programming lingo for display on the console so if you've got some programming experience I you may be underwhelmed by this you know it's the first step it's great you have to do it you may be surprised that you can do this with JavaScript I certainly was to find that you can run JavaScript as a freestanding program these days using node this was a surprise to me when I first did this if you're a complete beginner this may feel all very confusing and you won't know you know why why console why log why any of this that's okay your confusion will go away as you carry on going through the course the important thing is to follow along with what I'm doing either after the video or during it type out this stuff get it working yourself that's absolutely vital and also experiment with it a bit so in this case you could probably guess that you can change the text hello world inside these single quotes to something else and it should still work generally so try it out for yourself and I'm going to assume that you are typing this stuff for yourself and experimenting with it a little bit otherwise you just won't learn what's in this course unless unless you're an experienced programmer maybe and then you could probably just watch the videos and apply them just from memory I don't know maybe but anyway okay so we'll leave it there for this I know we won't I've got another thing to do before we leave this video let's check our code in to get so in there in the last video I created a github github repository and this directory that we're in is a local version of that so it now if I type git status hang on let's just do clear first so just type clear to clear the console get space status if you've got get installed you'll see a message like this so this is actually showing in red it may or may not do for you but it will probably say untracked files hello world so what I want to do is I want to we say stage the changes for commit is get lingo this isn't really tutorial on get but I need to tell git about this file I need to tell it look store this file so I'm going to say git add and I'll just use guitar to star to say look at everything to the git repository here and after that or I could just do get out hello world Jas doesn't matter which one really if I then do get status now it says changes to be committed and it tells me what command I would use if I wanted to undo what I just did and it says new file hello world Jas now I can write git commit and then M to add a message and I so I'm committing to gates meaning now I'm actually saving my changes in my local git repository so git add says look take notice of these files they're important basically we say that we're staging changes c'mere c'mere actually saves those changes in effect the changes that we made to this file we created it and added text to it we want to save all that and it's the commit that's actually saving it basically so I do git commit M and then I'll just put a message created in double quotes and hit return ok and now if I do get status it it says let's just do clear and get space status it says on branch master your branch is ahead of origin master by one commit use git push to publish your local commits so I've committed to my local git repository I've saved the changes that I've just done but I want to I want to send them to the remote repository on github comm because you know if my computer gets messed up I don't want to lose my changes so I'm gonna save the local changes in the remote repository to do that I write get push origin master so four different words there so I'm using git I'm doing a push command and pushing to the origin in other words to the remote repository and this is a what we call a branch name it's a particular version of this code basically we won't dwell on that too much but I'm going to hit return you might need to add a username and password at this point it's not asking me to do that because I've already run git but it will probably ask you to add your github username which is probably an email address and your github calm password as well and it may also ask you to configure your your email address and it will tell you how to do that probably if it asks you to do that so you probably won't have too much trouble with this it's not too confusing so there's three commands that we did we did let's do maybe list yeah let's do history Brett and gets you don't have to follow you don't have to do this but I want to look at the history of things that I've done and filter that so grep filters it so I want to run this through grep and just see the ones that contain the word get and we can see that what I did was basically I did get I'd star get commit M with a message and get pushed push origin master those are the three commands that I used to save what I've done get status was just used to see what's going on basically and you might need to do other stuff you might need to do all this stuff like just add your password the first time you do this okay when you've done that you should be able to go to github.com and well if you log in you should be able to see your repository there and you find that your source code has been added to it and there it is for me if if you so you may or may not decide to use github it's not an essential part of this course but whether you do or not if you want to see my source code of stuff I'm creating you can go to github.com slash cave of programming and then you want to go to my no js' repository so either just go to slash node j s directly or click on my repositories tab and go to no j s so basically go to the URL github comm slash cave off programming all one word slash nodejs and then you can see my source code in and here's hello world j s so after this tutorial I'll probably start giving these kind of numbers so we can you can basically you know kind of keep track of them a bit better alright so that's it for this video hopefully you run your first hello world program if you're a complete beginner with programming and you manage to run this that's an incredible achievement believe me be proud of it okay so until next time happy coding
