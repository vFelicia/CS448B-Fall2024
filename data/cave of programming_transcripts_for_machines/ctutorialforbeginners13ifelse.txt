hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this video tutorial in the C++ for complete beginning series I'm going to take a look if else and we're going to take a little bit of a further look at conditions so let's let's start by outputting a really simple menu which is a very common thing to do in command line programs so I'm going to say here C out and let's have a menu option so the user can enter a number to take some particular action let's say 1 and add new record or something like that endler and I want to have a bunch of different options so I'm just going to copy this to save time let's have a few of these and let's say we can have delete record and maybe view record and search record search record and as I've quit so the idea is that there's some kind of database and you want to search it and view items and delete items and that sort of thing and this is a menu that lets you do it if we look at this now and that should look pretty good that's pretty good we need to change these numbers here of course and one thing you can do in in strings and that's often helpful for lining stuff up especially if you were to put the numbers here at the end let's say is you can include a tab in a string and in C++ and many other languages between double quotes you can use these things called and control sequences and what they look like you need a backslash it must be a backslash not a forward slash and then you have a single character like that and so this this actually outputs a tab you can also use backslash n to output a newline and there are other options but I think those are by far the most common and also if you want to actually output a double quote within double quotes you can use a backslash double quote to do that otherwise you couldn't put double quotes within double quotes anyway let's let's put some / T's in here some tab characters so I'm going to stick them all after there the numbers so this each one of these backslash control sequences they're only a single character and often they're invisible characters like a tab and so let's let's take a look at that so I'll run this and you can see now that we've got tabs there doesn't really look that good but I wanted to show you the tab anyway because often it is very useful let's get the selection from user let's say see out enter your selection like this and end look in fact let's have a flush there so they can enter the number on the same line as this and let's get that input so we've done this before lots of times I'm going to say int let's call it I just call it value and see in value now we want to take various different actions depending on what the user enters and of course we could use them if we could say if value equals let's say five then and let's do a CL let's say are you sure you want no let's let's not do large let's just say application quitting well this is a bit of artificial because we're not actually going to take any action here we're just going to output some text but it's um it's just kind of a demo so let's spell application correctly and I'm going to run this and we'll check that it works so if I if I run this now and if I enter like four or something doesn't say anything nothing happens because I haven't told it to do anything if I hit four if I hit five in state application quitting so we've seen this in the last tutorial the only difference was we use strings there but and this works very well with integers as well now supposing you want to take an action if something's true but and you want to take a different action if that thing isn't true so you want to choose between two possible alternatives let's let's say for example here that them we wanna and we want to say that the user and let's let's say the user has like some kind of privileges and certain users can't use these first two options so we want to take one and one action if they enter a number that's less than three and if it's greater than or equal to three then we want to different action so we can say if value and I'm going to use less than here less than three then we want to say see out in sufficient privileges to use these menu options by now and lo so this this is we read this as less than and is also greater than which looks like that what we want to use less than here now that the way I remember this well when you first start programming it's difficult to remember which way round this greater than or less than goes and yeah after after you've been programming a while you just kind of automatically know but and a good way to remember this is that the condition is true here if the smaller value is at the smaller end of this symbol and the bigger value is at the bigger end so this arrow is got like a point to a small end and it's got a big end the kind of prongs there and this condition will evaluate to true if the small value is at small end if value is smaller of the two values and at the big end here we have three and that also applies to greater than this condition will be true if value is greater and three was the smaller value let's use less than here and let's see how that works so this is pretty simple again so we can enter a number and greater than three and let's say six nothing's going to happen the value this this evaluates to false so value is not less than three so this so value less than threes is false if we enter a value that is less than three let's enter one then this condition evaluates to true and says insufficient privileges it does it does this now what if we want an alternative so we want to say okay if the value is less than 3 we do this but if it's equal to 3 or it's greater than 3 in other words if this is false we want to do something else and we can do that just with an ounce so immediately after the closing bracket if I'm going to type else open a new curly bracket like that hit return Eclipse the spot the closing one in for me and we can say see out privilege level sufficient kind of a strange thing to say in a program but just demo select let's see let's run that and now if we enter two let's say then insufficient privileges if we enter 3 then says privilege level sufficient so so this is now this is now falls because value is not less than 3 it's equal to 3 so it does the else bit of the F so one of these conditions is always going to execute it's just a question of which one and let's let's just try a bigger number than 3 we could enter anything really like 66 and it will it will do this so this is ifelse and I want to draw your attention to the fact that I've indented the stuff between these curly brackets by a tab so you could write it like this where you could put a brackets anywhere and miss out tubs left right and center but it's really hard to read this especially if you have multiple lines in here so you should absolutely never do that wherever you have curly brackets code between curly brackets indents the code between them by tab and if you have curly brackets within curly brackets then the code between these will get indented by another tab so the indentation level Clues you in to how the code is working with the brackets and if you ever get confused you can always use a shortcut I think it's ctrl shift F on window is a command shift F on map or you can just right click and go it's a bit slow go to source and format to note there's a ctrl M sequence for my map here we'll do that and then you can see it automatically indents it so this this is if elves and you can use it as well with equals equals so like you know you could say and if value equals equals 5 then we could say see out quitting and learn elves and the curly brackets see out well normally would have a loop here to get the option level again but let's just say here not quitting just for just a really simple slightly useless demo of this so let's let's run that see what happens so now if we say like for so we're going to get privilege level sufficient and then it says not quitting because this evaluates to false so we get this let's run it again and enter five so the first if now is still same privilege level sufficient because value is not less than three then it says is value equal to five and the answer is yes so does this bit of this if so that lasts basically it for this tutorial we've seen and we've seen greater than and equal to voicing greater than less than and we've seen ifelse and so to practice this try to maybe try to write a little application like this output your own menu use some tabs in it just for a better practice and try to take some different actions depending on what number the user enters you can also try this with strings if you like the more practice you do the better and I don't like to give particular actual test questions because I don't think that that valuable myself I think it's much better if you make up a little program somehow that uses things like greater than or less than and if ELPS made one up another extra kind of mental stretch and making something of yourself so if you can't think of anything then just try creating this application something closely similar and if you want to get creative that's even better so that's it for this tutorial and in the next tutorial we're going to look a little bit more got one more video on if if elves and we're going to look at how you can have multiple conditions in an if because here clearly you actually want to choose between different specific alternatives rather than just looking at ranges of numbers and we're going to look at how you can do that in the next tutorial so until next time happy coding you
