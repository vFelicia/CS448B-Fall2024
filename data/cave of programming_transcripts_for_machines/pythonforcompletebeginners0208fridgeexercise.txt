in this video I'm going to give you an exercise which you can try if you want to remember the exercises are optional I wouldn't want you to feel that you've got to do the exercises and if you can't do them for some reason that you've somehow failed the important thing is only to practice so if you've got your own way of practicing if L if else or practicing anything else for that matter that's usually going to be just as good as the exercises that I give you so I'm going to call this exercise the fridge let's a comment here the fridge now I want to describe the exercise and for that I'm going to need multiple lines so I could type out multiple hash signs like this and then put text here or wherever as long as it's you know the right side of these hash signs but it's easier to use a different comment style to write multiple lines of comment python doesn't actually have multiline comments as such but it does have multiline strings normally we Define a string between double quotes you can actually also use single quotes it's exactly the same but let's say double quotes and put some text in there and of course that's a string but if you want strings that stretch multiple lines you can open and close the string with three quotes like this now I can also use this to create multiline comments because Python's just going to read this and say okay it's just a string it's not even assigned to a variable I can basically just ignore it so it will treat it like a comment effectively so the exercise is this get the user to enter a temperature in Celsius if you're not used to using Celsius don't worry because that's not going to matter here now we're going to pretend that this temperature is the internal temperature of a fridge so it's being detected by some kind of monitoring apparatus and then we're going to print different things depending on the temperature if the temperature is less than zero print fridge too cold if the temperature is 0 to 4째 C print fridge okay or something like that if the temperature is 4 to 6째 print fridge too warm and if the temperature is greater than 6째 you're going to print fridge broken now there is some ambiguity the way I've specified this for example the temperature of 4째 is that in this range or is it in this range but I'll leave it up to you to decide how that's going to work the basic thing is just to create a program that basically fulfills these criteria so you're probably going to want to use a if L if else type of statement and the conditions can be things involving less than or greater than or greater than or equal or less than or equal or whatever and with exercises generally I recommend people to approach them by first looking at is there a bit you can actually do and then do that bit and then the other bits that you can't do you might figure those out later on as you go along but try to find some part of this that you can do even if you have to simplify it in order to be able to do it then simplify it and write a simpler version of it and then you'll get some practice which is the whole point of this really and also after that after you've written a simplified version of this maybe you can change it and make it a bit more elaborate and make it conform to this specification a bit more accurately see how you get on don't stress about it and we'll take a look at it in the next video hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
