hello in this video we're going to take a look at control characters in strings so let's define a string so I'm going to write here string I'll call it text I'm giving it a generic name because I don't really know what it's going to be exactly but I'll write some text here what should we write to be or not to be that is the question all right so we've got two sentences here and we can output that sysout an output text so let's run this and we've got the output as we expect now within strings because they are simply just text you can use more or less any character you want to use almost any character that you might feel like using is valid in there it's just ordinary text but we can put control characters in there so all of the characters we've got in here are printing characters well in a way even the spaces I'm not sure how technically how it's classified but the point is that they all they all visibly display in in your output so the letter B visibly displays as it is the space will that just create space I guess it's an nonprinting character anyway let's not worry about that but the rest all or visibly display but there are non printing characters and these are things that alter the formatting of your string so they don't actually display themselves they alter the position of it somehow and probably the most commonly used one is the newline character so then the nonprinting characters or control characters start with a backslash so backslash n means newline so at a point where I had there we're going to create a new line in other words we're going to see that these two sentences are now on two separate lines and we don't want that space anymore because we don't want to start a new line with a space or whatever let's run this and you can see we've got that on two separate lines now another really common character that you might want to use is tab so let's let's indent the first line with a tab so you can put it anywhere in your string but we'll put it at the beginning here let's write /t that gives us a tab character so when we run this program we can see that the first sentence has been indented by one tab we'll put another one in because this looks ugly let's at least line them up so directly after the newline I'm going to write slash T so we've got a new line here followed by a tab character and if we run this now they're both tapped in one tab if you actually for some reason want a slash in your in your string because slash normally starts the control character you can't just write slash in there it will think I mean backslash o it will think that must be some weird control character so we get an error I don't think backslash o is a control character or if it is I haven't used it but anyway it's not valid to just put a slash in by itself if you actually want to slash in there you have to write two slashes and then it works so here we've got to be slash or not to be okay anyway let's get rid of that that's that's not something you usually use because you don't normally need slashes in your string okay now I'm going to give you a little challenge let's write this in a comment so I'm going to put slash star as a multiline comment and ends in slash star and this star is purely decorative it doesn't have to be that just makes you a lot nicer so let's imagine that we want to output some text on the console that looks like this so it's indented by let's say a tab and it says select an option and then indent it a little bit more underneath that we're going to say 1 what should we say add an entry to view the database or 3 exit so look at this bit of text forget about the asterisks they're just for decoration or because they're part of the comment how would you output this text on the command line so you've got four lines here and three of them that the first one is indented one tab and the others let's say they're going to be indented two tabs so they're indented one type relative to the first line have a go of that yourself it's up to you how you do it whether you store these lines just in one variable which is easiest or you put the numbers in there separately or whatever that's I'll leave that up to you if you want a particular particularly challenging task store the numbers separately so one two and three store those in integer type variables and store the rest in strings okay have a go at lapped us try to write a program that outputs this on the command line and if you can't do it don't despair we'll take a look at it in the next video
