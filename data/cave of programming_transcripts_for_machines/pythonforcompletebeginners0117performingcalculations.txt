in this video we're going to write a program that does a calculation let's try to write a program that asks the user what their name is and then asks them how old they are and then tells them how many years they've got to live if they want to be 100 years old so how many more years would it take to reach 100 years old first let's get their name so name equals and I'll use input here and we'll apply some text to act as a prompt let's say enter your name and we'll have a colon and a space there and after I finish this I'm going to ask you to put the code away and see how much you can write yourself from memory and if you try that at this stage you would already want to run it I think already try that this bit Works before you go on the next bit and you could figure that out by doing print name and check that that works let's actually just try this and run it although being an experienced programmer I know that this does work okay so John and there you go it says John so that bit's working and that's how you'd want to proceed I think if you're new to this sort of line by line and keep testing running your program now let's say age equals input and enter your age now when we've got that age we want to do a calculation with it we're going to need a variable to store the result of that calculation let's call it years left and that's going to be equal to 100 minus age so we can figure out how many more years the person has to live before they're 100 years old now notice that I've written all of these variable names in lowercase in this case I wanted to to use two words for the variable name so I've separated the two words by an underscore this is the convention that I'm using in this course for naming variables there are different conventions out there I think this is probably the most common convention to use underscores to separate different words in variable names and to make the variable names lowercase but you could also use a different convention the important thing is that you have to stick to a convention pick a convention and stick to it otherwise your code gets really confusing you don't want to mix different conventions some people might write years left so they capitalize any subsequent words after the first one in the variable name and that's fine as long as you stick to that convention if you're working in a team of people of course you have to follow what whatever convention the team uses and they will normally have some kind of set of coding conventions that you're supposed to follow okay now supposing we want to print this out so I say print let's maybe put their name and then comma you have plus years left plus years left before you reach 100 I'll get rid of this side panel so we can see the whole thing more easily so what I may be thinking at this point is this is going to print for example Sarah you have 12 years left before you reach 100 if someone called Sarah who's 88 uses the program now what do you think will this actually work in in fact it doesn't and can you guess why well let's try running it and see what it does so I run it and it says enter your name my name is John enter your age I'm 48 I don't know where the years have gone a lot of them went on programming let's run it and I get a trace back and what does it say well it says the problems occurring on line four of my file here and it says type error unsupported operan types for minus int and stra so minus is an operator and the things that we give to the operator to work with so this and this they're called operand and it's telling me you can't subtract a string from an INT so when input returns text it returns it as has a string so H here is actually a string it may look like a number but it's a string and then we can't do a calculation with a string we can't take 100 and subtract some text from it that's a problem what we have to do is something called casting we have to change this from a string to let's say an INT or a float I have to cast it from a string to an INT and we can do that by using the int builtin function so I just need to pass age to the int builtin function and that is going to convert this string to an integer and then I can subtract that integer from 100 however this program still doesn't work can you guess why let's try it and see what happens enter your next name John 48 now the error is at line six and it says can only concatenate stra not int two stra so the problem Now lies in here so we've got years left which now has the type int but we're trying to join it to Strings right right so we can add two integers together with plus and we can concatenate two strings with plus but we can't join an INT to a string with plus so this fails what we have to do is convert this years left to a string and then we can join it with other strings name is already a string so that's not a problem but what we want to do here is just join a bunch of strings and this is not a string as you can see if you use the type function to print its type so let's convert it to a string with the stra builtin function and now we'll try this enter your name John age 48 John you have 52 years left before you reach 100 what a cheerful thought actually it's not bad 52 years I'm probably not going to live to be 100 H who cares now it's pretty easy to break this program let's try and see if we can break it enter your name John enter your age 120 what does this do well it says you've got minus 20 years left before you reach 100 which I suppose if I was 120 would sort of be true let's let's try running it and entering something that can't be converted to an INT and now we get a trace back we get an error later on we'll see how we can fix those errors how we can handle them but for now it's enough just to be able to write little programs that do calculations so what I would suggest is that you put this code away and see how much you can write from memory if the is not very much that's fine then you're going to have to look at the code to be able to finish writing the rest of it but while I don't Advocate making a huge point of memorizing things I think it is good practice to try putting code away and seeing how much you actually do remember if you try to type it out and run it because that will tell you which bits you've forgotten and if the answer is all of it that's okay just look at the code but have a go see if you can write this yourself first from memory and then look at the program if you can't do that this is a free video from my Python and machine learning course I'm uploading some videos from the start of the course to get you started with python the full course is absolutely huge and teaches you Python and the basics of machine learning and artificial intelligence with a ton of exercises and solutions please click the link in the description for the full course
