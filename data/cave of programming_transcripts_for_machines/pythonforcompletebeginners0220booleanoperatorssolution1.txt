in this video we're going to look at the first of two possible solutions and there are others actually to this exercise now this is quite a difficult exercise if you haven't done anything like this before but what I would say is that firstly if you try to do it that's really the practice that you need the object is not necessarily to be able to do this at this stage the object is that you should practice and try to figure out how to do these kinds of things it is that trying that will cause you to gradually make progress whether you actually get the answer in the end or not secondly if you've tried to do this exercise and you couldn't manage to do it correctly you might feel at some point during this video that you've now got enough knowledge that you could actually do it maybe that won't even happen till the end of the video and it's a good idea then to pause the video at that point and have another go at it so first of all we've got to ask the user if they're a student if they have pets and if they smoke so let's do that here so let's call this student and say that's equal to input are you a student question mark and let's put y/n as a hint and we'll have a little sort of character here let's use a colon for a prompt symbol I'm going to duplicate this and we want one for pets and we want one for smoking so let's say here do you have pets and do you smoke so now when we get these answers back they're not going to be Boolean variables we need to convert whatever the user types to a Boolean Ian variable so let's create some Boolean variables let's say is student equals the answer equal to Y so if they enter y then this will evaluate to true and we assign that value to is student we could also use the same variable again we could put student here and there's nothing wrong with using the VAR aable to get some value and then assigning that value back to the same variable converting student itself into a Boolean value but for clarity here I'll just use a different variable now we need to do that for the others so let's say here has pets and does smoke and now here we need pets and here we need smokes now I always recommend if you're a a beginner especially but I also do this to an extent as a professional or at least I was a professional developer in the past these days I largely make videos but I always recommend that you develop a bit of the program and then test it out by printing the values of variables because otherwise if you just write a whole program and run it and it doesn't work that's quite an unpleasant experience and it can sometimes be hard to figure out where the problem is it's much better to develop it bit by bit as you go along so let's print is student and we'll print these others as well so has pets and does smoke let's try it so we'll run the program are you a student let's say yes do you have pets I'll say no do you smoke let's say no so we've got true false false so that seems to be correct so far now the tricky bit is so one way we can approach this exercise is by combining all these into a single Boolean value and then we can print the answer as to whether or not they're allowed to rent this property and there are multiple ways to do this even using this particular approach combining booleans so I'll try to pick something that's comparatively easy so first let's take the case where they are a student let's create a variable student can rent equals now how could we set this to true or false using the information that we've got well we want to ask if there a student so is student and then we want to say and some other conditions are also true so for this person to be a student who is allowed to rent this property well that has to be true and some other conditions have to be true what are the conditions if you're a student you can only rent the property if you don't have pets and you don't smoke so let's say here and not has pets and not does smoke so I think that word decide whether they can rent or not and are a student so let's say print student can rent Let's test this out so I run this are you a student that should be are you a student are you a student okay so I'm going to say yes I am a student and do I have pets yes do I smoke no can't rent it sorry okay so are you a student yes do you smoke wait do you have pets let's say no do you smoke yes still can't rent it are you a student yes do you have pets no do you smoke no true you can rent it and if I say I'm not a student shouldn't really matter what I type after that it's going to come back false because they're not a student that is allowed to rent the place because they're not a student let's tackle the other case where they are not a student so non student can rent equals not is student so they're not a student okay so if you're not a student you're allowed to rent this property if you smoke or you have pets but not both so let's say not is student and not does smoke and has pets so this will only be true if both of these things are true and then we turn that to fults for a not so we're saying there a non student who who is allowed to rent this property only if they're not a student to start with and it's not true that they both smoke and have pets as well so let's say print non student can rent so now let's run this and try it out and see if this bit works the second bit so if I say I am not a student let's say I am a student to start with I am a student and I don't have pets and I don't smoke second bit should be false because this is only for non students let's try it again and say say I'm not a student do you have pets yes do you smoke no true I'm allowed to rent are you a student no do you have pets no do you smoke yes then I'm allowed to rent but if I say I'm a non student not a student and I have pets and I also smoke I'm not allowed to rent so I think the second bit works and now we can combine them into a single variable let's say can rent equals student can rent or non student can rent so if either of those are true then we're fine now let's print this out so print can rent and if I run this okay actually I'm going to get rid of these CU we don't need these anymore okay let's try this so are you a student let's say I am and I don't have pets or smoke then I can rent be nice if I got some text here actually can rent colon and let's just convert this to a string okay let's run this so are you a student yes and I don't have pets and I don't smoke I can rent but if I say I am a student and I have pets but don't smoke can't rent if I'm a student I don't have pets but I smoke can't rent what about if I'm a non student and I have pets and I smoke I can't rent what about if I'm a non student and I have pets but I don't smoke I can rent and if I'm a non student I don't have any pets I do smoke I can also rent I think this works pretty well seems to be okay if I type see here I type y y by mistake that's going to end up being considered false because of the way I've done this comparison let's just try that again so I want to put in here that I'm not a student I do have pets and I do smoke not a student I have pets and I smoke can't rent I think this works this is complicated right it's pretty complicated I don't think most programming is even as complicated as this to be honest and this isn't the only way to do this so I could have set can rent in a single line by combining all of these conditions together without using these intermediate student can rent and nonstudent can rent variables and there are other ways of doing it I could have broken it down further I could have maybe combined this into a single variable and so on so hopefully you see the general idea of this approach you've got an idea of how this approach works so if you haven't already written this program I would suggest having another go it now you've seen how I approached it if you find yourself just tearing your hair out eventually and you get sick of it and just leave it you might come back to it later on even in six months or something after more practice but it it's definitely worth having a serious go at trying to do this because you'll learn a lot about Boolean variables and how to think in a Boolean logic type of a way but at the end of the day if it's just too frustrating don't sweat it the important thing is to just spend some time practicing whether you get the answer in the end or not eventually you'll be able to write programs that work but that can take some practice so while that's always the aim at this stage if you can't do that I wouldn't beat yourself up about it just practice and your skills will gradually improve hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artif IAL intelligence until next
