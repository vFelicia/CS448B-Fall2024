hello before we go on to look at some worked examples of what we've seen so far I've got just a few more tips for you and these most of them relate to the course specifically first of all the source code if you go to github.com slash cave of programming this is where I keep my public source code so you can look at this look at whatever you want but if you click on repositories' and then go to find Java beginners 11 in the list click on that you can find here all the source code that we're working on so if I want to see this source code I can actually browse it and see it here which is helpful I noticed that when I provide these repositories some people want to download the whole thing and and build all the applications I would recommend not doing that you can do it if you want to but I would recommend not downloading it because you don't learn anything like that really what this is best useful is just consulting it if you've got something wrong somewhere and you can't figure out what it is of course you can look back at the video but it's probably easier to look at this source code in many cases so take a take a look at that and if you keep it open while you work then you can refer back to it okay so a second thing that I'm going to say here is to get the most out of the course always type out code and experiment with it so you could you can't learn programming just by watching videos it's like learning the piano or the violin or learning a human language for that matter if you just watch videos you aren't going to learn it what you have to do is use the videos as a source of inspiration and information type any code that I type in the videos make sure at some point you type it out yourself and even better try to think how could you change that code without breaking a program try to make some meaningful change to it experiment with it and the more you do that the more you'll learn you will find sometimes you'll create bugs and errors maybe you won't be able to fix them but if you spend some time trying to figure out why your program doesn't work even if you never actually figure out why that is at this stage all the time you spend doing that puzzling over it will really help especially if rather than just looking at it you also experiment with it try out putting the values of variables you know try to try to experiment with it kind of physically change the code try to get it to work and to run but the main thing here is type everything out and also experiment with it a little bit try to change it and still have it run in a meaningful way and do something useful because you won't learn just by watching videos it's a practical skill like learning the piano let's take a look at this one so I would say focus on practice not memorization or notes and the reason that I say this is because I've seen beginners try to learn programming by like they have a lesson or they watch some videos and they make endless notes on it or they try to they really strain their brains trying to memorize everything and I would say that's not an effective way to learn the effective way to learn is to practice think of it just like learning the guitar or whatever you gotta practice practice is the key to it so don't worry too much about memorizing things don't worry too much about making notes but practice everything so everything that you want to learn you have to actually try it out yourself check that it works experiment with it a little bit if you do that enough you will learn programming bit by bit you may sometimes feel very puzzled but eventually you're getting the hang of it and it's really a question of how much time you spend doing that you have to practice and a lot of practice is going to be needed but the good news is that after a certain programming tends to be addictive people tend to get addicted to it and time flies by not everyone has that experience but many people do that you start writing programs and when you reach a certain level of fluency you you get into this state of mind where you're just curious and you think well I could add I could add this new feature to this program see if that works and it becomes an addictive process for many people and that can really help with the practice if you're addicted to something of course you'll practice it a lot don't forget to go outside though you know and take breaks don't screw yourself up with programming but practice is the key and finally this is optional learn to touch type touch typing means being able to type on your keyboard without looking at the keyboard now I think only about half of all programmers for a guess have this skill and the others do what we call hunting and pecking they hunt and peck so they keep looking down at their keyboard they use 1 2 3 however many fingers and they just type the characters one by one that's fine it's totally fine but if you want to learn even faster then learn to touch tight you can find free touch typing programs on the Internet if I search for free touch typing you can find various links it to programs online they use on the internet that teach you to touch type and it's actually not that hard to learn to touch type probably most people can do it in a few weeks or less especially if you start touch typing your emails it's difficult at first to make the transition from hunting and pecking to touch typing but you can learn this quite quite quite quickly and when you learnt it your typing speed will increase a lot now although typing speed isn't a big deal in programming you can type slowly and you know you're still going to still going to be writing programs programming is not primarily about typing speed it's not so important but a major reason that people get discouraged with programming is they just feel it's taking them too long and too much effort to write code so they avoided writing code and you can earn a lot more effectively if you touch type for this reason in my opinion you can learn faster because you're less discouraged from writing code you don't think well how long will it take me to type out total height or you know how long you don't think like that instead you think and your fingers do the typing more or less so touch typing can help make you less reluctant to type code and by doing that it makes it easier to learn coding nevertheless that is optional and probably half of all programmers something like that they just hunt and peck they don't learn touch typing so it's up to you okay so until next time happy coding
