hello in this video we're going to start looking at variables and variables are one of the most important basic building blocks of computer programs so we'll get started with them here I've created a project called integer variables I've given it a a class called app which has a main method and I put one statement in there it just says hello so you should try that yourself and check it you can run it and then let's add some more code to this so what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually click after the opening bracket here and hit return a couple of times just so that I can get a couple of blank lines above this statement and after the opening curly bracket and here I'm going to type well we need a name for our variable and we need to think about what it's actually going to refer to a variable is it's kind of a way of referring to some sort of value or some sort of entity that can change as your program progresses and that's why it's called a variable because it varies let's imagine that you keep cats and you've got some quantity of cats in your house so what we want is a variable that can hold the number of cats we've currently got maybe maybe sometimes your friend takes some of them or you know you you require more cuts so the number of cats that you've got can change okay so I'm gonna write here int and in a space and in cats and then a semicolon so what's going on here well first of all let's deal with this yellow warning so you see this yellow underlining here and in the margin there's a little yellow icon it's like a light bulb with a exclamation mark in this version of Eclipse if I hover over it it says the value of the local variable cats is not used what it's telling me is that I've created a variable a thing called a variable and I'm not using it and that's true so warnings are things that you might want to pay attention to in your program you don't really want to have any warnings in your program when you run it but unlike an error a warning won't stop your program actually running so I can actually run this program still it does actually run so if you see a red icon here all this red underlining that's an error and an error is a problem it will stop your program compiling you won't be able to run it but this is just a warning so he can run it okay now what have we done here well this is a statement finishes in semicolon and we've essentially said that it's a bit like creating a sort of bucket in this case it's a bucket big enough to hold numbers and it's the right type of bucket for holding numbers if you wanted to hold text or something we'd need something different so int is we call it the type of the variable and int is a primitive data type we call it in Java and cats is just a name I've made up to it's like sticking a label on a bucket and writing caps on it so we've got our bucket which can hold numbers because we've used the keyword int and we've stuck a label on that bucket called and written cuts on it int is short for integer and integers integer just means a whole number it can be positive or negative but it's a number so we can assign a value to that let's do this so I'm going to go to maybe the next line and write cats equals seven semicolon what have we done now well we've taken a number seven and we've stored it in this variable or we we say that we've assigned the value seven to this variable and it's like taking the number seven putting it in our bucket this is going to sing confusing at first but after you after you practiced it a bit it won't be and finally let's output this value so I've got a system dot out dot print line here and I'm gonna get rid of this text so get rid of the stuff in the speech marks so it looks like this and then between these round brackets I'm going to type cats so we're saying display the value of this variable let's click run and then it says there in the console it says seven so just to go through that again quickly we wanted a variable that can refer to a number and we've written int that's short for integer because we want to create some space in the computer's memory essentially that can hold a number and this this process here we call it declaring a variable and really it's like creating a bucket of the right size and type to hold a number and then sticking a label on it and writing caps on that label here we've assigned the value to the variable and that's a bit like taking the number seven and putting it in this bucket so we say that we've assigned I've assigned a value to the variable cats and it's we that value is 7 that we've assigned and then finally we printed the value so that comes out on a console try this for yourself and the order matters you've got to have these in a right order and check that you can get this to work and then we'll see what we can do with variables so until next time happy coding
