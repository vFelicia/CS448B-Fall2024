in this video we're going to take a look at defining a function in Python and in this section of the course in general we'll be taking a good look at functions and what they are and how to use them in programming in general there are three basic paradigms let's say for structuring your code you can write procedural code and an example of a procedural programming language might be C this means that you structure your code into functions which call each other and that's what what we're going to be looking at in this section of the course we have so far been basically writing procedural code we just haven't defined our own functions yet we can also have objectoriented programming languages an example of one of those will be Java and this means that your program consists of objects which interact with each other and in fact in Python almost everything is actually an object even a number is an object we can also have functional programming languages I'm only aware of one pure functional programming language and that's hascal and this means that basically you pass functions to each other and in functional programming in general you avoid things like loops and various other things that we haven't really discussed yet in favor of functional programming techniques so where does python actually fit into this what kind of programming language is it well like many other programming languages you can do elements of all of these in Python so python is basically an objectoriented language but we can also do procedural programming in it and we can do functional programming and we'll be looking at all three of these in this course in this section we'll focus on procedural programming let's start by writing a simple program I'll say response here just a variable I've made up equals input how are you then the user is going to enter something and we'll check the response let's say if response equals okay and let's check for the lowercase version as well or response equals okay then in that case I'm going to print excellent now we could check for other responses but I'll just have an else here and say print oh no so notice here that when I have this or I have to repeat response so here I'm checking is response okay uppercase letters and here I'm checking is response okay lowercase letters I can't just write if response equals okay or okay I've got to repeat the response variable this is something that sometimes confuses beginners because in everyday speech we would say if response is okay or okay but here we have to explicitly say what we're comparing both times is response okay or is response okay with lowcase letters now let's try this program out so I'm going to say Python and the name of the file how are you let's say okay it says excellent I'm going to put a some punctuation there in a space let's run it again so okay lowercase letters that works as well how are you let's say I'm bad and it says oh no now we might want to use this code multiple times within our program or it might be part of a library of code that we're building up it might be just one thing that we can do and we have to do this quite often when we're writing programs so we want to sort of package it up somehow and one thing we can do is put this in a function how do we do that well let's go up here to above where we've written the code and I'm going to say defa and this is short for Define and I'm going to make up a name just like I do with variables and just like with variables I'm going to use lowercase letters and I'm going to separate them with underscores if I have more than one word and if I want to use numbers that's fine but a number can't be the first thing in the name so let's call this maybe ask user status now unlike when I'm creating a variable I need round brackets here and open and close round bracket and then I need a colon just like we have when we're creating an if statement or a for Loop or something now I've got an error here now and that's because this stuff now needs to be indented to say it's part of this ask user status function let's just select all of this and hit the Tab Key and I might as well get rid of this blank line here not that it makes any difference to the program when it's running now what does this do well if we run this now nothing happens at all what we've done here is we've defined a function a function is just a block of code which you can run whenever you need it to actually make the function run I have to call the function so let's go down here and get rid of all of the indent and then just type ask user status and the round brackets the round brackets are what clue you in to the fact that it is actually a function and notice I'm not going to repeat the defa keyword here here I'm not trying to define a function I'm just trying to make this function run I'm just trying to call this function so if I run this now let's see what happens how are you so it's actually running the code and you can see that it works so I can now run this block of code whenever I want it in my program I could run it again immediately if I wanted to I could even run it in a loop let's try this how are you okay and it just asks me again how are you okay but I'll delete the second invocation for the moment so try this out for yourself type out some code that does something and then put it in a function by adding def a function name open and close round brackets and the colon above that code and you have to indent the code to say that it's part of this function and then you can call the function within your program you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
