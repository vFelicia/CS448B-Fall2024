hello this is John from cave our programming calm in this video we're going to take a look at arrays in JavaScript and nodejs continuing my course on nodejs and javascript for complete beginners so in the last video we took a look at four loops and now we're going to look at arrays so let's create a new file here in visual studio code and I'll call it a raised dot yes and as usual I'm going to write you strict at the top so an array is a list of items it's a you can think of it like a numbered list of items so let's let's create a variable I'm going to call this days and I'm going to set it equal to and now we've we've seen variables that have there are the type text so I could write you know days equals hello or whatever and we've seen numerical variables like 7.3 but I can actually set a single variable equal to a whole list of things and the way we do that is well there are various ways to do this in JavaScript but again here I'm going to concentrate in this first part of the course on stuff that is similar to what you get in other programming languages and there is also very common in JavaScript just concentrating on the simplest ways of doing things and fundamental building blocks so we write two square brackets here and then the usual semicolon and in these two square brackets I can put a list of things now its usual to put a list of things that are all the same type although you don't have to so here I'm going to write days of the week let's have Sunday Monday Tuesday and that's enough I think so this this is like it's like a shopping list of well days in this case which is a bit weird but each of these items is numbered starting at 0 and the fact that that things in an in an array on numbered starting at zero does tend to confuse beginners but you just have to sort of get used to it so to actually access a we call these things elements we call the items in an array elements of the array and to actually access them we we do it like this let's write console.log and access an element of this array so the first one would be so the variable name and then square brackets and then a number like that so we're this is item zero in the array so here we use square brackets to actually initialize a variable this is here we're using square brackets to actually create an array and here now that we've got the variable we're using those same square brackets with just an integer inside to access elements of the array and this is sometimes called dereferencing dereferencing the array so if we run this program then let's run node arrays j/s we get sunday the first item in the array we could also have for example set a variable equal to this let's try that with the second element at index 1 so that's right let let day equal days one and then console.log day so because we start numbering at zero item number one in the array is Monday so we've got 0 1 & 2 and here we're just with dereferencing the array getting a value out of it and getting an element from the array and we were using it to initialize this variable day and then outputting it let's try that I'm just gonna clear my console no we've got Monday let's let's that well was that didn't want that there okay let's try and the final element so the final element days of course at index 2 and that is Tuesday you can you can have a raise that are absolutely massive so there we go Tuesday we've got three elements here but and you know if you're having to initialize arrays by hands sort of hardcoding and literal values like this then you're not going to have many values because it's going to get boring to tighten them but you could for example initialize an array from values in a file or from values that you've created somehow and arrays can then potentially have you know even millions tens of millions or whatever entries in them so you can put a lot of stuff in array we could have an array of numbers for example so let's write let what should we call this I don't really know heights equal imagine this is these are Heights or a bunch of people so we have the square brackets and then we have how are they going to be 1.7 may be meters one point six five one point five one point nine and we can do the same thing with that just you know like consult logs so for example this will be our index two in the array so that's index zero one two three so that's output it Heights to JavaScript unlike many more strict programming languages doesn't always force you to put that semicolon at the end of a statement but it is a good idea to put it in okay let's try running this and we get one point five down there we can mix things of different types in JavaScript arrays so let's maybe first though look at how we would iterate through an array so one thing to say is that we can get the length of an array so we can do that like this let's get the length of this Hight's array console.log height length so we used the variable name of the array and then dot length and that that tells us how many items are in the array so if you run this we see there are four items that's that's right here items in heights array I tend to revert using double quotes because they're probably more common in programming languages so I'm used to typing them but I I do sort of prefer single quotes for JavaScript personally I don't know I just think it looks nicer anyway let's let's try this so items in height sorry for so we've got four items in the heights array but notice the last item would be at index 3 so one less than the length of the array and that's because we start numbering at zero and this this can be confusing sometimes we call it the off by one problem or related problems we call them the off by one problem you have to remember that the last element of the array is a index length minus one so we can actually iterate through the whole array and output every item in it with a for loop and if you've been following this course from the start and you're a relative beginner I would recommend now trying to do that yourself see if you can work out how to do it can you use a forloop to output every item in an array like this one and I'm going to show you how to do it so if you want to have a go at that pause the video and try it so let's write four I can use let I equal zero I less than Heights length I plus plus and then we can use ie to access all the items in the array so I can write console.log heights square brackets I let's maybe put some text here so the output isn't too confusing item in Heights array I can even put item it's right item I in Heights array let's try that and see what it looks so what we what it looks like so we get this so this stuff here and we've output successfully the entire array now in JavaScript we can actually put things of different types in arrays so I could write here hello like that and if I now try to output that array you know it still works but it has to be said that in general in programming if you have an array like this generally you're going to put things at the same type in it and generally you're going to write code that treats the elements in the array all in the same kind of a way so you won't want them to be all the same kind of a thing all right we'll leave it there for this video and the thing to do as always if you're confused by this or even if you're not if if you have if you're not used to working with arrays and using for loops and things you just just this try out for yourself try to get to a point where you can just write it out from memory I don't think it's helpful to take notes I do think it's helpful to type this stuff out even multiple times until you can do it from memory and don't forget you can also find my github repository at get TOCOM slash cave of programming and then go to the go to the repository for this course if you want to browse the source code online okay we'll leave it there for now until next time happy coding
