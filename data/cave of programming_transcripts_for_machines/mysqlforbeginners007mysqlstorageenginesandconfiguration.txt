hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to take a look at my sequel database engines so although this is not a tutorial on my sequel database administration it is a tutorial on using my sequel as as an end user and on learning sequel and working with in my sequel database nevertheless there are some configurable configuration options that affect how my sequel works so before we go any further we're going to have to take a look at some configuration related stuff because you're going to need to know that in order to predict how your queries are actually going to work so I'm I've already typed a used tutorial one but there's no harm in typing it again so we're using the right database and now I'm going to type show engines and execute that now what on my sequel engine is is it's a module a part of my sequel that deals with your sequel and constructs tables basically I'm not sure if the actual code that passes your queries is part of the engine but certainly the part of my sequel that constructs tables and decides what they can do what it can't do that's called an engine and there are my sequel supports various different engines now most of these I haven't used but there are two really important ones that you should know about historically my sequel as I remember it this is according to my memory and I've been working with my sequel probably since around 1999 I think historically my sequel was built around and I don't know how to plants these names but I'll make up for pronunciation it was built around this my by some engine now that was while it was a good start but it didn't support some really important features of databases it didn't support as I remember it didn't support trans and I presume still dozen it didn't support foreign keys even which as we'll see later on are really important to use so it was a big step forward later on when my sequel came out with this I know DB engine which does support transactions does support foreign keys and if you do show engines hopefully you'll see that I know DB is set to the default now it's possible to change which engine you use and you're probably not going to want to for this tutorial you're going to want to make sure that I know DB is the default engine unless there's something even newer and better that's come out since this tutorial in which case you could switch to that but in this tutorial we're going to be using the I know T V engine it is possible to it's possible to specify on a table by table basis which engine your table uses and again most of the time that's probably going to be pretty useless but it's quite common that if you see a sequel script that's intended to be executed to create a complete database after every table it will specify which engine each table is using and it's normally going to be the same engine every time and it's normally going to be I know dB so in case you see that in the script is kind of important to know about if we type in here show table and status we can see which engine each of our tables is using we've only got one table at the moment and it's using the default I know DB but I could change that and there are a number of ways they could change it so let's create a table let's call it test and I'll give it just one column so let's say int int and I'm going to say next after this bracket I'm going to say engine equals and pick a different engine so the only one I've actually used is this my I son so let's go ahead and try that so I've executed that I've created the table and now let's look at show table status and we see that we've got a test table using this my I some database I'm going to delete that for a moment let's say drop the table test and we'll see another way of doing that so another way you could do this is you could set the default storage engine for your for your session so you could say set default yeah this is right I think set default storage engine equals my I son let's try that looks good and now let's do show tables so there are tables just to remind ourselves we've only got one table now called users and I'm gonna do show tables status okay that's good and that's also do show engines so we see that this one say we've got users is using I know DB as we saw before SH let's do the shell engines now we can see that my I son is set to the default so we'll try creating another table so great table I'll call it test again I'll say it's just a one column ID and I won't specify a storage engine so I'll execute that and then we'll do show table status and now we can see that the default really has been changed to my I son as we we also saw when we did when we did show and show engines struggling to remember because these are commands that I very infrequently use most of the time you don't need to bother with this but I'm just want to show you show you this so you kind of are familiar with it and you're not puzzle if you come across it and you do want to make sure we show engines you do want to make sure that I know DB is set to the default so let's set I know the DB back to the back to the default and say set default storage engine equals I know DB I don't think capital letters make a difference though but I'll put it all in capitals because that definitely works and then again we'll do show engines and now we can see yeah I know DB is back to the default now if you let's say you've got my sequel installed and you find you're using it's a recent version of my sequel so it supports IMDB but you're for some crazy reason you find that is using my I some you can change it in your session as we've just seen or you can specify it after every table that you should use I know DB if necessary if you're the administer administrator of your my sequel server yourself you can also change this in a config file so this is this is not what this is kind of taking is a little bit away from the point of this course as a whole but I'm just gonna demonstrate that quickly so if you look in the my sequel folder you'll find this a my sequel dot CNF if you're using Linux or some kind of UNIX type system like the Mac and it's probably going to be called dot ini' if you're using Windows now although this is present in my my sequel installation folder here in fact on the Mac and you would have to check this if you want to do if you want to do it for Windows you have to check where the default location of this file actually is because it's actually not here this isn't the one that's actually being read on my system which is a Mac so let's go to a terminal now and again if you're not familiar with the terminal really don't worry about it because it's this taking us off the main point of this tutorial anyway but what I had to do was I had to go to where this file is actually located it's going to see the user local my sequel which is where it happens to be great it happens to be located on my mark and it could be different for yours and this is it's really just a kind of demo dummy configuration file and if we look at it is pretty simple it's just most of the most of these options are just comments or they just commented out but what I did do what I've already done here and I've added this myself because at least in my version here it didn't already exist I've added this option default storage engine equals my by some so this is how you can configure it if you want to so on my mark there actual location that this file is really read from is in slash etc and of course it's going to be different on different systems so you have to Google this if you want to do it so here's my my dot CNF it will be my dot any on Windows I'm gonna do sudo fine my dot CNF so I'm just using some unix commands i'm familiar with already you could edit this in any editor as long as you have to make sure it's not readonly otherwise you know you're not gonna be able to save it and this first check that there is an already a default storage engine option in there and there isn't here so that's of it in fact let's stop the server first let's go to the system preferences and just i'm gonna stop the my sequel server and if i get a right bad name password for my mac it will really help a lot more haste in their speed okay so I've stopped here now I'm gonna put in here default storage engine just like the edited the nonworking demo version but now I'm really editing the version that's actually being used so I'm going to talk to my I son right in here and this is my sequel D session so I've saved that and I'm gonna start my server again let's go to System Preferences start my sequel server then I'll go back to my my sequel workbench and I'm gonna quit it stop course is probably still not working we open a connection and I'm gonna do show engines we don't actually after you do use database before show engines your show engines doesn't apply to a particular database and we can see here that my I son is set to the default so before I do anything else I'm going to set it back to I know DP because einem DB is the one at least at the moment that you really want to be using so I'm just going to comment this out with a hash sign which is a common symbol that just turns this into a line that's not going to be actually read and I probably should have stopped the server really before I read it today but in any case I'm going to stop it now and restart it and we're gonna go to the workbench when it's running do so engines probably I need to reopen a connection show engines and now we see I know DP is the default game so now that the thing that you really want to take away from this tutorial is you need to do show engines and check that IMDB is the default fuel system if it isn't and you are the administrator of your server you can change the default in a config file and that will make sure that even after you restart the server I know DP will remain the default if you're not the administrator you have a choice between either using set store set default storage engine set set storage engine is what it used to be when I set default storage engine equals I know DB you could use that but we have to remember to do it every time you open a connection to my sequel or you could specify it every time after you create a table like create table test ID int and equals equals I know DB but that's kind of a lot of hassle so if you're lucky just do show engines and you'll find it is the default already okay that's it for this tutorial until next time happy coding
