in this video we're going to take a look at if else so we'll take this program here and it's important of course to make sure you've got a working version of this before enlarging it further I'm going to go to the last line in this code block here that the if applies to so we'll go to the next line and I'm going to delete the indent and write else colon and here let's say print your name is not John or whatever you want to write there so what does this do well it's probably fairly selfexplanatory if this condition is true this code will be executed if this condition isn't true this code will be executed so this if else statement only ever executes one of the two code blocks it's either going to execute this if the condition's true or this if the the conditions false let's try it out enter your name John and it says your name is John hello and then program finished of course always executes because it's not part of this if out statement and if I type some other name it's going to say your name is not John or whatever you've put here and program finished again notice that the else has to be flush up against the left hand margin whereas the code in the else block the else code block that has to be indented by however much you've decided to indent things by so I've been using four spaces therefore this must be indented by four spaces also otherwise you'll get a syntax error and we've got a colon here as well after the else keyword try it out for your yourself and if you can think of any way to experiment with it that will usually help to improve your understanding a simple thing you could do is just add more lines right here into the else Clause hello you've been watching a free sample from my Python and machine learning for complete beginners course I'm uploading enough videos from the start of the course to get you started with python and machine learning the full course is absolutely massive if you're interested in it please click the link in the description the complete course covers not only basic python but also some fairly Advanced python even some desktop programming stuff and then goes on to machine learning and artificial intelligence until next time happy coding
