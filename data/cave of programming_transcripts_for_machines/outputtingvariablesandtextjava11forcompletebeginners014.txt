hello in this video we're going to take a look at outputting variables so so far we've got this really simple program and I've created a copy of this and I've called it outputting variables so maybe create a new program yourself and we're going to change this code okay so one thing I should say here is that it's it's really really valuable to just type stuff over and over again I think it's it's too easy to imagine that programming is primarily an intellectual exercise of course it is an intellectual exercise but a lot of the learning that you need to undertake is kind of related to your fingers it you have to get into the habit of typing things and getting used to typing them and you sort of develop a kind of almost a muscle memory and you get used to just typing particular programming constructs so rather than copy your last project always type it out again for the moment and if you want to really accelerate your learning learn to touch tight tight without looking at the keys and you can find lots of programs on the internet too to help you with that but anyway okay so I've got this program here and we're out putting the value total but I can actually add some text to that so within the round brackets here of system dot out dot print line I'm going to write total number of animals let's put a colon there this is just text and then a space and then I'll close the speech mark like this and then after the closing speech mark here so after this I'm going to put a space and a plus space and then total now before we discuss what this is let's see it running let's run it and it says total number of animals 12 which is much more helpful if you're actually going to write a program for example I don't know to help you calculate something help you do your tax whatever obviously it's very useful to output text with your numbers so we've already used a plus sign here and what this plus sign did was we added the values stored in these two variables together or as a quick way of saying that I could say that it adds these two variables together yeah it's the number of cats the number of dogs adding cats and dogs these two variables are both have type int or integer variables now what we're doing here is something different the plus sign actually has a different meaning we've got some text here and we are adding a an integer to it so you can't add text to integers you can't add like the word giraffe to the number 13 let's say it makes no sense what this is actually doing is it's turning this number into some text and concatenating it with this text so it's essentially it's joining the number to some text it's kind of a text operation and the result is what we see in the console below which is this we can also output so after we've declared the variables and given them values we can output all of them if we want let's write that let's try that let's write this out control space and number of carts and plus cats notice that I left a space before the closing speech mark the everything within the closing speech mark within the speech marks is just text so even this space is just some text but it looks nicer when its output if we put space there because we got this nice space here and it's really important to strive for legibility and beauty in all of your coding it'll make it a lot easier so if I write number of cats and then plus cats and then output that let's run it so it says number of cats seven total number of animals twelve let's output the number of dogs as well so I'm going to write it here number of dogs one thing this is really useful for is helping you to get bugs out of your code because whatever variables you have in your program you can quickly output the values of them just using this owl system dot out dot print line and that can be very very helpful so now we're outputting the number of cats dogs and the total number of them let's take a look there we go and let's also add some other number of animals in here so I could write int what else would you keep in your house maybe some people keep rats I don't see how it's going to be possible to keep all these animals from devouring each other but anyway so interrupts equals let's say we've got three rats which is three too many in my opinion but you know each to their own so we've said in total equals cats plus dogs we can just add another plus there and we can write rats we can add them all together cats plus dogs plus rats let's output the number of rats as well since we've output the number of cats and dogs number of rats and plus rats so we were just using this plus to join the number of rats with this text here okay finally let's try this and there we go we've got a number of cats number of dogs number of rats and the total animals is fifteen which is too many but there you go ok try this for yourself experiment a little bit add add stuff together doesn't to the animals can be whatever you want the important thing is to type it out and create your project from scratch as well don't copy it copying is useful but at this stage the important thing is to get practice writing out code okay so until next time happy coding
