hello this is John from cave of programming calm this is another video in my course on programming in JavaScript and note nodejs in this video we're going to do something that's completely optional you don't need it to follow the course but it's a really good thing if you do do it and that is we're going to set up a git repository on github and that's going to be where we're going to store our code so if you go to github calm so github is it's when you go to it you're gonna see something different to this I've already created an accounts on there but let's maybe see things and log out so I can see something more like what you'll see when you go to it so you'll see this create a free account on there now what is this well we're gonna use version control software called git you don't have to to follow this course but I am going to and get stores your code somewhere it's going to store it in what we call a remote repository and github.com allows you to create remote repositories for free so you can store your code and you can either make it public or keep it private completely for free at least at the time I'm making this tutorial so create a free account on there and sign into it and then you kind of want to create a new repository so your screen might look different to mine when you sign into geeks I've been using this for quite a while as you can see but somewhere you'll find a button to create a new repository and you need to click that ok you need to give it a name so I'm gonna call this node J s I think that will probably do the trick why not yeah and you can type a description of it if you want source code for JavaScript and node J s for beginners up to you what you put you can choose to make it public or private if you're embarrassed about people seeing your code you might want to make it private I'm gonna make mine public so that you can look at my source code examples here you can add a readme file if you want that's always a good thing to do I'm gonna tick to say yes I want a readme file in there you can always add it later and then this is get ignore file and what this is it's a file that contains lists of files that are going to be present in the directory that you're working in but you don't want to store them in your source code repository and there are various standard getting more files that we can use here I don't know if there is one for JavaScript now I don't know I thought it was actually yeah this one for node look so if you search for node and select that that's a good one license you can change that as well I'll use the MIT license which as far as I understand means anyone can use my source code for anything I'm not sure if they even have to attribute attribute me but I don't care here you can use my source code for this course as you see fit and then when you've done all that and decided on all that just click create repository and this doesn't usually take long here we go so this is a source code repository which we're going to check code into as we go along now I'm going to click this clone or download button I mean those copy this this URL here and I'm going to go to my terminal now we can actually do this I believe from within visual studio code I haven't looked up how to do that but to do what I'm about to do you don't have to use the command line you can use a variety of tools that you know gets user interfaces but I'm just going to do it on the command line here I'm using a bash terminal so if you're using a Windows console instead you want to probably spend a little bit just a little bit of time just checking how to use that sort of basic usage of it windows the windows console by default will tell you where you where you are it says like C colon slash whatever it tells you where you are in the directory structure and you're gonna need to just understand the directory structure thing to follow this course you know velocities basic sort of computing if you played with a computer for a while you'll know what a directory is and so on okay so in bash though it may or may not show you where you are by default you can find out by doing PWD so if you are using bash you can type PWD and it'll tell you where you're located in a directory structure to change directories in bash I think it's the same in Windows you just do CD space and the directory that you want to change into you always need that space in bash though I think windows lets you do CD dot to go to the directory above but that doesn't work in bash you need CD space dot pretty similar really that's changed directory so if you play with that for a bit you'll get used to it so I can go to the directory above in Windows I do dare if I remember rightly to see what's in here in a bash terminal I can do whether it's on Windows or not and do LS shows me where I am and I'm just gonna change into this directory here on bash usually you can use tab as well to autocomplete directory or file names alright so anyway I'm in I'm in a directory where I am I want to put my work and I've got get working in here so I can use git if I type git it actually does something and I want to do git clone clone and then paste in that URL hit return and this is going to take my remote repository and basically create a local version of it so if I do LS now or dare I suppose dir suppose it will be in Windows console now I can see that it's created this nodejs directory it's called node.js because that's what I just called it on github comm when I created that repository I can CD into this change directory and do an S order or whatever and you can see what files are in it at the moment this is where I'm going to be creating my source code so we'll create source code in the next video I thing and we'll also look at how to check it into get okay so until next time happy coding
