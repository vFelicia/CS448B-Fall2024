hello this is John from cave of programming calm continuing the series of videos in my JavaScript and node.js for complete beginners course in this video we're going to start looking at loops in JavaScript and we're going to look at the very common while loop which is a kind of loop so I've created this file while j/s and if you are a complete beginner this is a kind of exciting step because when you start using loops that's the point at which you really leverage the power of programming to automate things so instead of typing something in your code like five times or even 50 million times which would be really impossible nearly you can you can get the JavaScript interpreter to output let's say some text or to execute some code as many times as you want let's start off by writing use strict doesn't matter what kind of quotes I use double or single but I'll try to use single because I thought I actually think they look nicer in JavaScript so the first thing we need is a variable because so we're going to execute some code repeatedly and we need to know we need to keep track of how many times we've run that code so far so I'm going to create a variable called counter let's write let counter equal I'm going to initially set it to zero and then we're going to write while so while it's a keyword and after that we have a pair of round brackets and after that I'll put a space in because I think it looks nice and we open a curly bracket and visual studio code has actually put the closing curly bracket in for me I just hit return and that lines up with the left margin which is exactly where we want it so we want a construct that looks like this and you may recognize this to an extent even if you're a total beginner because it's it's the same as what we have for an if statement and as with an if statement we're going to put a condition in here and we're going to put some code between these curly brackets here these curly brackets and the code inside them that we're going to put inside them that's called a code block so what at let's suppose we want to output some text exactly three times we can write here while counter less than three and within the loop we're going to increase the value of counter so I could write counter equals counter plus one now this every time this executes it's going to increase the value of counter by one and this sometimes confuses beginners because it looks like we're saying counter is equal to counter plus one which seems impossible on this counter is infinite I suppose maybe then it's possible I don't know but you have to remember that this is the assignment operator what it does is it takes whatever is on the right hand side and it assigns that value will stores it in this variable on the left here so we're assigning a new value to counter which is equal to counter plus 1 so if counter is 0 then 0 plus 1 gives us 1 and it stores that value encounter so the new value of counter becomes 1 we can actually write this in a shorter way just by writing counter plus plus it does the same thing it increments the value of counter it adds 1 to it so what what does this whole thing do let's first put in some text so we can before we increment counter here we can put in as many lines of code as we want and they will be executed repeatedly as I just put in some blank lines just to make it a bit clearer let's write console dot log hello semicolon so the JavaScript or the nodejs interpreter in this case is going to read down so it we declare counter and then we hit this wild keyword and it says okay is this condition true if it is then it's going to execute whatever is in this code block here when it's finished executing it it's gonna go back to the beginning go back to the beginning go back to the wild keyword that is and it will ask again is this condition true and if it is it will execute the code block again it keeps doing that until it finds that the condition is false when the condition is false it's no longer true then it won't execute this it will go on to whatever is after that in the program that's right console dot log finished and this may seem confusing if you're a beginner but a thing is to try out and play with it a bit yourself so let's run it now I'm going to write node while j/s and we see we've got three hellos exactly and then it says finished so if you prat if you just practice this a little bit you should be able to figure out how to output some text exactly the number of times that you want notice it's not gonna work if we if we don't increment counter here that's a vital working part of it it's quite common to forget that so when you're writing while loops I recommend putting that in right at the start before you start filling in code that you want to execute in the loop if we comment this out here and I try to execute it I haven't actually tried this but let's try it then it's an infinite loop and I have to stop it with ctrl C which stops programs executing in the bash shell so we don't normally want infinite loops well we always have to have some way of ending the loop normally so you have to remember all the different bits of this so it can be a bit it can seem a bit counterintuitive that we sit we're saying while counter is less than 3 and yet we want to output or we want to execute whatever code is in here 3 times and the reason for that is that counter starts at 0 so we have 0 1 & 2 those are the iterations of the loop the values of the counter for those iterations so sort of show what I mean here if I write comic counter in console dot log so that we output the value of counter I'll just clear my console if I run that we can see that counter takes the value 0 1 & 2 and then when it gets to the value 3 this condition is false country is no longer less than 3 it's false so it doesn't execute that it just goes on and does the rest of the program afterwards as you can see so if you're a beginner you definitely need to practice this a little bit I'm going to give you an exercise in the next video but you have to pry would recommend practicing this before you go onto that video because otherwise the exercise it may be too hard practice it a little bit it's really not difficult it can look confusing at the start you just need a little bit of practice with it and you should be able to output whatever texts do you like exactly however many times you like okay so we'll leave it there for this video until next time happy coding
