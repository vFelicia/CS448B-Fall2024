hello to get started with writing Java programs you're gonna need two things you're gonna need the Java software that actually creates your programs and you're gonna need some sort of editor to work in so in this video we're going to take a look at installing the software that actually will take the text files that you're going to write in the Java programming language and turn them into actual Java programs and what you need is the Java standard edition as se a software development kit SDK so I'm going to search for Java SC SDK download in this course we're using version 11 of the development kit at least to start with so if I click on this link here that says Java SE development kit 11 then we go to the oracle downloads page on this page you have to be sure to check accept license agreement and then you need to download the correct installer for your platform so I'm actually using mark so I would I would download this OSX version I'd use the 64bit version so if you're using Windows download the windows director installer and you've got options for Linux as well so you need to download that and install it you probably won't encounter any problems as long as you have admin rights on your computer if you do encounter any strange error message messages or anything like that don't be afraid to type the error message out into Google or into some search engine and just Google the error message basically and find out what comes up because other people will have had the same problems but basically you shouldn't you shouldn't really encounter any problems most of the time so you just need to install the latest version of Java it there's a later version out by the time you're watching this so version 12 is actually already out and the reason I'm not planning to start off using that is because there are relatively minor changes in version 12 of Java compared to version 11 and it's not always the case that all the software you use will be compatible with the absolute latest version so it's often not a bad idea to hang back a little bit from upgrading your version of Java because otherwise you may run into incompatibility issues so I'm following a policy here in this course of using a fairly recent version at the actual time that I'm making this video so if you're watching this and version 14 is out or whatever you can use version 14 but I'm gonna stick with jar 11 at a moment even though version 12 is already out okay so try to install that get that installed and I'll see you in the next video
