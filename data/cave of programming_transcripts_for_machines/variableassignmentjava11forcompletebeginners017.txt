hello in this tutorial we're going to look at assigning values to variables so I've written a comment here actually and it's a multiline comment so if you want to have one line of comments like this that's just text on one line the next line wouldn't be a comment any more and that starts with two slashes but you can also have multiline comments with slash star and they end in star slash these stars are just decorative we don't actually need them they just look nice but that's where Clips put them in but this video is about assigning variables so if you want to have comments on multiple lines you can just think those them with slash star and finish them with star slash okay so let's declare some variables here I'm going to have int dogs equals 8 and int cats equals 3 and we can output those values so we can say dogs is that and the number of cats we're going to have cats cats and if we run that we should see what we expect this check so yes it says down here dogs eight cats three okay now we can change variables as we go along so underneath this so underneath the system dot out dot print lines underneath those let's set the number of dogs equal to the number of cats so I'm going to do that by saying dogs equals cats and we'll output them again let's try this and see what it does so if I run this now we sit we see that the the number of dogs has been set to what the number of cats was set to which is three this can be very confusing for beginners so to start with we have eight stored in the variable dogs and we have three I should say I'll use the proper language I've got three assigned to the variable castes and later on we say this this is saying here take whatever number is in cats and assign that value to the variable called dogs and then we display them again remember your your programs working downwards so it does this it does this then we output those values and then we're changing the value in dogs and then we're out putting the values again and this looks perhaps confusing because it reminds people of an equation for one thing it looks as though we're saying the number of dogs and the number of cats is the same but that's not what we're doing here this is assigning a value to the dog's variable when we write a variable and we write equals and then some value we assign a value to the variable we're actually changing the value in this dog's variable using this assignment operator technically it's not an equality operator it's an assignment operator here this equals and the value that we're giving dogs is whatever value cats as and that's three because we assign the value three to it so we end up with cats is unchanged it's still three and a number of dogs is eight by the time we run the program let's try this again so there we go with a both three now these variables don't know about each other they don't it's not like they they're not it's not like the number of dogs is forever linked to the number of cats so if I write here cats equals ten what have I done now well the value of cats was three I set the number of dogs to the number of cats I set it to three then I changed the number of cats to ten the number of dogs is still three so we should have dogs equals three and cats equals ten let's run this and that's what we've got dogs three and cats ten often I want to output the values of variables multiple times as I go through my program for example when I'm debugging and I like to just put numbers on those so here I could say 1 and this is 1 and let's say this is 2 and this is 2 makes it just a little bit clearer I think what's going on so it looks like this try that out for yourself so declare some variables you can have 2 3 however many you like display them try assigning new values to them and try assigning the value in one variable to another and display them again and if you like you can carry on change the values again output the values again in your console it's really worth doing this so you may be watching thinking that you can just memorize this and you can up to a point but you'll quickly lose the thread of what's happening if you don't practice it's very important to practice this try it out practically the more you do that the better okay so have a go at this yourself try declaring variables outputting them changing the values outputting them again and I'll catch you in the next video until then happy coding
