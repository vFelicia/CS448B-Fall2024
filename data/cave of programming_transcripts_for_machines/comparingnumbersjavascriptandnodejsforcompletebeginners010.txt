hello in this video we're going to look at comparing numbers in JavaScript if you've done programming before in some other language you can skip this video because there are no surprises in this particular one this is stuff that it's the same in many different programming languages so let's start off with you strict here because I want to force myself to declare variables now we can write console.log and we could compare for example 7 with 7 supposing we want to know if 7 is equal to 7 which it clearly is we can write 7 equals equals 7 now this equals equals here is the Equality test operator it's unlike the single equals sign which is used to assign values to variables the double equals sign is equality test operator it's used to check if two values are equal or not and it returns either true or false I say returns meaning this whole expression here will evaluate as a whole to either true or false let's run this so what like all that I called it comparing numbers so if I run node comparing numbers dot j s it says true now this is a bit useless because we know that 7 is equal to 7 but I could have one of these values stored in a variable like let's write let value well that's right let's call it days in week equals 7 and notice the way I write this variable here is called camel casing so I've written the first letter lowercase and an each subsequent word that it's made up of I write with an uppercase first letter for readability this is called camel casing and it's a very common convention in JavaScript so it's what I'm going to be using here it's important to stick to consistent coding conventions now so I can compare days in week here with seven is it equal to seven that and that's going to be of course true true whereas if I asked is equal to six or something then it's going to be false and this might not seem like much but this is sort of a key part of programming really comparing values like this this might be something you've got from user input or it's something you calculated at enormous length and then you want to check is it equal to something else in JavaScript there's also a symbol with three equal signs like this which at first glance seems to do the same sort of thing and we're going to be looking at that a video to a video video or two down the line for a moment we'll just look at equals equals now let's just copy this and I'll add like sort of a bit of text here so that we can because I'm going to have lots of these I want to keep track of which ones which okay so there's equals equals there's also less than or greater than so we could write days and we less than eight for example that will be true let's try this true and there's also greater than so days in week greater than eight so of course this this is the bit that's being actually evaluated and turned into either true or false this is just some text that I've just put there as a description so his days and we greater than eight no it's not because days in week is seven so if we run this now we should get false and we do false there's you can use less than and greater than with floating point numbers like eight point three for example if you want you know you want to compare two numbers with decimal points in them you can compare them with greater than or less than you can't do it so successfully with equals equals it should be avoided don't try to compare floatingpoint numbers or decimals or fractions whatever you want to call them with equals equals because they can't be stored in a precise way in a computer's memory so two floatingpoint numbers that seem to be equal you know they could differ by some tiny tiny amount and they won't be equal at all or you know something we could happen basically just avoid comparing floating point numbers with equality test operators in most programming languages in general it's not a good thing to do but all of these work fine with integers and it's common to use these two with floating point integers notice with the lessthan and greaterthan operators they return true if the thing at the smaller end of them if you think of them as having a small end and a large end these actual operators it's when the thing at the smaller end is smaller than the thing at the lighter end that they return true so dazing week is that smaller than eight which is that the larger end yes so that's true here we've got another operator is greater than dazing week is that the bigger end of the operator so to speak is that bigger therefore than eight which is at the smaller end no it's not so this is going to evaluate to false after a while it sort of becomes second nature to to recognize these less than and greater than so we've also got greater than or equal to I less than or equal to as copy these and change them to less than or equal to and greater than or equal to less than or equal to greater than or equal to so these this will this taking this one for start less than or equal to this is going to return true if if days in week is either less than or equal to 8 let's maybe put 7 here so if we asked firstly is it is it is dazing we less than 7 that's false it's not it's not less than 7 because it's equal to 7 but if I write is dazing me less than or equal to 7 less than or equal to 7 that's now true dazing we is less than or equal to 7 because it happens to be equal to 7 so if I run this now I should change the text as well here this is now true and greater than or equal to of course works in the same sort of way I'll just leave this as it is is dazing we greater than or equal to 8 false it's not greater than 8 and also it's not equal to 8 and that's why that gives me false there we go false ok so that those are all the most important comparison operators for numbers we've also got this one the identity test operator which we're going to talk about later but you know in general you can basically use that instead of equals equals wherever you feel like it with numbers here it's just going to do the same thing oh yeah there's also not equal which I should mention so if I copy these we've got not equal looks like this and we've also got a version of it with just another equals sign in which for our purposes here does the exact same thing so it's dazing ly not equal to 6 that's true it's it's not equal to 6 so if you run this we find yes it's true that it's not equal to 6 and this longer version does the same thing here we'll talk about that later so if you're a beginner and you probably are if you actually watch this video then you want to just practice these try them all out for yourself just try them all out don't worry about making notes but try them for yourself and you probably want to make sure that you can remember what they're called I suppose so this is equality test this is actually identity test which we'll look at later this is the not equal operator this is not identical and we've got less than what's this one greater than less than or equal to greater than or equal to okay try them all out and we'll move on to look at comparing strings when we finished going through these comparison operators which won't take us much longer then we will go on to actually practically using them and looking at some more of the building blocks of programming so until next time happy coding
