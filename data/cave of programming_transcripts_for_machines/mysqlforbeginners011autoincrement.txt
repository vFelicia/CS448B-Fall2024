hello this is John from kof programming do.com in this tutorial we're going to take a look at Auto incrementing primary keys so I'm going to drop my users table again get rid of it and uh I've got to actually write drop table users in there and now I'm going to recreate the table similar to what we had before so what we had before was something like this create table users and the columns are ID int which is the primary key we've got name text and email text but actually for the purposes of this tutorial let's just let's just have a name in there because it'll save a little bit of time um so um the the the only sort of problem with this uh which is a sort of problem is that the ID field here um we have to invent a unique value for it now sometimes that's what you want sometimes you're running some software or something and you naturally get an ID uh when a user creates a a new account let's say on your system and you want to insert that ID into the database and uh there are ways of of course of doing queries and checking that the new idea is unique this sort of thing but sometimes it's nice if you can just get my SQL to invent an ID for you and you can do that by making the primary key autoincrement so let's let's drop this users table again I'm going to go back to the stuff that I just typed and I'm going to after primary key so before the comma I'm going to type Auto uncore increment so this is a very MySQL specific keyword and what it does is it means that you can do inserts without specifying an ID and the ID that will be assigned to each row will just be incremented or increased from whatever the last value that was used was and it's going to start at one so let's create that table now and we'll say insert into users and now I won't specify an ID so I'll just specify the one column we've got now which is at the moment it's just the name column and we'll say values and by the way I did a bit of checking and apparently um although I've always mixed double and single quotes except where I was using a database that really wouldn't accept one one or the other apparent single quotes are considered a kind of default standard thing to use in SQL but my sqls seems to be just fine with double quotes anyway let's insert something into there let's insert Bob that's the quotes around your um text values your string values so we'll insert that and we'll do a select star from users select star from users and we can see that we've inserted Bob and even though we we didn't specify an ID this time and even though it's a primary key so it has to have a value we can see that because it's autoincrement it's automatically assign Bob the value of one and of course if you insert another value let's insert another one then it's going to go to two as you might expect so let's take a look here and now it's two uh now my SQL won't allow zero in an autoincrement column so let's take a look at that uh supposing we do specify the ID and we specify it let's say as three or Any number greater than two that's going to work and we can do the select now and we see that the ID value of three which we have specified for this Auto inrent column now it my SQL will accept that just fine it's going to accept any valid value here which is going to be anything other than zero or some value that we've already got in this column or some value that's too big to fit in there which would be a really big number but if we um if we try to insert zero we get different results now um this depends on your settings I'm pretty sure that in the past I've tried to do this and it just hasn't run the query so I'm sure that's configurable but if we just run this now and we do a select on it with the settings that I've got here which is pretty much the yeah it's just the outof thee boox settings that it came with what happens is if you specify zero for an autoincrement column as we just did just right here then um it just kind of ignores the zero and it proceeds as though you hadn't specified any value for it so it will give us give it the next available ID in the sequence okay so that's it for this tutorial have a go yourself create a table with a primary key if you want to that is try inserting into it and also see what happens if if you try to insert zero on your your system maybe it won't run the query or maybe it will just ignore it and insert an auto incremented value in any case so until next time happy coding
