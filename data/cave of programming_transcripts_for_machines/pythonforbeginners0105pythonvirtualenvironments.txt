in this video we're going to look at setting up something called a python environment and although this is strictly speaking optional it will make your life so much easier if you do it so I really strongly recommend that you do follow me and set up a python environment and they always work in a python environment so to do this firstly you need to be able to type that python command that will run the latest version of python so if I type Python 3 hyphen hyphen version I get back the version of python that I installed you need to be able to do this before you can set up a python environment once you've done that type the command that you use to run the version of python you've installed and then type hyphen m space vnf and then a space and type vmf again this is going to set up a python environment so The Hyphen m is actually saying load this thing called a module which has the name vmf and this is actually a directory name that's where we're going to put the python environment related stuff so if I run this it may take a few minutes to set up okay that was actually pretty quick and if I check what's happened if I list the content of this directory using LS or using whatever command you use on your system I can see that there is now a VM directory in there let's take a look at what's in the VMS directory so I type LS or whatever command you use and Vie EnV which is the folder that I put it in and we can see in there there is a bin subdirectory if I type LS VM slash bin I can see what's in the bin subdirectory it used to be the case on Windows I think it still is that here you would have to use the the other slash the one that slopes the other way I think Powershell will accept this forward slash even on Windows but of course you can type whatever you want as long as you can figure out how to list the contents of directories like this and we can see in here there are various these are actually programs they're scripts small programs called activate and to activate the python environment we need to use the right one for our platform now since I'm using Powershell I can use this activate dot PS1 so I need to type the name of that program to run it from the current directory let's try typing VM slash bin this may also be in a scripts folder I think it used to be but now it seems to be in a bin folder at least on my platform and then activate and in fact Powershell is not case sensitive if I type part of the file name and hit tab it actually Auto completes it for me then I'm going to have to put in dot P hit tab again and that's that's what I want notice this dot at the beginning that may not appear on Windows on Linux and Mac generally if you want to run a program you have to type a DOT which stands for the current directory and then the directory names relative to that that that may not be necessary on Windows I don't know but either way you just need to run this activate.ps1 program and Powershell does need to be running this is a Powershell script right so if you're using Powershell this is the one you need to run if you're using something else then maybe you need to run one of these others so let's try this I run this and we can see that Powershell is still running and we're running a python virtual environment which is what VM stands for virtual environment now what's the good of this well here it is if I type python now remember previously that was giving me the wrong version of python on my system but now it actually starts the right version of python this has actually started up a python shell I'm just going to quit that by typing quit and some round brackets if I type python hyphen hyphen version then we can see this is running the right version of python so one thing that this does for you is it means you can definitely type just python by itself and it will run the right version and the other thing which is perhaps more important is that now if we install extra python code which we call packages and we'll look at those later on they will install in the right place whereas otherwise it if you don't use a virtual environment or you don't set one up and you install a python package it may well install for a different version of python that's hanging around on your system and it won't work for the version that you're using so this python virtual environment tremendously simplifies the business of working with python and that's why I strongly strongly recommend it so I'm going to assume for the rest of the course that you have a console that you like using and you know basically how to navigate it maybe with a lesson CD or other commands and I'll assume you've got Powershell running if you haven't that's okay as long as you know what you're doing and I'll assume that you have an active python virtual environment running because this will simplify things a lot this is a free video from my course Python and machine learning for complete beginners I'm releasing the first couple of chapters of this course completely for free on YouTube to get you started with python I plan to upload new videos here to YouTube every Monday and every Thursday for at least a couple of months if you're interested in the complete course which teaches you python from scratch and eventually progresses to things like creating graphical user interfaces and using neural networks principal component analysis cluster analysis all that stuff and much more besides then you can find a link in the description or just go to this URL on the screen right here if you finish the whole course you'll be able to write all kinds of general purpose programs in Python and use Python to do machine learning and artificial intelligence as well thank you for watching until next time happy coding
