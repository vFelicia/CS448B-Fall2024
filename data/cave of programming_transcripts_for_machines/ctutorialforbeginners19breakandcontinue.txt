hello this is John from cave of programming calm in this tutorial we're going to look at break and continue in the context of loops and C++ so before we move on from loops we've got a couple of statements that can be very useful in some programs in loops and can help you to simplify your code so for an example is let's take a for loop so I'm going to type for int I equals 0 and we can also use foreign for sorry continue and break with while loops and dowhile loops as well let's say I less than 5 and I plus plus so let's let's put something in here so we can see what's happening let's say C out I is and I and I'll have an end learn so check this works I'm going to run that we need to build it first project build project and run it there we go so we've got I is 0 1 2 3 4 now the first and probably the most useful at these statements is break so what break does is it jumps immediately out of the loop which is yeah it's sometimes useful because sometimes in your your for loop is probably more often used with while loops but even in a for loop you might have some extra condition which occurs within the loop which makes you want to break out of the loop and you could add that condition up here you could have an and clause or whatever in there but sometimes it just makes for more elegant code if you check some condition within the loop and if that condition occurs you break out of the loop let's say for example if I is equal to three break so as soon as we as soon as this code executes the loops going to stop executing we're going to break out of it and even if there's anything underneath here we're not going to see it and let's say looping dot so brake is going to immediately jump out of these brat and closing brackets and do whatever x' after the loop let's put here program quitting so if we run this program so I click run and we get I is zero and and and it says looping and then I is one looping is two is three but when I use three this condition says yeah I is three and it breaks and then notice we don't get this looping after that so after three here it doesn't say looping break is literally shot straight out of the loop and then we were on to the stuff that's after the loop and be careful that when you have like nested brackets within brackets always put that extra tab indentation in here so here I've got an if nested within my for nested within the main subroutine so the statements within main are indented by one tab within four all the statements are indented by an extra tab and within this if which has its own curly brackets we've indented the brain by another top and that's that's really important to keep your code readable so that's that's break let's maybe copy this code and paste it down here so what I'll do is I'll comment this out because I don't I don't want to use it anymore here but I want you to be able to refer to it if you download the source code so I'm just gonna and comment this hour with a slash star star slash let's just use the auto formatter here in fact the auto for matter is strangely and not indented the break ma'am usually you should indent stuff within if but I guess the formatter feels that break should be an exception but I'm going to put it back anyway because it looks a bit odd to me yeah so and continue is a little bit similar to break but it just kind of breaks and the current iteration of the loop and then goes on to the next iteration so if we have continued in here instead what's going to happen is we're not going to execute any statements after continue it's going to break out of that particular iteration of the loop but then it is going to carry on with the following iterations so if we look at this now then we get I is 1 is 2 I week is 3 and after I is 3 when we do to continue we don't execute the statements that come after continue so there's no looping after I is 3 but unlike break it then does go on to do the rest of the iterations of the loop so we get is 4 and says looping so that's that's continue and what I want to do in the rest of this tutorial is show you just like one usage maybe of break so you can see how it can be useful let's take the code from from a dowhile tutorial so here I've got this program that repeatedly asks the user to enter their password until they finally enter the right password so I'm going to copy all this stuff and paste it in here nice format that yeah continue is also not being indented usually you should like if I had another statement in here like see out let's put see out hello hello let's just let's just do that and then just format that I'll say that first well that's pretty weird and the formatter here is yeah the reason is that I now see because I've commented out if I don't comment it out I use the format you can seal it does in dense stuff correctly but because I've got this stuff in in a comment it's the auto formatter is not doing what I expected it to do so let's just indent those manually for the moment and so that that looks good I'll go into this actually that's that's a bit weird I guess and format is just not geared up for code within comments so nevermind okay and so yeah we've got this program that asks for a password and repeatedly and we can simplify this using break so here we've got we're checking this condition twice that we're checking if the input is equal to the password or not twice here and here now what we could do here is we could change this wild condition to true so now this is an infinite loop but we can break the loop with break so let's say if input is equal to password then we say break let's put the closing bracket in there there we go else so if the input is not equal to the password then we say access denied and we continue so justjust by using a break statement there are made it a little bit clearer and I've avoided having to repeat the condition twice so I think that looks good let's let's check it as if it works so as soon as the inputs equal to the password we're going to break out of what would otherwise be an infinite loop so I'm going to run that enter your password let's try garbage garbage garbage hello access denied well it's case sensitive let's type hello lower case and says program quitting I also said password accepted so just a little example of our break can simplify your code and same for continued I think breaks probably more common now if you want to practice this what I'd recommend is first write a little program write just a little demo like like what I did earlier in this tutorial checking that you understand break and do the same for continue and then take this code from the dowhile tutorial and try to modify it yourself with a break or if you can think of a way to user continue in there that makes it nicer by all means do but try to use break or continue in there to simplify the code like I've done and try to do it from memory without referring back to this code but if you do need to refer back then no shame in that but it's good if you if you have a go at first try to get it working yourself from memory and then even if you end up with furring back to this code that will help you uncover the deficits in your understanding and it will help you to get to grips with this okay so that's it for this tutorial and until next time happy coding you you
