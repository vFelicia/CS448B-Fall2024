hello it's nice to meet you my name is matt and i am an embedded software engineer which basically means i write software for small devices or devices that are not fullon computers i recently had the idea of creating a simple supposed course for beginners so for people who have never seen code before and want to know how computers work by writing some c plus plus code so this course will entail a lot of the fundamentals that you need in order to program not just in simple explores but in in any other language out there so things like how memory is laid out how you can access memory in your computer and how the program deals with that memory and etc so i'd like to begin by talking a little bit about myself in the first place so i studied computer science at university i graduated with a master's degree in it in 2018. since then i have been writing sible's postcode to develop programs for desktops and more recently i have been writing software for cars in the embedded in the embedded world well prior to that i had used a few different languages as well such as python phd back in the day when i first got started uh and and so on so what i want to sort of show you guys in this course is is the fundamentals the absolute fundamentals that you need in order to pick up any programming language out there and for you guys to understand fundamentally how how a computer program works okay so now that we've got the introduction out of the way let's start talking about the main topic of this video which is setting up your environment so you have all the tools necessary to complete this course yeah so the first thing i'm going to ask you guys to download is something called an ide now ide stands for integrated development environment and it's basically a program that contains all the tools that you need to write code and generate your program out of your code yeah so if you're in windows i would highly recommend using visual studio 2019 because it comes with all the c plus plus compilers that we need it comes with a really good editor and code completion tools as well now visual studio 2019 is free the community edition is completely free so you can just go to the website and download it if you're on windows so make sure you do that and you install it now if you're not on windows if you're on if you're on linux or on a mac os machine i could recommend an ide called c lion which is something i use on a daily basis for work on on my linux machine and it is in the same way like visual studios it includes all the tools that you need for writing your code and debugging it and generating programs out of it but unfortunately it's not free for general use it is free for students so if you have a student email with your university or school you can get a free license out of it but if you're not a student like myself i think i'm paying currently something like eight pounds a month which is about nine ten dollars i believe a month for the license but it is worth having if you have no other option so make sure you install this as well if you if you can there is a first a day trial here so you can you can try it out before buying a license if you want okay now the main thing that these ides will include is generally they will include a c plus plus compiler so a c plus plus compiler is a program uh that reads your source code so something that you've got here on the on the right on the left side so this is c plus with source code and that compiler is gonna then generate uh instructions for your cpu for your machine to read because unlike what many people think uh c plus plus code or just programming in general isn't something that the uh the cpu can can understand there's a step in the middle which is actually generating the instructions and that's what the compiler will do you will generate here what's on the right and this this on the right here is what your computer actually understands and can execute yeah so this is what a compiler does and you should get that for free with visual studio however i think c line if you don't have a compiler installed on your on your machine already you have to install it manually okay by the way i do have an article about how to install um something called cmake on my website i'm going to be linking it on the description and there is a subsection here about how you can install a compiler on your machine if you're on linux if you're interested so make sure you check the link out okay now the final tool that you're going to need is cmake and cmake is a build system generator and what that basically means is that you can tell the computer you can tell your your ides in fact how your project is structured so you will tell the ids where your source files are located what programs you're generating out of them and what libraries you're using and etc okay i do have an article on my website again this is i'm going to link it on the description it explains in a simple manner um everything about cmake so everything that you need to know for now uh about cmake okay so now um if you went for the c lion option so you've installed c line on your on your linux machine or mac os or even on windows because it has support for windows as well that comes automatically free for you you don't have to install anything else okay that it comes with cmake however if you went for the visual studio is installation and you selected the basic cpu suppose desktop development option on the installation page then there is something extra you need to do and that's something extra is actually installing cmx support for visual studio which is not too hard all you got to do is go on your taskbar look for visual studio installer as you can see here this this this program here you should have it installed already if you installed visual studio 2019 and this is basically where you manage all the addons for visual studio yeah so to do that you can click on modify on the visual studio option there and you're going to go on individual components and to install the cmake support you're going to look for c plus c make support i believe or something like that there you go c plus plus c make tools for windows you're going to check this box here and there will be a button called install you're going to click on that and just wait for the installation to be done and you're good to go okay in my case i've already got that installed so obviously it's not here and that's it for this video now if you've followed everything that i've mentioned here you should have all the tools that you need to follow the course okay and i'm going to leave it here in the next video i plan to be teaching you guys how to write the simplest c plus plus program with the simplest c make and get you your ide to compile that and and run the program for you okay so if you've got any any comments if you've got any feedback please feel free to comment on the video i will make sure that i reply to every every single one of the the questions i get at least the star of this course um thanks for watching and bye
