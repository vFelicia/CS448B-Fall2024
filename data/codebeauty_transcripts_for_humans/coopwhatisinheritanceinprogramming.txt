00:00 - hi everyone my name is saldina and i
00:03 - make i.t
00:04 - and programming related videos on my
00:06 - channel so if that is something that is
00:08 - of interest to you consider subscribing
00:10 - and give this video a thumbs up as well
00:13 - and in this particular video i want to
00:15 - talk about inheritance
00:18 - so here i have my visual studio and here
00:20 - i have some code that we have written
00:23 - in the previous tutorials of this course
00:26 - so if you haven't watched those
00:28 - make sure to watch them the links are
00:30 - going to be
00:31 - in the description of this video and now
00:34 - i'm going to go very quickly
00:36 - over the code that we have here so i
00:39 - have created a class that is called
00:41 - youtube channel
00:43 - and that class has four private
00:46 - properties name owner name subscribers
00:49 - count
00:50 - and then published video titles and then
00:52 - we have a couple of public methods
00:55 - as well we have a constructor
00:58 - which just assigns initializes these
01:01 - variables here
01:02 - and then we have getinfo method that
01:05 - just
01:06 - writes out information values that are
01:08 - stored
01:09 - inside these properties here and then
01:12 - as well we have subscribe and
01:14 - unsubscribe methods
01:15 - our subscribe method increases our
01:18 - subscribers counter and then our
01:20 - unsubscribe method
01:22 - decreases that subscribers counter but
01:24 - first we have to check if
01:26 - that subscriber's count is greater than
01:28 - zero
01:29 - so those would be subscribe and
01:31 - unsubscribe methods and then we have
01:33 - this
01:34 - publish video method as well that just
01:36 - adds
01:37 - a new item adds a new title to this
01:40 - published videos list
01:43 - okay now what is going to happen if i
01:46 - want to create
01:47 - another type of youtube channel a
01:49 - specific type of youtube channel
01:52 - which is going to be for example um
01:54 - cooking youtube channel
01:56 - so i should copy these properties right
02:00 - well that can be one approach but
02:03 - the quicker and better approach is going
02:05 - to be to inherit
02:06 - this youtube channel class so let's do
02:09 - that
02:10 - let's create another type of channel so
02:13 - let's create another class
02:15 - let's say class and then let's call it
02:18 - cooking
02:21 - youtube channel
02:26 - like this okay now i have created a
02:30 - class
02:31 - that is called cooking youtube channel
02:33 - and in order to inherit
02:35 - this youtube channel class what i'm
02:37 - going to do is i'm going to
02:39 - put this column sign and then i'm going
02:41 - to say public
02:43 - youtube channel like this
02:46 - and in this way my cooking youtube
02:49 - channel is going
02:50 - to inherit my youtube channel
02:53 - and that means that my cooking youtube
02:56 - channel is going to have
02:57 - everything that my youtube channel has
03:00 - now this public access modifier means
03:03 - that
03:04 - whatever is public in this class here it
03:07 - is going to be
03:08 - public here as well so in this derived
03:11 - class
03:12 - and one very important thing is to know
03:14 - that
03:15 - this class is called base class so the
03:18 - one that you inherit from
03:20 - that is base class and then the
03:23 - derived class is going to be this one
03:25 - here so the one
03:26 - that inherits from the base class is
03:29 - called
03:30 - derived class and in this particular
03:32 - situation our cooking youtube channel is
03:34 - derived class now what is going to
03:38 - happen
03:38 - if i want to create for example an
03:40 - object of this
03:42 - cooking youtube channel so i'm going to
03:43 - say cooking youtube channel
03:45 - and let's call it youtube channel
03:49 - like this okay now as you can see it
03:52 - says that
03:53 - default constructor of cooking youtube
03:56 - channel cannot be
03:57 - referenced now that is because we do not
04:00 - have a constructor for this class here
04:02 - so
04:02 - let's create one let's create a
04:04 - constructor
04:06 - so i'm going to copy this name and then
04:09 - add
04:09 - these parentheses okay
04:13 - and now if i hover over this
04:16 - it says that the constructor is
04:18 - inaccessible
04:19 - so we still have an error but we have a
04:22 - different error which means that we are
04:23 - making progress
04:25 - so because this constructor is
04:27 - inaccessible i will have to make it
04:29 - public to make it accessible outside of
04:32 - this
04:33 - class here so i'm going to say public
04:37 - okay and now my constructor is going to
04:40 - be
04:41 - accessible but there is another thing
04:44 - that we have to do and that is going to
04:45 - be
04:46 - inside this constructor we have to
04:48 - receive properties that we are going to
04:50 - initialize
04:51 - in our constructor and those are going
04:54 - to be these two properties
04:56 - name and owner name so here i'm going to
04:58 - say that my constructor receives two
05:00 - properties
05:01 - so string name
05:05 - and then string owner name so the owner
05:10 - of that
05:11 - channel and what i'm going to do when i
05:14 - receive these two properties i'm not
05:16 - going to initialize them here in my
05:18 - constructor because
05:19 - i'm inheriting from a class that already
05:22 - knows
05:23 - how to construct how to initialize
05:26 - these two particular properties so i'm
05:29 - going to call the constructor of that
05:31 - class so i'm going to call the
05:32 - constructor of this
05:34 - youtube channel class so here i'm going
05:36 - to put
05:37 - this column sign and then i'm going to
05:40 - invoke its constructor so i'm going to
05:42 - say youtube channel
05:44 - and then i will pass these two
05:46 - parameters here so i'm going to say
05:48 - name and then owner
05:51 - name like this and now
05:55 - our base class our youtube channel class
05:58 - is going to construct to initialize
06:00 - actually the value of these two
06:02 - properties and as you can see here we
06:05 - have
06:06 - an error that asks us to
06:09 - pass these two values to our constructor
06:13 - so we are going to pass two parameters
06:15 - the first one is going to be the name of
06:17 - our channel so let's say that that is
06:19 - going to be for example
06:20 - amy's kitchen like this
06:25 - and then owner is going to be um
06:28 - girl named amy let's put
06:31 - that here as well okay now after i have
06:34 - created an
06:35 - object of this cooking youtube channel
06:38 - what i should be able to do
06:40 - is i should be able to access all of
06:43 - these public
06:44 - methods that my base class has so
06:48 - all of these methods from my youtube
06:50 - channel class
06:51 - should be available for my uh cooking
06:54 - youtube channel so here i'm going to say
06:56 - youtube channel dot and then as you can
07:00 - see
07:00 - these are available so get info publish
07:03 - video
07:04 - subscribe unsubscribe let's write out
07:06 - info about my channel
07:08 - like this and if i run it
07:11 - now well you can see
07:14 - that we have amy's amy's kitchen channel
07:18 - owner is amy it has zero subscribers and
07:20 - it has
07:21 - no videos as well so let's publish a
07:24 - couple
07:24 - of videos for amy amy's kitchen channel
07:27 - so here i'm going to say okay
07:30 - before it does get info function i'm
07:32 - going to say youtube channel
07:34 - dot and then let's say publish video
07:37 - of for example apple
07:41 - pie like this
07:44 - and then let's publish another video
07:47 - let's say for example
07:48 - chocolate cake
07:52 - like this and now
07:55 - if i run this program as you can see
07:59 - we have oh we have two videos
08:03 - and let's as well say that people like
08:06 - these videos so they decide to subscribe
08:09 - to
08:09 - amy's kitchen channel so i'm going to
08:11 - say youtube channel
08:13 - dot subscribe so for example two people
08:17 - decide to subscribe to her channel
08:20 - and if i run my program again
08:23 - you can see that now we have two
08:25 - subscribers
08:27 - as well so we have been able to invoke
08:30 - all of these methods that are
08:33 - implemented
08:34 - in our base class so here from
08:37 - the object of our derived class so from
08:41 - the object of
08:42 - this derived class here now this derived
08:46 - class this cooking youtube channel
08:47 - can have its own members meaning things
08:50 - that are specific for this class only so
08:54 - let's say for example that we want to
08:55 - create a method that is going to be
08:57 - called
08:58 - uh for example practice so i'm going to
09:01 - say void
09:02 - practice like this and then
09:06 - what this method should do it should
09:09 - just
09:10 - make our user that has this cooking
09:12 - youtube channel it should
09:14 - say that this user is practicing cooking
09:17 - and then
09:17 - learning new recipes and things like
09:20 - that so i'm going to say
09:21 - c out like this and that let me copy
09:25 - this part of the code because i don't
09:27 - want to make a typo
09:29 - like this so it says that
09:33 - our youtube channel's user is practicing
09:36 - cooking
09:36 - learning new recipes and then
09:38 - experimenting with spices
09:39 - because i guess that's something that
09:41 - you should do if you have a cooking
09:43 - youtube channel
09:44 - and let me add endline here as well
09:48 - like this so now if i decide to invoke
09:51 - this method
09:52 - this method is going to be available
09:54 - only
09:55 - for objects of this cooking youtube
09:57 - channel so i'm going to say
09:59 - youtube channel like this and then let's
10:03 - say
10:03 - practice like this now
10:06 - um let me very quickly change the name
10:09 - of this
10:10 - youtube channel object because i want to
10:11 - create another object that is going to
10:13 - be
10:13 - off uh this youtube channel type and i
10:16 - want to call that youtube channel
10:18 - so here i'm going to say um cooking
10:21 - youtube channel and i'm going to paste
10:24 - that name here
10:25 - and then here and here here as well
10:29 - okay now we have named this object
10:32 - cooking youtube channel and if i run
10:35 - this program
10:37 - you can see that at the end it says
10:39 - practicing cooking learning new recipes
10:41 - experimenting with
10:43 - spices now as i already said this
10:45 - practice method should be available
10:48 - only for the objects of this cooking
10:50 - youtube channel
10:51 - class so that means if i decide to
10:54 - create
10:55 - an object of this class here this base
10:57 - class
10:58 - that class is not going to have this
11:00 - practice method and let's prove that
11:02 - very quickly so here i'm going to create
11:04 - an
11:04 - object of youtube channel class type and
11:08 - let's call that object
11:09 - youtube channel that's why i changed the
11:13 - name of this
11:14 - object like this and let's say
11:17 - that that is going to be my channel for
11:20 - example
11:22 - code beauty like this
11:25 - and then let's say that owner is
11:28 - my name salvina so now if i try to
11:33 - access this practice method on my
11:36 - youtube channel so i press
11:38 - dot you can see that that method is not
11:41 - available for this base class it is
11:44 - available
11:45 - only for this cooking youtube channel
11:48 - class because this practice is very
11:51 - specific method meaning
11:53 - this cool beauty channel which is
11:55 - oriented to programming and i.t
11:58 - does not really benefit from learning um
12:01 - recipes and experimenting with spices
12:03 - practicing cooking and things like that
12:05 - so this channel
12:07 - should probably have some other way of
12:10 - practicing because it is different type
12:13 - of
12:13 - channel so i'm going to delete this code
12:17 - here okay and
12:20 - let's repeat this one more time so we
12:23 - have created
12:24 - a derived class which is called cooking
12:26 - youtube channel
12:28 - and we have inherited everything that
12:30 - our youtube channel class
12:32 - has by saying public and then
12:36 - the name of our base class and this
12:38 - public access modifier is going to
12:40 - allow us to have whatever is public here
12:43 - to have that
12:44 - public here as well and then we have
12:47 - created a constructor for our cooking
12:49 - youtube channel
12:50 - and in that constructor we receive two
12:53 - parameters
12:54 - name and owner name and since our base
12:57 - class constructor knows
12:59 - how to initialize those two we have here
13:02 - invoked
13:03 - this base class constructor and then
13:06 - here we have created as well a method
13:09 - that is called
13:10 - practice and that method just says that
13:13 - our user
13:14 - is practicing cooking and he is learning
13:17 - new recipes and experimenting with
13:19 - spices now there's one more thing that i
13:21 - want to show you and
13:22 - that is going to be to let's create
13:25 - another object of this cooking youtube
13:28 - channel and
13:29 - that is going to be let's say cooking
13:31 - youtube channel 2
13:33 - and let's call it
13:36 - john's kitchen like this
13:39 - and owner is going to be for example
13:42 - john
13:43 - now what is going to happen if i say for
13:46 - example
13:47 - that this second youtube channel so this
13:50 - cooking youtube channel too
13:51 - john's youtube channel is practicing i'm
13:54 - going to
13:55 - um comment these two because i don't
13:58 - need them
13:59 - and if i run my program now you can see
14:02 - that it says two times practicing
14:05 - cooking learning new recipes
14:06 - experimenting with spices and then the
14:08 - same
14:09 - line here so you cannot really
14:11 - differentiate between
14:13 - which one is amy's channel and which one
14:15 - is
14:16 - john's channel so in order to make
14:19 - that a bit more understandable i'm going
14:22 - to add a property here so here i want to
14:24 - add
14:25 - the name of the owner of this channel so
14:27 - here i'm going to say
14:28 - let me copy this property like this
14:32 - so owner name and then let's say that
14:35 - that owner
14:37 - is practicing cooking learning new
14:39 - recipes experimenting with spices
14:41 - and so on but as you can see this
14:44 - this property here is not accessible it
14:47 - says that
14:48 - member owner name is inaccessible and
14:51 - why is that the case why is it
14:53 - inaccessible because it is private and
14:56 - if you remember
14:58 - private members can be accessed only
15:01 - within that
15:02 - class and then public members can be
15:04 - accessed from outside of that class
15:07 - but what happens if you want to have for
15:09 - example a certain
15:11 - property to be accessible in the derived
15:14 - class now there
15:15 - is an access modifier for that as well
15:18 - so that is going to be protected access
15:21 - modifier so i'm going to say here
15:24 - protected
15:26 - like this and then i'm going to move
15:29 - this owner name
15:30 - to my protected area like this
15:33 - so now this owner name property should
15:36 - be accessible
15:38 - in derived classes as well and as you
15:40 - can see the error has
15:42 - disappeared so now if i run my program
15:47 - you can see that it says that amy is
15:50 - practicing cooking learning new recipes
15:52 - and experimenting with spices and then
15:55 - this second line here says that john
15:59 - is practicing cooking and learning new
16:02 - recipes and experimenting with spices
16:04 - so now we have made a difference we have
16:07 - specified the name of our
16:09 - owner of the channel and we can
16:11 - understand
16:12 - what the code is doing a bit more
16:16 - i hope that you understood what is
16:18 - inheritance and how it works in c
16:20 - plus plus and if you did please like
16:22 - this video
16:23 - don't forget to subscribe to my channel
16:25 - and click that bell icon as well
16:27 - and i'm going to see you in my next
16:29 - video bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone my name is saldina and i make i.t and programming related videos on my channel so if that is something that is of interest to you consider subscribing and give this video a thumbs up as well and in this particular video i want to talk about inheritance so here i have my visual studio and here i have some code that we have written in the previous tutorials of this course so if you haven't watched those make sure to watch them the links are going to be in the description of this video and now i'm going to go very quickly over the code that we have here so i have created a class that is called youtube channel and that class has four private properties name owner name subscribers count and then published video titles and then we have a couple of public methods as well we have a constructor which just assigns initializes these variables here and then we have getinfo method that just writes out information values that are stored inside these properties here and then as well we have subscribe and unsubscribe methods our subscribe method increases our subscribers counter and then our unsubscribe method decreases that subscribers counter but first we have to check if that subscriber's count is greater than zero so those would be subscribe and unsubscribe methods and then we have this publish video method as well that just adds a new item adds a new title to this published videos list okay now what is going to happen if i want to create another type of youtube channel a specific type of youtube channel which is going to be for example um cooking youtube channel so i should copy these properties right well that can be one approach but the quicker and better approach is going to be to inherit this youtube channel class so let's do that let's create another type of channel so let's create another class let's say class and then let's call it cooking youtube channel like this okay now i have created a class that is called cooking youtube channel and in order to inherit this youtube channel class what i'm going to do is i'm going to put this column sign and then i'm going to say public youtube channel like this and in this way my cooking youtube channel is going to inherit my youtube channel and that means that my cooking youtube channel is going to have everything that my youtube channel has now this public access modifier means that whatever is public in this class here it is going to be public here as well so in this derived class and one very important thing is to know that this class is called base class so the one that you inherit from that is base class and then the derived class is going to be this one here so the one that inherits from the base class is called derived class and in this particular situation our cooking youtube channel is derived class now what is going to happen if i want to create for example an object of this cooking youtube channel so i'm going to say cooking youtube channel and let's call it youtube channel like this okay now as you can see it says that default constructor of cooking youtube channel cannot be referenced now that is because we do not have a constructor for this class here so let's create one let's create a constructor so i'm going to copy this name and then add these parentheses okay and now if i hover over this it says that the constructor is inaccessible so we still have an error but we have a different error which means that we are making progress so because this constructor is inaccessible i will have to make it public to make it accessible outside of this class here so i'm going to say public okay and now my constructor is going to be accessible but there is another thing that we have to do and that is going to be inside this constructor we have to receive properties that we are going to initialize in our constructor and those are going to be these two properties name and owner name so here i'm going to say that my constructor receives two properties so string name and then string owner name so the owner of that channel and what i'm going to do when i receive these two properties i'm not going to initialize them here in my constructor because i'm inheriting from a class that already knows how to construct how to initialize these two particular properties so i'm going to call the constructor of that class so i'm going to call the constructor of this youtube channel class so here i'm going to put this column sign and then i'm going to invoke its constructor so i'm going to say youtube channel and then i will pass these two parameters here so i'm going to say name and then owner name like this and now our base class our youtube channel class is going to construct to initialize actually the value of these two properties and as you can see here we have an error that asks us to pass these two values to our constructor so we are going to pass two parameters the first one is going to be the name of our channel so let's say that that is going to be for example amy's kitchen like this and then owner is going to be um girl named amy let's put that here as well okay now after i have created an object of this cooking youtube channel what i should be able to do is i should be able to access all of these public methods that my base class has so all of these methods from my youtube channel class should be available for my uh cooking youtube channel so here i'm going to say youtube channel dot and then as you can see these are available so get info publish video subscribe unsubscribe let's write out info about my channel like this and if i run it now well you can see that we have amy's amy's kitchen channel owner is amy it has zero subscribers and it has no videos as well so let's publish a couple of videos for amy amy's kitchen channel so here i'm going to say okay before it does get info function i'm going to say youtube channel dot and then let's say publish video of for example apple pie like this and then let's publish another video let's say for example chocolate cake like this and now if i run this program as you can see we have oh we have two videos and let's as well say that people like these videos so they decide to subscribe to amy's kitchen channel so i'm going to say youtube channel dot subscribe so for example two people decide to subscribe to her channel and if i run my program again you can see that now we have two subscribers as well so we have been able to invoke all of these methods that are implemented in our base class so here from the object of our derived class so from the object of this derived class here now this derived class this cooking youtube channel can have its own members meaning things that are specific for this class only so let's say for example that we want to create a method that is going to be called uh for example practice so i'm going to say void practice like this and then what this method should do it should just make our user that has this cooking youtube channel it should say that this user is practicing cooking and then learning new recipes and things like that so i'm going to say c out like this and that let me copy this part of the code because i don't want to make a typo like this so it says that our youtube channel's user is practicing cooking learning new recipes and then experimenting with spices because i guess that's something that you should do if you have a cooking youtube channel and let me add endline here as well like this so now if i decide to invoke this method this method is going to be available only for objects of this cooking youtube channel so i'm going to say youtube channel like this and then let's say practice like this now um let me very quickly change the name of this youtube channel object because i want to create another object that is going to be off uh this youtube channel type and i want to call that youtube channel so here i'm going to say um cooking youtube channel and i'm going to paste that name here and then here and here here as well okay now we have named this object cooking youtube channel and if i run this program you can see that at the end it says practicing cooking learning new recipes experimenting with spices now as i already said this practice method should be available only for the objects of this cooking youtube channel class so that means if i decide to create an object of this class here this base class that class is not going to have this practice method and let's prove that very quickly so here i'm going to create an object of youtube channel class type and let's call that object youtube channel that's why i changed the name of this object like this and let's say that that is going to be my channel for example code beauty like this and then let's say that owner is my name salvina so now if i try to access this practice method on my youtube channel so i press dot you can see that that method is not available for this base class it is available only for this cooking youtube channel class because this practice is very specific method meaning this cool beauty channel which is oriented to programming and i.t does not really benefit from learning um recipes and experimenting with spices practicing cooking and things like that so this channel should probably have some other way of practicing because it is different type of channel so i'm going to delete this code here okay and let's repeat this one more time so we have created a derived class which is called cooking youtube channel and we have inherited everything that our youtube channel class has by saying public and then the name of our base class and this public access modifier is going to allow us to have whatever is public here to have that public here as well and then we have created a constructor for our cooking youtube channel and in that constructor we receive two parameters name and owner name and since our base class constructor knows how to initialize those two we have here invoked this base class constructor and then here we have created as well a method that is called practice and that method just says that our user is practicing cooking and he is learning new recipes and experimenting with spices now there's one more thing that i want to show you and that is going to be to let's create another object of this cooking youtube channel and that is going to be let's say cooking youtube channel 2 and let's call it john's kitchen like this and owner is going to be for example john now what is going to happen if i say for example that this second youtube channel so this cooking youtube channel too john's youtube channel is practicing i'm going to um comment these two because i don't need them and if i run my program now you can see that it says two times practicing cooking learning new recipes experimenting with spices and then the same line here so you cannot really differentiate between which one is amy's channel and which one is john's channel so in order to make that a bit more understandable i'm going to add a property here so here i want to add the name of the owner of this channel so here i'm going to say let me copy this property like this so owner name and then let's say that that owner is practicing cooking learning new recipes experimenting with spices and so on but as you can see this this property here is not accessible it says that member owner name is inaccessible and why is that the case why is it inaccessible because it is private and if you remember private members can be accessed only within that class and then public members can be accessed from outside of that class but what happens if you want to have for example a certain property to be accessible in the derived class now there is an access modifier for that as well so that is going to be protected access modifier so i'm going to say here protected like this and then i'm going to move this owner name to my protected area like this so now this owner name property should be accessible in derived classes as well and as you can see the error has disappeared so now if i run my program you can see that it says that amy is practicing cooking learning new recipes and experimenting with spices and then this second line here says that john is practicing cooking and learning new recipes and experimenting with spices so now we have made a difference we have specified the name of our owner of the channel and we can understand what the code is doing a bit more i hope that you understood what is inheritance and how it works in c plus plus and if you did please like this video don't forget to subscribe to my channel and click that bell icon as well and i'm going to see you in my next video
