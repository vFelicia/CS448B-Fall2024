00:00 - hi guys and welcome back to my channel
00:02 - in this video i'm going to teach you
00:04 - everything about stl vector we are going
00:06 - to talk about arrays dynamic arrays and
00:09 - vectors and i'm going to explain the
00:12 - differences advantages and disadvantages
00:15 - as well as examples of when to use each
00:18 - one so if you came here to learn
00:20 - exclusively about how to use stl vector
00:24 - then you can navigate directly to that
00:26 - part there is contents in the
00:28 - description but i advise you to watch
00:30 - the entire video because you are going
00:33 - to learn about differences between
00:35 - arrays dynamic arrays and vectors and
00:38 - i'm also going to show you
00:39 - understandable examples of when to use
00:42 - each one and before i start with this
00:45 - topic i want to say that today's video
00:47 - is made available freely for you to
00:49 - watch by visual assist which i have been
00:51 - using for a long time because it helps
00:54 - me to write cleaner code faster
00:56 - some of my favorite features are
00:58 - refactoring which means that it reduces
01:01 - the complexity of your code it makes it
01:04 - more understandable and readable so you
01:06 - can refactor some old legacy code or the
01:10 - first version of your own code and make
01:12 - it cleaner and then it also provides
01:14 - code inspection and correction so it
01:17 - analyzes your code as you write it and
01:19 - it fixes common bugs and errors so when
01:22 - i use visual assist i feel like i'm not
01:25 - coding alone and like i have an
01:28 - additional pair of eyes that checks my
01:30 - code and then i also love fast
01:32 - navigation because if you ever worked on
01:34 - large projects you know that this is
01:36 - very common problem so visual assist
01:38 - helps you to navigate to any part of the
01:41 - code that you want very fast and if you
01:43 - want to learn about all the cool
01:45 - features that even beginners can use as
01:47 - well as how to install it download it
01:49 - and use it you can watch the video that
01:51 - will be linked here and also in the
01:53 - description so how can you get it well
01:57 - as a code beauty viewer you can use the
01:59 - link in the description right now to get
02:01 - one month free trial of visual assist
02:05 - so definitely check it out and reduce
02:07 - the stress of learning programming and
02:09 - get yourself assistance so to return to
02:12 - the topic of this video i first want to
02:14 - share some very important information
02:16 - about
02:17 - arrays and dynamic arrays and after
02:20 - understanding those two it will be very
02:22 - easy for you to know and understand how
02:25 - and when to use vectors
02:27 - so when i talked about arrays in this
02:30 - video
02:32 - i said that arrays are a type of
02:34 - collection that stores elements in a
02:37 - continuous memory which means
02:39 - one element after the other
02:42 - i also said that arrays have fixed size
02:45 - which means that if you declare an array
02:48 - of 10 elements you can store only 10
02:50 - elements or less into that array but not
02:53 - a single element more
02:56 - so now i'm going to give you an example
02:58 - of when using arrays would be good idea
03:01 - and then i'm also going to give you an
03:02 - example of when using arrays would be a
03:05 - potential problem as well as how to
03:08 - solve that situation so imagine the
03:10 - following situation you are building an
03:13 - application that shows top 100 best
03:15 - cryptocurrencies to invest in together
03:18 - with their prices now these things
03:20 - change very quickly due to the market
03:23 - activity so you want to keep your users
03:26 - updated you want to update the prices
03:28 - sometimes you even want to remove one
03:30 - cryptocurrency and add another
03:32 - cryptocurrency into top 100 so in this
03:36 - situation using arrays would be ideal
03:39 - solution why well because you would be
03:42 - able to make those updates and those
03:44 - changes very quickly because you would
03:46 - be able to access every single element
03:48 - of that array directly how come well
03:52 - because you can access elements of
03:54 - arrays directly by using the name of the
03:57 - array and the index or the position of
04:00 - that element and also because you always
04:03 - want to display and show top 100
04:06 - cryptocurrencies so not 101 or 99 but
04:09 - always 100 then in that situation using
04:13 - arrays would be ideal solution but let's
04:16 - imagine a different problem let's say
04:19 - that you have built your own programming
04:20 - course and you want people to enroll
04:23 - into that course so you decide
04:25 - okay i am not really popular not many
04:28 - people know about me so i expect 100
04:31 - people to enroll into that course not
04:34 - more not less so with that in mind you
04:37 - decide that you are going to create an
04:39 - array of 100 students in your
04:41 - application and that is where you are
04:44 - going to store your students but what
04:46 - happens down the line is that people
04:48 - realize that your course is very good so
04:51 - they start sharing it with their friends
04:53 - and soon before you realize it 1000
04:56 - people want to enroll in your course but
04:59 - that is just not possible because you
05:02 - hard coded the array to 100 students so
05:04 - you cannot store any more students so
05:08 - that is one potential problem that can
05:10 - happen and another potential problem
05:13 - that can happen is that
05:14 - let's say someone else creates even
05:16 - better course than you so only 10 people
05:19 - decide to enroll in your course so what
05:22 - happens in this situation is that
05:24 - 90 of the space that you created for
05:27 - that array is going to be empty but it
05:30 - will still hold that memory so that
05:32 - other applications cannot use it so you
05:35 - have the array for 100 students but you
05:37 - have only 10 students inside that array
05:40 - but again it is taking that memory and
05:43 - other applications cannot use it so this
05:46 - means that for this specific situation
05:48 - using arrays is not a good solution and
05:51 - it is not good because of two reasons
05:54 - first reason is if you want to fix this
05:56 - problem if 1000 people want to all of a
05:59 - sudden enroll in your course
06:01 - in order to fix this problem you need to
06:03 - rewrite your code and you need to fix
06:06 - that bug in your code which later
06:08 - requires you to rebuild your application
06:11 - and redeploy it and that takes time and
06:14 - the second reason is that during that
06:16 - time other students will not be able to
06:19 - enroll into your course so that means
06:22 - that you are effectively losing money
06:24 - while your application is unavailable
06:26 - for more students so with this in mind
06:29 - we can conclude that using arrays for
06:32 - solving this type of problem is not an
06:34 - ideal solution it's actually terrible
06:37 - solution so now i'm going to explain how
06:39 - you can approach this problem and solve
06:41 - it in a better way a better solution for
06:44 - this problem would be using dynamic
06:46 - arrays and this is because dynamic
06:48 - arrays have the ability to resize
06:51 - themselves when something happens
06:53 - and that something is usually adding new
06:56 - elements or removing existing elements
06:59 - so
07:00 - let's say that you have a dynamic array
07:02 - that has 100 elements so it can store
07:06 - 100 elements so currently you have 99
07:09 - students and at the moment that you are
07:11 - adding 100 student your dynamic array
07:15 - says hey i see that this array has the
07:18 - potential to grow even more so what i'm
07:20 - going to do now is i am going to resize
07:23 - myself so how does it do that well
07:26 - it allocates space for bigger array that
07:29 - can store for example 105 elements or
07:32 - 110 elements and then it copies the old
07:36 - smaller array into that bigger array
07:39 - that it has allocated and then it
07:42 - deletes the allocates that old array so
07:45 - now you have a bigger array you have all
07:47 - of your elements and you have some
07:49 - additional space to add more elements so
07:52 - that is how dynamic arrays work
07:55 - and then also if you have let's say only
07:58 - 10 elements inside your dynamic array
08:01 - there is no need to have an array of 100
08:04 - elements you can have a dynamic array of
08:06 - 15 elements for example so that you
08:09 - don't waste all of that memory that you
08:11 - are not currently using
08:13 - so that is how dynamic arrays work and
08:16 - if you want to learn more about dynamic
08:18 - arrays as well as how to implement them
08:21 - and understand them in more detail you
08:23 - can watch the video that will be linked
08:25 - here and i will also link it in the
08:26 - description and now i'm going to talk
08:29 - about an even better solution which is
08:32 - stl vector so stl vector is something
08:36 - that has all the benefits of dynamic
08:39 - arrays but with much less work so now
08:42 - i'm going to explain what is stl vector
08:45 - and i will show you the examples of how
08:47 - to use stlvector and then after you see
08:50 - those examples at the end of this video
08:52 - i will come back to this topic once more
08:55 - and explain the difference between
08:57 - vector and dynamic array so that you can
08:59 - know when to use each one and what are
09:02 - advantages and disadvantages of both
09:06 - okay so a vector is a type of collection
09:08 - that behaves like a dynamic array it is
09:11 - an array because it stores elements in a
09:14 - continuous memory which means one after
09:17 - the other like an array does rather than
09:20 - randomly in your memory like some other
09:22 - collections do for example a linked list
09:26 - and then it is also dynamic because it
09:29 - has the ability to resize itself when
09:32 - you are adding new elements or removing
09:35 - existing elements so when you add new
09:37 - elements into your vector it is going to
09:39 - increase in size and then when you
09:42 - remove existing elements it will
09:44 - decrease in size so that it doesn't take
09:46 - unnecessary space in memory so how do
09:49 - you create a vector
09:50 - well it's very easy you need two things
09:53 - first you need to include vector here so
09:57 - include
09:58 - vector like this and then second thing
10:01 - is you just create a vector so you say
10:04 - please
10:05 - create a vector of in this situation
10:08 - vector of integers and then you give it
10:10 - a name so let's say
10:12 - numbers
10:13 - okay so with this i have created a
10:16 - vector of integers that is called
10:18 - numbers one important thing that you can
10:20 - notice here is that you don't specify
10:22 - the size for your vector like you would
10:24 - specify the size for an array and this
10:27 - is because vector resizes itself
10:30 - automatically okay
10:33 - so in this video i'm going to show you
10:34 - all the important functionalities that
10:36 - you need to know about and understand
10:38 - how to use that are related to vector
10:41 - collection so the first thing that you
10:43 - need to know is how to insert elements
10:46 - into this vector so in order to do that
10:49 - you would say
10:50 - numbers
10:51 - dot
10:52 - push
10:54 - back
10:55 - and then here you put the element that
10:56 - you want to insert into your vector so
10:59 - this is how you insert elements into
11:02 - vector and then let's add a couple of
11:04 - more let's say
11:06 - 4
11:07 - inch i is equal to 1 i is less than or
11:12 - equal to 10 and then i plus plus
11:16 - okay
11:17 - and then here i'm going to say
11:19 - numbers push back i
11:21 - like this so with this for loop i have
11:24 - added 10 elements into this vector here
11:28 - so now the question is how can we access
11:31 - and print these elements well i'm going
11:33 - to show you two ways to do this the
11:36 - first one is going to be a quick and
11:37 - easy way and then the second one will be
11:40 - using iterators which is an important
11:42 - topic related to vectors which i'm going
11:44 - to explain later so let's see the quick
11:47 - way first so you say
11:50 - 4
11:51 - and
11:52 - number of
11:53 - numbers vector and then here
11:56 - c out
11:58 - number and then let's put an end line
12:01 - okay so this here is a quick and easy
12:04 - way to print the elements of a vector so
12:06 - you use for each loop and you iterate
12:09 - through your numbers vector that numbers
12:12 - vector contains integers and you give
12:15 - the name to every single element of that
12:18 - vector and then here i am just printing
12:20 - that element in the current iteration so
12:24 - if i run this program let's see what we
12:25 - will get and we get the first element
12:28 - that we added here and then we also get
12:31 - the remaining 10 elements that we added
12:33 - using our for loop another way to do
12:36 - this thing here is with the help of
12:38 - iterators and iterators are important
12:41 - topic related to vectors so what are
12:44 - iterators
12:45 - iterators are like special functions
12:48 - that point to some important locations
12:50 - in your vector two most important
12:53 - locations in your vector are its
12:54 - beginning and end
12:56 - so we have two iterators called begin
13:00 - and end so let's see how we can do this
13:03 - thing here with the help of iterators
13:06 - so i'm going to say
13:08 - for
13:09 - auto
13:11 - i t so iterator is equal to
13:14 - numbers begin okay this has been
13:17 - automatically generated for me so please
13:20 - start at numbers begin iterator and then
13:23 - go until numbers end iterator and then
13:27 - please increment the iterator in each
13:30 - iteration by one like this okay and what
13:34 - i want to do inside here is i want to
13:37 - say see out iterator and then let's also
13:40 - add end line okay let's make a quick
13:43 - pause here so that i can explain a
13:45 - couple of things first thing is this
13:47 - auto part here what does this mean well
13:50 - it means the following
13:52 - please check which type this part here
13:55 - will return and then
13:57 - automatically assign that type to this
14:01 - it iterator so that is all that it means
14:04 - please do that automatically so that i
14:07 - as a programmer developer don't have to
14:09 - do that myself
14:11 - okay
14:12 - and then second thing that i want to
14:14 - explain is this error here in c plus
14:17 - plus in programming you cannot actually
14:20 - print the iterator itself so this part
14:23 - here is not allowed but you can do one
14:26 - of following options
14:28 - so what you can do is you can print the
14:33 - value of the element of that iterator
14:36 - like this
14:38 - and then another thing that you can do
14:40 - is you can print the address of the
14:43 - iterator like this
14:45 - and then the third option that you have
14:47 - is you can print the address
14:50 - of the
14:52 - element like this
14:54 - okay so those are three options the
14:57 - value of the element the address of the
14:59 - iterator and then the address of the
15:02 - element so if i run the program let's
15:05 - see what we will get okay so we get this
15:07 - for all the elements inside our numbers
15:10 - vector so here is the value of the first
15:12 - element and then the address of the
15:15 - iterator and then the address of the
15:18 - first element itself and then the value
15:21 - for the second element the address of
15:23 - its iterator and then the address of the
15:25 - second element and so on and so on for
15:28 - every single element inside our numbers
15:31 - vector
15:33 - so one more time
15:35 - these are four options you cannot do
15:38 - this so you cannot print the iterator
15:40 - itself what you can do are these three
15:43 - options so you can print the value of
15:46 - the element you can print the address of
15:48 - the iterator and you can print the
15:50 - address of the element itself
15:54 - now let's delete this part here because
15:57 - i want to show you some more interesting
15:58 - things that you can do with vectors so
16:01 - what you can do is you can perform
16:03 - arithmetic operations on vectors so how
16:06 - would you do that so again let's say
16:10 - auto
16:11 - i t so auto iterator will be equal to
16:15 - numbers begin so please assign it to the
16:19 - beginning of my vector and then what i
16:22 - want to do is i want to say c out
16:26 - please print the value that is stored on
16:29 - this
16:30 - i t
16:31 - plus five so this is perfectly valid and
16:35 - you can do this so if i run this program
16:38 - what do you expect to get can someone
16:40 - please explain this in the comments
16:42 - okay so let's run the program and we get
16:46 - the value of 5 and the reason is we have
16:48 - 11 elements inside our vector so we
16:51 - start at zero and then we add five more
16:54 - elements to that so we get the value of
16:57 - five but
16:59 - if i removed this part here i'm just
17:02 - going to comment it and if i run the
17:05 - program again now we are going to get
17:07 - the value of 6 because we start at the
17:10 - iterator position 1 and then we add 5
17:14 - more elements as we have specified here
17:17 - so that means that we are going to move
17:19 - five more spaces which furthermore means
17:22 - that we have moved to the element six
17:25 - now let's see a couple of more
17:26 - interesting things that we can do with
17:28 - iterators and vectors so let me return
17:30 - that for loop that we had before
17:33 - so here is our for loop and here are the
17:36 - iterators that return the beginning of
17:38 - the vector and
17:39 - end of the vector
17:41 - now
17:42 - an interesting thing is that there are
17:44 - two more iterators that are used very
17:46 - often in programming with vectors and
17:49 - those are
17:50 - c begin and c end so what is the
17:54 - difference between these two and the two
17:58 - that we had previously so the ones
18:00 - without c well let me show you that on
18:03 - an example
18:04 - what is going to happen if i say
18:06 - something like please dereference the
18:09 - value of this iterator and assign it the
18:11 - value of 20. so if i run the program
18:15 - every single element of this vector
18:17 - should have the value of 20. okay so
18:20 - that is what we have achieved by
18:22 - assigning the value of 20 to every
18:24 - single element inside this for loop but
18:27 - what is going to happen if i decide to
18:29 - use c begin
18:31 - and c and iterators well immediately we
18:35 - are going to get an error and that error
18:38 - says that expression must be a
18:40 - modifiable value that means that c begin
18:44 - and c and are constant iterators which
18:47 - means that if you declare an iterator as
18:49 - a constant so c begin and c and constant
18:53 - begin and constant n
18:55 - you will not be able to change its value
18:58 - and we can clearly see that part here so
19:01 - we are not able to do this anymore
19:03 - because our iterators are made constant
19:07 - so when would you use constant iterators
19:09 - you would use constant iterators when
19:11 - you create a functionality that only
19:14 - needs to for example print the data but
19:16 - not change it so chances are that you
19:19 - are going to work with other developers
19:21 - as well so if you don't want another
19:23 - developer to do something like this by
19:25 - accident in order to prevent him to do
19:28 - that and change the data again
19:30 - accidentally and cause a bug in that way
19:32 - you can prevent him by using constant
19:35 - iterators like i did here so let's see
19:38 - what are some other important
19:39 - functionalities of vector i'm going to
19:41 - put all of the functionalities that you
19:43 - should know about here on the screen and
19:46 - then i will be back to explain them so
19:48 - here are some interesting
19:50 - functionalities that you are going to
19:51 - see and use very often when you are
19:53 - working with vectors
19:55 - and here i also have the results for
19:58 - these functionalities so let's start
20:00 - with the first one
20:02 - okay so the first one is size and size
20:05 - tells you what is the current size of
20:07 - your vector and as you can see
20:10 - initially the size of your vector is 10
20:12 - because at the beginning we have added
20:15 - 10 elements to our numbers vector
20:18 - okay and then the second functionality
20:20 - is max size max size tells you what is
20:24 - the maximum number of elements that you
20:26 - can add to your vector and that is this
20:29 - number here which i'm not even going to
20:31 - try to pronounce
20:33 - okay
20:34 - and then capacity this one is very
20:36 - interesting and capacity tells you how
20:39 - many elements you can add to your vector
20:42 - before resizing it so
20:45 - here it says that capacity is 13 and we
20:49 - already have 10 elements inside our
20:51 - vector which means that we can add three
20:53 - more elements before resizing this
20:57 - numbers vector so that is what capacity
21:00 - functionality tells you and then vector
21:03 - dot resize will resize your vector to
21:06 - the size that you specify here so here i
21:10 - have resized my numbers vector to the
21:13 - size of five so if i try to print the
21:16 - size of that vector after resizing it
21:19 - here you can see that the new size is 5.
21:23 - so now we have only five elements inside
21:26 - our numbers vector okay and then this
21:29 - part here will check if
21:32 - vector is empty or not so if this vector
21:36 - here is empty it will print that the
21:37 - vector is empty else it will print that
21:40 - vector is not empty so since we
21:42 - currently have five elements inside our
21:45 - vector that means that the vector is not
21:48 - empty which you can see here
21:50 - okay and then we have two ways to access
21:53 - elements of a vector directly besides
21:56 - the one that i have showed you with
21:58 - using arithmetic operations we have two
22:00 - more ways and that is with these squared
22:04 - brackets so you specify the name of your
22:08 - vector and then you specify the index or
22:10 - the position of the element that you
22:12 - want to access
22:14 - and here you can see that element at
22:16 - position
22:17 - zero is one that is the first way and
22:19 - then the second way is with this at
22:22 - functionality and it works absolutely
22:24 - the same so you say numbers dot at and
22:28 - then you specify the position and as you
22:30 - can see here the element at position 0
22:33 - is 1 and that is because the indexing of
22:36 - vectors the same as arrays
22:38 - starts with zero and then another
22:41 - functionality is front and front will
22:43 - tell you which is the front element of
22:46 - your vector and in this situation the
22:48 - front or the first element is number one
22:51 - and then
22:52 - back will tell you what is the last
22:54 - element of your vector so that is
22:57 - element five
22:59 - as you can see here
23:01 - and then another thing that i want to
23:02 - show you is how you can clear your
23:05 - vector and that is with the help of
23:06 - functionality called clear it is going
23:08 - to delete all elements so if i try to
23:11 - check for the size of my vector after i
23:13 - have cleared it here you can see that
23:16 - the new size will be equal to zero okay
23:19 - so let's clear this code very quickly
23:21 - because i want to show you a couple of
23:23 - more interesting functionalities that
23:25 - you should know about
23:26 - so there are two more functionalities
23:28 - that are very important for you to know
23:30 - related to vectors and those are how you
23:33 - can insert an element at a specific
23:36 - position inside your vector and then how
23:38 - you can remove an element from a
23:40 - specific position inside your vector
23:43 - so for that you use functions called
23:45 - insert and erase so let's first see how
23:49 - this insert functionality works so here
23:51 - you specify the name of your vector and
23:53 - then you say insert and then here you
23:56 - will specify the position at which you
23:58 - want to insert this element here so
24:01 - number 88 and the position is beginning
24:05 - of the vector plus five so that means
24:08 - the element with index five
24:11 - so
24:11 - with this part here i'm going to print
24:13 - the elements of the vector so let's see
24:15 - what is going to be the result okay so
24:19 - as you can see the number 88 appears at
24:22 - the position five so again the
24:24 - indexation of vectors starts at zero the
24:27 - same as array so this is element zero
24:31 - element 1 2 3 4 and then element 5 which
24:35 - has this value that we have specified
24:38 - here and then if i want to remove an
24:40 - element from a specific position i would
24:42 - use function called
24:44 - erase and then specify the position that
24:46 - i want to remove the element from
24:49 - so when i uncomment this line here it
24:51 - will remove the element from position
24:54 - five so if i run the program again
24:57 - as you can see
24:59 - this 88 has disappeared because that was
25:02 - the element on position five and then
25:05 - another interesting functionality that
25:07 - you can do is you can also say
25:10 - numbers
25:11 - dot
25:12 - pop back and this functionality is going
25:15 - to remove an element from the back of
25:17 - your vector so if i start the program
25:20 - once more as you can see the last
25:22 - element which was number 10 now has been
25:25 - popped which means that it was removed
25:27 - so those were some functionalities that
25:29 - you should know about and i'm going to
25:31 - print all of this code in a comment so
25:33 - that you can use it and now we have come
25:36 - to the final question which is what is
25:38 - the difference between dynamic array and
25:41 - vector and which one you should use a
25:43 - vector is a class which means that it is
25:46 - like a container that completely hides
25:49 - memory management from the programmer
25:51 - and it also provides you with useful
25:53 - functionalities that are very easy to
25:55 - use as you could see already in the
25:57 - examples that i have shown
25:59 - a dynamic array on the other hand is
26:01 - like an old-fashioned way to do this
26:03 - same thing
26:04 - so in dynamic arrays every time that you
26:07 - want to either increase or decrease the
26:09 - size of your array you need to work with
26:12 - raw pointers and you need to use new and
26:15 - delete keywords in order to allocate and
26:18 - de-allocate memory and if you want to
26:21 - learn how to do this you can watch the
26:23 - video that will be linked in the
26:25 - description so now the question is what
26:27 - is better vector or dynamic array and
26:31 - the answer is that vector will be better
26:33 - for 99 of situations
26:36 - why
26:37 - well because vector is standardized
26:40 - everyone knows how to use it and
26:42 - millions of developers have already used
26:44 - it and tested it so it is not
26:47 - error-prone it doesn't have errors on
26:49 - the other hand if you decide to manage
26:51 - memory on your own and use dynamic
26:53 - arrays
26:54 - you could get slightly better time or
26:57 - memory performance but you risk to make
27:00 - so many bucks at that process that it is
27:03 - probably not even worth it so my
27:05 - recommendation is to use vectors always
27:08 - and only if you have performance or
27:11 - memory issues with that approach only
27:14 - then you should consider to use dynamic
27:17 - arrays and handle the memory yourself
27:19 - and again this is because vector is very
27:22 - very thin wrapper around dynamic array
27:24 - that provides you with all the
27:26 - functionalities that i've shown you and
27:28 - many more those functionalities are
27:30 - already tested they don't have errors
27:32 - and in 99 of situations using vector is
27:36 - going to be the fastest the most
27:38 - understandable and the cleanest solution
27:41 - and very very rarely and under some very
27:44 - specific circumstances it can happen
27:46 - that switching to dynamic arrays can
27:49 - provide you with some performance
27:50 - benefits but even then you would have to
27:53 - test both solutions and perform multiple
27:56 - tests do a lot of analyzing and
27:58 - profiling just to see if you will even
28:00 - get that performance improvement by
28:02 - switching to dynamic arrays so again you
28:05 - should be aware that both exist you
28:07 - should know what is dynamic array and
28:09 - what is vector you should also know what
28:12 - are the differences and pros and cons
28:15 - but again my recommendation is to always
28:17 - use vector so that would be all for this
28:20 - video if you enjoyed it please give it a
28:22 - big thumbs up because that means a lot
28:24 - to the youtube algorithm and then also
28:26 - share this video with other people who
28:28 - are struggling with programming and who
28:30 - need to learn about this topic and if
28:33 - you have any questions make sure to put
28:34 - them in the comment section so that i
28:36 - can reply and so that other people who
28:38 - are wondering about the same things can
28:41 - read those answers so again thank you
28:44 - very much for watching and i'm going to
28:45 - see you in some other video bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys and welcome back to my channel in this video i'm going to teach you everything about stl vector we are going to talk about arrays dynamic arrays and vectors and i'm going to explain the differences advantages and disadvantages as well as examples of when to use each one so if you came here to learn exclusively about how to use stl vector then you can navigate directly to that part there is contents in the description but i advise you to watch the entire video because you are going to learn about differences between arrays dynamic arrays and vectors and i'm also going to show you understandable examples of when to use each one and before i start with this topic i want to say that today's video is made available freely for you to watch by visual assist which i have been using for a long time because it helps me to write cleaner code faster some of my favorite features are refactoring which means that it reduces the complexity of your code it makes it more understandable and readable so you can refactor some old legacy code or the first version of your own code and make it cleaner and then it also provides code inspection and correction so it analyzes your code as you write it and it fixes common bugs and errors so when i use visual assist i feel like i'm not coding alone and like i have an additional pair of eyes that checks my code and then i also love fast navigation because if you ever worked on large projects you know that this is very common problem so visual assist helps you to navigate to any part of the code that you want very fast and if you want to learn about all the cool features that even beginners can use as well as how to install it download it and use it you can watch the video that will be linked here and also in the description so how can you get it well as a code beauty viewer you can use the link in the description right now to get one month free trial of visual assist so definitely check it out and reduce the stress of learning programming and get yourself assistance so to return to the topic of this video i first want to share some very important information about arrays and dynamic arrays and after understanding those two it will be very easy for you to know and understand how and when to use vectors so when i talked about arrays in this video i said that arrays are a type of collection that stores elements in a continuous memory which means one element after the other i also said that arrays have fixed size which means that if you declare an array of 10 elements you can store only 10 elements or less into that array but not a single element more so now i'm going to give you an example of when using arrays would be good idea and then i'm also going to give you an example of when using arrays would be a potential problem as well as how to solve that situation so imagine the following situation you are building an application that shows top 100 best cryptocurrencies to invest in together with their prices now these things change very quickly due to the market activity so you want to keep your users updated you want to update the prices sometimes you even want to remove one cryptocurrency and add another cryptocurrency into top 100 so in this situation using arrays would be ideal solution why well because you would be able to make those updates and those changes very quickly because you would be able to access every single element of that array directly how come well because you can access elements of arrays directly by using the name of the array and the index or the position of that element and also because you always want to display and show top 100 cryptocurrencies so not 101 or 99 but always 100 then in that situation using arrays would be ideal solution but let's imagine a different problem let's say that you have built your own programming course and you want people to enroll into that course so you decide okay i am not really popular not many people know about me so i expect 100 people to enroll into that course not more not less so with that in mind you decide that you are going to create an array of 100 students in your application and that is where you are going to store your students but what happens down the line is that people realize that your course is very good so they start sharing it with their friends and soon before you realize it 1000 people want to enroll in your course but that is just not possible because you hard coded the array to 100 students so you cannot store any more students so that is one potential problem that can happen and another potential problem that can happen is that let's say someone else creates even better course than you so only 10 people decide to enroll in your course so what happens in this situation is that 90 of the space that you created for that array is going to be empty but it will still hold that memory so that other applications cannot use it so you have the array for 100 students but you have only 10 students inside that array but again it is taking that memory and other applications cannot use it so this means that for this specific situation using arrays is not a good solution and it is not good because of two reasons first reason is if you want to fix this problem if 1000 people want to all of a sudden enroll in your course in order to fix this problem you need to rewrite your code and you need to fix that bug in your code which later requires you to rebuild your application and redeploy it and that takes time and the second reason is that during that time other students will not be able to enroll into your course so that means that you are effectively losing money while your application is unavailable for more students so with this in mind we can conclude that using arrays for solving this type of problem is not an ideal solution it's actually terrible solution so now i'm going to explain how you can approach this problem and solve it in a better way a better solution for this problem would be using dynamic arrays and this is because dynamic arrays have the ability to resize themselves when something happens and that something is usually adding new elements or removing existing elements so let's say that you have a dynamic array that has 100 elements so it can store 100 elements so currently you have 99 students and at the moment that you are adding 100 student your dynamic array says hey i see that this array has the potential to grow even more so what i'm going to do now is i am going to resize myself so how does it do that well it allocates space for bigger array that can store for example 105 elements or 110 elements and then it copies the old smaller array into that bigger array that it has allocated and then it deletes the allocates that old array so now you have a bigger array you have all of your elements and you have some additional space to add more elements so that is how dynamic arrays work and then also if you have let's say only 10 elements inside your dynamic array there is no need to have an array of 100 elements you can have a dynamic array of 15 elements for example so that you don't waste all of that memory that you are not currently using so that is how dynamic arrays work and if you want to learn more about dynamic arrays as well as how to implement them and understand them in more detail you can watch the video that will be linked here and i will also link it in the description and now i'm going to talk about an even better solution which is stl vector so stl vector is something that has all the benefits of dynamic arrays but with much less work so now i'm going to explain what is stl vector and i will show you the examples of how to use stlvector and then after you see those examples at the end of this video i will come back to this topic once more and explain the difference between vector and dynamic array so that you can know when to use each one and what are advantages and disadvantages of both okay so a vector is a type of collection that behaves like a dynamic array it is an array because it stores elements in a continuous memory which means one after the other like an array does rather than randomly in your memory like some other collections do for example a linked list and then it is also dynamic because it has the ability to resize itself when you are adding new elements or removing existing elements so when you add new elements into your vector it is going to increase in size and then when you remove existing elements it will decrease in size so that it doesn't take unnecessary space in memory so how do you create a vector well it's very easy you need two things first you need to include vector here so include vector like this and then second thing is you just create a vector so you say please create a vector of in this situation vector of integers and then you give it a name so let's say numbers okay so with this i have created a vector of integers that is called numbers one important thing that you can notice here is that you don't specify the size for your vector like you would specify the size for an array and this is because vector resizes itself automatically okay so in this video i'm going to show you all the important functionalities that you need to know about and understand how to use that are related to vector collection so the first thing that you need to know is how to insert elements into this vector so in order to do that you would say numbers dot push back and then here you put the element that you want to insert into your vector so this is how you insert elements into vector and then let's add a couple of more let's say 4 inch i is equal to 1 i is less than or equal to 10 and then i plus plus okay and then here i'm going to say numbers push back i like this so with this for loop i have added 10 elements into this vector here so now the question is how can we access and print these elements well i'm going to show you two ways to do this the first one is going to be a quick and easy way and then the second one will be using iterators which is an important topic related to vectors which i'm going to explain later so let's see the quick way first so you say 4 and number of numbers vector and then here c out number and then let's put an end line okay so this here is a quick and easy way to print the elements of a vector so you use for each loop and you iterate through your numbers vector that numbers vector contains integers and you give the name to every single element of that vector and then here i am just printing that element in the current iteration so if i run this program let's see what we will get and we get the first element that we added here and then we also get the remaining 10 elements that we added using our for loop another way to do this thing here is with the help of iterators and iterators are important topic related to vectors so what are iterators iterators are like special functions that point to some important locations in your vector two most important locations in your vector are its beginning and end so we have two iterators called begin and end so let's see how we can do this thing here with the help of iterators so i'm going to say for auto i t so iterator is equal to numbers begin okay this has been automatically generated for me so please start at numbers begin iterator and then go until numbers end iterator and then please increment the iterator in each iteration by one like this okay and what i want to do inside here is i want to say see out iterator and then let's also add end line okay let's make a quick pause here so that i can explain a couple of things first thing is this auto part here what does this mean well it means the following please check which type this part here will return and then automatically assign that type to this it iterator so that is all that it means please do that automatically so that i as a programmer developer don't have to do that myself okay and then second thing that i want to explain is this error here in c plus plus in programming you cannot actually print the iterator itself so this part here is not allowed but you can do one of following options so what you can do is you can print the value of the element of that iterator like this and then another thing that you can do is you can print the address of the iterator like this and then the third option that you have is you can print the address of the element like this okay so those are three options the value of the element the address of the iterator and then the address of the element so if i run the program let's see what we will get okay so we get this for all the elements inside our numbers vector so here is the value of the first element and then the address of the iterator and then the address of the first element itself and then the value for the second element the address of its iterator and then the address of the second element and so on and so on for every single element inside our numbers vector so one more time these are four options you cannot do this so you cannot print the iterator itself what you can do are these three options so you can print the value of the element you can print the address of the iterator and you can print the address of the element itself now let's delete this part here because i want to show you some more interesting things that you can do with vectors so what you can do is you can perform arithmetic operations on vectors so how would you do that so again let's say auto i t so auto iterator will be equal to numbers begin so please assign it to the beginning of my vector and then what i want to do is i want to say c out please print the value that is stored on this i t plus five so this is perfectly valid and you can do this so if i run this program what do you expect to get can someone please explain this in the comments okay so let's run the program and we get the value of 5 and the reason is we have 11 elements inside our vector so we start at zero and then we add five more elements to that so we get the value of five but if i removed this part here i'm just going to comment it and if i run the program again now we are going to get the value of 6 because we start at the iterator position 1 and then we add 5 more elements as we have specified here so that means that we are going to move five more spaces which furthermore means that we have moved to the element six now let's see a couple of more interesting things that we can do with iterators and vectors so let me return that for loop that we had before so here is our for loop and here are the iterators that return the beginning of the vector and end of the vector now an interesting thing is that there are two more iterators that are used very often in programming with vectors and those are c begin and c end so what is the difference between these two and the two that we had previously so the ones without c well let me show you that on an example what is going to happen if i say something like please dereference the value of this iterator and assign it the value of 20. so if i run the program every single element of this vector should have the value of 20. okay so that is what we have achieved by assigning the value of 20 to every single element inside this for loop but what is going to happen if i decide to use c begin and c and iterators well immediately we are going to get an error and that error says that expression must be a modifiable value that means that c begin and c and are constant iterators which means that if you declare an iterator as a constant so c begin and c and constant begin and constant n you will not be able to change its value and we can clearly see that part here so we are not able to do this anymore because our iterators are made constant so when would you use constant iterators you would use constant iterators when you create a functionality that only needs to for example print the data but not change it so chances are that you are going to work with other developers as well so if you don't want another developer to do something like this by accident in order to prevent him to do that and change the data again accidentally and cause a bug in that way you can prevent him by using constant iterators like i did here so let's see what are some other important functionalities of vector i'm going to put all of the functionalities that you should know about here on the screen and then i will be back to explain them so here are some interesting functionalities that you are going to see and use very often when you are working with vectors and here i also have the results for these functionalities so let's start with the first one okay so the first one is size and size tells you what is the current size of your vector and as you can see initially the size of your vector is 10 because at the beginning we have added 10 elements to our numbers vector okay and then the second functionality is max size max size tells you what is the maximum number of elements that you can add to your vector and that is this number here which i'm not even going to try to pronounce okay and then capacity this one is very interesting and capacity tells you how many elements you can add to your vector before resizing it so here it says that capacity is 13 and we already have 10 elements inside our vector which means that we can add three more elements before resizing this numbers vector so that is what capacity functionality tells you and then vector dot resize will resize your vector to the size that you specify here so here i have resized my numbers vector to the size of five so if i try to print the size of that vector after resizing it here you can see that the new size is 5. so now we have only five elements inside our numbers vector okay and then this part here will check if vector is empty or not so if this vector here is empty it will print that the vector is empty else it will print that vector is not empty so since we currently have five elements inside our vector that means that the vector is not empty which you can see here okay and then we have two ways to access elements of a vector directly besides the one that i have showed you with using arithmetic operations we have two more ways and that is with these squared brackets so you specify the name of your vector and then you specify the index or the position of the element that you want to access and here you can see that element at position zero is one that is the first way and then the second way is with this at functionality and it works absolutely the same so you say numbers dot at and then you specify the position and as you can see here the element at position 0 is 1 and that is because the indexing of vectors the same as arrays starts with zero and then another functionality is front and front will tell you which is the front element of your vector and in this situation the front or the first element is number one and then back will tell you what is the last element of your vector so that is element five as you can see here and then another thing that i want to show you is how you can clear your vector and that is with the help of functionality called clear it is going to delete all elements so if i try to check for the size of my vector after i have cleared it here you can see that the new size will be equal to zero okay so let's clear this code very quickly because i want to show you a couple of more interesting functionalities that you should know about so there are two more functionalities that are very important for you to know related to vectors and those are how you can insert an element at a specific position inside your vector and then how you can remove an element from a specific position inside your vector so for that you use functions called insert and erase so let's first see how this insert functionality works so here you specify the name of your vector and then you say insert and then here you will specify the position at which you want to insert this element here so number 88 and the position is beginning of the vector plus five so that means the element with index five so with this part here i'm going to print the elements of the vector so let's see what is going to be the result okay so as you can see the number 88 appears at the position five so again the indexation of vectors starts at zero the same as array so this is element zero element 1 2 3 4 and then element 5 which has this value that we have specified here and then if i want to remove an element from a specific position i would use function called erase and then specify the position that i want to remove the element from so when i uncomment this line here it will remove the element from position five so if i run the program again as you can see this 88 has disappeared because that was the element on position five and then another interesting functionality that you can do is you can also say numbers dot pop back and this functionality is going to remove an element from the back of your vector so if i start the program once more as you can see the last element which was number 10 now has been popped which means that it was removed so those were some functionalities that you should know about and i'm going to print all of this code in a comment so that you can use it and now we have come to the final question which is what is the difference between dynamic array and vector and which one you should use a vector is a class which means that it is like a container that completely hides memory management from the programmer and it also provides you with useful functionalities that are very easy to use as you could see already in the examples that i have shown a dynamic array on the other hand is like an oldfashioned way to do this same thing so in dynamic arrays every time that you want to either increase or decrease the size of your array you need to work with raw pointers and you need to use new and delete keywords in order to allocate and deallocate memory and if you want to learn how to do this you can watch the video that will be linked in the description so now the question is what is better vector or dynamic array and the answer is that vector will be better for 99 of situations why well because vector is standardized everyone knows how to use it and millions of developers have already used it and tested it so it is not errorprone it doesn't have errors on the other hand if you decide to manage memory on your own and use dynamic arrays you could get slightly better time or memory performance but you risk to make so many bucks at that process that it is probably not even worth it so my recommendation is to use vectors always and only if you have performance or memory

switching to dynamic arrays so again you should be aware that both exist you should know what is dynamic array and what is vector you should also know what are the differences and pros and cons but again my recommendation is to always use vector so that would be all for this video if you enjoyed it please give it a big thumbs up because that means a lot to the youtube algorithm and then also share this video with other people who are struggling with programming and who need to learn about this topic and if you have any questions make sure to put them in the comment section so that i can reply and so that other people who are wondering about the same things can read those answers so again thank you very much for watching and i'm going to see you in some other video bye
