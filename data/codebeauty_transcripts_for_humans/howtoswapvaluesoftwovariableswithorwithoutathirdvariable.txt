00:00 - hi guys welcome to my channel in this
00:03 - video I wanted to answer a question that
00:05 - I recently got and there is a question
00:08 - that is often asked on job interviews
00:10 - and also students get it on their exams
00:12 - and that is a question on how you can
00:15 - swap the value of two variables I'm
00:18 - going to give you two ways to solve this
00:20 - problem but let me just explain what I
00:22 - mean by this so I'm going to copy the
00:26 - text of this problem here like this and
00:31 - let me say that I have one variable
00:34 - which is going to be called a and that
00:37 - variable is going told value of 20 let's
00:40 - say and then I have another variable
00:43 - which is going to be called V and that
00:45 - variable holds value of 10 and now I
00:48 - need to switch the value so to swap the
00:51 - value of these two variables
00:52 - I want my a to hold whatever my B is
00:55 - holding and then I want my B to hold
00:58 - whatever mine is holding so how we are
01:01 - going to do that for the first
01:03 - explanation I will need something so let
01:05 - me get it so here I have two glasses and
01:09 - inside this left glass I have my green
01:12 - juice and then inside this glass I have
01:15 - just plain water and the question that
01:18 - we have in our visual studio is
01:20 - equivalent to a question how we can swap
01:23 - the content of these two glasses and to
01:27 - solve that problem I'm going to use
01:29 - another glass so temporary glass and
01:33 - that is this one here and I'm sorry guys
01:35 - I know this is not a glass it's a shaker
01:37 - but it will do for this explanation so
01:40 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
01:42 - take this this last is variable and I'm
01:46 - going to put its content inside this
01:49 - third glass this temporary glass okay
01:53 - and then when I have saved the value of
01:57 - this glass inside this temporary glass
02:00 - what I can do is I can put my green
02:04 - juice so the content of this lies inside
02:06 - here okay
02:10 - this is a bit more complex in
02:13 - real-life game programming so once you
02:17 - do that you have saved the value of this
02:21 - glass here so the content of this glass
02:24 - here inside this class and now what we
02:26 - are left to do is just to put whatever
02:29 - our temp that variable our temp glass
02:32 - was holding inside this glass here and
02:35 - now we have successfully accomplished to
02:38 - solve this problem so we have switched
02:40 - the content of these two glasses you
02:42 - know let's just translate this into our
02:45 - code now that I have explained the
02:48 - algorithm to solve this problem we are
02:50 - just going to translate that algorithm
02:53 - into C++ code so the first thing that
02:56 - I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
02:58 - variable a temporary variable which I'm
03:01 - going to call temp and inside that temp
03:04 - variable I'm going to put whatever my a
03:07 - is holding so I'm going to say that my
03:09 - temp holds now whatever is inside my a
03:13 - variable and since we have our a
03:15 - variable 3 now to hold something else
03:18 - I'm going to put my B value inside my a
03:22 - so now my a is going told whatever my D
03:25 - is holding and now that we have saved
03:28 - the value of our be inside our a
03:30 - variable we can put inside our B
03:34 - whatever our temp variable is holding so
03:38 - that is the value that previously was
03:41 - inside our a variable and this here is
03:44 - really the algorithm to solve this
03:47 - problem using a third variable and let's
03:50 - just quickly add a seat out so then we
03:52 - can see what we have done so our a is
03:56 - equal to a and then our B is equal to RB
04:05 - now let's add and line like this and I'm
04:10 - going to just a comma sign here ok and
04:14 - if I run the program you see now that
04:18 - here we have a is equal to 20 and B is
04:22 - equal to 10 and now we have successfully
04:24 - swapped the value of these two variables
04:27 - so
04:27 - now my a is holding then and that might
04:31 - be is holding twenty which previously
04:33 - was inside my a variable and this is a
04:37 - solution for our problem using a third
04:39 - variable but this question is often
04:42 - asked in another way and that is how you
04:45 - can swap the value of two variables
04:47 - without using a third variable and now
04:50 - I'm going to explain that so let me very
04:53 - quickly delete this until here okay and
04:59 - in order to solve this problem without
05:01 - using third variable you will have to
05:04 - think in a more mathematical way and the
05:07 - solution for this is going to be the
05:09 - following so the first thing that I'm
05:11 - going to do is I'm going to say ok let's
05:14 - say that my a variable is going to hold
05:16 - whatever my 8 is holding and I'm going
05:20 - to add whatever my B is holding also and
05:23 - this expression here would be really
05:26 - incorrect in any mathematics but in
05:29 - programming this is this is a valid
05:30 - expression and it means this here
05:34 - whatever this expression results in I'm
05:36 - going to assign that to my a variable
05:39 - and this here is whatever my a is
05:42 - holding plus whatever my B is holding
05:44 - assign that to a so that is going to be
05:47 - a so 20 plus B 10 that is equal to 30 so
05:53 - now in this line here my a is going to
05:56 - hold the value of 30 and then in the
06:00 - next line let's see now my B is going to
06:05 - hold whatever my a is holding and then
06:08 - subtract whatever might be is holding
06:11 - from that so in this line here I'm going
06:14 - to say store inside might be the result
06:17 - of this expression here and this
06:20 - expression will result in following a so
06:24 - 30 minus B minus 10 that is going to be
06:28 - 30 minus 10 20 so in this line here my B
06:33 - is going to hold the value of 20 and
06:36 - then what we are left to do is just to
06:39 - put
06:40 - the correct value inside RA and that is
06:43 - going to be equal to a minus B this
06:49 - means whatever my is holding at this
06:51 - very moment and that is 30 minus
06:55 - whatever might be is holding at this
06:57 - very moment and that is 20 in guys 30
07:01 - minus 20 is going to result in and our a
07:04 - is going to get the value of 10 in this
07:07 - line here so now if I write out C out is
07:14 - equal to a now let's add a line and then
07:19 - C out B is equal to B and if I run my
07:27 - program you see that I'm going to get
07:31 - the expected result so my a now is
07:34 - holding whatever might be was holding so
07:37 - 10 and that might be is holding this
07:40 - value that previously was inside our a
07:42 - variable here so we have solved this
07:46 - problem in two way so with or without a
07:49 - third variable so if you found this

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys welcome to my channel in this video I wanted to answer a question that I recently got and there is a question that is often asked on job interviews and also students get it on their exams and that is a question on how you can swap the value of two variables I'm going to give you two ways to solve this problem but let me just explain what I mean by this so I'm going to copy the text of this problem here like this and let me say that I have one variable which is going to be called a and that variable is going told value of 20 let's say and then I have another variable which is going to be called V and that variable holds value of 10 and now I need to switch the value so to swap the value of these two variables I want my a to hold whatever my B is holding and then I want my B to hold whatever mine is holding so how we are going to do that for the first explanation I will need something so let me get it so here I have two glasses and inside this left glass I have my green juice and then inside this glass I have just plain water and the question that we have in our visual studio is equivalent to a question how we can swap the content of these two glasses and to solve that problem I'm going to use another glass so temporary glass and that is this one here and I'm sorry guys I know this is not a glass it's a shaker but it will do for this explanation so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this this last is variable and I'm going to put its content inside this third glass this temporary glass okay and then when I have saved the value of this glass inside this temporary glass what I can do is I can put my green juice so the content of this lies inside here okay this is a bit more complex in reallife game programming so once you do that you have saved the value of this glass here so the content of this glass here inside this class and now what we are left to do is just to put whatever our temp that variable our temp glass was holding inside this glass here and now we have successfully accomplished to solve this problem so we have switched the content of these two glasses you know let's just translate this into our code now that I have explained the algorithm to solve this problem we are just going to translate that algorithm into C++ code so the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable a temporary variable which I'm going to call temp and inside that temp variable I'm going to put whatever my a is holding so I'm going to say that my temp holds now whatever is inside my a variable and since we have our a variable 3 now to hold something else I'm going to put my B value inside my a so now my a is going told whatever my D is holding and now that we have saved the value of our be inside our a variable we can put inside our B whatever our temp variable is holding so that is the value that previously was inside our a variable and this here is really the algorithm to solve this problem using a third variable and let's just quickly add a seat out so then we can see what we have done so our a is equal to a and then our B is equal to RB now let's add and line like this and I'm going to just a comma sign here ok and if I run the program you see now that here we have a is equal to 20 and B is equal to 10 and now we have successfully swapped the value of these two variables so now my a is holding then and that might be is holding twenty which previously was inside my a variable and this is a solution for our problem using a third variable but this question is often asked in another way and that is how you can swap the value of two variables without using a third variable and now I'm going to explain that so let me very quickly delete this until here okay and in order to solve this problem without using third variable you will have to think in a more mathematical way and the solution for this is going to be the following so the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to say ok let's say that my a variable is going to hold whatever my 8 is holding and I'm going to add whatever my B is holding also and this expression here would be really incorrect in any mathematics but in programming this is this is a valid expression and it means this here whatever this expression results in I'm going to assign that to my a variable and this here is whatever my a is holding plus whatever my B is holding assign that to a so that is going to be a so 20 plus B 10 that is equal to 30 so now in this line here my a is going to hold the value of 30 and then in the next line let's see now my B is going to hold whatever my a is holding and then subtract whatever might be is holding from that so in this line here I'm going to say store inside might be the result of this expression here and this expression will result in following a so 30 minus B minus 10 that is going to be 30 minus 10 20 so in this line here my B is going to hold the value of 20 and then what we are left to do is just to put the correct value inside RA and that is going to be equal to a minus B this means whatever my is holding at this very moment and that is 30 minus whatever might be is holding at this very moment and that is 20 in guys 30 minus 20 is going to result in and our a is going to get the value of 10 in this line here so now if I write out C out is equal to a now let's add a line and then C out B is equal to B and if I run my program you see that I'm going to get the expected result so my a now is holding whatever might be was holding so 10 and that might be is holding this value that previously was inside our a variable here so we have solved this problem in two way so with or without a third variable so if you found this video helpful make sure to like it and do subscribe to my channel and also any questions that you have leave those in the comments down below and share this video with anyone who'd like to learn programming and I'm going to see you in my next video and also guys one question for you if you have any recipes any algorithms on how you can make green juice taste and smell good please make sure to write those in a comments down below bye
