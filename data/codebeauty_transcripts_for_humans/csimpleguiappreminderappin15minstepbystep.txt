00:00 - hi guys and welcome to my channel in
00:02 - this video I want to show you how you
00:03 - can build your programming skills by
00:05 - building simple and small projects so in
00:08 - this video we will build one together
00:10 - and then also make sure to watch until
00:12 - the end because there will be some
00:13 - examples for you to practice so here is
00:16 - a quick demo of the application that we
00:18 - are going to build so here is the
00:20 - application that we want to build it has
00:22 - date time and then here we will put in a
00:26 - message and when we click set reminder
00:28 - it is going to remind us when that time
00:30 - comes so let's say that I want a
00:32 - reminder message at
00:35 - 1503 and let's say that I want to tell
00:40 - wake up and click set reminder and now
00:44 - we wait until 1503 okay
00:49 - [Music]
00:52 - so here is our message and now I'm going
00:55 - to show you how to build this app but
00:57 - before we start I have a surprise
01:00 - are you ready to take your programming
01:03 - skills to the next level because my
01:06 - programming course is coming soon and
01:08 - it's unlike anything you've ever seen
01:10 - before we are going to dive deep into
01:13 - programming and I will teach you about
01:17 - all of the concepts but not on
01:19 - individual small examples I will teach
01:22 - you how all of the programming Concepts
01:24 - work together and how they coexist to
01:27 - make big complex real world applications
01:30 - so this is going to be beginner to
01:33 - Advanced programming course and all of
01:35 - the things that you can already see on
01:37 - my YouTube channel are maybe three
01:39 - percent of this programming course and
01:42 - the remaining 97 are the things that you
01:45 - cannot find anywhere else on the
01:47 - internet so for those of you who watch
01:50 - my YouTube videos I want to give you a
01:52 - special discount so make sure to click
01:55 - the link in the description to secure
01:57 - your place because I have already
01:58 - published this news in my last video and
02:00 - a lot of people people have already
02:01 - signed up and unfortunately the number
02:04 - of people that can get a discount is
02:06 - limited so if you want one make sure to
02:09 - sign up now so let's go back to our
02:12 - project and see how we are going to
02:13 - build this application so to build this
02:16 - application I will use C plus Builder
02:18 - because it is the easiest and fastest
02:20 - way to build multi-platform applications
02:22 - with C plus so if you don't already have
02:25 - it I will put a link in the description
02:27 - so that you can download it and code
02:29 - along with me you could already see how
02:32 - our application is going to look like so
02:34 - let's start building it and let's start
02:36 - building user interface first
02:39 - so here in this palette I will drag and
02:41 - drop all of the controls that we need
02:43 - first of all we need date control so
02:48 - it's called T date edit I'll drag and
02:51 - drop it and then we need also time edit
02:55 - it's called T time edit drag and drop
02:58 - that as well okay and then we need the
03:02 - edit which is just a regular input field
03:05 - text box where you can write your
03:07 - message and we need button
03:11 - okay
03:12 - and another control that we need is
03:15 - called T timer and if you don't see it
03:18 - here make sure to delete this and then
03:21 - click on this Arrow which says show
03:23 - palette categories and select system and
03:27 - here under system you should be able to
03:29 - see tea timer so drag and drop that as
03:31 - well so here are all of the controls
03:33 - that we will need now I will just resize
03:36 - them a little bit and position them and
03:38 - then I will be back so here are all of
03:40 - the controls I've just repositioned them
03:42 - a little bit and also don't forget to
03:45 - change the names of all of these
03:47 - controls because we want to access them
03:49 - from our c plus code and we will do that
03:52 - by using their names so this control
03:54 - here is called reminder date and then
03:58 - this one here is called reminder time
04:00 - and then reminder message and our button
04:04 - is called set reminder button and I've
04:07 - also changed the text for our button it
04:10 - now says set reminder okay and this
04:14 - timer here also change its name and call
04:16 - it reminder timer
04:19 - like this so now what we need to do is
04:22 - implement the functionality for this set
04:25 - reminder button so I will double click
04:28 - on it and as you can see here we have
04:31 - Handler and inside this Handler we are
04:34 - going to describe what is going to
04:36 - happen when our user enters the date and
04:40 - time and reminder message and clicks set
04:42 - reminder so how are we going to
04:44 - implement this functionality first we
04:47 - need to get the values that our user has
04:49 - entered for date and time and then we
04:53 - will find the difference between that
04:55 - reminder date and time and the current
04:57 - time in order to get the remaining time
05:01 - until that message should be shown and
05:04 - we will use that remaining time as an
05:07 - interval for our timer so our timer will
05:10 - be set and it will count that remaining
05:13 - time and then it will show the message
05:14 - so let's start building that step by
05:17 - step so first I want to get the values
05:19 - the user has entered so I will say t
05:23 - date and I will call that variable
05:26 - reminder date okay and inside reminder
05:30 - date which is of type T date I will
05:33 - store the value
05:35 - from this field here I need its name its
05:39 - name is reminder date so I will copy
05:41 - that and go back here and here I will
05:45 - say
05:46 - reminder date and I will take date value
05:51 - from it okay this is how we get date now
05:55 - let's get time as well so I will say tea
05:57 - time and I will call it reminder time is
06:01 - equal to and I believe that this is
06:05 - called reminder time I'm correct okay so
06:08 - let's go back and let's
06:11 - say reminder time and then from this I
06:14 - want to take time like this okay now I
06:18 - want to join these two variables into
06:21 - one so there is a type called T date
06:25 - time
06:27 - like this and I will call this variable
06:30 - reminder date time
06:33 - okay reminder
06:36 - date
06:38 - oh my God this is time is equal to and
06:42 - there is a very easy way to join these
06:45 - two values you just say reminder date
06:49 - Plus
06:51 - reminder time okay let's do a little bit
06:55 - of formatting here okay so inside this
06:58 - variable now we have our reminder date
07:01 - and time the next step that I want to do
07:04 - is I want to find the difference between
07:06 - this reminder date time that our user
07:09 - has set and the current time and to
07:12 - determine current time there is a
07:13 - function called now so we will use that
07:16 - and this is how we are going to use it I
07:18 - will say the date time and call it
07:21 - remaining time
07:24 - okay and I will say that remaining time
07:27 - is equal to
07:30 - reminder date time minus
07:33 - now
07:34 - okay so this remaining time variable is
07:39 - going to store the difference between
07:41 - that reminder date time that our user
07:43 - wants this message to be shown at and
07:46 - the current time okay and we will store
07:49 - that value here so now we can set this
07:51 - difference as a timer and it is going to
07:54 - count count count and when it comes to
07:56 - that time it will show the reminder
07:58 - message but one important thing that we
08:01 - need to do before that is we need to
08:04 - convert this into milliseconds because
08:06 - this here is in date time format and our
08:10 - timer receives only milliseconds so how
08:13 - are we going to do that let me very
08:15 - quickly find something and then I will
08:17 - be back so this is what I've been
08:19 - looking for it's the number of
08:21 - milliseconds per day it's 86 million
08:24 - four hundred thousand okay why do I need
08:27 - this because the timer that we want to
08:30 - set receives only milliseconds so now we
08:34 - need to convert at this remaining time
08:36 - into milliseconds so how are we going to
08:38 - do that well let's first create a
08:41 - variable of type double
08:43 - and let's call it the remaining time in
08:46 - milliseconds let's say remaining time
08:49 - in milliseconds
08:52 - like this okay so how are we going to
08:55 - convert this into milliseconds it's very
08:58 - simple oh my God it is very simple check
09:02 - this out so I will multiply this
09:05 - remaining time with milliseconds per day
09:07 - but I first need to cast this to double
09:10 - because currently this is in date time
09:13 - format so I will use static
09:16 - cast and I will cast it to double type
09:20 - what I'm going to cast this so I need to
09:23 - put this into parentheses and I will
09:27 - multiply it by milliseconds per day
09:32 - like this okay and let's just move this
09:36 - into a new line like this so how does
09:39 - this work well very simple if this
09:42 - remaining time is an entire day when it
09:45 - is in date time format when you cast it
09:48 - to double then it will have the value of
09:50 - 1 1.0 so when you multiply 1.0 with this
09:57 - many milliseconds per day you will get
09:59 - exactly this many milliseconds which is
10:02 - one entire day so in this many
10:05 - milliseconds your reminder message will
10:08 - be shown and then if this is for example
10:10 - half a day when it is in date time
10:13 - format then when you convert it to
10:15 - double it is going to be 0.5 so when you
10:19 - multiply 0.5 by this many milliseconds
10:22 - you will get half of this so you will
10:25 - get 43 million and 200 000 which means
10:29 - that in that many milliseconds your
10:31 - reminder message will be shown and that
10:33 - many milliseconds is half a day so that
10:37 - is how this part here works and now what
10:40 - we can do is we can use this value here
10:43 - and set it as the interval for our timer
10:46 - so here I will say reminder timer and I
10:51 - will set its interval please make sure
10:53 - to use this Arrow because we are working
10:56 - with pointers here and this is a pointer
10:59 - so here I will say interval
11:01 - and its value is going to be this value
11:06 - here like this and the only remaining
11:09 - thing to do is to say that this reminder
11:12 - timer is now enabled so reminder timer
11:17 - enabled is equal to True like this so
11:21 - with this we have successfully set our
11:24 - timer so the next thing that we need to
11:26 - do is we need to define the behavior of
11:28 - our application when this time is
11:31 - reached so go to design file or your
11:35 - form Dot fmx and here you need to double
11:38 - click on your timer okay and you will
11:42 - get this function here and inside it we
11:45 - will Define two things
11:47 - first as soon as this timer is reached
11:50 - we want to disable it and second thing
11:53 - is we want to show that message to our
11:55 - user so let's go very quickly to our
11:58 - design file once more just to check the
12:00 - name of this timer it's called a
12:02 - reminder timer and I will go back to my
12:05 - CPP code and here I will say reminder
12:08 - timer enabled
12:11 - it's capital letter E enabled
12:15 - is equal to false so this means that
12:18 - from this point on our reminder timer
12:20 - will be disabled and the second thing
12:23 - was to show the message so I will say
12:25 - show message there's already a function
12:28 - for that and inside here I want to show
12:31 - whatever our user has typed into this
12:35 - edit field and the name of this edit
12:38 - field is reminder message so go back to
12:42 - CPP and here I will show reminder
12:45 - message text
12:48 - like this and make sure that it's
12:50 - capital letter T okay so that is the
12:54 - last thing and one more thing before we
12:57 - run this application is we actually want
13:00 - to start our application with this timer
13:03 - in disabled mode so inside your
13:07 - Constructor of the form you need to say
13:10 - that this timer will be disabled when
13:13 - the application starts because you want
13:16 - to control yourself when the timer
13:19 - should be enabled and that is here okay
13:22 - so now if I run this application
13:25 - let's see what's going to happen so here
13:28 - we need to select the date it's today's
13:30 - date so I don't want to change that I
13:33 - just want to change the time so let's
13:34 - say 14 57 and let's say wake up and here
13:41 - I will say set reminder and now we wait
13:45 - okay
13:48 - foreign
13:52 - and as you can see here is our message
13:54 - now one important thing that you should
13:57 - keep in mind is that this message can be
14:00 - a few seconds early or a few seconds
14:02 - late and that can be due to two things
14:05 - first one is that this code does need
14:08 - some time to execute and then second
14:11 - reason is that your system time does not
14:13 - necessarily need to be in sync with this
14:16 - time in perfect sync so if your
14:18 - notification is late or early that is
14:21 - potential reason so at the beginning of
14:23 - this video I promise to give you a
14:25 - couple of ideas on how you can practice
14:27 - programming on your own so now I'm going
14:29 - to do that this entire project was
14:32 - inspired by one of my reels this one
14:35 - so you guys asked me to help you
14:38 - implement some of these projects so I
14:40 - decided to do that right now and if you
14:43 - want to get more ideas and if you want
14:45 - to get more tips or best practices and
14:48 - things like that make sure to follow me
14:50 - on Instagram because I am a lot more
14:53 - active there because it's much faster to
14:55 - create content for Instagram so
14:57 - definitely add me there so that we can
14:59 - stay in touch between my YouTube videos
15:01 - the link for my Instagram profile will
15:04 - be in the description so thank you very
15:06 - much I hope that you enjoyed this video
15:08 - if you have any questions you can leave
15:09 - those in the comment section and if you
15:12 - want more videos like this one give this
15:14 - video a big thumbs up thank you again
15:16 - for watching and I will see you in some
15:18 - other video bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys and welcome to my channel in this video I want to show you how you can build your programming skills by building simple and small projects so in this video we will build one together and then also make sure to watch until the end because there will be some examples for you to practice so here is a quick demo of the application that we are going to build so here is the application that we want to build it has date time and then here we will put in a message and when we click set reminder it is going to remind us when that time comes so let's say that I want a reminder message at 1503 and let's say that I want to tell wake up and click set reminder and now we wait until 1503 okay so here is our message and now I'm going to show you how to build this app but before we start I have a surprise are you ready to take your programming skills to the next level because my programming course is coming soon and it's unlike anything you've ever seen before we are going to dive deep into programming and I will teach you about all of the concepts but not on individual small examples I will teach you how all of the programming Concepts work together and how they coexist to make big complex real world applications so this is going to be beginner to Advanced programming course and all of the things that you can already see on my YouTube channel are maybe three percent of this programming course and the remaining 97 are the things that you cannot find anywhere else on the internet so for those of you who watch my YouTube videos I want to give you a special discount so make sure to click the link in the description to secure your place because I have already published this news in my last video and a lot of people people have already signed up and unfortunately the number of people that can get a discount is limited so if you want one make sure to sign up now so let's go back to our project and see how we are going to build this application so to build this application I will use C plus Builder because it is the easiest and fastest way to build multiplatform applications with C plus so if you don't already have it I will put a link in the description so that you can download it and code along with me you could already see how our application is going to look like so let's start building it and let's start building user interface first so here in this palette I will drag and drop all of the controls that we need first of all we need date control so it's called T date edit I'll drag and drop it and then we need also time edit it's called T time edit drag and drop that as well okay and then we need the edit which is just a regular input field text box where you can write your message and we need button okay and another control that we need is called T timer and if you don't see it here make sure to delete this and then click on this Arrow which says show palette categories and select system and here under system you should be able to see tea timer so drag and drop that as well so here are all of the controls that we will need now I will just resize them a little bit and position them and then I will be back so here are all of the controls I've just repositioned them a little bit and also don't forget to change the names of all of these controls because we want to access them from our c plus code and we will do that by using their names so this control here is called reminder date and then this one here is called reminder time and then reminder message and our button is called set reminder button and I've also changed the text for our button it now says set reminder okay and this timer here also change its name and call it reminder timer like this so now what we need to do is implement the functionality for this set reminder button so I will double click on it and as you can see here we have Handler and inside this Handler we are going to describe what is going to happen when our user enters the date and time and reminder message and clicks set reminder so how are we going to implement this functionality first we need to get the values that our user has entered for date and time and then we will find the difference between that reminder date and time and the current time in order to get the remaining time until that message should be shown and we will use that remaining time as an interval for our timer so our timer will be set and it will count that remaining time and then it will show the message so let's start building that step by step so first I want to get the values the user has entered so I will say t date and I will call that variable reminder date okay and inside reminder date which is of type T date I will store the value from this field here I need its name its name is reminder date so I will copy that and go back here and here I will say reminder date and I will take date value from it okay this is how we get date now let's get time as well so I will say tea time and I will call it reminder time is equal to and I believe that this is called reminder time I'm correct okay so let's go back and let's say reminder time and then from this I want to take time like this okay now I want to join these two variables into one so there is a type called T date time like this and I will call this variable reminder date time okay reminder date oh my God this is time is equal to and there is a very easy way to join these two values you just say reminder date Plus reminder time okay let's do a little bit of formatting here okay so inside this variable now we have our reminder date and time the next step that I want to do is I want to find the difference between this reminder date time that our user has set and the current time and to determine current time there is a function called now so we will use that and this is how we are going to use it I will say the date time and call it remaining time okay and I will say that remaining time is equal to reminder date time minus now okay so this remaining time variable is going to store the difference between that reminder date time that our user wants this message to be shown at and the current time okay and we will store that value here so now we can set this difference as a timer and it is going to count count count and when it comes to that time it will show the reminder message but one important thing that we need to do before that is we need to convert this into milliseconds because this here is in date time format and our timer receives only milliseconds so how are we going to do that let me very quickly find something and then I will be back so this is what I've been looking for it's the number of milliseconds per day it's 86 million four hundred thousand okay why do I need this because the timer that we want to set receives only milliseconds so now we need to convert at this remaining time into milliseconds so how are we going to do that well let's first create a variable of type double and let's call it the remaining time in milliseconds let's say remaining time in milliseconds like this okay so how are we going to convert this into milliseconds it's very simple oh my God it is very simple check this out so I will multiply this remaining time with milliseconds per day but I first need to cast this to double because currently this is in date time format so I will use static cast and I will cast it to double type what I'm going to cast this so I need to put this into parentheses and I will multiply it by milliseconds per day like this okay and let's just move this into a new line like this so how does this work well very simple if this remaining time is an entire day when it is in date time format when you cast it to double then it will have the value of 1 1.0 so when you multiply 1.0 with this many milliseconds per day you will get exactly this many milliseconds which is one entire day so in this many milliseconds your reminder message will be shown and then if this is for example half a day when it is in date time format then when you convert it to double it is going to be 0.5 so when you multiply 0.5 by this many milliseconds you will get half of this so you will get 43 million and 200 000 which means that in that many milliseconds your reminder message will be shown and that many milliseconds is half a day so that is how this part here works and now what we can do is we can use this value here and set it as the interval for our timer so here I will say reminder timer and I will set its interval please make sure to use this Arrow because we are working with pointers here and this is a pointer so here I will say interval and its value is going to be this value here like this and the only remaining thing to do is to say that this reminder timer is now enabled so reminder timer enabled is equal to True like this so with this we have successfully set our timer so the next thing that we need to do is we need to define the behavior of our application when this time is reached so go to design file or your form Dot fmx and here you need to double click on your timer okay and you will get this function here and inside it we will Define two things first as soon as this timer is reached we want to disable it and second thing is we want to show that message to our user so let's go very quickly to our design file once more just to check the name of this timer it's called a reminder timer and I will go back to my CPP code and here I will say reminder timer enabled it's capital letter E enabled is equal to false so this means that from this point on our reminder timer will be disabled and the second thing was to show the message so I will say show message there's already a function for that and inside here I want to show whatever our user has typed into this edit field and the name of this edit field is reminder message so go back to CPP and here I will show reminder message text like this and make sure that it's capital letter T okay so that is the last thing and one more thing before we run this application is we actually want to start our application with this timer in disabled mode so inside your Constructor of the form you need to say that this timer will be disabled when the application starts because you want to control yourself when the timer should be enabled and that is here okay so now if I run this application let's see what's going to happen so here we need to select the date it's today's date so I don't want to change that I just want to change the time so let's say 14 57 and let's say wake up and here I will say set reminder and now we wait okay foreign and as you can see here is our message now one important thing that you should keep in mind is that this message can be a few seconds early or a few seconds late and that can be due to two things first one is that this code does need some time to execute and then second reason is that your system time does not necessarily need to be in sync with this time in perfect sync so if your notification is late or early that is potential reason so at the beginning of this video I promise to give you a couple of ideas on how you can

because it's much faster to create content for Instagram so definitely add me there so that we can stay in touch between my YouTube videos the link for my Instagram profile will be in the description so thank you very much I hope that you enjoyed this video if you have any questions you can leave those in the comment section and if you want more videos like this one give this video a big thumbs up thank you again for watching and I will see you in some other video bye
