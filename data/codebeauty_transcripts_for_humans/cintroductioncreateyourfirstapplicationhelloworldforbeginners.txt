00:00 - hi guys and welcome to my channel this
00:02 - is going to be introduction to C
00:04 - programming language so in this video
00:06 - you are going to learn what is C what
00:09 - kind of applications we can build with C
00:11 - what is the difference between C and
00:13 - other programming languages and together
00:16 - we are going to build your first C
00:19 - application so I decided to divide this
00:21 - video into two parts the first part will
00:24 - be shorter and we are going to talk
00:26 - about some general stuff that is
00:28 - important related to C and then in the
00:31 - second part of the video we will install
00:33 - the tool that we need to write C
00:35 - applications and then together we are
00:37 - going to create your first C application
00:41 - and if you would like to learn practical
00:42 - programming I have an entire C practical
00:46 - programming course which is beginner
00:48 - friendly it's step by step everything is
00:51 - on one place from beginner to expert in
00:54 - the course we will focus on building
00:56 - real world applications so that you can
00:58 - get all of the programming skills and
01:00 - practical experience that you need to
01:02 - build the applications that you want and
01:05 - also you will get career ready skills so
01:08 - in this course I'm going to share over
01:10 - 10 years of my experience in a beginner
01:13 - friendly way so that you can also start
01:15 - building applications on your own in as
01:18 - little as 3 months you will also get
01:21 - access to an exclusive community of
01:23 - developers so that in this process of
01:25 - learning You Are Not Alone lost or
01:28 - confused because if if you have a
01:30 - question there will always be someone to
01:32 - help you very fast so that you can
01:35 - progress in an optimal way and the first
01:38 - 100 people who sign up using the link in
01:40 - the description will get a special
01:42 - discount so if you want to learn
01:44 - practical programming and start building
01:46 - real applications click the link and you
01:49 - can start your transformation from
01:51 - beginner to expert developer immediately
01:54 - so with that being said let's go to the
01:57 - topic of this video so the first
01:59 - question that I want to answer is what
02:01 - is c c is very powerful and verstile
02:05 - programming language it is developed by
02:07 - Microsoft and it is very very popular
02:11 - you can use it to build many different
02:13 - types of applications you can build
02:15 - modern desktop applications mobile
02:17 - applications games simple websites very
02:20 - big complex applications and so much
02:23 - more uh it is beginner friendly which
02:25 - means that it is suitable to learn as
02:28 - your first programming langu anguage but
02:30 - also if you already know another
02:32 - programming language like maybe C++ Java
02:35 - JavaScript Python and so on that
02:38 - knowledge will definitely help you
02:40 - because C is very similar to many other
02:43 - programming languages now I'm sure that
02:46 - as a beginner you probably heard about
02:48 - many different programming languages so
02:50 - now you are wondering which one is the
02:53 - best and which one you should pick um I
02:56 - want you to understand that programming
02:58 - languages are very similar in what way
03:00 - well when you learn one programming
03:02 - language then you start seeing patterns
03:05 - in other programming languages so it
03:07 - becomes very easy to switch to another
03:09 - programming language much easier than to
03:11 - learn your first programming language
03:14 - the same way that uh when you learn to
03:16 - drive a car and then you buy another car
03:20 - it is not going to be as hard to switch
03:22 - to that other car because you already
03:24 - know how to drive it will just take you
03:26 - a few days to get used to the new car so
03:29 - it's the same with programming languages
03:31 - but with that being said they are also
03:34 - very different because they have
03:35 - different purpose as I said with C you
03:39 - can build most of the modern
03:41 - applications that you and me are using
03:43 - every day so modern desktop applications
03:46 - mobile applications games websites and
03:49 - so on that is the purpose of C but if
03:52 - you want to build um let's say devices
03:55 - that are very close to Hardware maybe
03:57 - devices that have very limited resour
03:59 - sources like memory and processing power
04:02 - such as different sensors in automobiles
04:06 - um cars um and then different medical
04:09 - devices like pacemakers heart monitors
04:12 - and things like that or some security
04:14 - systems like smart door locks or
04:17 - security cameras and things like that
04:20 - then you wouldn't choose C because there
04:22 - are other languages which are better for
04:25 - thatt so what are some other benefits of
04:27 - c c is modern programming language it is
04:31 - very fast it is very clean and organized
04:35 - which makes it very beginner friendly
04:37 - easy to understand and learn for
04:39 - beginners also demand for C developers
04:43 - is very very high a lot of companies are
04:45 - looking for C developers to build
04:48 - different applications games and other
04:51 - cool software Al so if you decide to
04:53 - learn C you will definitely have a lot
04:56 - of job opportunities with C you can
04:58 - build all kinds of things as I already
05:01 - said from very small simple websites to
05:04 - very big complex applications and the
05:07 - main benefit is that c is crossplatform
05:11 - which means that your applications can
05:13 - work on Windows Mac and Linux operating
05:17 - systems c community is huge and it is
05:20 - usually very helpful which means that if
05:23 - you ever encounter a problem and you
05:25 - need help most likely there is someone
05:28 - out there who has already faced the same
05:30 - problem and he solved it so you can
05:32 - always find help uh and probably you
05:36 - will find that help on stack Overflow
05:38 - which is like developers online Bible
05:42 - you will see when it comes to learning C
05:45 - is beginner friendly which means that
05:47 - you can start learning and Building
05:49 - Things right away so you can immediately
05:52 - apply your knowledge and as an example
05:54 - of that I'm going to link a video here
05:57 - and also in the description and in that
05:59 - video we we are building a real useful
06:02 - application in a simple and easy way
06:04 - with C so if you want to check that out
06:07 - the link will be in the description now
06:09 - in order to write C code and create
06:12 - applications you need a tool for that
06:15 - and my recommendation is to install
06:17 - Visual Studio IDE IDE stands for
06:20 - integrated development environment and
06:22 - it means that it has everything that you
06:25 - need to create applications so we have a
06:28 - place to write code we can start our
06:30 - application we can debug which means we
06:32 - can discover and fix bugs and a lot more
06:37 - and the best part is that Community
06:39 - version is completely free and it is
06:41 - enough to build any kind of application
06:44 - that you want so my recommendation is to
06:46 - install Visual Studio 2022 it's
06:49 - completely free and now I'm going to
06:51 - show you where you can download it and
06:53 - how to install it so go to Google and
06:55 - type Visual Studio 2022 community and
06:59 - click on this official Microsoft link
07:03 - okay go to downloads and here you are
07:06 - going to download Community version
07:08 - because it is
07:10 - free okay
07:12 - save and here is my installer file so
07:15 - I'm going to click on
07:17 - that click on run and here we get Visual
07:21 - Studio installer so click on continue
07:24 - the installation process is very simple
07:27 - it's mostly next next finish so let's
07:30 - wait for this to
07:32 - install okay and here you are going to
07:35 - select net desktop development that is
07:38 - going to be enough for what we need to
07:40 - build C applications but as you can see
07:43 - there are many other things that you can
07:45 - do with Visual Studio but for us this
07:47 - one is going to be enough so click on
07:50 - install and now we are going to wait for
07:53 - a few minutes for this to be installed
07:56 - the installation process is finished and
07:58 - now it recommends that we should restart
08:00 - our computer for some of you it might
08:03 - work without restarting but just to be
08:05 - sure I recommend that you restart your
08:07 - computer and then we will continue so I
08:10 - will restart mine and then I'll be back
08:13 - so start your visual studio and here we
08:16 - are going to create our first project so
08:19 - click on create a new
08:22 - project okay it's loading everything and
08:25 - the type of application that I want to
08:27 - build is C console
08:30 - application if you cannot see it here
08:32 - you can search it so type c console app
08:37 - okay it is this one here and please make
08:40 - sure that it is C and not Visual Basic
08:43 - or some other language and also as I
08:46 - told you it is crossplatform as you can
08:48 - see here so this application is going to
08:50 - work on Linux Mac and windows so let's
08:53 - select that and click on
08:55 - next okay and here we are going to give
08:58 - the name to our application let's call
09:01 - it my first app everything should be
09:07 - together so my first app and click on
09:10 - next okay and here we are choosing
09:14 - framework you can leave this as it is so
09:16 - just click on
09:19 - create okay and now it is creating
09:22 - everything that we need for our
09:23 - application so this is what we will get
09:26 - when the project is created and this
09:29 - that you can see here is already
09:31 - functional small application so now I'm
09:34 - going to run it so that you can see how
09:35 - it looks like and then we are going to
09:37 - explain how this works so in order to
09:40 - start the application you can press on
09:42 - this little play button or you can go to
09:46 - debug and click on start debugging or
09:49 - press F5 on your keyboard whichever you
09:52 - prefer so click on this and now the
09:56 - application is going to start okay as
09:58 - you can see this is the application that
10:02 - we have it says hello world and then
10:05 - this here is some junk text that is
10:07 - generated by visual studio and at the
10:09 - end it says press any key to close this
10:12 - window so if I press any key it is going
10:15 - to close the console now as I said the
10:18 - black window that you just saw is called
10:21 - console and that is exactly what our
10:24 - application does it says in the console
10:27 - I'm going to write the following line
10:30 - and that line is this text here so this
10:34 - command here will write this line of
10:37 - text in our console and this is your
10:40 - first C program now if I want to write
10:44 - something else I will simply change this
10:47 - text here so let's say like this video
10:51 - wink wink okay and I'm going to start my
10:55 - program and as you can see we get this
10:58 - text in our cont console now there are a
11:01 - few more things that I want to explain
11:03 - so let's close this program okay this
11:06 - symbol here semicolon is a symbol that
11:10 - you use to end each command so this is
11:13 - one command and to tell to your computer
11:16 - hey here is the end of the command you
11:18 - put this symbol okay and then this here
11:23 - is a comment and you can write comments
11:26 - in the code for yourself or other
11:28 - developers so that you can better
11:30 - understand and remember what a certain
11:32 - line of code does for example here we
11:35 - can say to learn practical programming
11:40 - visit code Beauty
11:42 - academy.com now please notice the
11:44 - difference between this text here and
11:47 - this text here this here is a comment
11:50 - which means that you can put anything
11:52 - that you want you can write any text
11:54 - that you want and as long as you put it
11:57 - under a comment which you do by writing
12:00 - two slash symbols you will not have any
12:03 - problems but this here is CP code which
12:07 - means that you need to follow C syntax
12:10 - otherwise you are going to have errors
12:13 - for example if I put here two dots
12:16 - instead of one we are going to get an
12:19 - error because this here is not valid C
12:22 - syntax so let's delete that and the
12:24 - error will disappear and then here as I
12:26 - said because this here is a comment you
12:29 - you can write anything that you want but
12:32 - just make sure that you add two SL
12:34 - symbols in front of it another important
12:37 - part is this part here it's called
12:40 - solution Explorer and if you cannot see
12:43 - it go to view and here you should find
12:46 - solution Explorer it is here so click on
12:48 - that and you should be able to see
12:51 - solution Explorer and as you can see
12:53 - here we have
12:55 - program.cs which is the file where we
12:58 - will be writing C code now there are
13:02 - many more important and interesting
13:04 - things that we will learn in the
13:05 - upcoming videos and just one last that I
13:09 - want to show you is in case that you
13:11 - make any mistake or any error you can go
13:14 - to view and then click on error list and
13:17 - here you should see all of the errors
13:20 - that you have in your program right now
13:21 - we have zero errors but if I click here
13:25 - let's say I add another dot as you can
13:27 - see here we get three errors just by
13:31 - adding one simple dot okay so let's
13:34 - delete that and the errors should
13:37 - disappear okay now one more thing that I
13:40 - want to show you before I end this video
13:42 - is for some of you this code might look
13:47 - like this and it is absolutely the same
13:50 - thing this program is going to do
13:53 - absolutely the same thing as the
13:54 - previous one here it just says that we
13:57 - have a class called program which is
14:00 - this file here where we are writing our
14:02 - code and then this here is main function
14:06 - and if you already learned any other
14:08 - programming language you know that any
14:11 - program starts its execution from the
14:13 - main function which means that the first
14:16 - line that will be executed in your
14:18 - program is the first line of your main
14:20 - function and that is this line here so
14:23 - if I run this program we will get
14:26 - absolutely the same result as the
14:29 - previous okay as you can see it says
14:32 - like this video so I believe it is going
14:34 - to be enough for this lesson in the next
14:36 - lesson we will write more code and I
14:39 - will teach you how to create some really
14:41 - cool apps so if you enjoyed this video
14:44 - and if you learned something new please
14:46 - give it a big thumbs up also if you have
14:48 - any questions leave those in the comment
14:50 - section so that I can reply to your
14:52 - comment or I can make a dedicated video
14:55 - about that specific topic that you ask
14:57 - about and if you want to learn practical
15:00 - programming if you want to build real
15:02 - world applications then definitely check
15:04 - out my practical programming course the
15:07 - link will be in the description so if
15:09 - you enjoy my teaching style and if you
15:12 - want me to be your mentor and take you
15:13 - from beginner to expert developer then
15:17 - definitely sign up for the course and
15:19 - you can start your transformation from
15:22 - beginner to expert immediately so thank
15:26 - you very much for watching and I will
15:28 - see you in the next video bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys and welcome to my channel this is going to be introduction to C programming language so in this video you are going to learn what is C what kind of applications we can build with C what is the difference between C and other programming languages and together we are going to build your first C application so I decided to divide this video into two parts the first part will be shorter and we are going to talk about some general stuff that is important related to C and then in the second part of the video we will install the tool that we need to write C applications and then together we are going to create your first C application and if you would like to learn practical programming I have an entire C practical programming course which is beginner friendly it's step by step everything is on one place from beginner to expert in the course we will focus on building real world applications so that you can get all of the programming skills and practical experience that you need to build the applications that you want and also you will get career ready skills so in this course I'm going to share over 10 years of my experience in a beginner friendly way so that you can also start building applications on your own in as little as 3 months you will also get access to an exclusive community of developers so that in this process of learning You Are Not Alone lost or confused because if if you have a question there will always be someone to help you very fast so that you can progress in an optimal way and the first 100 people who sign up using the link in the description will get a special discount so if you want to learn practical programming and start building real applications click the link and you can start your transformation from beginner to expert developer immediately so with that being said let's go to the topic of this video so the first question that I want to answer is what is c c is very powerful and verstile programming language it is developed by Microsoft and it is very very popular you can use it to build many different types of applications you can build modern desktop applications mobile applications games simple websites very big complex applications and so much more uh it is beginner friendly which means that it is suitable to learn as your first programming langu anguage but also if you already know another programming language like maybe C++ Java JavaScript Python and so on that knowledge will definitely help you because C is very similar to many other programming languages now I'm sure that as a beginner you probably heard about many different programming languages so now you are wondering which one is the best and which one you should pick um I want you to understand that programming languages are very similar in what way well when you learn one programming language then you start seeing patterns in other programming languages so it becomes very easy to switch to another programming language much easier than to learn your first programming language the same way that uh when you learn to drive a car and then you buy another car it is not going to be as hard to switch to that other car because you already know how to drive it will just take you a few days to get used to the new car so it's the same with programming languages but with that being said they are also very different because they have different purpose as I said with C you can build most of the modern applications that you and me are using every day so modern desktop applications mobile applications games websites and so on that is the purpose of C but if you want to build um let's say devices that are very close to Hardware maybe devices that have very limited resour sources like memory and processing power such as different sensors in automobiles um cars um and then different medical devices like pacemakers heart monitors and things like that or some security systems like smart door locks or security cameras and things like that then you wouldn't choose C because there are other languages which are better for thatt so what are some other benefits of c c is modern programming language it is very fast it is very clean and organized which makes it very beginner friendly easy to understand and learn for beginners also demand for C developers is very very high a lot of companies are looking for C developers to build different applications games and other cool software Al so if you decide to learn C you will definitely have a lot of job opportunities with C you can build all kinds of things as I already said from very small simple websites to very big complex applications and the main benefit is that c is crossplatform which means that your applications can work on Windows Mac and Linux operating systems c community is huge and it is usually very helpful which means that if you ever encounter a problem and you need help most likely there is someone out there who has already faced the same problem and he solved it so you can always find help uh and probably you will find that help on stack Overflow which is like developers online Bible you will see when it comes to learning C is beginner friendly which means that you can start learning and Building Things right away so you can immediately apply your knowledge and as an example of that I'm going to link a video here and also in the description and in that video we we are building a real useful application in a simple and easy way with C so if you want to check that out the link will be in the description now in order to write C code and create applications you need a tool for that and my recommendation is to install Visual Studio IDE IDE stands for integrated development environment and it means that it has everything that you need to create applications so we have a place to write code we can start our application we can debug which means we can discover and fix bugs and a lot more and the best part is that Community version is completely free and it is enough to build any kind of application that you want so my recommendation is to install Visual Studio 2022 it's completely free and now I'm going to show you where you can download it and how to install it so go to Google and type Visual Studio 2022 community and click on this official Microsoft link okay go to downloads and here you are going to download Community version because it is free okay save and here is my installer file so I'm going to click on that click on run and here we get Visual Studio installer so click on continue the installation process is very simple it's mostly next next finish so let's wait for this to install okay and here you are going to select net desktop development that is going to be enough for what we need to build C applications but as you can see there are many other things that you can do with Visual Studio but for us this one is going to be enough so click on install and now we are going to wait for a few minutes for this to be installed the installation process is finished and now it recommends that we should restart our computer for some of you it might work without restarting but just to be sure I recommend that you restart your computer and then we will continue so I will restart mine and then I'll be back so start your visual studio and here we are going to create our first project so click on create a new project okay it's loading everything and the type of application that I want to build is C console application if you cannot see it here you can search it so type c console app okay it is this one here and please make sure that it is C and not Visual Basic or some other language and also as I told you it is crossplatform as you can see here so this application is going to work on Linux Mac and windows so let's select that and click on next okay and here we are going to give the name to our application let's call it my first app everything should be together so my first app and click on next okay and here we are choosing framework you can leave this as it is so just click on create okay and now it is creating everything that we need for our application so this is what we will get when the project is created and this that you can see here is already functional small application so now I'm going to run it so that you can see how it looks like and then we are going to explain how this works so in order to start the application you can press on this little play button or you can go to debug and click on start debugging or press F5 on your keyboard

text in our console and this is your first C program now if I want to write something else I will simply change this text here so let's say like this video wink wink okay and I'm going to start my program and as you can see we get this text in our cont console now there are a few more things that I want to explain so let's close this program okay this symbol here semicolon is a symbol that you use to end each command so this is one command and to tell to your computer hey here is the end of the command you put this symbol okay and then this here is a comment and you can write comments in the code for yourself or other developers so that you can better understand and remember what a certain line of code does for example here we can say to learn practical programming visit code Beauty academy.com now please notice the difference between this text here and this text here this here is a comment which means that you can put anything that you want you can write any text that you want and as long as you put it under a comment which you do by writing two slash symbols you will not have any problems but this here is CP code which means that you need to follow C syntax otherwise you are going to have errors for example if I put here two dots instead of one we are going to get an error because this here is not valid C syntax so let's delete that and the error will disappear and then here as I said because this here is a comment you you can write anything that you want but just make sure that you add two SL symbols in front of it another important part is this part here it's called solution Explorer and if you cannot see it go to view and here you should find solution Explorer it is here so click on that and you should be able to see solution Explorer and as you can see here we have program.cs which is the file where we will be writing C code now there are many more important and interesting things that we will learn in the upcoming videos and just one last that I want to show you is in case that you make any mistake or any error you can go to view and then click on error list and here you should see all of the errors that you have in your program right now we have zero errors but if I click here let's say I add another dot as you can see here we get three errors just by adding one simple dot okay so let's delete that and the errors should disappear okay now one more thing that I want to show you before I end this video is for some of you this code might look like this and it is absolutely the same thing this program is going to do absolutely the same thing as the previous one here it just says that we have a class called program which is this file here where we are writing our code and then this here is main function and if you already learned any other programming language you know that any program starts its execution from the main function which means that the first line that will be executed in your program is the first line of your main function and that is this line here so if I run this program we will get absolutely the same result as the previous okay as you can see it says like this video so I believe it is going to be enough for this lesson in the next lesson we will write more code and I will teach you how to create some really cool apps so if you enjoyed this video and if you learned something new please give it a big thumbs up also if you have any questions leave those in the comment section so that I can reply to your comment or I can make a dedicated video about that specific topic that you ask about and if you
