00:00 - hi everyone and welcome to my channel in
00:02 - this video i want to share an
00:04 - interesting story time with you because
00:06 - a few days ago i was talking with a
00:08 - colleague at work and we were discussing
00:11 - interview questions that are often asked
00:13 - for a software developer position
00:16 - and i remembered the most tricky
00:19 - interview question that i received and
00:22 - my answer was as wrong as it can be so i
00:26 - decided to tell you this story so that
00:28 - you don't make the same mistake that i
00:30 - did in case that you get this same
00:32 - question but before i start i know that
00:35 - a lot of you guys who are watching this
00:36 - video also watch a lot of my c plus
00:39 - programming tutorials and you already
00:42 - know that i recommend c plus plus
00:44 - builder as a great tool to help you
00:46 - create modern multi-platform
00:48 - applications but for those of you who
00:50 - are here for the first time even if you
00:53 - don't understand a lot about coding you
00:55 - can still use c
00:57 - builder because it basically has a lot
01:00 - of the components that we use very often
01:02 - already available so you can just drag
01:05 - and drop them and you can build modern
01:07 - interfaces and multi-platform
01:09 - applications so make sure to check it
01:12 - out and i will even put a link in the
01:14 - description that you can use in order to
01:15 - get 30 days free of c plus plus builder
01:18 - so that you can try it out and see what
01:20 - you can build with it
01:22 - so to return to my story the question
01:24 - that i was asked is not necessarily a
01:27 - programming problem it's more a logical
01:29 - problem and you can expect this question
01:31 - on any job interview which requires you
01:34 - to have logical thinking and problem
01:37 - solving skills
01:38 - and it is a very tricky question and it
01:41 - tricked me so that i very naively gave
01:44 - the wrong answer so the question was
01:48 - actually um instead of telling you let
01:51 - me prepare something and then i am going
01:52 - to show you
01:54 - so here i have made three cards now
01:58 - two of these three cards are completely
02:02 - empty as you can see and then a one has
02:05 - job written on it which means i guess
02:08 - that if you pick this one you will get a
02:10 - job
02:12 - so
02:14 - let me mix these a little bit
02:17 - okay
02:18 - so what he did is he said
02:21 - please pick one of these three cards
02:26 - and let's say that for example i picked
02:29 - this one so the first one i said this is
02:32 - my card
02:34 - so what he did is he said
02:36 - okay
02:37 - this is your card but before i show you
02:40 - your card
02:41 - let me tell you that this card here is
02:45 - empty
02:46 - and then you threw it
02:48 - away and then he said
02:51 - also before i show you this card here
02:55 - i will give you the opportunity to
02:57 - switch
02:58 - so do you still want your card or do you
03:02 - want to switch to this card here
03:05 - and what i did in this situation is what
03:09 - i believe most people in my position
03:11 - would do and please let me know what you
03:13 - would do in this situation so write me
03:15 - in the comment section which card you
03:17 - would choose and why
03:20 - so
03:21 - what i did is i said
03:23 - i will still keep my card
03:25 - and then he asked why
03:28 - so i said two reasons
03:30 - first of all i believe that you are
03:32 - trying to trick me because you can see
03:35 - the cards and i cannot
03:37 - and then the second reason is that
03:40 - it doesn't really matter i am choosing
03:42 - between two cards so there is
03:45 - 50 50 chance that any one of these two
03:48 - is the winner
03:52 - and
03:53 - long story short my answer was as wrong
03:56 - as it can be
03:58 - and basically what he said is you are
04:01 - wrong and there is always
04:04 - 66 chance that if you switch you will
04:08 - get the right answer
04:11 - and then this card is empty as you can
04:14 - see
04:16 - so i was very confused by this because i
04:18 - did not get any explanation and i still
04:22 - was absolutely convinced that there is
04:25 - 50 50 chance for each card to be the
04:28 - winner so
04:30 - that day when i came home i did what i
04:33 - knew best and that is i decided to
04:36 - create a program that will solve this
04:38 - problem for me so i decided to create a
04:41 - program that is going to give me the
04:43 - answer that i needed and that is exactly
04:46 - what i did i created a program that will
04:49 - run one million simulations of this
04:52 - problem in order to get the right answer
04:55 - and the results of this program
04:57 - absolutely astonished me so that is what
05:00 - i'm going to show you now
05:03 - so here i have a program that does
05:05 - 1 million simulations in order to give
05:08 - me the answer to this problem
05:11 - so if i run this program let's see what
05:13 - is going to happen
05:15 - okay as you can see it says that out of
05:18 - these 1 million simulations
05:21 - you are going to win 33.3573
05:26 - of the time
05:27 - if you stay with your initial card and
05:30 - then if you decide to switch your card
05:33 - you are going to win
05:36 - six 66.6164 percent of the time so
05:40 - this is definitely not 50 50 as i
05:44 - thought
05:45 - and after seeing the result of this
05:47 - program i was even more confused because
05:49 - i could not find the logical explanation
05:51 - of why this is happening
05:54 - so
05:55 - one more thing that you can do is you
05:57 - can even increase the number of these
06:00 - simulations to let's say 10 million for
06:02 - example and what you are going to get in
06:05 - this situation is even more accurate
06:08 - result but it is also going to take
06:10 - longer for your program to execute
06:12 - so it is going to take longer to execute
06:15 - 10 million simulations than 1 million
06:17 - simulations but as you can see after 10
06:20 - million simulations the result is even
06:22 - closer to the 33.33333
06:26 - and then the switch result is closer to
06:29 - the 66.66666
06:33 - so
06:34 - again i was very confused because i did
06:37 - not understand what is happening what is
06:40 - logical explanation of this behavior
06:44 - the problem that i just demonstrated is
06:46 - known as monty hall problem and it is
06:50 - often used as a tricky question in order
06:53 - to test someone's logical thinking
06:55 - so the explanation of this problem is
06:58 - following
06:59 - when you are given the opportunity
07:01 - initially to choose between three cards
07:05 - each one of these three cards has 33
07:08 - percent chance that it is the winner
07:10 - because there are three cards and only
07:12 - one winner
07:14 - so when you pick your card you have
07:18 - 33.333
07:20 - chance of winning and then there is
07:24 - 66.6 percent chance that the winner is
07:27 - on this side because here i have two
07:30 - cards
07:31 - so
07:32 - one thing that you absolutely know is
07:34 - that one of these two cards is empty
07:37 - because there is only one winner so what
07:40 - the interviewer does is he removes that
07:43 - empty card from this side
07:46 - okay
07:48 - and by doing that he makes you think
07:51 - that you are choosing between two cards
07:54 - so it is seemingly 50 50 chance for each
07:58 - card to be the winner but what most
08:02 - people don't understand is that it is
08:04 - actually not 50 50 but it is still 66
08:09 - chance for this card here to be the
08:12 - winner
08:14 - okay
08:15 - and in order to understand this let me
08:18 - ask you this same question but in a
08:22 - little bit different way so i have three
08:25 - cards again and let's say that you get
08:28 - the same question so to pick one of
08:30 - these three
08:32 - so you decide to pick this one
08:35 - now
08:36 - what is going to happen if the
08:38 - interviewer asks you at this point hey
08:41 - do you want to keep your card or do you
08:44 - want me to give you these two cards what
08:47 - are you going to answer to that question
08:49 - because you definitely know if you have
08:52 - only one card you have 33 chance of
08:55 - winning but if you have two cards you
08:59 - have 66 chance of winning
09:02 - so what are you going to choose in that
09:04 - situation
09:06 - and what if i told you that this
09:08 - question is absolutely the same as the
09:12 - question from my previous example
09:14 - why
09:16 - well
09:17 - what you definitely know is that one of
09:19 - these two cards is empty so what the
09:23 - interviewer does is he
09:26 - reveals that empty card and then he
09:29 - removes it
09:30 - and that tricks you to think that you
09:32 - are choosing between two cards so
09:35 - seemingly
09:36 - 50 50 chance for each card to be the
09:39 - winner but
09:40 - actually the only way for you to win if
09:43 - you stay with your card is if you chose
09:47 - the winner when you were initially
09:50 - choosing between
09:51 - three cards
09:54 - and if you still don't understand this
09:56 - let me exaggerate it to the point where
09:58 - it is going to be absolutely clear so
10:02 - let's say that you get the opportunity
10:04 - to choose between 100 cards where only
10:07 - one of those 100 is a winner and 99 are
10:11 - empty so
10:13 - what you do is you pick your card and
10:16 - then there are
10:18 - 99 cards in this hand so
10:22 - what the interviewer then does is he
10:24 - removes 98 empty cards from this hand
10:28 - here
10:29 - okay
10:30 - and then he gives you the opportunity to
10:33 - switch so then he asks you hey
10:36 - are you going to keep your card or are
10:39 - you going to switch to this card here so
10:42 - what are the chances that you initially
10:45 - picked a winner when you were choosing
10:48 - among 100 cards and is it really 50
10:53 - chance here and then 50
10:55 - chance here
10:58 - so i hope that now you understand the
11:00 - explanation of this very tricky question
11:02 - that is often asked in order to test
11:04 - your problem solving skills and your
11:07 - logic so
11:08 - don't make the same mistake that i did
11:11 - and if you are given a choice between
11:14 - staying with your card and then
11:16 - switching to this card after one is
11:19 - removed always switch because
11:22 - statistically there is higher chance for
11:25 - you to win if you switch so for all
11:28 - those of you who are watching this video
11:30 - just out of curiosity and are not
11:32 - interested in programming at all
11:35 - thank you very much for watching please
11:37 - give this video a thumbs up and now you
11:39 - can leave bye bye
11:42 - now while we are waiting for all the
11:44 - non-programmers to leave i'm going to
11:46 - ask the ones who are still watching to
11:48 - give this video a thumbs up as well
11:50 - because i am going to give you the code
11:52 - for this simulation and then i also have
11:55 - an interesting game task for you
11:58 - i will pin my code in the comments so
12:00 - that you can use it to help you solve
12:02 - the task and the task is following so
12:06 - you will give your player the
12:08 - opportunity to pick one of the three
12:11 - cards and after he picks his card you
12:15 - are going to reveal the empty card from
12:18 - this side and then remove it and then
12:21 - you are going to give him the
12:22 - opportunity to switch so you're going to
12:25 - ask him if he wants to keep his card or
12:28 - if he wants to switch and after he makes
12:32 - a decision you are going to show him the
12:35 - result
12:36 - so what i want you to make as well is a
12:40 - counter which will tell you how many
12:41 - times the user has played and also how
12:44 - many times he has won and how many times
12:47 - he has lost
12:49 - so that is a task for this video and you
12:52 - can leave your solution in the comment
12:53 - section and also if you have any
12:55 - questions or any suggestions for my
12:57 - future videos and then as i promised in
13:00 - my last video which i will link here the
13:03 - person with the best solution from that
13:05 - video will get a shout out so
13:08 - i will put here a screenshot of the
13:11 - person that had the best and the most
13:13 - creative solution and i will also link
13:16 - that video in the description in case
13:18 - that you want to check it out so
13:20 - thank you very much for watching please
13:22 - give this video a thumbs up for the
13:24 - youtube algorithm and then also share it
13:26 - with your friends because this is a very
13:29 - tricky question that not many people
13:31 - understand so
13:33 - thank you very much for watching and i
13:35 - am going to see you in some other video
13:37 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone and welcome to my channel in this video i want to share an interesting story time with you because a few days ago i was talking with a colleague at work and we were discussing interview questions that are often asked for a software developer position and i remembered the most tricky interview question that i received and my answer was as wrong as it can be so i decided to tell you this story so that you don't make the same mistake that i did in case that you get this same question but before i start i know that a lot of you guys who are watching this video also watch a lot of my c plus programming tutorials and you already know that i recommend c plus plus builder as a great tool to help you create modern multiplatform applications but for those of you who are here for the first time even if you don't understand a lot about coding you can still use c builder because it basically has a lot of the components that we use very often already available so you can just drag and drop them and you can build modern interfaces and multiplatform applications so make sure to check it out and i will even put a link in the description that you can use in order to get 30 days free of c plus plus builder so that you can try it out and see what you can build with it so to return to my story the question that i was asked is not necessarily a programming problem it's more a logical problem and you can expect this question on any job interview which requires you to have logical thinking and problem solving skills and it is a very tricky question and it tricked me so that i very naively gave the wrong answer so the question was actually um instead of telling you let me prepare something and then i am going to show you so here i have made three cards now two of these three cards are completely empty as you can see and then a one has job written on it which means i guess that if you pick this one you will get a job so let me mix these a little bit okay so what he did is he said please pick one of these three cards and let's say that for example i picked this one so the first one i said this is my card so what he did is he said okay this is your card but before i show you your card let me tell you that this card here is empty and then you threw it away and then he said also before i show you this card here i will give you the opportunity to switch so do you still want your card or do you want to switch to this card here and what i did in this situation is what i believe most people in my position would do and please let me know what you would do in this situation so write me in the comment section which card you would choose and why so what i did is i said i will still keep my card and then he asked why so i said two reasons first of all i believe that you are trying to trick me because you can see the cards and i cannot and then the second reason is that it doesn't really matter i am choosing between two cards so there is 50 50 chance that any one of these two is the winner and long story short my answer was as wrong as it can be and basically what he said is you are wrong and there is always 66 chance that if you switch you will get the right answer and then this card is empty as you can see so i was very confused by this because i did not get any explanation and i still was absolutely convinced that there is 50 50 chance for each card to be the winner so that day when i came home i did what i knew best and that is i decided to create a program that will solve this problem for me so i decided to create a program that is going to give me the answer that i needed and that is exactly what i did i created a program that will run one million simulations of this problem in order to get the right answer and the results of this program absolutely astonished me so that is what i'm going to show you now so here i have a program that does 1 million simulations in order to give me the answer to this problem so if i run this program let's see what is going to happen okay as you can see it says that out of these 1 million simulations you are going to win 33.3573 of the time if you stay with your initial card and then if you decide to switch your card you are going to win six 66.6164 percent of the time so this is definitely not 50 50 as i thought and after seeing the result of this program i was even more confused because i could not find the logical explanation of why this is happening so one more thing that you can do is you can even increase the number of these simulations to let's say 10 million for example and what you are going to get in this situation is even more accurate result but it is also going to take longer for your program to execute so it is going to take longer to execute 10 million simulations than 1 million simulations but as you can see after 10 million simulations the result is even closer to the 33.33333 and then the switch result is closer to the 66.66666 so again i was very confused because i did not understand what is happening what is logical explanation of this behavior the problem that i just demonstrated is known as monty hall problem and it is often used as a tricky question in order to test someone's logical thinking so the explanation of this problem is following when you are given the opportunity initially to choose between three cards each one of these three cards has 33 percent chance that it is the winner because there are three cards and only one winner so when you pick your card you have 33.333 chance of winning and then there is 66.6 percent chance that the winner is on this side because here i have two cards so one thing that you absolutely know is that one of these two cards is empty because there is only one winner so what the interviewer does is he removes that empty card from this side okay and by doing that he makes you think that you are choosing between two cards so it is seemingly 50 50 chance for each card to be the winner but what most people don't understand is that it is actually not 50 50 but it is still 66 chance for this card here to be the winner okay and in order to understand this let me ask you this same question but in a little bit different way so i have three cards again and let's say that you get the same question so to pick one of these three so you decide to pick this one now what is going to happen if the interviewer asks you at this point hey do you want to keep your card or do you want me to give you these two cards what are you going to answer to that question because you definitely know if you have only one card you have 33 chance of winning but if you have two cards you have 66 chance of winning so what are you going to choose in that situation and what if i told you that this question is absolutely the same as the question from my previous example why well what you definitely know is that one of these two cards is empty so what the interviewer does is he reveals that empty card and then he removes it and that tricks you to think that you are choosing between two cards so seemingly 50 50 chance for each card to be the winner but actually the only way for you to win if you stay with your card is if you chose the winner when you were initially choosing between three cards and if you still don't understand this let me exaggerate it to the point where it is going to be absolutely clear so let's say that you get the opportunity to choose between 100 cards where only one of those 100 is a winner and 99 are empty so what you do is you pick your card and then there are 99 cards in this hand so what the interviewer then does is he removes 98 empty cards from this hand here okay and then he gives you the opportunity to switch so then he asks you hey are you going to keep your card or are you going to switch to this card here so what are the chances that you initially picked a winner when you were choosing among 100 cards and is it really 50 chance here and then 50 chance here so i hope that now you understand the explanation of this very tricky question that is often asked in order to test your problem solving skills and your logic so don't make the same mistake that i did and if you are given a choice between staying with your card and then switching to this card after one is removed always switch because statistically there is higher chance for you to win if you switch so for all those of you who are watching this video just out of curiosity and are not interested in programming at all thank you very much for watching please give this video a thumbs up and now you can leave bye bye now while we are waiting for all the nonprogrammers to leave i'm going to ask the ones who are still watching to give this video a thumbs up as well because i am going to give you the code for this simulation and then i also have an interesting game task for you i will pin my code in the comments so that you can use it to help you solve the task and the task is following so you will give your player the opportunity to pick one of the three cards and after he picks his card you are going to reveal the empty card from this side and then remove it and then you are going to give him the opportunity to switch so you're going to ask him if he wants to keep his card or if he wants to switch and after he makes a decision you are going to show him the result so what i want you to make as well is a counter which will tell you how many times the user has played and also how many times he has won and how many times he has lost so that is a task for this video and you can leave your solution in the comment section and also if you have any questions or any suggestions for my future videos and then as i promised in my last video which i will link here the person with the best solution from that video will get a shout out so i will put here a screenshot of the person that had the best and the most creative solution and i will also link that video in the description in case that you want to check it out so thank you very much for watching please give this video a thumbs up for the youtube algorithm and then also share it with your friends because this is a very tricky question that not many people understand so thank you very much for watching and i am going to see you in some other video bye
