00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel my
00:02 - name is saldina
00:03 - and i make it and programming related
00:06 - videos on this channel
00:08 - so if that is something that is of
00:09 - interest to you consider subscribing
00:11 - and give this video a thumbs up as well
00:14 - and in this particular video
00:16 - i want to talk about constructors and
00:18 - class methods
00:19 - so here i have some code that we have
00:21 - written in
00:22 - a previous tutorial of this course so if
00:25 - you haven't watched that
00:26 - make sure to check it out i am going to
00:28 - link it here and
00:30 - in the description as well and let's
00:32 - explain very quickly this code that we
00:34 - have here
00:35 - so i have created a class called youtube
00:38 - channel
00:39 - and that class has four public
00:41 - properties so for
00:42 - attributes those are name
00:46 - owner name subscribers count and then a
00:49 - list of published video
00:50 - titles and then here i have created
00:54 - an object of that class i have assigned
00:57 - the value today to these properties here
01:00 - okay and then here i have written out
01:03 - information
01:04 - about this object that we created and as
01:07 - i said in this video i want to talk
01:09 - about constructors and class
01:11 - methods and how am i going to explain
01:13 - these well
01:14 - let me first introduce a problem to this
01:17 - approach here so that you can really
01:19 - understand the need for these two
01:22 - so what happens if i want to create
01:25 - another
01:26 - object of this youtube channel class how
01:28 - am i going to do that
01:30 - well in this current situation what i
01:32 - would do
01:33 - is i would copy this so i'm going to
01:36 - copy it
01:38 - and then i'm going to paste it here
01:41 - like this and let's give it a name let's
01:44 - say that this channel is going to be
01:45 - youtube channel 2
01:47 - and let's call it let's say youtube
01:49 - channel 2 dot
01:51 - name let's say that it is going to be
01:53 - called amy sings
01:57 - for example and owner is going to be
02:00 - a girl called amy and then she is going
02:03 - to have let's say
02:04 - 2 000 subscribers okay and then
02:08 - the videos that she has published are
02:10 - going to be
02:11 - songs obviously because she has a
02:14 - channel named amy sings
02:16 - so let's say that she has published for
02:18 - example
02:19 - um let's see johnny
02:23 - b cover like this so that's
02:27 - one song that's one video and then let's
02:30 - say
02:30 - that another video that she has
02:32 - published is going to be for example
02:36 - lorelei so that's a song from scorpions
02:40 - and she has made a cover of that song
02:43 - like this now these two are two of my
02:46 - favorite songs
02:47 - and you can put whatever you want here
02:49 - in this list
02:50 - and i'm also wondering and you can write
02:53 - that in the comments down below what are
02:54 - your favorite songs
02:56 - so please write that in the comments
02:58 - just don't put links because i think
02:59 - that youtube has this policy of treating
03:02 - um links as advertising or spam or
03:05 - something so just write out
03:07 - the name of your song and then uh the
03:10 - name of a singer i guess
03:11 - and i'm really looking forward to
03:13 - reading your comments so
03:15 - now that i have created this second
03:17 - youtube channel
03:19 - what i want to do is i want to write out
03:21 - information about this channel
03:23 - but i noticed that i'm missing here uh
03:25 - this youtube channel too
03:27 - so here i'm going to say youtube channel
03:28 - 2 dot owner name and then youtube
03:30 - channel two dot
03:31 - subscribers count and then youtube
03:34 - channel two
03:35 - dot published video titles as well okay
03:38 - now if i wanted to write out information
03:40 - about this second channel what i would
03:42 - do is i would copy this
03:45 - so i'm going to copy it and then paste
03:47 - it
03:48 - here and here i will say that the name
03:51 - is youtube channel 2 dot
03:52 - name and that owner name is youtube
03:55 - channel 2 dot owner name and then here
03:57 - as well and then youtube channel two dot
04:00 - published video titles okay now if i run
04:04 - this program
04:06 - we should get information about these
04:08 - two channels so
04:10 - the first channel is this one that we
04:12 - already had it's
04:14 - code beauty owner is me and then this is
04:17 - subscribers counter
04:18 - and then these are three videos that i
04:20 - published so far i mean i published more
04:22 - than three videos
04:24 - uh but this is just an example and then
04:27 - here is our
04:28 - second channel it's called amy sings and
04:31 - then
04:31 - owner is amy she has 2 000 subscribers
04:34 - and then she has published
04:36 - two covers now this here has
04:40 - a problem if we wanted to create a third
04:42 - a fourth
04:43 - fifth object we would have to copy
04:47 - this code and then each time that we
04:48 - want to write out information about
04:50 - those channels we would have to copy
04:52 - this code
04:53 - and this really collides with a
04:55 - principle
04:56 - called don't repeat yourself meaning do
04:59 - not repeat your code if you don't really
05:01 - have to repeat it
05:02 - and in this particular situation we do
05:04 - not have to repeat it
05:05 - so how we are going to solve this
05:07 - problem well the first thing that i want
05:09 - to talk about are going to be
05:10 - constructors
05:12 - and what a constructor is it is a
05:14 - special method that is going to be
05:15 - invoked
05:16 - each time that you create an object of a
05:19 - specific
05:19 - class meaning that method is going to be
05:22 - called on the construction
05:24 - of that object so there are two rules
05:28 - when it comes to constructors and the
05:30 - first rule is that constructor has the
05:33 - same name
05:34 - as your class and then the second rule
05:38 - is that constructor does not have a
05:40 - return
05:41 - type so let's create a constructor for
05:43 - this youtube channel class
05:46 - here i'm going to say youtube channel
05:49 - like this and then i'm going to put
05:51 - these parentheses and i'm going to put
05:53 - these
05:54 - curly brackets as well now what i want
05:57 - to do in this constructor
05:58 - is i want to receive two parameters i
06:02 - want to receive two arguments and those
06:04 - are going to be string
06:05 - name and then string um
06:09 - let's let's say owner name
06:12 - okay now these are
06:16 - two parameters that i want to pass to my
06:18 - constructor and what i'm going to do
06:20 - with these in my constructor is i'm
06:22 - going to assign these
06:23 - to these properties here so i'm going to
06:25 - say that
06:26 - name is going to be equal to whatever my
06:29 - user has passed to this constructor so
06:31 - name is equal to
06:33 - this name here and then
06:36 - owner name in my class
06:39 - is going to be equal to this owner name
06:42 - that i have received in my
06:44 - constructor now since since this
06:46 - constructor here is invoked
06:48 - each time that i create object each time
06:50 - that it is constructed
06:52 - that means that at the beginning when a
06:55 - channel is created
06:56 - it has zero subscribers so i'm going to
06:59 - put here
07:00 - zero like this we do not even have to
07:02 - pass this value
07:03 - in our constructor because when you
07:05 - create your youtube channel you do not
07:06 - have
07:07 - subscribers okay now what am i going to
07:10 - do
07:11 - here is i do not need to write this code
07:13 - like this anymore so i'm going to
07:16 - delete i'm going to actually comment
07:17 - this code here
07:19 - and as you can see this is underlined it
07:22 - says that no default constructor exists
07:24 - for class
07:25 - youtube channel now what we have to do
07:28 - is we have to use
07:29 - this constructor here that i have just
07:31 - created
07:32 - and how you do that well you put
07:35 - parentheses here and then inside these
07:38 - parentheses we are going to pass
07:40 - these two parameters so the first
07:43 - parameter is going to be the name
07:45 - so that is the name of our channel and
07:48 - that is
07:48 - this name here so code beauty like this
07:52 - and then a second parameter as you can
07:54 - see here
07:55 - is owner name and that was this value
07:59 - here so i'm going to pass that here like
08:02 - this
08:03 - and now after i have created this
08:06 - youtube channel we do not need
08:08 - this code um anymore so i'm going to
08:10 - delete it
08:12 - okay and what we can do is we can do the
08:16 - same with this
08:17 - second channel so with this youtube
08:19 - channel too so i'm going to really
08:20 - comment this code
08:22 - for a moment and then here i want to
08:24 - invoke a constructor
08:26 - for this youtube channel class and pass
08:28 - it
08:29 - as first value the name because we are
08:32 - receiving name as
08:33 - our first value in our constructor like
08:36 - this
08:37 - and then the second value that we need
08:38 - to pass is going to be
08:40 - owner name so i'm going to copy that as
08:43 - well
08:44 - and now we have successfully created
08:46 - this
08:47 - second youtube channel okay so
08:50 - now i can delete this code here as well
08:54 - okay and now if i run my program
08:58 - as you can see it has written out
09:00 - information about my two channels
09:02 - the first one is code beauty owner is me
09:05 - and then
09:05 - i have zero subscribers because i have
09:08 - just created my channel and we have
09:09 - assigned that
09:10 - here and then our second channel is
09:13 - amy sings owner is amy and she has zero
09:17 - subscribers as well
09:18 - and as you can see both of these videos
09:20 - published videos
09:21 - lists are empty because we haven't uh
09:24 - really
09:25 - added any videos okay so how do you do
09:28 - that i'm going to
09:30 - delete this from here and then move it
09:32 - here
09:33 - like this so now we have both of our
09:35 - objects being created
09:37 - at the beginning here so what i want to
09:39 - do now
09:40 - is i want to add a couple of videos to
09:42 - this channel here so how do you do that
09:45 - well you say youtube channel
09:48 - like this and then i'm going to put dot
09:51 - and here in this published video titles
09:54 - list i'm going to invoke a method push
09:57 - back which is going to add at the end of
10:00 - this
10:00 - list another element and that element is
10:04 - going to be of type string because
10:06 - this published video titles is a list of
10:09 - strings so here i'm going to add
10:11 - a string and i'm going to call that
10:15 - video c plus plus for
10:18 - beginners like this so
10:21 - that is one video and then let's add a
10:24 - couple more videos let's say
10:26 - uh html and css for beginners
10:31 - and then let's say um oop for beginners
10:35 - well no let's say c plus plus oop
10:39 - like this okay so we have added
10:42 - three videos for this first channel and
10:45 - then the second channel does not have
10:46 - videos
10:47 - yet so if i run my program again
10:50 - you can see that this first channel has
10:54 - three videos and then this check the
10:56 - second channel does not have
10:58 - any videos yet because we have deleted
11:01 - those that we previously had
11:02 - okay now that was the example on how you
11:06 - can create a constructor and how you can
11:08 - use a constructor so
11:09 - this here is the constructor of this
11:12 - youtube channel
11:13 - class and we have passed two parameters
11:16 - two arguments to this constructor and
11:18 - then here in our constructor
11:20 - we have really assigned initial values
11:24 - to these properties here that we have in
11:26 - our youtube channel
11:28 - and then this here is the way that you
11:31 - use your constructor so
11:33 - you put these parentheses and then you
11:35 - pass the values that your constructor
11:37 - has to receive
11:38 - and here we have created two objects and
11:42 - we have done that without repeating code
11:45 - now what is going to happen with this
11:47 - here so
11:49 - this here and then this here is
11:51 - repeating code as well
11:52 - and in order to solve this particular
11:55 - problem
11:56 - we are going to use class methods
11:59 - so class method is going to describe a
12:01 - behavior
12:02 - of a class and since here we are writing
12:05 - out
12:06 - these attributes of our class since we
12:09 - are writing out information about
12:11 - our youtube channels what i want to do
12:14 - is i want to create a method that is
12:16 - going to be called
12:17 - get info for example so that method is
12:20 - going to be of type void
12:22 - let's call it get info like this
12:27 - and what i want to do in this particular
12:29 - method is i want to copy this code here
12:31 - so i'm going to
12:33 - cut it and then paste it here
12:36 - and in this particular method in this
12:38 - get info i want to say
12:40 - please write out name and then the name
12:44 - property we don't need this youtube
12:46 - channel object anymore because we are in
12:48 - the class
12:49 - itself okay and then here as well i'm
12:53 - going to delete this
12:54 - here and then here and
12:57 - now this code should work so whenever
13:00 - you invoke this
13:01 - get info method on your object it should
13:04 - write out
13:05 - all of these properties of that object
13:08 - so
13:08 - now i can remove this code here as well
13:11 - so this um information about our second
13:15 - channel
13:16 - and how am i going to get how am i going
13:19 - to invoke this method
13:20 - well i say the name of my object so for
13:23 - example youtube
13:25 - channel dot and then as you can see
13:28 - i have this get info method available
13:30 - here because it is
13:32 - public so i say get info and i invoke it
13:35 - like i would invoke any other function
13:38 - and let's do the same for our second
13:40 - youtube channel let's say
13:41 - youtube channel to
13:44 - get info like this and now if i run my
13:49 - program
13:50 - as you can see it has written out
13:52 - information about my two channels
13:55 - so code beauty saldena's owner and then
13:58 - subscribers count my videos and then
14:00 - info about my second channel
14:02 - as well so i hope that you understood
14:05 - the concept behind
14:07 - a constructor of a class and then behind
14:10 - a class
14:11 - method here we have demonstrated how you
14:13 - can create an
14:14 - object using a constructor and then here
14:17 - as well
14:18 - so you don't really have to repeat your
14:20 - code each time that you create
14:22 - an object and then here we have invoked
14:26 - a method
14:26 - of these objects which we have
14:29 - implemented
14:30 - here so you do not have to repeat that
14:32 - code as well
14:33 - each time that you need to get
14:34 - information about your object
14:36 - you just invoke this get info method
14:40 - and now our main function looks much
14:42 - cleaner and all the implementations
14:45 - of the construction of our objects and
14:47 - then this
14:48 - get info method are in this youtube
14:51 - channel class
14:52 - so i hope that you enjoyed this video if
14:54 - you did give it a thumbs up and also
14:56 - subscribe to my channel don't forget to
14:58 - hit that bell icon and i'm going to see
15:02 - you
15:02 - in my next video bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to my channel my name is saldina and i make it and programming related videos on this channel so if that is something that is of interest to you consider subscribing and give this video a thumbs up as well and in this particular video i want to talk about constructors and class methods so here i have some code that we have written in a previous tutorial of this course so if you haven't watched that make sure to check it out i am going to link it here and in the description as well and let's explain very quickly this code that we have here so i have created a class called youtube channel and that class has four public properties so for attributes those are name owner name subscribers count and then a list of published video titles and then here i have created an object of that class i have assigned the value today to these properties here okay and then here i have written out information about this object that we created and as i said in this video i want to talk about constructors and class methods and how am i going to explain these well let me first introduce a problem to this approach here so that you can really understand the need for these two so what happens if i want to create another object of this youtube channel class how am i going to do that well in this current situation what i would do is i would copy this so i'm going to copy it and then i'm going to paste it here like this and let's give it a name let's say that this channel is going to be youtube channel 2 and let's call it let's say youtube channel 2 dot name let's say that it is going to be called amy sings for example and owner is going to be a girl called amy and then she is going to have let's say 2 000 subscribers okay and then the videos that she has published are going to be songs obviously because she has a channel named amy sings so let's say that she has published for example um let's see johnny b cover like this so that's one song that's one video and then let's say that another video that she has published is going to be for example lorelei so that's a song from scorpions and she has made a cover of that song like this now these two are two of my favorite songs and you can put whatever you want here in this list and i'm also wondering and you can write that in the comments down below what are your favorite songs so please write that in the comments just don't put links because i think that youtube has this policy of treating um links as advertising or spam or something so just write out the name of your song and then uh the name of a singer i guess and i'm really looking forward to reading your comments so now that i have created this second youtube channel what i want to do is i want to write out information about this channel but i noticed that i'm missing here uh this youtube channel too so here i'm going to say youtube channel 2 dot owner name and then youtube channel two dot subscribers count and then youtube channel two dot published video titles as well okay now if i wanted to write out information about this second channel what i would do is i would copy this so i'm going to copy it and then paste it here and here i will say that the name is youtube channel 2 dot name and that owner name is youtube channel 2 dot owner name and then here as well and then youtube channel two dot published video titles okay now if i run this program we should get information about these two channels so the first channel is this one that we already had it's code beauty owner is me and then this is subscribers counter and then these are three videos that i published so far i mean i published more than three videos uh but this is just an example and then here is our second channel it's called amy sings and then owner is amy she has 2 000 subscribers and then she has published two covers now this here has a problem if we wanted to create a third a fourth fifth object we would have to copy this code and then each time that we want to write out information about those channels we would have to copy this code and this really collides with a principle called don't repeat yourself meaning do not repeat your code if you don't really have to repeat it and in this particular situation we do not have to repeat it so how we are going to solve this problem well the first thing that i want to talk about are going to be constructors and what a constructor is it is a special method that is going to be invoked each time that you create an object of a specific class meaning that method is going to be called on the construction of that object so there are two rules when it comes to constructors and the first rule is that constructor has the same name as your class and then the second rule is that constructor does not have a return type so let's create a constructor for this youtube channel class here i'm going to say youtube channel like this and then i'm going to put these parentheses and i'm going to put these curly brackets as well now what i want to do in this constructor is i want to receive two parameters i want to receive two arguments and those are going to be string name and then string um let's let's say owner name okay now these are two parameters that i want to pass to my constructor and what i'm going to do with these in my constructor is i'm going to assign these to these properties here so i'm going to say that name is going to be equal to whatever my user has passed to this constructor so name is equal to this name here and then owner name in my class is going to be equal to this owner name that i have received in my constructor now since since this constructor here is invoked each time that i create object each time that it is constructed that means that at the beginning when a channel is created it has zero subscribers so i'm going to put here zero like this we do not even have to pass this value in our constructor because when you create your youtube channel you do not have subscribers okay now what am i going to do here is i do not need to write this code like this anymore so i'm going to delete i'm going to actually comment this code here and as you can see this is underlined it says that no default constructor exists for class youtube channel now what we have to do is we have to use this constructor here that i have just created and how you do that well you put parentheses here and then inside these parentheses we are going to pass these two parameters so the first parameter is going to be the name so that is the name of our channel and that is this name here so code beauty like this and then a second parameter as you can see here is owner name and that was this value here so i'm going to pass that here like this and now after i have created this youtube channel we do not need this code um anymore so i'm going to delete it okay and what we can do is we can do the same with this second channel so with this youtube channel too so i'm going to really comment this code for a moment and then here i want to invoke a constructor for this youtube channel class and pass it as first value the name because we are receiving name as our first value in our constructor like this and then the second value that we need to pass is going to be owner name so i'm going to copy that as well and now we have successfully created this second youtube channel okay so now i can delete this code here as well okay and now if i run my program as you can see it has written out information about my two channels the first one is code beauty owner is me and then i have zero subscribers because i have just created my channel and we have assigned that here and then our second channel is amy sings owner is amy and she has zero subscribers as well and as you can see both of these videos published videos lists are empty because we haven't uh really added any videos okay so how do you do that i'm going to delete this from here and then move it here like this so now we have both of our objects being created at the beginning here so what i want to do now is i want to add a couple of videos to this channel here so how do you do that well you say youtube channel like this and then i'm going to put dot and here in this published video titles list i'm going to invoke a method push back which is going to add at the end of this list another element and that element is going to be of type string because this published video titles is a list of strings so here i'm going to add a string and i'm going to call that video c plus plus for beginners like this so that is one video and then let's add a couple more videos let's say uh html and css for beginners and then let's say um oop for beginners well no let's say c plus plus oop like this okay so we have added three videos for this first channel and then the second channel does not have videos yet so if i run my program again you can see that this first channel has three videos and then this check the second channel does not have any videos yet because we have deleted those that we previously had okay now that was the example on how you can create a constructor and how you can use a constructor so this here is the constructor of this youtube channel class and we have passed two parameters two arguments to this constructor and then here in our constructor we have really assigned initial values to these properties here that we have in our youtube channel and then this here is the way that you use your constructor so you put these parentheses and then you pass the values that your constructor has to receive and here we have created two objects and we have done that without repeating code now what is going to happen with this here so this here and then this here is repeating code as well and in order to solve this particular problem we are going to use class methods so class method is going to describe a behavior of a class and since here we are writing out these attributes of our class since we are writing out information about our youtube channels what i want to do is i want to create a method that is going to be called get info for example so that method is going to be of type void let's call it get info like this and what i want to do in this particular method is i want to copy this code here so i'm going to cut it and then paste it here and in this particular method in this get info i want to say please write out name and then the name property we don't need this youtube channel object anymore because we are in the class itself okay and then here as well i'm going to delete this here and then here and now this code should work so whenever you invoke this get info method on your object it should write out all of these properties of that object so now i can remove this code here as well so this um information about our second channel and how am i going to get how am i going to invoke this method well i say the name of my object so for example youtube channel dot and then as you can see i have this get info method available here because it is public so i say get info and i invoke it like i would invoke any other function and let's do the same for our second youtube channel let's say youtube channel to get info like this and now if i run my program as you can see it has written out information about my two channels so code beauty saldena's owner and then subscribers count my videos and then info about my second channel as well so i hope that you understood the concept behind a constructor of a class and then behind a class method here we have demonstrated how you can create an object using a constructor and then here as well so you don't really have to repeat your code each time that you create an object and then here we have invoked a method of these objects which we have implemented here so you do not have to repeat that code as well each time that you need to get information about your object you just invoke this get info method and now our main function looks much cleaner and all the implementations of the construction of our objects and then this get info method are in this youtube channel class so i hope that you enjoyed this video if you did give it a thumbs up and also subscribe to my channel don't forget to hit that bell icon and i'm going to see you in my next video bye
