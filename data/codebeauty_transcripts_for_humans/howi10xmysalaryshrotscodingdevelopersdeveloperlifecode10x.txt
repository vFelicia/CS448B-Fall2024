00:00 - how I connect my salary as a developer
00:02 - so in just two years I went from 2000 to
00:05 - 20 000 per month and here's how the main
00:08 - mistake most programmers make nowadays
00:10 - is as soon as they get a job they want
00:12 - they start ignoring other job offers on
00:16 - LinkedIn
00:17 - you already have a job you are in the
00:19 - perfect position to make what I like to
00:22 - call disrespectful offers a
00:24 - disrespectful offer is the next time you
00:27 - receive a message from a software
00:28 - company asking if you want to work for
00:30 - them say yes but ask for double the
00:33 - money so if you currently work for 5 000
00:35 - ask for 10 and if you work for 10 ask
00:38 - for twenty thousand and it doesn't
00:39 - matter if you think that it's too much
00:41 - because you would be surprised at how
00:44 - many companies are willing to pay a lot
00:45 - more money than you think and the only
00:48 - thing that you have to do is ask of
00:50 - course a lot of companies will reject it
00:52 - but you know what is your biggest
00:53 - Advantage you are not desperate to
00:56 - accept any job because you already have
00:59 - one so you need only one company that is
01:02 - going to pay as much as you ask and that
01:04 - is definitely going to happen in two
01:06 - three four months and that is how you
01:09 - are going to double your salary
