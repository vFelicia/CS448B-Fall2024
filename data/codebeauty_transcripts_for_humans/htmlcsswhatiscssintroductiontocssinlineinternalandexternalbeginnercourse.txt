00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:01 - welcome to another video of HTML and CSS
00:04 - for beginners in this video I want to
00:07 - talk about CSS in my previous video I
00:09 - have explained basics of HTML and in
00:12 - this one I want to cover the basics of
00:14 - CSS so we are going to talk about
00:16 - different types of CSS and we are going
00:18 - to talk about CSS in general so before
00:21 - we start make sure to subscribe to my
00:23 - channel and also click the bell icon so
00:25 - that you are notified when I publish my
00:27 - next video and also follow me on my
00:29 - other social media platforms the link
00:31 - for that is going to be in the
00:32 - description of the video so without
00:34 - further ado let's start with today's
00:37 - lesson the first thing that I want to
00:40 - explain is going to be what is CSS CSS
00:44 - stands for cascading style sheets and
00:47 - that really means that CSS is used in
00:50 - order to style your HTML document so in
00:53 - order to style your web page and for
00:56 - that we are going to use it and I really
00:58 - wanted to make this course both HTML and
01:00 - CSS because these two are used really
01:03 - together so not separately but you use
01:06 - HTML in order to define the structure of
01:08 - your web page so all the elements that
01:10 - are going to appear in your web page and
01:12 - then CSS is really going to be styling
01:15 - those elements so here I have this basic
01:19 - HTML structure I hope that you are
01:21 - familiar with this if you are not you
01:24 - can watch my previous video there I have
01:26 - explained this basic HTML structure so
01:29 - I'm going to start from there and we are
01:31 - going to add a couple of elements the
01:34 - first one that I want to add is going to
01:36 - be title so let's say title ok and here
01:43 - I'm going to use let's say my first page
01:49 - like this so I'm going to say that this
01:52 - is my first web page and I have saved it
01:55 - and now if I click reload here as you
01:58 - can see my first page has appeared as
02:00 - this top title so that has done this
02:04 - title tag now I want to add headings so
02:08 - for that we are using this
02:09 - h1 tag and I'm going to say this is
02:14 - heading like this and also I have saved
02:19 - that so control us in order to save all
02:22 - the changes when you get this black dot
02:25 - symbol so control s and the changes are
02:27 - saved and then you can refresh it in
02:30 - your browser and your tag is going to
02:33 - appear so this is heading has appeared
02:35 - in my web browser okay
02:38 - so let's add one more element and that
02:41 - is going to be a paragraph and inside it
02:44 - I want to add let's say I want to write
02:47 - this is paragraph okay and then let's
02:53 - add a couple more sentences so I'm going
02:55 - to say this is second line and add a
02:59 - break line as well and then let's add a
03:03 - third line so that it really looks like
03:05 - a real paragraph so this is second one
03:07 - and then this is third third line okay
03:12 - and I'm going to add the end of sentence
03:15 - so now if i refresh it you can see that
03:18 - our paragraph has appeared here as well
03:20 - so now what I want to do is I want to
03:23 - style these elements here and the first
03:26 - type of CSS that I'm going to show you
03:28 - is going to be inline CSS because there
03:31 - are multiple ways that you can write
03:33 - your CSS the first one is going to be in
03:35 - Y after that I'm going to show you
03:37 - internal CSS and then I'm going to show
03:39 - you external CSS which is used most
03:42 - often
03:42 - so my CSS is going to be really to write
03:46 - your style in the tag so in the in this
03:49 - element itself on it start that you put
03:53 - style attribute and then in these
03:56 - quotation marks you can put really the
03:59 - property that you want to style and then
04:01 - its value and as you can see here we are
04:03 - offered with multiple properties that
04:06 - properties that we can style for this h1
04:08 - tag and the one that I want to use is
04:11 - going to be for example color like this
04:14 - and then after I've specified the
04:18 - property name itself I'm going to really
04:20 - write the color that I want
04:23 - this text to be off so I'm going to use
04:25 - for example hot pink color okay
04:30 - and now if I save this and then refresh
04:34 - my web browser page here you can see
04:37 - that this heading has become of this hot
04:39 - pink color okay so that is one thing
04:42 - that I want to show you and then what
04:44 - style this paragraph text as well so
04:47 - this paragraph element I want to style
04:50 - differently so I want to say for example
04:53 - that for my paragraph tag I want to
04:55 - style background color so this property
04:58 - here and for that let's use green let's
05:03 - say this green yellow color and here you
05:06 - can really specify the name of your
05:08 - color or you can put this RGB value
05:11 - meaning red green and blue and you can
05:15 - as well put here hexadecimal code of
05:18 - your color and for now we are going to
05:20 - use only this green yellow name of a
05:24 - color so if I save that and then refresh
05:27 - my page you can see that this here has
05:30 - become of this greenish color that we
05:33 - have specified here okay so that would
05:36 - be really styling these elements in
05:39 - lines so this is called inline CSS
05:42 - because we specified that CSS in this
05:46 - element itself so in this start tag of
05:49 - an element and now I want to show you
05:52 - another way of writing CSS and that is
05:54 - going to be really writing internal CSS
05:57 - so what is internal CSS that means that
06:01 - you can put your CSS so your style in
06:04 - this head section in this style text so
06:08 - I'm going to write style and then here
06:13 - so between the start tag and instead I'm
06:16 - going to put the name of my element and
06:19 - that is going to be for example this P
06:22 - tag so I want to style my paragraph and
06:25 - then in these curly brackets we are
06:27 - going to specify the style for this P
06:29 - tag and this style is going to be
06:32 - applied on all paragraph tags that we
06:35 - have in this
06:36 - HTML document so here I'm going to say
06:40 - for example that I want to style the
06:42 - font size of this P element and I'm
06:47 - going to say that that font size should
06:49 - be for example 20 pixels okay and after
06:53 - I have saved it I can refresh it and as
06:56 - you can see this paragraph now has this
06:59 - size of 20 pixels and this here is going
07:04 - to be applied on all paragraph tags in
07:06 - my HTML document so in this body section
07:11 - and just to prove that I'm going to add
07:13 - another paragraph and I'm going to say P
07:16 - and let's say this is second paragraph
07:21 - like this okay also I have saved it and
07:26 - now if i refresh it you can see that my
07:28 - second paragraph has appeared and it has
07:31 - the same font size as this one here but
07:34 - it does not have this green yellow
07:36 - background color because we have
07:38 - specified this inline CSS only on this
07:41 - first paragraph and that's why only this
07:44 - first paragraph has this greenish
07:46 - background but this one does not have
07:48 - any background at all so for that I'm
07:52 - going to move this background color from
07:55 - this my CSS into this internal CSS so
08:00 - I'm going to copy that control C and
08:03 - then placed it here and now if I save it
08:07 - and reload my page once more you can see
08:11 - that this paragraph two has gotten this
08:13 - green yellow background color and that
08:16 - means that now we can really remove this
08:19 - inline CSS from our first paragraph and
08:23 - this should behave the same when I save
08:25 - it and reload it it has stayed the same
08:29 - okay and let's move this h1 element into
08:35 - this internal CSS as well so here I'm
08:38 - going to say h1 and then put these curly
08:40 - brackets which means in these curly
08:43 - brackets I'm going to specify the style
08:45 - for all h1 elements on my webpage
08:48 - so let's say for example that I want
08:51 - style background color as well and for
08:54 - this background color I'm going to
08:56 - choose well this lavender blush color
08:59 - let's say for example because that's
09:00 - apparently a color so if I save it and
09:03 - then reload it here you can see that our
09:08 - heading has gotten this pink not not
09:11 - pink
09:11 - but this lavender blush background color
09:14 - I'm sorry guys I should probably use
09:16 - normal colors okay so we have styled it
09:20 - with this lavender blush color and let's
09:25 - also add it another property so let's
09:28 - say that we want to style the color
09:29 - itself so for this color I'm going to
09:34 - use for example red okay and now if I
09:39 - save this document and try to reload it
09:42 - here what do you expect that is going to
09:44 - happen well I did in a comments down
09:45 - below so if I reload it you can see that
09:48 - nothing has changed and why has that
09:51 - happened why Notting has changed because
09:53 - as you can see here we have specified
09:55 - red color but here we have still this
09:58 - hot pink color as the color for this
10:01 - heading and this this my CSS really has
10:05 - priority over this internal CSS because
10:08 - any time that you specify inline CSS for
10:12 - your element that is going to be really
10:14 - of a higher priority than your internal
10:17 - CSS so the priorities of these types of
10:21 - CSS go in a following way so the biggest
10:24 - priority has this in my CSS after dad
10:29 - the priority has this internal CSS so
10:32 - whatever you put in these style tags and
10:35 - then though these priority has external
10:37 - CSS but that is the one that is most
10:40 - used most so if I delete this my CSS now
10:45 - I'm going to save my document and then
10:49 - I'm going to reload my page and then as
10:52 - you can see our heading has become of
10:54 - this red color that we have specified
10:56 - here so now we have really removed all
10:59 - the styling from this
11:01 - my CSS to this internal CSS and this
11:06 - internal CSS is one way to style your
11:09 - page as well but neither the inline CSS
11:12 - nor the internal CSS are used that often
11:16 - and the one that is used most is going
11:19 - to be external CSS but why what is your
11:22 - reason well if you remember when we had
11:25 - that style for our paragraph tag here so
11:28 - inline style for this paragraph if you
11:31 - can remember that that was not really
11:34 - applied on any other paragraph tag but
11:36 - this one here okay so we have changed
11:40 - that when we moved that paragraph style
11:42 - to our internal CSS so with this with
11:46 - this code here we have said please style
11:47 - all my paragraph tags in this page but
11:50 - when you build a website you usually
11:53 - have your website consisting of more
11:56 - than one page and usually I want to
11:58 - apply the same styling for all of those
12:00 - pages and that is why external CSS is
12:04 - used meaning that you create a different
12:06 - file for your style and then you apply
12:09 - that file on all the HTML pages so on
12:12 - all the web pages that your site
12:14 - consists of and now I'm going to show
12:17 - you how you can create external CSS so
12:21 - I'm going to say file and then new file
12:25 - and here I have been presented with this
12:28 - untitled empty document so I'm going to
12:31 - save it ctrl s and I'm going to save it
12:34 - on my desktop so the same location where
12:37 - my where this my first webpage HTML
12:41 - document is that is very important so
12:44 - I'm going to name it style and the
12:48 - extension that you use for CSS files is
12:51 - going to be dot C SS okay so when I say
12:56 - that you can see that now it really
12:59 - looks different than it did before so it
13:02 - has this dot CSS extension and then here
13:05 - you can really move all of this internal
13:08 - CSS so I'm going to copy it and then I'm
13:12 - going to paste it
13:14 - here and now I can delete this style tag
13:19 - from my head section so I'm going to
13:21 - delete that and I'm going to save my
13:23 - document and now if I try to refresh
13:26 - this page you can see that all of my
13:29 - styling has disappeared and why is that
13:32 - happened well as we deleted that Styles
13:36 - tag from this head tag so from this page
13:39 - we have really deleted all the Styles we
13:42 - have moved them to a different file
13:44 - which is this one here and I'm going to
13:47 - save that file and in order to have
13:49 - those styles so these Styles here
13:53 - applied to your HTML page you really
13:56 - have to link this file to this HTML page
13:59 - so you have to say please use styles
14:03 - from a separate file which is going to
14:04 - be this one here and in order to do that
14:08 - we use link tag which is this one here
14:13 - and we have to specify two attributes to
14:16 - our link tag the first one is going to
14:18 - be this relationship attribute so you
14:21 - say arielle and then if you hover over
14:24 - it it says this attribute names a
14:27 - relationship of the linked document to
14:29 - the current to the current document okay
14:32 - so this attribute here is going to
14:35 - specify the relationship of this style
14:38 - CSS file to my HTML page and that
14:42 - relationship is style sheet like this
14:49 - okay so this Styles dot CSS is a style
14:53 - sheet for this web page and then the
14:56 - second attribute that you have to
14:57 - specify is going to be the location so
15:00 - where is this house dot CSS file and
15:04 - that is going to be really using H ref
15:07 - attribute like this and since this file
15:12 - here and this file here both have the
15:14 - same location so both of these files are
15:17 - on C users celina desktop and this one
15:21 - as well so C user selina desktop you can
15:24 - really specify just the name of the
15:26 - Styles file so you can see style dot CSS
15:31 - okay
15:32 - and now if I see these changes and
15:36 - refresh my webpage as you can see all
15:38 - these Styles appeared again so now we
15:41 - have again these styles that we have
15:43 - specified externally so in the external
15:46 - file and we have linked that file using
15:50 - this linked link tag and now we have
15:53 - really styled our web page using
15:55 - external CSS and now if you had multiple
15:58 - plate pages you can really just link
16:01 - this file the styles that CSS file to
16:04 - multiple pages and all of them are going
16:06 - to have a similar theme similar style
16:09 - one more thing that I want to show you
16:11 - is what is going to happen if I move for
16:14 - example this style dot CSS file so here
16:17 - we have specified only the name of our
16:20 - style file and that is because both of
16:24 - these files so both this HTML document
16:27 - and this CSS document are on the same
16:29 - location so that is this one here so
16:32 - disk c users so Deena desktop and then
16:35 - this one here is as well on disk C users
16:39 - sadena and then desktop and because of
16:42 - that we could only specify the name of
16:44 - our Styles file which is style dot CSS
16:47 - but what is going to happen if I for
16:50 - example move this file so what is going
16:53 - to happen if I create a new folder which
16:56 - I'm going to call let's say Styles okay
17:00 - and then I take this style dot CSS file
17:04 - which is this one here so this one that
17:07 - we have written here and linked here I
17:10 - take it and move it in my Styles folder
17:13 - so let's try to open this page again so
17:18 - I'm going to just reload it and as you
17:21 - can see we have lost our Styles again
17:23 - and why has that happened well because
17:27 - this style dot CSS is not available
17:30 - anymore on this location and this is the
17:32 - location where your HTML page is going
17:36 - to try to look for this file but since
17:39 - the location destination folder of this
17:42 - style dot CSS file has changed we have
17:45 - to really specify a new path to this
17:47 - file and let's check that path so I'm
17:51 - going to open this folder which I have
17:52 - created and then I'm going to right
17:54 - click on my style dot CSS and then click
17:57 - properties and here I have the location
18:02 - to my style file and that is going to be
18:05 - C users salvina desktop and then this
18:09 - Styles folder as well okay and then as
18:14 - you can see here it is going to look for
18:16 - this style dot CSS on C user solving a
18:19 - desktop which means that we are missing
18:21 - this part of pad here so this Styles
18:24 - folder so in order to fix the problem
18:28 - that we have we have to really specify
18:31 - that part of a pet here so I'm going to
18:34 - write styles and then put this flash so
18:39 - please try to look for this style CSS on
18:43 - this path and then add this Styles
18:46 - folder as well and then this is the name
18:48 - of the file that you are going to
18:49 - include so after I have saved it if I
18:53 - try to reload my page again you can see
18:55 - that my Styles have reappeared okay so I
19:00 - hope that you understood what is CSS and
19:04 - that you understood different types of
19:05 - CSS so we have talked about inline CSS
19:08 - internal and external CSS and the
19:12 - external CSS is this one here and that
19:16 - is the one that is used most often even
19:18 - though it is not wrong to use inline or
19:22 - internal CSS and we probably will
19:25 - sometime use the my CSS sometimes use
19:28 - the internal and external CSS as well so
19:32 - it really depends on what you need so it
19:35 - depends on your needs whether you want
19:36 - style a single tag in that case you can
19:40 - use inline CSS if you want to style all
19:42 - the page so a single page you can use
19:45 - internal CSS and then if you have
19:47 - multiple pages that you want to style
19:48 - you can use this external CSS and that
19:52 - often the case in in real life so you
19:54 - often have a website that consists of
19:57 - multiple pages so I hope that you

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video of HTML and CSS for beginners in this video I want to talk about CSS in my previous video I have explained basics of HTML and in this one I want to cover the basics of CSS so we are going to talk about different types of CSS and we are going to talk about CSS in general so before we start make sure to subscribe to my channel and also click the bell icon so that you are notified when I publish my next video and also follow me on my other social media platforms the link for that is going to be in the description of the video so without further ado let's start with today's lesson the first thing that I want to explain is going to be what is CSS CSS stands for cascading style sheets and that really means that CSS is used in order to style your HTML document so in order to style your web page and for that we are going to use it and I really wanted to make this course both HTML and CSS because these two are used really together so not separately but you use HTML in order to define the structure of your web page so all the elements that are going to appear in your web page and then CSS is really going to be styling those elements so here I have this basic HTML structure I hope that you are familiar with this if you are not you can watch my previous video there I have explained this basic HTML structure so I'm going to start from there and we are going to add a couple of elements the first one that I want to add is going to be title so let's say title ok and here I'm going to use let's say my first page like this so I'm going to say that this is my first web page and I have saved it and now if I click reload here as you can see my first page has appeared as this top title so that has done this title tag now I want to add headings so for that we are using this h1 tag and I'm going to say this is heading like this and also I have saved that so control us in order to save all the changes when you get this black dot symbol so control s and the changes are saved and then you can refresh it in your browser and your tag is going to appear so this is heading has appeared in my web browser okay so let's add one more element and that is going to be a paragraph and inside it I want to add let's say I want to write this is paragraph okay and then let's add a couple more sentences so I'm going to say this is second line and add a break line as well and then let's add a third line so that it really looks like a real paragraph so this is second one and then this is third third line okay and I'm going to add the end of sentence so now if i refresh it you can see that our paragraph has appeared here as well so now what I want to do is I want to style these elements here and the first type of CSS that I'm going to show you is going to be inline CSS because there are multiple ways that you can write your CSS the first one is going to be in Y after that I'm going to show you internal CSS and then I'm going to show you external CSS which is used most often so my CSS is going to be really to write your style in the tag so in the in this element itself on it start that you put style attribute and then in these quotation marks you can put really the property that you want to style and then its value and as you can see here we are offered with multiple properties that properties that we can style for this h1 tag and the one that I want to use is going to be for example color like this and then after I've specified the property name itself I'm going to really write the color that I want this text to be off so I'm going to use for example hot pink color okay and now if I save this and then refresh my web browser page here you can see that this heading has become of this hot pink color okay so that is one thing that I want to show you and then what style this paragraph text as well so this paragraph element I want to style differently so I want to say for example that for my paragraph tag I want to style background color so this property here and for that let's use green let's say this green yellow color and here you can really specify the name of your color or you can put this RGB value meaning red green and blue and you can as well put here hexadecimal code of your color and for now we are going to use only this green yellow name of a color so if I save that and then refresh my page you can see that this here has become of this greenish color that we have specified here okay so that would be really styling these elements in lines so this is called inline CSS because we specified that CSS in this element itself so in this start tag of an element and now I want to show you another way of writing CSS and that is going to be really writing internal CSS so what is internal CSS that means that you can put your CSS so your style in this head section in this style text so I'm going to write style and then here so between the start tag and instead I'm going to put the name of my element and that is going to be for example this P tag so I want to style my paragraph and then in these curly brackets we are going to specify the style for this P tag and this style is going to be applied on all paragraph tags that we have in this HTML document so here I'm going to say for example that I want to style the font size of this P element and I'm going to say that that font size should be for example 20 pixels okay and after I have saved it I can refresh it and as you can see this paragraph now has this size of 20 pixels and this here is going to be applied on all paragraph tags in my HTML document so in this body section and just to prove that I'm going to add another paragraph and I'm going to say P and let's say this is second paragraph like this okay also I have saved it and now if i refresh it you can see that my second paragraph has appeared and it has the same font size as this one here but it does not have this green yellow background color because we have specified this inline CSS only on this first paragraph and that's why only this first paragraph has this greenish background but this one does not have any background at all so for that I'm going to move this background color from this my CSS into this internal CSS so I'm going to copy that control C and then placed it here and now if I save it and reload my page once more you can see that this paragraph two has gotten this green yellow background color and that means that now we can really remove this inline CSS from our first paragraph and this should behave the same when I save it and reload it it has stayed the same okay and let's move this h1 element into this internal CSS as well so here I'm going to say h1 and then put these curly brackets which means in these curly brackets I'm going to specify the style for all h1 elements on my webpage so let's say for example that I want style background color as well and for this background color I'm going to choose well this lavender blush color let's say for example because that's apparently a color so if I save it and then reload it here you can see that our heading has gotten this pink not not pink but this lavender blush background color I'm sorry guys I should probably use normal colors okay so we have styled it with this lavender blush color and let's also add it another property so let's say that we want to style the color itself so for this color I'm going to use for example red okay and now if I save this document and try to reload it here what do you expect that is going to happen well I did in a comments down below so if I reload it you can see that nothing has changed and why has that happened why Notting has changed because as you can see here we have specified red color but here we have still this hot pink color as the color for this heading and this this my CSS really has priority over this internal CSS because any time that you specify inline CSS for your element that is going to be really of a higher priority than your internal CSS so the priorities of these types of CSS go in a following way so the biggest priority has this in my CSS after dad the priority has this internal CSS so whatever you put in these style tags and then though these priority has external CSS but that is the one that is most used most so if I delete this my CSS now I'm going to save my document and then I'm going to reload my page and then as you can see our heading has become of this red color that we have specified here so now we have really removed all the styling from this my CSS to this internal CSS and this internal CSS is one way to style your page as well but neither the inline CSS nor the internal CSS are used that often and the one that is used most is going to be external CSS but why what is your reason well if you remember when we had that style for our paragraph tag here so inline style for this paragraph if you can remember that that was not really applied on any other paragraph tag but this one here okay so we have changed that when we moved that paragraph style to our internal CSS so with this with this code here we have said please style all my paragraph tags in this page but when you build a website you usually have your website consisting of more than one page and usually I want to apply the same styling for all of those pages and that is why external CSS is used meaning that you create a different file for your style and then you apply that file on all the HTML pages so on all the web pages that your site consists of and now I'm going to show you how you can create external CSS so I'm going to say file and then new file and here I have been presented with this untitled empty document so I'm going to save it ctrl s and I'm going to save it on my desktop so the same location where my where this my first webpage HTML document is that is very important so I'm going to name it style and the extension that you use for CSS files is going to be dot C SS okay so when I say that you can see that now it really looks different than it did before so it has this dot CSS extension and then here you can really move all of this internal CSS so I'm going to copy it and then I'm going to paste it here and now I can delete this style tag from my head section so I'm going to delete that and I'm going to save my document and now if I try to refresh this page you can see that all of my styling has disappeared and why is that happened well as we deleted that Styles tag from this head tag so from this page we have really deleted all the Styles we have moved them to a different file which is this one here and I'm going to save that file and in order to have those styles so these Styles here applied to your HTML page you really have to link this file to this HTML page so you have to say please use styles from a separate file which is going to be this one here and in order to do that we use link tag which is this one here and we have to specify two attributes to our link tag the first one is going to be this relationship attribute so you say arielle and then if you hover over it it says this attribute names a relationship of the linked document to the current to the current document okay so this attribute here is going to specify the relationship of this style CSS file to my HTML page and that relationship is style sheet like this okay so this Styles dot CSS is a style sheet for this web page and then the second attribute that you have to specify is going to be the location so where is this house dot CSS file and that is going to be really using H ref attribute like this and since this file here and this file here both have the same location so both of these files are on C users celina desktop and this one as well so C user selina desktop you can really specify just the name of the Styles file so you can see style dot CSS okay and now if I see these changes and refresh my webpage as you can see all these Styles appeared again so now we have again these styles that we have specified externally so in the external file and we have linked that file using this linked link tag and now we have really styled our web page using external CSS and now if you had multiple plate pages you can really just link this file the styles that CSS file to multiple pages and all of them are going to have a similar theme similar style one more thing that I want to show you is what is going to happen if I move for example this style dot CSS file so here we have specified only the name of our style file and that is because both of these files so both this HTML document and this CSS document are on the same location so that is this one here so disk c users so Deena desktop and then this one here is as well on disk C users sadena and then desktop and because of that we could only specify the name of our Styles file which is style dot CSS but what is going to happen if I for example move this file so what is going to happen if I create a new folder which I'm going to call let's say Styles okay and then I take this style dot CSS file which is this one here so this one that we have written here and linked here I take it and move it in my Styles folder so let's try to open this page again so I'm going to just reload it and as you can see we have lost our Styles again and why has that happened well because this style dot CSS is not available anymore on this location and this is the location where your HTML page is going to try to look for this file but since the location destination folder of this style dot CSS file has changed we have to really specify a new path to this file and let's check that path so I'm going to open this folder which I have created and then I'm going to right click on my style dot CSS and then click properties and here I have the location to my style file and that is going to be C users salvina desktop and then this Styles folder as well okay and then as you can see here it is going to look for this style dot CSS on C user solving a desktop which means that we are missing this part of pad here so this Styles folder so in order to fix the problem that we have we have to really specify that part of a pet here so I'm going to write styles and then put this flash so please try to look for this style CSS on this path and then add this Styles folder as well and then this is the name of the file that you are going to include so after I have saved it if I try to reload my page again you can see that my Styles have reappeared okay so I hope that you understood what is CSS and that you understood different types of CSS so we have talked about inline CSS internal and external CSS and the external CSS is this one here and that is the one that is used most often even though it is not wrong to use inline or internal CSS and we probably will sometime use the my CSS sometimes use the internal and external CSS as well so it really depends on what you need so it depends on your needs whether you want style a single tag in that case you can use inline CSS if you want to style all the page so a single page you can use internal CSS and then if you have multiple pages that you want to style you can use this external CSS and that often the case in in real life so you often have a website that consists of multiple pages so I hope that you enjoyed
