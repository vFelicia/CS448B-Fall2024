00:00 - hi guys and welcome to my channel in
00:02 - this video I'm going to show you how you
00:03 - can set up visual studio code and
00:06 - everything that you need to install in
00:08 - order to build C applications with vs
00:11 - code the first thing that I want to
00:13 - explain is that vs code is a text editor
00:16 - it is free it is lightweight and if your
00:18 - computer is not that good but you still
00:20 - want to learn coding maybe you want to
00:22 - follow some of my C programming videos
00:24 - here on YouTube then vs code is going to
00:27 - be enough for you and in this video I
00:29 - will show you how you can set it up and
00:31 - everything that you need to install all
00:33 - of the extensions so that you can build
00:35 - C applications with vs code on the other
00:38 - hand there are some other tools like
00:40 - visual studio and visual studio is also
00:43 - free for you as a student and visual
00:45 - studio is a lot more powerful than vs
00:47 - code Visual Studio is an IDE which means
00:51 - integrated development environment and
00:53 - that means that it contains everything
00:56 - that you need to have in order to build
00:57 - applications in order to debug which
01:00 - means to discover and fix bugs in your
01:02 - applications different diagnostic tools
01:05 - that are going to help you to optimize
01:06 - your applications everything that you
01:08 - need in order to deploy your
01:09 - applications and so on so visual studio
01:12 - is a lot more powerful than vs code and
01:16 - also you can use it in order to build
01:17 - applications not just in C but many
01:20 - other programming languages as well but
01:22 - if you're just beginner and you first
01:24 - want to write some code and see if you
01:26 - really like it or not before you decide
01:28 - to invest in a better computer that is
01:29 - is more expensive then vs code is going
01:32 - to be more than enough for you and in
01:34 - this video I will show you how you can
01:36 - set up everything so that you can use vs
01:38 - code in order to make C applications I
01:41 - make a lot of C videos here on YouTube
01:43 - you can check out my C for beginners
01:46 - playlist I will link it in the
01:47 - description and in those videos you are
01:49 - going to learn a lot of important
01:51 - programming Concepts and for most of
01:53 - those videos VSS code is going to be
01:55 - enough but for those of you who want to
01:57 - speed up your progress and who want to
01:59 - get a job as soon as possible I also
02:02 - have a mentorship program which is
02:04 - practical programming course where you
02:06 - can get help directly from me we are
02:08 - going to work on real projects and at
02:11 - the end of the course you are going to
02:12 - get the knowledge and the certificate
02:15 - that you need in order to get your first
02:16 - job as a software developer we have a
02:19 - lot of students who started just three
02:21 - or four months ago and they already got
02:24 - their first job and when they started
02:26 - they were complete beginners so all the
02:28 - questions that you have will will be
02:30 - answered by experienced developers
02:32 - people who have been coding for years
02:34 - including myself this course is paid
02:37 - course so it is only for serious people
02:39 - who really want to work and who want to
02:42 - see serious results of their work
02:44 - salaries in IT industry are three times
02:46 - higher than any other industry so the
02:48 - competition is tough and you really need
02:50 - to work hard and you need to be prepared
02:52 - if you want to stand out among other
02:54 - people so if you want to use this
02:56 - opportunity I'm going to leave a coupon
02:58 - code that you can use to get a discount

03:08 - don't like the course you can get all of
03:10 - your money back no questions asked so
03:12 - this is for people who want to learn
03:14 - practical programming and start career
03:16 - as soon as possible and then in this
03:18 - video I will teach you how you can
03:19 - install and set up vs code so that you
03:21 - can build C applications and start
03:24 - learning programming the first thing
03:26 - that you will need is to download and
03:28 - install vs code you can do that on the
03:30 - official Microsoft website please use
03:33 - this link I will put it in the
03:35 - description so that you don't have to
03:36 - type it manually okay so here we can
03:39 - download vs code I will click on this
03:42 - button here so download for Windows okay
03:46 - and here it is asking me to save this
03:48 - installer file so click on Save okay and
03:51 - now we are waiting for the download
03:53 - process to finish okay so download
03:55 - process just finished and here I have my
03:58 - installer file so now we are going to
04:01 - install vs code and the installation
04:02 - process is very simple mostly next next
04:06 - next finish so let's double click here I
04:09 - will click on
04:11 - run and then I will accept these terms
04:14 - and agreements and then click on next
04:17 - and then next again next again and here
04:21 - I'm going to check these two options as
04:23 - well so all of these four options are
04:26 - checked they are going to be useful for
04:28 - you later when you learn more about
04:29 - coding so let's install them up front so
04:32 - select these four options and click on
04:35 - next okay and then here I will click on
04:38 - install and now we are waiting for the
04:41 - installation process to finish okay so
04:44 - the installation process is finished and
04:46 - now you can click on finish and it
04:48 - should launch Visual Studio
04:50 - code okay so here is our VSS code and if
04:56 - it did not start for you automatically
04:58 - you can open it manually just click on
05:00 - this start icon and type Visual Studio
05:04 - code and you can run it by clicking on
05:06 - this icon okay so the first thing that I
05:09 - want to do is to change this light theme
05:12 - into Dark theme and this is completely
05:14 - optional you don't have to do this if
05:16 - you like this theme but for me this is
05:18 - too bright and it is hurting my eyes and
05:21 - I believe that for most of you it's the
05:23 - same so let's change this light theme
05:25 - into Dark theme go to file and here you
05:28 - are going to find references theme color
05:32 - team okay and here we are going to
05:34 - select one of these dark teams the one
05:36 - that I like is this one dark visual
05:39 - studio so click on that okay and as you
05:42 - can see now it's much better it's much
05:44 - easier on the eyes so we have installed
05:47 - vs code which was the first step the
05:49 - second step and the second thing that we
05:51 - will need is to install net SDK and this
05:55 - is a set of tools that is developed by
05:57 - Microsoft and we are going to to use
06:00 - this set of tools in order to build C
06:02 - applications so now we need to install
06:05 - it you can open your Google once more
06:09 - and you can use this link in order to
06:12 - download net SDK I will put this link in
06:15 - the description so that you don't have
06:16 - to retype it okay so open this link okay
06:20 - and here you need to download latest
06:22 - version of net um now at the moment of
06:25 - filming this video that is net 8.0 so
06:28 - let's download that
06:30 - click here okay and then save and now we
06:34 - are waiting for the download process to
06:37 - finish so once it is downloaded you
06:39 - should have this installation file and
06:41 - now we are going to run the installation
06:43 - it's going to be very easy nothing
06:45 - special so mostly next next finish so
06:49 - let's double click on this installation
06:51 - file click on
06:53 - run and here click on install and now we
06:57 - are waiting for the installation to
06:59 - finish so the installation was
07:01 - successful and here you can click close
07:04 - now just to make sure that everything
07:05 - was installed successfully I will teach
07:07 - you two commands that you can use in
07:09 - order to check that so press on this
07:11 - Windows button and type CMD and open
07:15 - this command prompt okay and here you
07:18 - can type the First Command that is going
07:21 - to tell you which SDK versions you have
07:23 - installed on your computer so type
07:27 - net Das Dash
07:30 - list-
07:32 - sdks so please give me the list of all
07:35 - of the sdks that are installed and here
07:39 - you can see that in my computer I have
07:41 - four if you did not install any NET
07:44 - Framework before then you should have
07:46 - only one the one that you have just
07:49 - installed so in order to check which one
07:52 - you are currently using type this
07:54 - command
07:56 - net D- version
08:00 - like this and it is going to give you
08:03 - the current version of NET Framework
08:05 - that you are using and that is the one
08:07 - that we have just installed okay this is
08:10 - great it means that everything was
08:11 - installed successfully so now we can go
08:14 - back to our Visual Studio code so here
08:17 - and here we will need to install a few
08:19 - extensions so that we can start building
08:21 - C applications with vs code so let's
08:25 - install the extensions that we need
08:27 - click on view extension
08:30 - and here we are going to search for the
08:32 - extensions that we need please type c
08:35 - dev kit like this and the extension that
08:40 - you need is this one so C dev kit please
08:44 - make sure that it is official extension
08:46 - by Microsoft so you will click on
08:49 - install for this extension and now we
08:52 - are waiting for the installation process
08:55 - to finish so the installation process is
08:57 - finished and now we should have have
08:59 - this extension and also a few more
09:01 - extensions that were installed with it
09:04 - so please delete this search term and
09:06 - here you should see these four
09:08 - extensions make sure that you have here
09:11 - in this list of installed extensions
09:14 - following four extensions you need net
09:17 - install tool that is official extension
09:19 - by Microsoft and then CP extension Again
09:23 - official by Microsoft and then C devkit
09:27 - Again official by Microsoft and then all
09:29 - of these other extensions that I have
09:32 - those are for some other work that I'm
09:34 - doing and you absolutely don't need them
09:36 - so you need these three Net install tool
09:40 - C and C devkit and then you need one
09:43 - more which was not installed for me
09:45 - maybe it was installed for you but no
09:47 - problem I will show you how you can add
09:49 - that one manually so the one that we
09:51 - need to add is intell code for C devkit
10:00 - like this okay so I will need to install
10:03 - this extension and again if you are
10:05 - installing it as well if you don't have
10:07 - it uh please make sure that it is
10:10 - Microsoft official extension so click on
10:13 - install here and it should be
10:15 - added okay now we are waiting so with
10:19 - this all of the extensions have been
10:21 - installed for me I will delete this
10:23 - search term once more to make sure that
10:25 - I have all four so we need net install
10:29 - tool We need c We need c dev kit and
10:33 - then we need intell code for C dev kit
10:37 - make sure that you have all four of
10:40 - these and if you don't have one of these
10:42 - you will have to install it manually so
10:45 - once you have all four of these we can
10:48 - proceed and start building C
10:50 - applications so let me show you how to
10:53 - build your first C application with VSS
10:56 - code click on view and then command
10:58 - palette or you can press contrl shift
11:01 - and P okay and here I will type net new
11:07 - project so select this
11:11 - option okay now we need to wait because
11:14 - we are creating this for the first time
11:16 - here you will get a list of most common
11:19 - templates and the one that we need is
11:21 - console app so you can find it in this
11:24 - list or you can search it manually so
11:26 - console app and click on this one and
11:30 - now you will be asked where you want to
11:33 - save this project for me let's say that
11:35 - I will save it on desktop okay select
11:39 - folder and now it is asking me to give
11:43 - the name to my application so let's say
11:46 - my first vs code console app okay and
11:52 - hit enter and now simply click create
11:56 - project okay and now we are waiting for
11:59 - the project to be created and here I
12:02 - will click yes I trust the author
12:04 - because author is me so I will click
12:07 - here and here on this left side we have
12:11 - our project so now I will show you how
12:14 - you can create a simple C application so
12:17 - now the question is where are we going
12:19 - to write the code well let's collapse
12:22 - this and let's open this expander here
12:25 - solution Explorer okay and here you
12:28 - should have this my first VSS code
12:32 - console application so under this you
12:35 - should have
12:36 - program.cs and that is the file where we
12:39 - are going to write the code so if you
12:41 - double click on this program.cs you
12:43 - should get a file that looks like this
12:46 - so here we already have this simple
12:49 - hello world program so if I hit F5 this
12:53 - program should start and here it is
12:55 - asking me first to select the debugger
12:58 - so I will click on this one so
13:00 - C okay and I will launch this
13:04 - application and now I'm waiting for this
13:06 - output in my console and as you can see
13:09 - it we have here hello world which is the
13:12 - result of this code that we have in our
13:15 - program.cs so if I want to print
13:17 - something else I will just change the
13:20 - text inside these quotation marks so
13:22 - let's say for example learn practical
13:26 - programming at code Beauty academy.com
13:29 - and then I simply hit F5 and the
13:32 - application should start okay and we
13:35 - have our output here and then let's say
13:39 - for example that you want to ask the
13:40 - user to enter his input let's see how we
13:43 - can do that let's first declare a
13:46 - variable of type string and let's call
13:48 - it name okay and then what I want to do
13:53 - is I want to say
13:56 - console. right line and I want to say
13:58 - here here please enter your
14:02 - name like this and then inside this name
14:07 - variable I want to read whatever the
14:10 - user has typed into the console so
14:14 - console. readline please make sure that
14:16 - you are using correct capital or
14:19 - lowercase letters so console. readline
14:22 - and then after the user has entered his
14:25 - name I will simply say again console
14:29 - right line and here I will say hello and
14:33 - let's also add the name that the user
14:36 - has entered like this so now I will
14:39 - simply hit F5 and our application should
14:42 - start so here it says please enter your
14:45 - name so you are going to enter your name
14:47 - in this prompt here so here I will enter
14:50 - my name that is
14:52 - Salina like this and if I press enter as
14:56 - you can see the application responds
14:58 - with hello Saina okay so I hope that you
15:02 - have enjoyed this video all of the links
15:04 - for all the tools that we have installed
15:05 - in this video will be in the description
15:07 - I will prepare everything for you uh so
15:10 - now you can start learning C and you can
15:13 - start watching my C for beginners
15:15 - playlist and learn how to actually build
15:18 - C applications and if you want to learn
15:21 - practical programming and if you want to
15:23 - start a career as a software developer
15:25 - then I highly recommend to join my
15:28 - practical programming course where you
15:29 - are going to get help from experienced
15:32 - mentors and you are going to optimize

16:12 - videos and for most of those Concepts vs
16:15 - code is going to be enough and then for
16:17 - some videos you will still need uh
16:19 - Visual Studio you will still need the
16:21 - entire IDE so if you have any questions
16:24 - you can leave those in the comment

you can get help directly from me we are going to work on real projects and at the end of the course you are going to get the knowledge and the certificate that you need in order to get your first job as a software developer we have a lot of students who started just three or four months ago and they already got their first job and when they started they were complete beginners so all the questions that you have will will be answered by experienced developers people who have been coding for years including myself this course is paid course so it is only for serious people who really want to work and who want to see serious results of their work salaries in IT industry are three times higher than any other industry so the competition is tough and you really need to work hard and you need to be prepared if you want to stand out among other people so if you want to use this opportunity I'm going to leave a coupon code that you can use to get a discount when you enroll in the course and also we have a 7Day money back guarantee which means that if for any reason you don't like the course you can get all of your money back no questions asked so this is for people who want to learn practical programming and start career as soon as possible and then in this video I will teach you how you can install and set up vs code so that you can build C applications and start learning programming the first thing that you will need is to download and install vs code you can do that on the official Microsoft website please use this link I will put it in the description so that you don't have to type it manually okay so here we can download vs code I will click on this button here so download for Windows okay and here it is asking me to save this installer file so click on Save okay and now we are waiting for the download process to finish okay so download process just finished and here I have my installer file so now we are going to install vs code and the installation process is very simple mostly next next next finish so let's double click here I will click on run and then I will accept these terms and agreements and then click on next and then next again next again and here I'm going to check these two options as well so all of these four options are checked they are going to be useful for you later when you learn more about coding so let's install them up front so select these four options and click on next okay and then here I will click on install and now we are waiting for the installation process to finish okay so the installation process is finished and now you can click on finish and it should launch Visual Studio code okay so here is our VSS code and if it did not start for you automatically you can open it manually just click on this start icon and type Visual Studio code and you can run it by clicking on this icon okay so the first thing that I want to do is to change this light theme into Dark theme and this is completely optional you don't have to do this if you like this theme but for me this is too bright and it is hurting my eyes and I believe that for most of you it's the same so let's change this light theme into Dark theme go to file and here you are going to find references theme color team okay and here we are going to select one of these dark teams the one that I like is this one dark visual studio so click on that okay and as you can see now it's much better it's much easier on the eyes so we have installed vs code which was the first step the second step and the second thing that we will need is to install net SDK and this is a set of tools that is developed by Microsoft and we are going to to use this set of tools in order to build C applications so now we need to install it you can open your Google once more and you can use this link in order to download net SDK I will put this link in the description so that you don't have to retype it okay so open this link okay and here you need to download latest version of net um now at the moment of filming this video that is net 8.0 so let's download that click here okay and then save and now we are waiting for the download process to finish so once it is downloaded you should have this installation file and now we are going to run the installation it's going to be very easy nothing special so mostly next next finish so let's double click on this installation file click on run and here click on install and now we are waiting for the installation to finish so the installation was successful and here you can click close now just to make sure that everything was installed successfully I will teach you two commands that you can use in order to check that so press on this Windows button and type CMD and open this command prompt okay and here you can type the First Command that is going to tell you which SDK versions you have installed on your computer so type net Das Dash list sdks so please give me the list of all of the sdks that are installed and here you can see that in my computer I have four if you did not install any NET Framework before then you should have only one the one that you have just installed so in order to check which one you are currently using type this command net D version like this and it is going to give you the current version of NET Framework that you are using and that is the one that we have just installed okay this is great it means that everything was installed successfully so now we can go back to our Visual Studio code so here and here we will need to install a few extensions so that we can start building C applications with vs code so let's install the extensions that we need click on view extension and here we are going to search for the extensions that we need please type c dev kit like this and the extension that you need is this one so C dev kit please make sure that it is official extension by Microsoft so you will click on install for this extension and now we are waiting for the installation process to finish so the installation process is finished and now we should have have this extension and also a few more extensions that were installed with it so please delete this search term and here you should see these four extensions make sure that you have here in this list of installed extensions following four extensions you need net install tool that is official extension by Microsoft and then CP extension Again official by Microsoft and then C devkit Again official by Microsoft and then all of these other extensions that I have those are for some other work that I'm doing and you absolutely don't need them so you need these three Net install tool C and C devkit and then you need one more which was not installed for me maybe it was installed for you but no problem I will show you how you can add that one manually so the one that we need to add is intell code for C devkit like this okay so I will need to install this extension and again if you are installing it as well if you don't have it uh please make sure that it is Microsoft official extension so click on install here and it should be added okay now we are waiting so with this all of the extensions have been installed for me I will delete this search term once more to make sure that I have all four so we need net install tool We need c We need c dev kit and then we need intell code for C dev kit make sure that you have all four of these and if you don't have one of these you will have to install it manually so once you have all four of these we can proceed and start building C applications so let me show you how to build your first C application with VSS code click on view and then command palette or you can press contrl shift and P okay and here I will type net new project so select this option okay now we need to wait because we are creating this for the first time here you will get a list of most common templates and the one that we need is console app so you can find it in this list or you can search it manually so console app and click on this one and now you will be asked where you want to save this project for me let's say that I will save it on desktop okay select folder and now it is asking me to give the name to my application so let's say my first vs code console app okay and hit enter and now simply click create project okay and now we are waiting for the project to be created and here I will click yes I trust the author because author is me so I will click here and here on this left side we have our project so now I will show you how you can create a simple C application so now the question is where are we going to write the code well let's collapse this and let's open this expander here solution Explorer okay and here you should have this my first VSS code console application so under this you should have program.cs and that is the file where we are going to write the code so if you double click on this program.cs you should get a file that looks like this so here we already have this simple hello world program so if I hit F5 this program should start and here it is asking me first to select the debugger so I will click on this one so C okay and I will launch this application and now I'm waiting for this output in my console and as you can see it we have here hello world which is the result of this code that we have in our program.cs so if I want to print something else I will just change the text inside these quotation marks so let's say for example learn practical programming at code Beauty academy.com and then I simply hit F5 and the application should start okay and we have our output here and then let's say for example that you want to ask the user to enter his input let's see how we can do that let's first declare a variable of type string and let's call it name okay and then what I want to do is I want to say console. right line and I want to say here here please enter your name like this and then inside this name variable I want to read whatever the user has typed into the console so console. readline please make sure that you are using correct capital or lowercase letters so console. readline and then after the user has entered his name I will simply say again console right line and here I will say hello and let's also add the name that the user has entered like this so now I will simply hit F5 and our application should start so here it says please enter your name so you are going to enter your name in this prompt here so here I will enter my name that is Salina like this and if I press enter as you can see the application responds with hello Saina okay so I hope that you have enjoyed this video all of the links for all the tools that we have installed in this video will be in the description I will prepare everything for you uh so now you can start learning C and you can start watching my C for beginners playlist and learn how to actually build C applications and if you want
