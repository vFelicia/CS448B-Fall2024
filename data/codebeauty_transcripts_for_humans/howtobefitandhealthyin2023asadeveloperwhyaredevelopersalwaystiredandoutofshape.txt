00:00 - [Music]
00:10 - hi everyone
00:11 - welcome to my channel before i start i
00:14 - want to thank you all for being part of
00:16 - this journey and
00:17 - building this channel together with me
00:19 - and considering that we will be reaching
00:21 - 10 000 people
00:22 - very soon i want to announce that i will
00:25 - be doing a special video for 10 000
00:27 - subscribers where
00:28 - i will be answering your questions so i
00:31 - encourage you to ask me anything that
00:33 - you would like to know
00:34 - in the comments down below and then to
00:36 - share this video so that we can grow
00:39 - and um if you're not subscribed yourself
00:42 - why not so in this video i want to
00:45 - answer to a question that i recently got
00:48 - and it is a question from a person named
00:50 - dor
00:51 - and he or she says um do you think that
00:55 - your job is making it hard for you to
00:57 - stay in shape
00:58 - i was wondering about it i have a lot of
01:01 - friends and people in my environment who
01:03 - work in the tech industry
01:05 - and programmers a couple of them are in
01:07 - good shape however
01:08 - a lot of them always say that they are
01:11 - tired
01:12 - and unmotivated i was wondering if this
01:14 - is common experience
01:16 - for programmers this is very interesting
01:20 - question
01:20 - and the short answer is no this is not
01:23 - the case for me
01:24 - and it definitely doesn't have to be the
01:26 - case for you
01:27 - and in this video i want to share a
01:30 - couple of tips
01:30 - related to food sleep and then i want to
01:33 - show you my training routine
01:35 - to help you maintain that healthy body
01:37 - have a lot of energy and not have any
01:40 - weight problems
01:41 - and i will leave timestamps as well so
01:43 - that you can navigate yourself to each
01:45 - individual part
01:46 - so there are three main things that you
01:49 - have to take care of
01:50 - and then if you're still having problems
01:52 - at the end of this video
01:53 - i will mention a fourth thing that can
01:55 - be a potential reason why
01:57 - so if this topic is something that you
01:59 - are interested in
02:00 - i would highly recommend you to watch
02:02 - the entire video
02:04 - so the first thing that i want to talk
02:06 - about is the way you eat
02:08 - food and for me personally i have been
02:11 - following a vegetarian diet for the past
02:14 - 10 years or something like that and that
02:16 - is just something that keeps my body
02:18 - healthy
02:19 - it gives me a lot of energy so that i
02:21 - can train and then the training is
02:23 - something that keeps my body
02:24 - in shape however i do remember a period
02:28 - of my life when i was in high school
02:30 - and a period of my life when i would
02:32 - feel tired
02:34 - all the time and it went to the point
02:36 - where i would come home from school
02:38 - and then i would literally fall asleep
02:40 - in those same clothes that i was wearing
02:42 - to school that is how tired i was and
02:44 - i've seen that changing my diet had a
02:46 - huge
02:47 - impact on my health however i will not
02:50 - tell you it's very simple just eat
02:52 - more vegetables and fruits and
02:53 - everything should be okay
02:55 - but i rather want to focus more on
02:57 - concrete
02:58 - algorithm on on design patterns and
03:00 - mistakes that i've seen people doing
03:02 - and simple changes that you can
03:04 - incorporate in your everyday life
03:06 - but that can have a huge impact on your
03:09 - health as well
03:10 - the main reason that you have weight
03:12 - problems as a developer
03:13 - is mindless eating and this is something
03:16 - that i see
03:17 - very often a lot of my colleagues have
03:20 - some sort of snacks on their tables
03:22 - all the time and those are things like
03:24 - chips and chocolate and cookies
03:26 - and things like that and take my word
03:29 - for it
03:30 - if you have it at your table if you have
03:32 - it at your site
03:33 - you are going to eat it 100 so
03:36 - the best would be just don't bring it
03:38 - with you don't buy it don't have it in
03:40 - your bag
03:41 - and have some healthier options instead
03:44 - and i will include some uh some of the
03:47 - snacks and foods that i
03:48 - eat if i can find any clips and then
03:51 - another thing
03:52 - is don't go grocery shopping when you
03:54 - are hungry
03:55 - because when you are hungry your brain
03:57 - is constantly looking for foods that
04:00 - will bring those energy levels up and it
04:02 - is much easier
04:04 - to get those energy levels up with foods
04:06 - that are calorie dense so
04:08 - it will make you buy those foods so
04:11 - never go
04:12 - grocery shopping when you are hungry and
04:14 - then have some healthier options at hand
04:16 - as well another very important tip is
04:19 - don't ever go on extreme diets
04:22 - and i would say don't go on any diet at
04:25 - all if it is not something that is
04:27 - sustainable long term as a lifestyle but
04:30 - especially don't go
04:31 - on those diets that promise you to lose
04:34 - a lot of weight in just a couple of days
04:36 - or
04:36 - weeks because you will probably lose
04:39 - that weight if you stick to that diet
04:41 - long enough
04:42 - however it is just not worth the damage
04:45 - that you can make to your body
04:47 - to put it simply your body is a machine
04:50 - and it uses food and calories as a fuel
04:54 - and if your body gets used to working on
04:56 - very low amount of calories
04:58 - once you start eating normal amounts of
05:00 - food you will actually
05:02 - gain weight and that is the notorious
05:04 - cycle of
05:05 - yo-yo dieting so you go on an extreme
05:08 - diet
05:08 - you lose weight in that process but in
05:11 - that process you starve your body so
05:13 - much
05:14 - and it gets to the point where you are
05:16 - constantly hungry
05:17 - and the only thing that you can think of
05:19 - is food
05:20 - so you start eating again but
05:23 - considering that you have starved your
05:25 - body so much
05:26 - now your body thinks that it just went
05:28 - through a period of
05:29 - famine because that is something that
05:32 - happened a lot
05:32 - throughout the history we didn't always
05:34 - had fridges full of food and restaurants
05:36 - and food delivery
05:38 - so now your body says okay if something
05:41 - like this
05:41 - happens again unless i have
05:44 - enough amount of body fat to sustain me
05:47 - through that period of
05:49 - starvation again i will probably die and
05:52 - i don't want to die so now your body
05:54 - says
05:55 - okay let's now store this food and this
05:57 - energy that we are eating now
05:59 - as body fat and then you start gaining
06:02 - weight
06:03 - and that is the cycle that can never end
06:06 - unless you decide to end it and you
06:08 - cannot actually end it
06:10 - if you go on these extreme diets so baby
06:13 - steps
06:14 - small changes something that is
06:16 - maintainable long
06:17 - term um and i actually have a tip for
06:20 - this as well
06:21 - and that is to enjoy the process itself
06:24 - you have to enjoy the process of losing
06:27 - weight in order to maintain it
06:29 - long term and um you definitely cannot
06:32 - enjoy it if you are eating only
06:34 - broccoli and kale and oatmeal all the
06:36 - time because that is just not enjoyable
06:38 - for anyone
06:39 - but what you can do is you can make
06:41 - small modifications to these healthy
06:43 - foods
06:44 - so that you make them more enjoyable for
06:46 - you for example
06:48 - if friday nights were mac and cheese
06:50 - nights for you
06:51 - um how about making those mac and cheese
06:54 - and broccoli nights
06:55 - so 50 broccoli and then 50 percent mac
06:58 - and cheese
06:59 - or if you for example always eat cereal
07:02 - for breakfast and now you want to switch
07:04 - to plain oatmeal
07:05 - that is just not going to be that tasty
07:08 - but how about
07:09 - adding a little piece of chocolate to
07:11 - that oatmeal or
07:12 - a little bit of ice cream or whipped
07:14 - cream something like that
07:16 - all of a sudden it becomes for example
07:18 - seventy percent healthy and then
07:20 - thirty percent unhealthy or eighty
07:22 - percent healthy and twenty percent
07:23 - unhealthy which is
07:24 - a lot better than 100 percent unhealthy
07:28 - and this is something that is so much
07:29 - more satisfying to you
07:31 - and it is maintainable long term because
07:34 - you know that in each meal you have
07:36 - something that you love
07:38 - and something to look forward to so
07:41 - these were some tips related to food
07:43 - that i have
07:44 - and then if you have some tips that work
07:46 - for you something that you have seen and
07:48 - read
07:48 - please write those in the comments down
07:50 - below because we are all part of this
07:52 - and we would all love to read something
07:55 - informative
07:56 - and useful now second very important
07:59 - thing is going to be
08:00 - sleep and this is something that is a
08:03 - problem for me
08:04 - because um most of the time i sleep for
08:06 - five or six hours per night and this is
08:09 - just something that i have been doing
08:10 - for so long
08:11 - and i somehow got used to it but i don't
08:14 - believe that it is the healthiest
08:15 - approach to sleeping
08:17 - so in this particular situation i would
08:19 - say do as i say
08:20 - not as i do so anywhere between seven
08:24 - to nine hours of sleep is going to be
08:26 - optimal for adults
08:28 - i believe that most adults should aim
08:29 - for seven to eight hours of sleep per
08:32 - night
08:32 - and then if you are under extreme
08:34 - amounts of stress either
08:36 - physical or mental it is normal to sleep
08:39 - longer in that situation
08:41 - and then third and my favorite is
08:43 - training
08:44 - physical activity so for me personally i
08:47 - have been training for the most part of
08:49 - my life but it just never was
08:52 - sports in a traditional sense because
08:54 - throughout my childhood
08:55 - and even teenage years i used to be very
08:58 - small very
09:00 - petite and i just didn't want to play
09:02 - sports with these
09:03 - big humans so then at the end of my high
09:07 - school i suddenly grew and i was
09:09 - 174 or 175 centimeters
09:13 - so i thought oh so i get to be tall in
09:16 - this life right
09:17 - so i figured that i need one more
09:20 - centimeter to be a fashion model
09:22 - so i asked god please give me one more
09:25 - centimeter and it didn't happen
09:28 - so i went for software engineering
09:30 - university and i ended up as a
09:33 - programmer such a huge loss for
09:34 - victoria's secret i know
09:37 - i'm just kidding i would go for software
09:39 - engineering either way
09:41 - so as i was saying throughout my life i
09:43 - always was pretty active and for the
09:45 - first half of my life
09:47 - that was running i used to run for 10
09:50 - miles a few times per week
09:52 - and then i had this transition period
09:54 - where i did only yoga and dancing
09:56 - and then for the past five years i have
09:59 - been training in a gym
10:00 - and i will insert some clips of my
10:02 - training here so that you can see that
10:06 - so i always had some activity that i
10:09 - enjoyed and i always did that
10:12 - and that is the best advice that i can
10:13 - give to you as well find
10:15 - something that you like and stick to
10:17 - that so for example
10:18 - if you enjoy going to the gym go to the
10:20 - gym if you enjoy playing sports
10:23 - playing basketball volleyball tennis
10:25 - something like that
10:26 - do that if you enjoy hiking or dancing
10:29 - go hiking and dancing because
10:31 - the best type of training is something
10:33 - that you can stick to
10:35 - long term and nowadays there is this
10:37 - huge pressure to be
10:39 - fit and shredded and have a lot of
10:41 - muscle and as someone who comes from
10:43 - that world i have to tell you that
10:45 - having a lot of muscle and being fit
10:47 - does not necessarily make you healthy
10:50 - so having abs and big shoulders and
10:53 - bicep and chest and glutes for girls
10:56 - that does not necessarily make you
10:58 - healthier than someone who does not have
11:00 - abs and big muscle and it can even be
11:03 - unhealthy if you take it to the
11:05 - extreme level so find some sort of
11:08 - activity that is enjoyable for you
11:10 - and stick to that if you have a dog for
11:12 - example go walk that dog for an hour or
11:15 - two hours a day and that is going to be
11:16 - a training for you
11:18 - or use a bicycle instead of a car to go
11:21 - to work
11:22 - and things like that now one very
11:24 - important thing
11:25 - regarding the part of the question
11:27 - asking do you feel
11:28 - tired i would say no most of the time i
11:31 - don't and
11:32 - after training i even feel more
11:34 - energized
11:35 - i do have sometimes muscle pain and
11:38 - muscle soreness
11:38 - if i change something in my training
11:40 - routine but for
11:42 - the most part i train because i enjoy it
11:45 - and i don't torture my body with
11:47 - training i don't punish it i don't take
11:49 - it to extremes because
11:51 - i don't believe that is healthy and your
11:54 - body is a machine after all and it can
11:56 - break so
11:57 - don't take it to extremes i believe that
11:59 - is going to be the goal for most people
12:01 - so to be healthier to have more energy
12:04 - and to keep their weight
12:06 - in check but if you're feeling extremely
12:08 - tired even though you are taking care of
12:10 - your food your sleep and your training
12:12 - that can be some underlying health
12:14 - condition as well
12:16 - now i am not diagnosing anyone i am not
12:19 - a medical doctor
12:20 - but from the things that i have seen and
12:22 - read and if i was
12:24 - feeling extremely tired i would
12:26 - definitely check my thyroid i would
12:27 - check
12:28 - my liver i would check my fertile levels
12:30 - that is very important for girls
12:33 - and then my vitamin b12 for vegans and
12:35 - vegetarians that is a must i would check
12:37 - magnesium i would check vitamin d
12:40 - everyone should be checking their
12:41 - vitamin d during the winter
12:43 - and many other vitamins and minerals
12:45 - because being deficient
12:47 - in many of these can have tiredness as
12:50 - a symptom so again if you want to be
12:53 - healthy and if you want to be in shape
12:55 - there are three important things to keep
12:57 - in mind
12:58 - food sleep and training and if you take
13:01 - care of these three things you shouldn't
13:03 - have problems with feeling tired or
13:06 - you shouldn't have problems with losing
13:07 - weight but if you find it extremely hard
13:10 - to lose weight or if you feel
13:11 - extremely tired definitely visit your
13:14 - doctor because you might have some
13:16 - underlying health condition
13:17 - and your doctor is probably going to be
13:19 - able to help you to fix those issues
13:21 - that you are having
13:22 - so i hope that you enjoyed this video if
13:24 - you did give it a thumbs up
13:26 - and then if you want me to make more
13:28 - videos like this if you want me to share
13:30 - more tips related to this topic
13:31 - write that in the comments down below
13:33 - and then write any questions that you
13:35 - have as well because i do read all the
13:37 - comments and
13:38 - if there is some question that i can
13:40 - help you with i will gladly make a video
13:42 - related to that
13:44 - so thank you very much for watching stay
13:46 - healthy
13:47 - stay in shape and i'm going to see you
13:49 - in my next video
13:51 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to my channel before i start i want to thank you all for being part of this journey and building this channel together with me and considering that we will be reaching 10 000 people very soon i want to announce that i will be doing a special video for 10 000 subscribers where i will be answering your questions so i encourage you to ask me anything that you would like to know in the comments down below and then to share this video so that we can grow and um if you're not subscribed yourself why not so in this video i want to answer to a question that i recently got and it is a question from a person named dor and he or she says um do you think that your job is making it hard for you to stay in shape i was wondering about it i have a lot of friends and people in my environment who work in the tech industry and programmers a couple of them are in good shape however a lot of them always say that they are tired and unmotivated i was wondering if this is common experience for programmers this is very interesting question and the short answer is no this is not the case for me and it definitely doesn't have to be the case for you and in this video i want to share a couple of tips related to food sleep and then i want to show you my training routine to help you maintain that healthy body have a lot of energy and not have any weight problems and i will leave timestamps as well so that you can navigate yourself to each individual part so there are three main things that you have to take care of and then if you're still having problems at the end of this video i will mention a fourth thing that can be a potential reason why so if this topic is something that you are interested in i would highly recommend you to watch the entire video so the first thing that i want to talk about is the way you eat food and for me personally i have been following a vegetarian diet for the past 10 years or something like that and that is just something that keeps my body healthy it gives me a lot of energy so that i can train and then the training is something that keeps my body in shape however i do remember a period of my life when i was in high school and a period of my life when i would feel tired all the time and it went to the point where i would come home from school and then i would literally fall asleep in those same clothes that i was wearing to school that is how tired i was and i've seen that changing my diet had a huge impact on my health however i will not tell you it's very simple just eat more vegetables and fruits and everything should be okay but i rather want to focus more on concrete algorithm on on design patterns and mistakes that i've seen people doing and simple changes that you can incorporate in your everyday life but that can have a huge impact on your health as well the main reason that you have weight problems as a developer is mindless eating and this is something that i see very often a lot of my colleagues have some sort of snacks on their tables all the time and those are things like chips and chocolate and cookies and things like that and take my word for it if you have it at your table if you have it at your site you are going to eat it 100 so the best would be just don't bring it with you don't buy it don't have it in your bag and have some healthier options instead and i will include some uh some of the snacks and foods that i eat if i can find any clips and then another thing is don't go grocery shopping when you are hungry because when you are hungry your brain is constantly looking for foods that will bring those energy levels up and it is much easier to get those energy levels up with foods that are calorie dense so it will make you buy those foods so never go grocery shopping when you are hungry and then have some healthier options at hand as well another very important tip is don't ever go on extreme diets and i would say don't go on any diet at all if it is not something that is sustainable long term as a lifestyle but especially don't go on those diets that promise you to lose a lot of weight in just a couple of days or weeks because you will probably lose that weight if you stick to that diet long enough however it is just not worth the damage that you can make to your body to put it simply your body is a machine and it uses food and calories as a fuel and if your body gets used to working on very low amount of calories once you start eating normal amounts of food you will actually gain weight and that is the notorious cycle of yoyo dieting so you go on an extreme diet you lose weight in that process but in that process you starve your body so much and it gets to the point where you are constantly hungry and the only thing that you can think of is food so you start eating again but considering that you have starved your body so much now your body thinks that it just went through a period of famine because that is something that happened a lot throughout the history we didn't always had fridges full of food and restaurants and food delivery so now your body says okay if something like this happens again unless i have enough amount of body fat to sustain me through that period of starvation again i will probably die and i don't want to die so now your body says okay let's now store this food and this energy that we are eating now as body fat and then you start gaining weight and that is the cycle that can never end unless you decide to end it and you cannot actually end it if you go on these extreme diets so baby steps small changes something that is maintainable long term um and i actually have a tip for this as well and that is to enjoy the process itself you have to enjoy the process of losing weight in order to maintain it long term and um you definitely cannot enjoy it if you are eating only broccoli and kale and oatmeal all the time because that is just not enjoyable for anyone but what you can do is you can make small modifications to these healthy foods so that you make them more enjoyable for you for example if friday nights were mac and cheese nights for you um how about making those mac and cheese and broccoli nights so 50 broccoli and then 50 percent mac and cheese or if you for example always eat cereal for breakfast and now you want to switch to plain oatmeal that is just not going to be that tasty but how about adding a little piece of chocolate to that oatmeal or a little bit of ice cream or whipped cream something like that all of a sudden it becomes for example seventy percent healthy and then thirty percent unhealthy or eighty percent healthy and twenty percent unhealthy which is a lot better than 100 percent unhealthy and this is something that is so much more satisfying to you and it is maintainable long term because you know that in each meal you have something that you love and something to look forward to so these were some tips related to food that i have and then if you have some tips that work for you something that you have seen and read please write those in the comments down below because we are all part of this and we would all love to read something informative and useful now second very important thing is going to be sleep and this is something that is a problem for me because um most of the time i sleep for five or six hours per night and this is just something that i have been doing for so long and i somehow got used to it but i don't believe that it is the healthiest approach to sleeping so in this particular situation i would say do as i

such a huge loss for victoria's secret i know i'm just kidding i would go for software engineering either way so as i was saying throughout my life i always was pretty active and for the first half of my life that was running i used to run for 10 miles a few times per week and then i had this transition period where i did only yoga and dancing and then for the past five years i have been training in a gym and i will insert some clips of my training here so that you can see that so i always had some activity that i enjoyed and i always did that and that is the best advice that i can give to you as well find something that you like and stick to that so for example if you enjoy going to the gym go to the gym if you enjoy playing sports playing basketball volleyball tennis something like that do that if you enjoy hiking or dancing go hiking and dancing because the best type of training is something that you can stick to long term and nowadays there is this huge pressure to be fit and shredded and have a lot of muscle and as someone who comes from that world i have to tell you that having a lot of muscle and being fit does not necessarily make you healthy so having abs and big shoulders and bicep and chest and glutes for girls that does not necessarily make you healthier than someone who does not have abs and big muscle and it can even be unhealthy if you take it to the extreme level so find some sort of activity that is enjoyable for you and stick to that if you have a dog for example go walk that dog for an hour or two hours a day and that is going to be a training for you or use a bicycle instead of a car to go to work and things like that now one very important thing regarding the part of the question asking do you feel tired i would say no most of the time i don't and after training i even feel more energized i do have sometimes muscle pain and muscle soreness if i change something in my training routine but for the most part i train because i enjoy it and i don't torture my body with training i don't punish it i don't take it to extremes because i don't believe that is healthy and your body is a machine after all and it can break so don't take it to extremes i believe that is going to be the goal for most people so to be healthier to have more energy and to keep their weight in check but if you're feeling extremely tired even though you are taking care of your food your sleep and your training that can be some underlying health condition as well now i am not diagnosing anyone i am not a medical doctor but from the things that i have seen and read and if i was feeling extremely tired i would definitely check my thyroid i would check my liver i would check my fertile levels that is very important for girls and then my vitamin b12 for vegans and vegetarians that is a must i would check magnesium i would check vitamin d everyone should be checking their vitamin d during the winter and many other vitamins and minerals because being deficient in many of these can have tiredness as a symptom so again if you want to be healthy and if you want to be in shape there are three important things to keep in mind food sleep and training and if you take care of these three things you shouldn't have problems with feeling tired or you shouldn't have problems with losing weight but if you find it extremely hard to lose weight or if you feel extremely tired definitely visit your doctor because you might have some underlying health condition and your doctor is probably going to be able to help you to fix those issues that you are having so i hope that you enjoyed this video if you did give it a thumbs up and then if you want me to make more videos like this if you want me to share more tips related to this topic write that in
