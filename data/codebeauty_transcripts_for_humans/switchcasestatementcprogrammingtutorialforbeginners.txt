00:00 - hi guys and welcome to my channel in
00:01 - this video I'm going to teach you about
00:03 - switch case statement which is very
00:05 - important and commonly used in
00:07 - programming I will share some tips
00:09 - tricks and common errors that happen and
00:12 - together we are going to build an
00:14 - application so let me show you the
00:16 - application that we are going to build
00:18 - as you can see the app asks you to
00:20 - select a language we have nine languages
00:23 - and then depending on which language you
00:25 - select the application is going to
00:27 - respond and greet you in that language
00:29 - so if I I say one the application says
00:32 - hello and welcome and then let's start
00:35 - the application again if I select for
00:38 - example um Hindi and I press enter as
00:41 - you can see here we get Namaste okay uh
00:44 - and then if you select something else
00:47 - which is not a valid choice for example
00:50 - 99 as you can see you get invalid choice
00:54 - so this is the application that we are
00:56 - going to build today together and you
00:58 - are going to learn how to use switch
01:00 - case statement also if you want to learn
01:02 - the skills and knowledge necessary to
01:05 - become a successful software developer

02:19 - discount and you can find more details
02:22 - in the description of this video so with
02:24 - that being said let's continue and build
02:26 - our application the first thing that our
02:28 - application should do is it should ask
02:31 - the user to select the language so I
02:33 - will say
02:36 - console. right line and here I will say
02:39 - please select the
02:44 - language okay and then below we are
02:48 - going to write all of the languages that
02:50 - he can select so
02:53 - console do right
02:55 - line if he presses one that is English
03:00 - okay and then the second language was
03:06 - Hindi okay and then let's say third
03:09 - language is
03:12 - U okay and then I will add the remaining
03:16 - languages and then I will be back so we
03:18 - have French German Spanish Portuguese
03:21 - Turkish and balcan any of the balcon
03:24 - languages and now what we should do is
03:27 - we should give our user the option to
03:29 - enter his choice so one of these nine
03:32 - numbers or any number and then based on
03:35 - his choice we are going to greet him in
03:38 - one of these languages or if he selects
03:41 - some option that is not valid then we
03:44 - are going to tell him you entered
03:46 - invalid choice so now I would like to
03:48 - invite you to try and implement this
03:50 - program with the help of if else
03:53 - conditions which we have learned in the
03:54 - previous video that is going to be
03:55 - linked here and also in the description
03:58 - in case that you did not watch it so
04:00 - make sure to watch it and then try to
04:02 - implement this program with the help of
04:04 - if else conditions and then I'm going to
04:07 - show you a better way to implement that
04:08 - same thing with the help of switch case
04:12 - the reason for that is because here we
04:14 - have a lot of different choices that the
04:15 - user can make and if you write a lot of
04:18 - if else conditions even if your program
04:21 - works the code will be hard to read hard
04:23 - to understand and maintain so a better
04:26 - choice is to implement this and to solve
04:29 - this problem with with the help of
04:30 - switch case so now I'm going to show you
04:33 - how you can do that so the first thing
04:35 - that we need to do is we need to read
04:37 - the choice that our user has entered and
04:39 - we will store that number inside an
04:42 - integer variable so let's create that
04:44 - variable let's say int
04:47 - Choice okay so what I want to do is
04:51 - whatever our user enters I want to parse
04:54 - that into integer so that it can be
04:56 - stored inside this integer variable so I
04:59 - will say
05:00 - int. pars console readline so I will
05:05 - read from the console what our user has
05:08 - entered and then I will parse that into
05:10 - an integer and store it inside this
05:13 - variable here and also please don't
05:15 - forget this semic column at the end so
05:18 - now that we have users Choice stored
05:21 - inside this variable what we want to do
05:24 - is we want to check which one of these
05:27 - numbers is inside this variable and then
05:30 - depending on that number we are going to
05:32 - write him a message in that specific
05:35 - language so the first thing that I will
05:38 - do is I will create a string variable I
05:40 - will call it
05:42 - message okay and initially I will not
05:46 - assign any value to this variable but
05:49 - what I will do is I will check what
05:52 - number is inside this Choice variable
05:55 - and then depending on that number I will
05:57 - store a message in one one of these nine
06:01 - languages and in order to check which
06:04 - value is inside this variable we are
06:07 - going to use switch case statement so
06:10 - switch case statement is used when you
06:12 - want to check what is the value of a
06:14 - certain variable but there are many
06:16 - different values that variable can hold
06:19 - for example in our case we have nine
06:22 - valid options nine valid cases and then
06:25 - our user can also enter an invalid
06:28 - number for example 15 so we should also
06:31 - be able to handle that situation as well
06:33 - and then in each one of these cases we
06:36 - want our program to behave differently
06:38 - we want to get a different message so
06:41 - for that we use switch case so let's see
06:45 - how would you do that so you write
06:48 - switch and then inside these parentheses
06:51 - you are going to put the variable whose
06:53 - value you want to check and that is our
06:56 - choice variable and then inside these
07:00 - curly brackets we will put all
07:02 - individual cases so in case that the
07:05 - user has entered number one which means
07:08 - that this variable holds number one then
07:11 - we will write a message in English in
07:14 - case that the user has entered number
07:16 - two so if this variable here holds
07:19 - number two then we will write a message
07:21 - in Hindi and then in case of three we
07:23 - will write a message in Ordo and so on
07:26 - so here I will describe each individual
07:29 - case so case one and then you put these
07:32 - two dots you put column sign so in this
07:36 - case message will be a message in
07:39 - English so I will say hello
07:43 - welcome okay and then one very important
07:47 - thing is that at the end of each case
07:50 - you need to put break statement so at
07:54 - the end of each case after you have
07:57 - finished describing what your program
07:59 - should do in that case you need to put
08:02 - break statement otherwise you are going
08:04 - to have errors okay so that is our case
08:09 - one now I'm going to copy this code and
08:11 - paste it and now I want to describe what
08:14 - is going to happen in case that the user
08:16 - has selected number two and in case of
08:19 - number two we need a message in Hindi so
08:22 - in Hindi I believe it is said
08:26 - Namaste okay I have a friend from India
08:28 - who always says Namaste and then does
08:32 - this what does that mean I find it so
08:35 - cute but I cannot do it right now so
08:39 - case number three is U we say asalam
08:42 - alaykum so case three and then message
08:47 - will be
08:49 - asalam
08:51 - alayum okay and then at the end of each
08:55 - case we need break okay so now I'm going
08:58 - to add these these remaining six
09:01 - languages and I will be back so I've
09:03 - added case four and that is French so in
09:06 - French we
09:07 - sayour
09:09 - Oren and then don't forget break at the
09:12 - end it's very important and then case
09:15 - five that is German so
09:23 - of and then again don't forget break at
09:26 - the end and then case six that is
09:29 - Spanish so we
09:33 - say um and then case seven is Portuguese
09:37 - so we say hola Bonia and then case eight
09:41 - that is Turkish so we sayaba hushen and
09:45 - then case nine I've put here Balon
09:48 - because that is actually my language
09:49 - it's a group of 10 languages which are
09:51 - very similar so in Balon we
09:56 - say okay so here we have have these nine
10:01 - cases and depending on which Choice
10:03 - which one of these nine numbers the user
10:06 - enters he is going to get one of these
10:09 - nine messages so now that we have stored
10:12 - one of these nine messages into this
10:15 - variable what we can do is we can simply
10:17 - write this message into our console but
10:20 - one thing that we need to do before that
10:22 - is we need to cover default case which
10:25 - means what is going to happen in case
10:27 - that user does not enter any one of
10:29 - these valid choices for example he
10:31 - enters number 10 or 100 so that case is
10:36 - called default and I will put it
10:42 - here like this so you say default so
10:46 - what is going to happen in default case
10:48 - well I will store inside my message
10:51 - invalid
10:53 - Choice like this and at the end I will
10:56 - put break again so now that we have
10:59 - covered all of these valid cases and
11:02 - then also default case which means if
11:04 - the user enters some number that is not
11:07 - valid now I can say
11:10 - console. line message so now if I run my
11:14 - program let's see what we are going to
11:16 - get so it says please select the
11:19 - language and if I say five and press
11:22 - enter we get guten tag will come in and
11:26 - then if I start the application again
11:29 - and I say for example two it says
11:32 - Namaste okay and then our default case
11:36 - is going to happen if I enter some
11:38 - choice that is not valid for example 57
11:41 - and I press enter as you can see we get
11:44 - invalid Choice okay so the main takeaway
11:48 - from this video is that we use switch
11:50 - case statement when we want to execute
11:53 - different block of code depending on a
11:56 - value of a certain variable in our case
11:59 - we want to check what is value inside
12:01 - Choice variable and then in case it is
12:04 - one we want to execute this code in case
12:06 - it is do we want to execute this code
12:09 - and so on and then at the end of each
12:12 - case please don't forget to put break
12:15 - that is very important okay and then
12:18 - here we have default case which means if
12:21 - neither one of these is the value for
12:24 - this variable then we are going to
12:27 - execute default case okay and for each
12:31 - case you can have just one line of code
12:34 - or you can have an entire block of code
12:37 - depending on what you want your program
12:39 - to do uh in all of our cases we have
12:42 - just one line of code but again if you
12:44 - wanted you could put an entire block of
12:47 - code and then very very important not to
12:50 - forget is that at the end of each case
12:52 - you need to put break statement an
12:55 - interesting question is do you need to
12:57 - have this default case so does every
13:01 - switch case statement need to have
13:04 - default as well and the answer is no you
13:07 - don't so this here is not obligatory I
13:10 - can delete it but in our program we are
13:13 - going to get an error here and the
13:15 - reason why we are getting this error is
13:17 - because we are trying to write this
13:19 - message and that is going to work
13:21 - without any problems in case that user
13:23 - enters one of these nine numbers but if
13:26 - he enters any other number which is not
13:29 - not valid case then we are going to have
13:32 - an error because we have not assigned
13:34 - any value to that variable so here our
13:37 - program says that this variable needs to
13:40 - have some value in case that the user
13:43 - does not enter one of these nine numbers
13:46 - and so far we have covered that with our
13:49 - default situation but now that we don't
13:52 - have it what we can do is we can assign
13:55 - initial value here so initially I can
13:58 - say in valid choice so that is going to
14:01 - be initial value of this variable and
14:03 - then in case that the user enters one of
14:06 - these numbers we will simply change that
14:09 - for one of these messages and then in
14:12 - case that he enters something that is
14:14 - not valid then we will have this initial
14:17 - message so we will not have the error
14:20 - anymore and now if I start my program
14:22 - again as you can see our program works
14:24 - without any problems so one it says
14:27 - hello welcome and then if I enter
14:30 - something that is not valid for example
14:32 - 55 as you can see we get this invalid
14:35 - Choice which is the initial string that
14:38 - we have stored inside this variable so
14:41 - you can use this approach here or you
14:43 - can have default case at the end
14:46 - whichever you prefer most beginners find
14:49 - this one easier to understand so I will
14:51 - leave this one and even if you leave
14:54 - both your program is still going to work
14:56 - but it is redundant to have both so I
14:59 - will simply remove this initial message
15:02 - here okay so now that you have learned
15:05 - what is switch case and how to use it I
15:07 - want to give you a task that you can do
15:09 - on your own in order to practice and
15:12 - then you can watch my solution so your
15:14 - task is the following I want you to ask
15:17 - the user to enter a number for a month
15:20 - so one for January two for February
15:22 - three for March and so on and then
15:24 - depending on the number that he has
15:26 - entered you are going to write him a
15:29 - message how many days that month has so
15:33 - please pause the video here and then try
15:34 - to implement this try to solve this
15:36 - problem on your own and then you can
15:38 - watch my solution so here is my solution
15:41 - and I wanted to show you this example
15:43 - because I wanted to teach you an
15:44 - important and interesting trick and that
15:47 - is how you can group multiple cases
15:50 - together so here I have grouped these
15:53 - seven cases that have the same behavior
15:56 - so I have grouped them like this so that
15:58 - I don't have to repeat my code and then
16:00 - I have also grouped these four cases
16:03 - together because they also have the same
16:05 - behavior and I will explain this in a
16:07 - minute but first let's explain from the
16:10 - beginning what this program does so
16:13 - first we ask the user to enter a month
16:15 - so enter a number between 1 and 12 and
16:19 - then we read what the user has typed and
16:22 - we parse that into an integer so we
16:24 - convert it into an integer and we store
16:27 - it inside this month variable and then
16:30 - we switch on that variable which means
16:32 - we check what is the value of that
16:35 - variable so in case that it is one or in
16:37 - case that it is three or five 7 8 10 or
16:41 - 12 those are these months here and in
16:44 - any one of these cases we will print the
16:46 - same message so we will write that month
16:49 - has 31 days and then at the end we need
16:53 - to put break now another way that you
16:55 - could do this is you could repeat this
16:57 - code for all of these individual cases
17:00 - so you can say case one and then this
17:02 - code here and then case three and then
17:04 - the same code and then case five the
17:06 - same code again and so on but you can
17:09 - also do it this way in order to make
17:11 - your code shorter and understandable and
17:13 - in order to avoid repeating your code so
17:17 - for any one of these cases we will write
17:20 - this message here and then at the end
17:22 - very important to put break and then we
17:24 - have these four cases which also have
17:26 - the same behavior so in case that month
17:29 - is April or June or September or
17:31 - November so in case four 6 9 or 11 is
17:35 - what user has typed we are going to
17:38 - write this message that month has 30
17:41 - days and then again it's very important
17:43 - that you put break and then since
17:46 - February is very specific we have just
17:49 - one month inside this group so in case
17:52 - of two we will say that month has 28 or
17:55 - 29 days on leap year and then again you
17:58 - need to to put break at the end and then
18:01 - we also have this default case which
18:03 - says invalid month so in case that the
18:05 - user enters any other number which is
18:07 - not between 1 and 12 we will write this
18:12 - message here okay so now if I start the
18:16 - program and I enter for example 10 that
18:19 - is October we get this message here that
18:22 - month has 31 days and then if I start
18:26 - the program again and I enter for
18:28 - example 9 that is September we should
18:31 - get this message here so that month has
18:34 - 30 days and then for February if we
18:38 - enter two we get this message here and
18:42 - then let me stop this program in case
18:44 - that I enter anything else which is not
18:46 - valid for example 99 we get invalid
18:50 - month message okay so this is how you
18:53 - use switch case and as I said in the
18:56 - beginning all of the problems that you
18:58 - can solve with switch case you can also
19:00 - solve with multiple if else conditions
19:03 - but sometimes if you write a lot of if
19:05 - else conditions that can make your code
19:07 - look bulky and hard to understand hard
19:09 - to maintain so if you need to write a
19:12 - lot of f Els conditions you should
19:14 - definitely consider using switch case
19:17 - instead but there are some important
19:19 - differences between if else statement
19:21 - and switch case statement and that is
19:24 - the following inside if else you can
19:27 - write different conditions and different
19:28 - different expressions for example you
19:30 - can say if a is greater than b then do
19:33 - something or if month is less than five
19:37 - then do this but in switch case you
19:40 - cannot do that so here inside each one
19:43 - of these cases you need to put exact
19:46 - value that this variable here can have
19:49 - and you cannot write expressions like
19:51 - you can in if else statement so that
19:55 - means that if else statement is more
19:57 - powerful it gives you more options but
20:00 - sometimes it is better to use switch
20:02 - case if you can of course because that
20:04 - will make your code easier to understand
20:07 - and easier to read for example if you
20:09 - need to write multiple if else
20:12 - statements then it is better to use
20:14 - switch case but that is possible only if
20:17 - you are checking the value of this
20:19 - variable against specific exact values
20:23 - that it can have and not some
20:25 - Expressions but if you just want to
20:27 - check one or two different values then
20:30 - it is completely okay and it is better
20:32 - and faster to write if else statement so
20:36 - if you don't understand F else then you
20:39 - can watch video that will be linked here
20:41 - and I will also put it in the
20:42 - description and then you can better
20:45 - understand what is if else and also the
20:47 - difference between switch case statement
20:49 - and if else statement so I hope that
20:52 - this video was helpful and that now you
20:55 - understand how to use switch case
20:56 - statement if you enjoyed it and if you
20:58 - want more videos like this give it a
21:01 - thumbs up and also if you have any
21:03 - questions you can leave those in the
21:04 - comment section uh and if you want to

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys and welcome to my channel in this video I'm going to teach you about switch case statement which is very important and commonly used in programming I will share some tips tricks and common errors that happen and together we are going to build an application so let me show you the application that we are going to build as you can see the app asks you to select a language we have nine languages and then depending on which language you select the application is going to respond and greet you in that language so if I I say one the application says hello and welcome and then let's start the application again if I select for example um Hindi and I press enter as you can see here we get Namaste okay uh and then if you select something else which is not a valid choice for example 99 as you can see you get invalid choice so this is the application that we are going to build today together and you are going to learn how to use switch case statement also if you want to learn the skills and knowledge necessary to become a successful software developer or if you are tired because you cannot find a job or you are stuck in your current job but you really want a big career in Tech

guarantee so you really have nothing to lose uh and the fastest people who enroll will get a special discount and you can find more details in the description of this video so with that being said let's continue and build our application the first thing that our application should do is it should ask the user to select the language so I will say console. right line and here I will say please select the language okay and then below we are going to write all of the languages that he can select so console do right line if he presses one that is English okay and then the second language was Hindi okay and then let's say third language is U okay and then I will add the remaining languages and then I will be back so we have French German Spanish Portuguese Turkish and balcan any of the balcon languages and now what we should do is we should give our user the option to enter his choice so one of these nine numbers or any number and then based on his choice we are going to greet him in one of these languages or if he selects some option that is not valid then we are going to tell him you entered invalid choice so now I would like to invite you to try and implement this program with the help of if else conditions which we have learned in the previous video that is going to be linked here and also in the description in case that you did not watch it so make sure to watch it and then try to implement this program with the help of if else conditions and then I'm going to show you a better way to implement that same thing with the help of switch case the reason for that is because here we have a lot of different choices that the user can make and if you write a lot of if else conditions even if your program works the code will be hard to read hard to understand and maintain so a better choice is to implement this and to solve this problem with with the help of switch case so now I'm going to show you how you can do that so the first thing that we need to do is we need to read the choice that our user has entered and we will store that number inside an integer variable so let's create that variable let's say int Choice okay so what I want to do is whatever our user enters I want to parse that into integer so that it can be stored inside this integer variable so I will say int. pars console readline so I will read from the console what our user has entered and then I will parse that into an integer and store it inside this variable here and also please don't forget this semic column at the end so now that we have users Choice stored inside this variable what we want to do is we want to check which one of these numbers is inside this variable and then depending on that number we are going to write him a message in that specific language so the first thing that I will do is I will create a string variable I will call it message okay and initially I will not assign any value to this variable but what I will do is I will check what number is inside this Choice variable and then depending on that number I will store a message in one one of these nine languages and in order to check which value is inside this variable we are going to use switch case statement so switch case statement is used when you want to check what is the value of a certain variable but there are many different values that variable can hold for example in our case we have nine valid options nine valid cases and then our user can also enter an invalid number for example 15 so we should also be able to handle that situation as well and then in each one of these cases we want our program to behave differently we want to get a different message so for that we use switch case so let's see how would you do that so you write switch and then inside these parentheses you are going to put the variable whose value you want to check and that is our choice variable and then inside these curly brackets we will put all individual cases so in case that the user has entered number one which means that this variable holds number one then we will write a message in English in case that the user has entered number two so if this variable here holds number two then we will write a message in Hindi and then in case of three we will write a message in Ordo and so on so here I will describe each individual case so case one and then you put these two dots you put column sign so in this case message will be a message in English so I will say hello welcome okay and then one very important thing is that at the end of each case you need to put break statement so at the end of each case after you have finished describing what your program should do in that case you need to put break statement otherwise you are going to have errors okay so that is our case one now I'm going to copy this code and paste it and now I want to describe what is going to happen in case that the user has selected number two and in case of number two we need a message in Hindi so in Hindi I believe it is said Namaste okay I have a friend from India who always says Namaste and then does this what does that mean I find it so cute but I cannot do it right now so case number three is U we say asalam alaykum so case three and then message will be asalam alayum okay and then at the end of each case we need break okay so now I'm going to add these these remaining six languages and I will be back so I've added case four and that is French so in French we sayour Oren and then don't forget break at the end it's very important and then case five that is German so of and then again don't forget break at the end and then case six that is Spanish so we say um and then case seven is Portuguese so we say hola Bonia and then case eight that is Turkish so we sayaba hushen and then case nine I've put here Balon because that is actually my language it's a group of 10 languages which are very similar so in Balon we say okay so here we have have these nine cases and depending on which Choice which one of these nine numbers the user enters he is going to get one of these nine messages so now that we have stored one of these nine messages into this variable what we can do is we can simply write this message into our console but one thing that we need to do before that is we need to cover default case which means what is going to happen in case that user does not enter any one of these valid choices for example he enters number 10 or 100 so that case is called default and I will put it here like this so you say default so what is going to happen in default case well I will store inside my message invalid Choice like this and at the end I will put break again so now that we have covered all of these valid cases and then also default case which means if the user enters some number that is not valid now I can say console. line message so now if I run my program let's see what we are going to get so it says please select the language and if I say five and press enter we get guten tag will come in and then if I start the application again and I say for example two it says Namaste okay and then our default case is going to happen if I enter some choice that is not valid for example 57 and I press enter as you can see we get invalid Choice okay so the main takeaway from this video is that we use switch case statement when we want to execute different block of code depending on a value of a certain variable in our case we want to check what is value inside Choice variable and then in case it is one we want to execute this code in case it is do we want to execute this code and so on and then at the end of each case please don't forget to put break that is very important okay and then here we have default case which means if neither one of these is the value for this variable then we are going to execute default case okay and for each case you can have just one line of code or you can have an entire block of code depending on what you want your program to do uh in all of our cases we have just one line of code but again if you wanted you could put an entire block of code and then very very important not to forget is that at the end of each case you need to put break statement an interesting question is do you need to have this default case so does every switch case statement need to have default as well and the answer is no you don't so this here is not obligatory I can delete it but in our program we are going to get an error here and the reason why we are getting this error is because we are trying to write this message and that is going to work without any problems in case that user enters one of these nine numbers but if he enters any other number which is not not valid case then we are going to have an error because we have not assigned any value to that variable so here our program says that this variable needs to have some value in case that the user does not enter one of these nine numbers and so far we have covered that with our default situation but now that we don't have it what we can do is we can assign initial value here so initially I can say in valid choice so that is going to be initial value of this variable and then in case that the user enters one of these numbers we will simply change that for one of these messages and then in case that he enters something that is not valid then we will have this initial message so we will not have the error anymore and now if I start my program again as you can see our program works without any problems so one it says hello welcome and then if I enter something that is not valid for example 55 as you can see we get this invalid Choice which is the initial string that we have stored inside this variable so you can use this approach here or you can have default case at the end whichever you prefer most beginners find this one easier to understand so I will leave this one and even if you leave both your program is still going to work but it is redundant to have both so I will simply remove this initial message here okay so now that you have learned what is switch case and how to use it I want to give you a task that you can do on your own in order to practice and then you can watch my solution so your task is the following I want you to ask the user to enter a number for a month so one for January two for February three for March and so on and then depending on the number that he has entered you are going to write him a message how many days that month has so please pause the video here and then try to implement this try to solve this problem on your own and then you can watch my solution so here is my solution and I wanted to show you this example because I wanted to teach you an important and interesting trick and that is how you can group multiple cases together so here I have grouped these seven cases that have the same behavior so I have grouped them like this so that I don't have to repeat my code and then I have also grouped these four cases together because they also have the same behavior and I will explain this in a minute but first let's explain from the beginning what this program does so first we ask the user to enter a month so enter a number between 1 and 12 and then we read what the user has typed and we parse that into an integer so we convert it into an integer and we store it inside this month variable and then we switch on that variable which means we check what is the value of that variable so in case that it is one or in case that it is three or five 7 8 10 or 12 those are these months here and in any one of these cases we will print the same message so we will write that month has 31 days and then at the end we need to put break now another way that you could do this is you could repeat this code for all of these individual cases so you can say case one and then this code here and then case three and then the same code and then case five the same code again and so on but you can also do it this way in order to make your code shorter and understandable and in order to avoid repeating your code so for any one of these cases we will write this message here and then at the end very important to put break and then we have these four cases which also have the same behavior so in case that month is April or June or September or November so in case four 6 9 or 11 is what user has typed we are going to write this message that month has 30 days and then again it's very important that you put break and then since February is very specific we have just one month inside this group so in case of two we will say that month has 28 or 29 days on leap year and then again you need to to put break at the end and then we also have this default case which says invalid month so in case that the user enters any other number which is not between 1 and 12 we will write this message here okay so now if I start the program and I enter for example 10 that is October we get this message here that month has 31 days and then if I start the program again and I enter for example 9 that is September we should get this message here so that month has 30 days and then for February if we enter two we get this message here and then let me stop this program in case that I enter anything else which is not valid for example 99 we get invalid month message okay so this is how you use switch case and as I said in the beginning all of the problems that you can solve with switch case you can also solve with multiple if else conditions but sometimes if you write a lot of if else conditions that can make your code look bulky and hard to understand hard to maintain so if you need to write a lot of f Els conditions you should definitely consider using switch case instead but there are some important differences between if else statement and switch case statement and that is the following inside if else you can write different conditions and different different expressions for example you can say if a is greater than b then do something or if month is less than five then do this but in switch case you cannot do that so here inside each one of these cases you need to put exact value that this variable here can have and you cannot write expressions like you can in if else statement so that means that if else statement is more powerful it gives you more options but sometimes it is better to use switch case if you can of course because that will make your code easier to understand and easier to read for example if you need to write multiple if else statements then it is better to use switch case but that is possible only if you are checking the value of this variable against specific exact values that it can have and not some Expressions but if you just want to check one or two different values then it is completely okay and it is better and faster to write if else statement so if you don't understand F else then you can watch video that will be linked here and I will also put it in the description and then you can better understand what is if else and also the difference between switch case statement and if else statement so I hope that this video was helpful and that now you understand how to use switch case statement if you enjoyed it and if you want more videos like this give it a thumbs up and also if you
