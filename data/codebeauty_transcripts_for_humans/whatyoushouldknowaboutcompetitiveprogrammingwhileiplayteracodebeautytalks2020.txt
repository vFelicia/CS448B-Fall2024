00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel i am
00:03 - so excited for making this video and
00:05 - this video is going to be a little bit
00:07 - different than my previous videos
00:08 - because
00:09 - ever since i said that i like playing
00:12 - games
00:12 - i received so many questions about what
00:15 - kind of games do i like to play
00:16 - so i decided to overlay this video with
00:19 - a gameplay
00:21 - and i'm still not sure which one it is
00:22 - going to be probably
00:24 - terra or call of duty but you can
00:26 - already see that because the video has
00:28 - been edited
00:29 - and then as well i want to ask you guys
00:31 - for suggestions so
00:33 - what kind of games do you like to play
00:34 - and then which ones i should try please
00:37 - write that in the comments
00:38 - and one thing one disclaimer i only said
00:41 - that i like playing games not that i am
00:43 - good at it
00:44 - so for all those of you that are better
00:47 - than me
00:48 - uh please be gentle in the comments and
00:51 - then
00:51 - as well if you like this video and if
00:53 - you would like me to make more videos
00:54 - like this
00:55 - give it a thumbs up so that i can know
00:57 - and without further ado let's start with
01:00 - today's video
01:01 - so in this video i want to answer a
01:03 - question that i see very often
01:05 - and that is about competitive
01:07 - programming so i really want to share my
01:09 - thoughts about competitive programming
01:11 - now the main reason i think people are
01:13 - interested in competitive programming
01:15 - besides it being fun because it is fun
01:19 - but the more important reason is because
01:22 - they are aware
01:23 - that it is going to give them visibility
01:25 - and it is a great opportunity
01:27 - to be seen by some of the biggest
01:29 - companies out there like
01:31 - google microsoft amazon facebook
01:34 - apple as well you know so these type of
01:37 - companies are usually the ones
01:38 - that sponsor these events and then they
01:41 - use that opportunity
01:42 - to look for a talented people on those
01:45 - type of events
01:46 - and even if you are not recognized there
01:48 - participating in coding competitions
01:51 - is something that is going to give you a
01:52 - big advantage over
01:54 - other people if you apply for a certain
01:56 - job for example
01:58 - because competing having experience in
02:00 - competitive programming
02:02 - is something that is going to tell your
02:04 - future employer that you are someone who
02:06 - knows
02:07 - how to solve complicated problems but
02:09 - more importantly that you are someone
02:11 - who is really
02:12 - dedicated and passionate about what
02:14 - you're doing and that is something that
02:16 - is
02:17 - very desirable for you to have and that
02:20 - is going to give you a great advantage
02:22 - over other people if you apply for a
02:24 - certain job
02:25 - one of the questions that i get as well
02:27 - is what is the most recommended language
02:29 - to use for competitive programming
02:31 - and i would say that c plus plus is
02:34 - definitely going to be the number one
02:35 - choice
02:36 - it is the most recommended language to
02:38 - use for competitive programming
02:40 - and um if you're interested in c plus
02:43 - tutorials i made a lot of those so you
02:45 - can find those
02:46 - on my channel if you want they go from
02:48 - the
02:49 - very beginner absolute beginner level
02:52 - and then other languages that you can
02:53 - use are going to be
02:55 - java python ruby as well they are all
02:58 - good but i definitely think that c
03:02 - plus is going to be the number one
03:03 - choice because in competitive
03:05 - programming time execution time
03:07 - is very important it is crucial and
03:11 - since c plus is very close to the
03:13 - hardware it is going to be very fast to
03:16 - execute so that is the reason why c
03:18 - plus plus is number one choice for
03:19 - competitive programming
03:21 - after that i would probably say java but
03:24 - that's just a personal preference and
03:26 - then i think as well that
03:27 - java is going to be a little bit faster
03:29 - than python
03:31 - so it is going to be really up to you to
03:33 - decide
03:34 - as i said c plus plus is going to be
03:35 - number one choice
03:37 - but there is a con to this as well
03:39 - because c plus plus is going to be
03:41 - probably the hardest one
03:42 - to learn but as well there are a lot of
03:45 - problems in competitive programming
03:47 - where
03:48 - the same code in c plus is going to um
03:51 - execute within the given time limit and
03:53 - then that same code
03:55 - in java or python is going to fail to do
03:58 - that
03:58 - so that is one reason to learn c plus as
04:01 - well
04:02 - and then you have stl which is standard
04:05 - template
04:06 - library which is going to be very useful
04:08 - for solving these type of problems
04:10 - and a quick disclaimer that i want to
04:12 - make because i see a lot of questions on
04:15 - my channel about
04:16 - stl is i want to ask you guys what kind
04:19 - of videos would you like to see on my
04:20 - channel
04:21 - please write that in the comments down
04:24 - below
04:24 - and of course i cannot answer to all
04:27 - your questions i cannot make
04:28 - all of those videos but the ones that i
04:30 - can i will i will really
04:32 - try to make those now there are a few
04:35 - misconceptions that i hear very often
04:37 - about competitive programming
04:39 - and one of them is that you have to be
04:41 - good in competitive programming
04:43 - in order to get a developer job or that
04:46 - you have to be good in competitive
04:47 - programming if you want to be a good
04:49 - developer
04:50 - and that is really not the case you know
04:52 - that is not true
04:54 - what happens very often is that in
04:56 - competitive programming
04:58 - you are most of the time focused on
05:00 - solving particular problem in
05:02 - as little time as possible and then uh
05:05 - the problem that you are solving is
05:06 - usually
05:07 - explained very clearly so it is very
05:10 - clear
05:10 - what you have to do but in a software
05:13 - developer job software engineer job
05:15 - the situation is a little bit different
05:18 - meaning
05:18 - you usually will not be pressured in
05:21 - terms of time
05:22 - you very often have enough time to think
05:24 - through that problem and to even try
05:26 - different approaches and different
05:28 - solutions for that problem
05:30 - but then the problem itself is usually
05:33 - not going to be defined
05:34 - nearly as good as it is in competitive
05:37 - programming
05:38 - and that is because in competitive
05:39 - programming all the problems that you
05:41 - are solving
05:42 - already have a well-known solution the
05:45 - best solution for that problem
05:47 - somebody knows that solution you know a
05:49 - judge and then it is going to be up to
05:51 - you
05:52 - if you are smart enough to find that
05:53 - solution yourself
05:55 - in real life on the other hand there are
05:57 - very often problems that don't have
06:00 - the best possible solution and because
06:02 - of that because there is no the best
06:04 - solution
06:05 - you will very often have to sacrifice
06:07 - something in order to get
06:09 - something else and if you know that a
06:12 - solution for your problem already exists
06:14 - you will just use
06:15 - a library or you will copy and paste the
06:19 - code i mean
06:20 - i'm sorry for saying that but that is
06:22 - something that happens
06:23 - in real programming and i don't
06:26 - um i don't copy and paste the code i
06:29 - mean
06:30 - i would never copy and paste the code
06:34 - okay i cannot lie in english
06:37 - but one thing to keep in mind if you are
06:39 - working on a real-life programming
06:41 - project
06:42 - is code maintainability and that is
06:45 - because the code that you are working on
06:47 - other people are working on that code as
06:49 - well so they are adding
06:51 - uh their features they are adding new
06:53 - bug fixes to that code and then
06:55 - you will really have to incorporate your
06:57 - code into an existing
06:58 - application so if you don't write that
07:00 - code
07:01 - with maintainability in mind you will
07:04 - find yourself
07:04 - in a big problem very soon and that
07:08 - project is going to be something that is
07:09 - not going to be
07:10 - maintainable anymore so you will not be
07:13 - able to add any more features to that
07:15 - application
07:16 - unless you really keep in mind the code
07:19 - maintainability
07:20 - and then the fact that you are working
07:21 - with other people as well
07:23 - that has both its pros and then its
07:25 - costs so
07:26 - very often you can ask for help from
07:29 - other people if you need it
07:30 - and you will get it most of the time but
07:33 - then you will have to learn to
07:34 - compromise
07:35 - as well whereas in competitive
07:37 - programming it's going to be
07:39 - only you most of the time and another
07:42 - thing that i would like to mention as
07:43 - well
07:44 - is of a financial nature so can you earn
07:46 - money as a competitive programmer
07:49 - and the answer to that question is yes
07:51 - you can so you can
07:52 - participate in different competitions
07:55 - and if you rank high enough
07:56 - you can get money that way but it is not
07:59 - going to be recommended nor good to rely
08:01 - only on competitive programming as your
08:04 - only stream of income because it is
08:06 - going to be very inconsistent
08:08 - whereas if you worked for a company for
08:11 - example
08:12 - or you had a regular developer job you
08:15 - have that consistent salary every single
08:17 - month or
08:18 - every single week depending on how it is
08:21 - regulated in your country
08:23 - but as well if you're very good at
08:25 - competitive programming
08:27 - you will very often be approached by
08:30 - different companies with offers that are
08:32 - much higher than
08:33 - software developers usually get so i
08:35 - would say that it is good in those terms
08:38 - so the conclusion is that i wouldn't
08:40 - rely on competitive programming as my
08:42 - only income stream
08:44 - but as someone who likes to follow my
08:45 - own dreams i would advise the same to
08:47 - you so
08:48 - if you like it if you enjoy it
08:51 - and if you are good at it or you think
08:53 - that you can become good at it
08:54 - i would definitely say go for it you
08:57 - know because it is the same with my
08:59 - youtube channel
09:00 - i do it because i really enjoy it it is
09:02 - a dream of mine
09:03 - i don't rely on it to sustain me
09:06 - financially i do have a
09:08 - nine to five developer job which i do
09:10 - every single day and
09:12 - that is the reason why i cannot publish
09:14 - more videos than i do
09:15 - even though i would love to but
09:17 - sometimes life gets in the way
09:19 - but still i am very proud to see the
09:21 - type of people that i have on my channel
09:24 - and i'm very grateful for all the
09:26 - support that i get
09:27 - and that is really the reason why i love
09:30 - doing this why i love publishing videos
09:32 - on youtube
09:33 - and even though i have a good job now
09:35 - and a youtube channel which is on an
09:37 - incline path
09:39 - it wasn't always that way i can clearly
09:42 - remember
09:43 - all the problems and all the struggles
09:45 - that i went through
09:47 - all the days where i was like oh my god
09:50 - this is so hard and all those things
09:53 - that i had to go through in order to
09:55 - to be where i am right now and that is
09:58 - exactly the reason why i
09:59 - started my youtube channel so that i can
10:01 - share those experiences with you
10:04 - and that you don't have to go through
10:06 - the same problems and make the same
10:07 - mistakes that i did
10:09 - and it took me three years of university
10:12 - and
10:13 - four years working in the industry after
10:15 - that
10:16 - to finally master the courage to turn on
10:19 - the camera and start doing what i'm
10:20 - doing right now
10:22 - and if i had someone to guide me through
10:24 - this process
10:25 - it wouldn't be it wouldn't be nearly as
10:28 - long
10:28 - so if i can give you one advice one
10:31 - thing to take with you from this video
10:33 - that would be that every single day that
10:36 - you struggled every single day that you
10:37 - spent
10:38 - trying to learn something and trying to
10:40 - be better at something
10:42 - doesn't really matter if it is
10:44 - competitive programming or something
10:45 - else
10:46 - every single day is going to pay off so
10:50 - i hope that this video is going to help
10:52 - to some of you and motivate you
10:54 - and if it does please give it a thumbs
10:57 - up and
10:57 - subscribe to my channel as well you can
11:00 - follow me on my other social media
11:02 - and thanks for watching i'm going to see
11:04 - you in my next video
11:07 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to my channel i am so excited for making this video and this video is going to be a little bit different than my previous videos because ever since i said that i like playing games i received so many questions about what kind of games do i like to play so i decided to overlay this video with a gameplay and i'm still not sure which one it is going to be probably terra or call of duty but you can already see that because the video has been edited and then as well i want to ask you guys for suggestions so what kind of games do you like to play and then which ones i should try please write that in the comments and one thing one disclaimer i only said that i like playing games not that i am good at it so for all those of you that are better than me uh please be gentle in the comments and then as well if you like this video and if you would like me to make more videos like this give it a thumbs up so that i can know and without further ado let's start with today's video so in this video i want to answer a question that i see very often and that is about competitive programming so i really want to share my thoughts about competitive programming now the main reason i think people are interested in competitive programming besides it being fun because it is fun but the more important reason is because they are aware that it is going to give them visibility and it is a great opportunity to be seen by some of the biggest companies out there like google microsoft amazon facebook apple as well you know so these type of companies are usually the ones that sponsor

going to give you a big advantage over other people if you apply for a certain job for example because competing having experience in competitive programming is something that is going to tell your future employer that you are someone who knows how to solve complicated problems but more importantly that you are someone who is really dedicated and passionate about what you're doing and that is something that is very desirable for you to have and that is going to give you a great advantage over other people if you apply for a certain job one of the questions that i get as well is what is the most recommended language to use for competitive programming and i would say that c plus plus is definitely going to be the number one choice it is the most recommended language to use for competitive programming and um if you're interested in c plus tutorials i made a lot of those so you can find those on my channel if you want they go from the very beginner absolute beginner level and then other
