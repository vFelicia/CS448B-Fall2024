00:02 - don't need to know how your phone works
00:03 - internally you just need to know which
00:06 - button to press in programming this is
00:08 - called encapsulation notice how our
00:10 - smartphone class has these methods but
00:13 - we cannot use them directly because they
00:15 - are private that's why we encapsulate
00:17 - them into one public method so here we
00:20 - have achieved encapsulation by dividing
00:22 - our class into private and public parts
00:24 - and this has two benefits it protects
00:26 - private parts from unwanted changes that
00:28 - could cause bugs it provides a simple
00:31 - way to use complex internal logic of the
00:33 - class through public methods follow for
