00:00 - hi guys and welcome to my channel in
00:01 - this video we are going to talk about
00:03 - input and output in C here I have
00:07 - created a c console application so here
00:10 - we are going to write our code and I'm
00:12 - going to demonstrate how it all works
00:14 - and before we start I want to invite you
00:16 - to join my practical programming course
00:18 - where I will teach you how to create
00:20 - real world applications and I will
00:23 - prepare you to start a successful career
00:25 - as a software developer the course is
00:27 - beginner friendly so we will go from
00:29 - zero to Hero step by step and here I'm
00:32 - going to put some of the messages from
00:34 - other students who already started and
00:36 - who joined code Beauty Academy so that
00:38 - you can see the impact that this course
00:41 - has had on their lives in the course we
00:43 - will write C but I will teach you the
00:46 - skills that you can apply across all of
00:48 - the other programming languages so you
00:50 - will get career ready skills and expert
00:52 - support and we also have a community
00:55 - where you can collaborate and connect
00:57 - with other successful developers and the
00:59 - best part is that everything is on one
01:01 - place I have created the entire plan for
01:04 - you and the only thing that you need to
01:05 - do is to follow that plan and you are
01:08 - going to achieve your goals currently we
01:10 - have a special discount and you can use
01:11 - the link in the description to enroll
01:14 - try it out for 7 days and if you don't
01:16 - like it you can get a full refund so you
01:19 - have really nothing to lose but a lot to
01:22 - gain for more details visit the link in
01:25 - the description so with that being said
01:27 - let's continue with the topic of this
01:29 - video so what is input and what is
01:32 - output input is any type of data that
01:35 - your program receives from a user or any
01:38 - other external source for example if I
01:41 - type the text on the keyboard that is
01:43 - one form of an input if your program
01:46 - reads a text file that is also another
01:48 - type of input or if your program
01:50 - downloads some data from the internet
01:52 - and uses that data that is also a form
01:55 - of input uh also if your program
01:57 - receives some data from another program
01:59 - and use that data that is also another
02:02 - type of input and for beginners the most
02:05 - common type of input is keyboard input
02:08 - and that is what we are going to learn
02:09 - and demonstrate in this video on the
02:12 - other hand output is any data that your
02:14 - program writes for the user to see for
02:17 - example that can be a message that you
02:19 - want to show to your user that can be
02:21 - result of certain calculation or any
02:24 - other information that you want to show
02:27 - to your user all those are output and in
02:30 - this video we are going to learn how we
02:32 - can work with both input and output so
02:36 - let's say that we want to create a small
02:38 - program that asks the user to input his
02:41 - name so when the user inputs his name
02:43 - for example David the program says hello
02:46 - David welcome to the program so that is
02:49 - what we are going to do now let's create
02:51 - that program so first we want to write
02:54 - some text into the console and for that
02:56 - we use this command here console WR line
03:01 - and then here under these double
03:03 - quotation marks we put the text that we
03:06 - want to write into the console so here I
03:08 - will say enter your name like this and
03:13 - please don't forget this semicolon at
03:15 - the end that is very important okay so
03:18 - after we have done this we expect our
03:22 - user to type his name so I am going to
03:25 - say console do
03:28 - readline okay
03:30 - and this command is used in order to
03:33 - read the input the text that user is
03:37 - typing so what am I going to do with
03:39 - this text I am going to store it in a
03:41 - variable so I expect my user to enter
03:45 - his name so what I will do is I will
03:47 - create a variable of type string I will
03:50 - call it name and to this variable I'm
03:53 - going to assign any text that the user
03:57 - writes okay so after I have asked my
04:00 - user to enter his name and the user has
04:03 - entered his name I will have his name
04:05 - inside this variable here so then what I
04:08 - can do is again I can say console. right
04:12 - line and here I will say hello and what
04:16 - I want to print is the name of my user
04:20 - like this and then I want to add some
04:22 - additional text so I will say hello and
04:25 - then the name and here I will say
04:28 - welcome to the
04:30 - program like this okay so let's start
04:34 - this app okay first it says enter your
04:37 - name so let's type my name my name is
04:41 - Salina okay and if I press enter as you
04:44 - can see here it says hello Salina
04:46 - welcome to the program okay so this is
04:50 - one simple program that we have just
04:52 - created now let's create another program
04:55 - because I want to show you some very
04:56 - important things that you need to have
04:58 - in mind when you are working work with
05:00 - numbers and when you are entering
05:02 - numbers in your program so what I would
05:05 - like to create is a program that asks
05:08 - the user to enter first number to enter
05:11 - second number and then the program is
05:13 - going to sum those two and the program
05:16 - is going to print the result of that
05:18 - calculation so here I would like to
05:20 - invite you to pause the video and try to
05:22 - write your own solution and then you can
05:25 - watch my solution and we can do it
05:27 - together so if you want to create this
05:29 - on on your own please pause the video
05:31 - here and now we are going to do it
05:33 - together so let's delete this code here
05:36 - we don't need it and I will leave this
05:38 - line so as I said I want to ask my user
05:42 - to enter two numbers let's do that part
05:45 - first here I will say x so please enter
05:48 - the value for x okay and what I want to
05:52 - do is I want to create a variable called
05:54 - X and into this variable I will say
05:58 - console
05:59 - do readline so whatever the user enters
06:04 - I will store that inside this variable
06:07 - something very important that you should
06:09 - notice here is that immediately we get
06:11 - this red squiggly which means that we
06:14 - have an error and the error says cannot
06:17 - implicitly convert type string to int so
06:20 - why are we getting this error the reason
06:22 - for this error is that whatever your
06:25 - user is typing on the keyboard any input
06:28 - that he enters whether it is a number or
06:31 - a text that will be treated as a string
06:35 - but because we are trying to store that
06:37 - inside an integer variable you cannot
06:40 - store a string into an integer variable
06:43 - so what you need to do is if you know if
06:45 - you expect your user to enter an integer
06:49 - here you need to convert this string
06:51 - into an integer so here I'm going to say
06:55 - int. pars and inside parentheses I I
06:59 - will put this console read line command
07:03 - so here I'm saying hey read line read
07:07 - whatever the user has typed and then
07:10 - parse that into an integer and store it
07:13 - inside this x variable so with this we
07:16 - will get our first number now let's ask
07:19 - the user to enter the second number and
07:22 - let's do the same thing for the second
07:24 - number so here I will say Y and here I
07:27 - will create y variable and again I'm
07:30 - going to read the input that my user has
07:32 - typed and I will convert that into an
07:34 - integer and store it into this variable
07:37 - here so now I can simply say int sum and
07:41 - I can sum x + y and I will print the
07:46 - result so let's copy this Command
07:49 - console. right line what do I want to
07:52 - print I want to print x + y is equal 2
07:56 - and then here I will add some like this
08:00 - okay so let's start the program and test
08:03 - this okay it says please enter X I will
08:06 - say six and then enter y I will say four
08:11 - okay so the result is here x + y is
08:14 - equal to 10 there is an improvement that
08:16 - we can make to our program and that is
08:17 - the fact that currently our program is
08:20 - working with integer numbers which means
08:22 - that if the user tries to enter decimal
08:25 - point number then we are going to get an
08:28 - error so let's demonstrate that let me
08:31 - start the application again and here I
08:34 - will say for example
08:36 - 7.4 and immediately as you can see the
08:39 - input string was 7.4 and it was not in
08:43 - correct format which means that it
08:45 - cannot store this decimal point number
08:47 - into an integer variable so in order to
08:51 - solve this problem what you can do is
08:53 - instead of creating integer variables
08:55 - and parsing into an integer you can use
08:58 - double so here I will say double please
09:02 - create a variable called X and it will
09:04 - be of type double and here I will parse
09:07 - into double and then I will do the same
09:09 - thing for y so then naturally Su also
09:13 - needs to be of type double and now our
09:16 - program can work with decimal numbers as
09:18 - well so let's start this and let's test
09:21 - again okay so again I will say
09:24 - 7.4 and then it asks for the second
09:27 - number so let's say 2.1 one and the
09:30 - result is
09:32 - 9.5 okay and if you are not familiar
09:35 - with different data types and difference
09:37 - between integers double strings and so
09:39 - on then I recommend you to watch this
09:42 - video it will be also linked in the
09:43 - description and there you are going to
09:45 - learn about all of the important data
09:47 - types that we have in C and in
09:49 - programming in general there is another
09:51 - potential error that we can get in this
09:53 - program and that is if the user tries to
09:56 - enter text instead of a number so let's
10:00 - demonstrate that I will stop the program
10:02 - and start it again okay so here if I try
10:05 - to enter some text instead of a number
10:08 - let's say test and I press enter as you
10:12 - can see immediately it says the input
10:13 - string test was not incorrect format so
10:17 - the reason why we are getting this error
10:19 - is because our program expects a number
10:22 - but instead it is getting text so it
10:25 - does not know how to work with text and
10:27 - how to store text in inside double
10:30 - variable there are different ways to
10:32 - solve this problem and to prevent this
10:34 - from happening and we are going to learn
10:36 - more about that in one of my future
10:38 - videos so make sure to subscribe and
10:40 - also click the Bell icon so you will get
10:42 - notification when I publish that video I
10:45 - believe that is going to be enough for
10:47 - this video and again I would like to
10:49 - remind you that I have a practical
10:51 - programming course where I teach you how
10:52 - to create real world applications and I
10:55 - help you to get a job as a software
10:58 - developer and start a successful career
11:01 - So currently we have a special discount
11:03 - so don't miss this opportunity and if
11:05 - you want to learn programming click the
11:07 - link in the description and you are
11:09 - going to find more details so thank you
11:11 - very much for watching if you enjoyed
11:13 - this video give it a big thumbs up and I
11:15 - will see you in some other video bye

like this okay so let's start this app okay first it says enter your name so let's type my name my name is Salina okay and if I press enter as you can see here it says hello Salina welcome to the program okay so this is one simple program that we have just created now let's create another program because I want to show you some very important things that you need to have in mind when you are working work with numbers and when you are entering numbers in your program so what I would like to create is a program that asks the user to enter first number to enter second number and then the
