00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:01 - welcome to another video C++ for
00:04 - beginners and this video is going to be
00:06 - sort of a continuation to my previous
00:08 - video in which I showed you how you can
00:11 - draw rectangle shape using C++ and in
00:14 - this video I want to show you how you
00:16 - can draw triangle and reverse triangle
00:19 - shapes using C++ as well so if you are
00:22 - not familiar with how you can draw
00:24 - rectangle I would suggest you to watch
00:26 - that video first I'm going to link it
00:28 - here because in my opinion it is a bit
00:32 - more difficult to draw triangle than it
00:35 - is to draw our rectangle shapes so one
00:38 - more thing I have also created Instagram
00:41 - and Twitter account so if you are
00:43 - interested in how developer life looks
00:46 - like and also if you're interested in
00:48 - behind-the-scenes of these videos that I
00:49 - post in youtube make sure to follow me
00:52 - on my other social media so at true code
00:55 - beauty Instagram and Twitter accounts
00:57 - I'm going to put the link to those in
00:59 - the description of this video so without
01:01 - further ado let's start drawing our
01:03 - triangle shape so here I have the shape
01:06 - that we are going to draw in this video
01:09 - and there is going to be this
01:11 - equilateral triangle shape that I have
01:13 - here and there is a couple of things
01:16 - that I want to explain before we start
01:18 - to write code the first thing is going
01:20 - to be that this height our user really
01:23 - has to enter this height so we are going
01:26 - to let our user decide how many of these
01:28 - symbols are going to be on this side and
01:31 - this side and this side as well and the
01:34 - second thing is going to be that our
01:35 - user defines this symbol so whichever
01:38 - symbol our user wants to use in order to
01:41 - draw this shape we are going to use that
01:43 - symbol that he enters those are two
01:46 - things that we need from our user and
01:48 - then it is up to us to really think and
01:51 - figure out the algorithm that we are
01:54 - going to use in order to draw this
01:56 - triangle shape here so let me explain to
01:59 - you how we are going to do that so we
02:02 - are going to have two for loops and
02:04 - those are going to be nested for loop so
02:07 - if you're not familiar with for loop
02:09 - nesting I'm going to link my video on
02:12 - here so make sure to watch it so our
02:15 - outer for loop is the one that is going
02:17 - to control this height of a triangle so
02:21 - in this particular case it is going to
02:23 - have five iterations one two three four
02:26 - five and our inner for loop is the one
02:30 - that is going to control the width of
02:32 - this triangle and if you really look at
02:36 - this triangle you can notice that our
02:38 - outer for loop really goes from 1 up to
02:42 - the number that our user has entered so
02:44 - it has 5 iterations in this particular
02:47 - case because our user has entered 5 for
02:50 - the length of this triangle so for the
02:53 - length of its sides so that is the
02:56 - behavior of our outer for loop it goes
02:59 - from 1 up to 5 in this particular case
03:02 - and then the behavior of our inner for
03:04 - loop is going to be the following so in
03:06 - the first iteration of our outer for
03:08 - loop our inner for loop has only one
03:10 - iteration after that in the second
03:13 - iteration of outer for loop inner for
03:16 - loop has two iterations then in the
03:19 - third iteration of outer for loop inner
03:21 - for loop has 3 in a fourth iteration of
03:24 - outer for loop inner for loop has 4 and
03:27 - so on so that means that our inner for
03:30 - loop goes from 1 up to the current value
03:34 - of the counter of outer for loop so
03:37 - let's translate that into our C++ code
03:42 - let me return this picture here okay so
03:46 - before we start to write that algorithm
03:50 - I am going to create a variable which is
03:53 - going to hold the length that our user
03:55 - enters so I'm going to call that
03:56 - variable length okay and then let's
04:00 - write out a message to the user so that
04:03 - he knows that he should enter length
04:06 - like this and let's store the value in
04:11 - our length variable so that is the first
04:14 - thing that we need from our user and
04:16 - then the second thing is going to be a
04:19 - symbol so there is going to be of type
04:21 - char
04:24 - like this so I'm going right out Oh see
04:28 - out symbol like this so that our user
04:34 - knows that you should enter symbol as
04:36 - well and let's store that symbol and our
04:40 - symbol variable so after we have
04:43 - acquired these two things from our user
04:45 - let's translate the algorithm that I
04:47 - just explained into C++ code so as I
04:52 - said we are going to have two for loops
04:53 - outer for loop which is going to have
04:57 - countered that I'm going to call let's
04:59 - say I and that outer for loop it's
05:03 - counter goes from 1 up to the value that
05:07 - our user has entered and it increases by
05:10 - 1 in each iteration okay so I'm going to
05:14 - say I is equal to 1 and then I is I is
05:18 - less than or equal to length so going
05:22 - that our user has entered and then
05:24 - please increment that I in each
05:27 - iteration so that is going to be outer
05:30 - for loop and then inner for loop is
05:33 - going to go from 1 up to the current
05:37 - value of outer for loops counter so in
05:41 - the first iteration is going to execute
05:43 - only once so this main to have only one
05:45 - iteration in the second iteration of
05:48 - outer for loop it is going to execute
05:50 - twice in the third it is going to
05:53 - execute three times four times five
05:55 - times so how we are going to write that
05:59 - we are going to say for int and then our
06:02 - inner for loops counter I'm going to
06:05 - called J and J goes from 1 up to the
06:10 - value of I so up to the value of outer
06:15 - for loops counter and it increases by 1
06:20 - as well in each iteration and in each
06:23 - iteration it has to write out this
06:25 - symbol that our user has entered so
06:27 - let's say C out simple like this okay
06:32 - and then there is one more thing that I
06:34 - want to explain and that is going to be
06:36 - after
06:37 - each iteration of outer for loop really
06:40 - the next iteration starts in a new line
06:42 - so we are going to write that here here
06:48 - I'm sorry so at the end of our for loop
06:51 - our outer for loop we are going to say C
06:54 - out and line okay and now if I run this
07:01 - program it asks for length I'm going to
07:06 - say that length is let's say Phi and
07:08 - then symbol is going to be start symbol
07:11 - and as you can see it has really written
07:14 - out a triangle that has the length five
07:18 - of these symbols that our user has
07:20 - entered and there is one more thing that
07:22 - I want to do in order to format this
07:24 - shape here to be a bit prettier and that
07:28 - is going to be really to add a function
07:33 - here which is going to assign to each of
07:36 - these symbols that our user enters so
07:38 - that our for loop writes out width of
07:42 - two fields and that is going to be done
07:45 - using a function that is called set W
07:48 - meaning set width and this function here
07:52 - is going to give the space of two fields
07:56 - to the symbol that comes after it and in
07:59 - order to use this function here we have
08:01 - to include its library and that is going
08:04 - to be IO manop library so I'm going to
08:07 - say include like this
08:10 - io medic oh okay
08:13 - and now this underlined has went away so
08:18 - if I run my program once more and I
08:23 - enter let's say for length six and then
08:25 - for a symbol I enter this this symbol
08:30 - here as you can see our triangle shape
08:33 - looks better now so it has the height or
08:37 - actually the length of six of these
08:40 - symbols that our user has entered and it
08:42 - has also used this symbol here in order
08:44 - to draw this triangle shape and there is
08:48 - one more thing that I want to show you
08:49 - so at the beginning
08:51 - this video I promised that I'm going to
08:53 - teach you how you can draw triangle
08:55 - shape and then reversed triangle shape
08:58 - as well so there is one very beautiful
09:02 - thing about programming and that is
09:03 - going to be code reusability and about
09:05 - real code reusability you are going to
09:07 - learn when we learn about classes and
09:10 - functions and when I make my videos on
09:13 - functions I'm going to link that video
09:16 - here so make sure to watch it because
09:18 - functions really are one of the most
09:20 - important things that you have to
09:22 - understand not only for C++ programming
09:24 - but for programming in general so make
09:27 - sure to watch that video and let's say
09:30 - that for now we are only going to really
09:32 - adjust this code here so we are going to
09:35 - modify it a little bit in order to draw
09:37 - this shape here so if you look at these
09:42 - two shapes you can really notice
09:43 - similarities and what are those so this
09:47 - inner for loop behaves about the same in
09:50 - both of these triangles but there is one
09:53 - key difference and that is going to be
09:54 - that in this triangle shape our outer
09:57 - for loop counts from 1 to 5 and then in
10:02 - this reference triangle our outer for
10:05 - loop really counts from 5 to 1 so if we
10:08 - modify that we are going to have this
10:12 - reverse triangle so let me move these
10:15 - and then I'm going to really copy this
10:19 - here so I'm going to use ctrl C and then
10:23 - ctrl we and now let's really add a
10:26 - couple of end lines between these two
10:30 - okay like this and then let's really
10:38 - modify this triangle shape that we have
10:40 - just explained and draw and as you could
10:44 - see on this image here our outer for
10:49 - loop counts from 5 to 1 which means from
10:52 - the side that our user has entered from
10:54 - 1 so that means that if we change our
10:57 - outer for loop we should get that
11:00 - reverse triangle shape
11:02 - so it goes from the length like this and
11:06 - it really goes while our eye is greater
11:11 - than or equal to one and that our eye
11:14 - decreases in each iteration so it
11:17 - decrements and now if I run my program
11:22 - it asks me for length let's say that
11:25 - length is going to be 5 and then symbol
11:28 - is going to be lets say this plus symbol
11:31 - and when I pressed enter we have gotten
11:35 - both of these triangle shapes so this
11:37 - one that we have drawn first and then
11:40 - this reverse triangle shape as well I
11:43 - hope that now you have really seen the
11:46 - real beauty of programming you learn
11:48 - some basics and then you can use those
11:51 - basics in the most creative ways that
11:53 - you can think of so I hope that you like

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video C++ for beginners and this video is going to be sort of a continuation to my previous video in which I showed you how you can draw rectangle shape using C++ and in this video I want to show you how you can draw triangle and reverse triangle shapes using C++ as well so if you are not familiar with how you can draw rectangle I would suggest you to watch that video first I'm going to link it here because in my opinion it is a bit more difficult to draw triangle than it is to draw our rectangle shapes so one more thing I have also created Instagram and Twitter account so if you are interested in how developer life looks like and also if you're interested in behindthescenes of these videos that I post in youtube make sure to follow me on my other social media so at true code beauty Instagram and Twitter accounts I'm going to put the link to those in the description of this video so without further ado let's start drawing our triangle shape so here I have the shape that we are going to draw in this video and there is going to be this equilateral triangle shape that I have here and there is a couple of things that I want to explain before we start to write code the first thing is going to be that this height our user really has to enter this height so we are going to let our user decide how many of these symbols are going to be on this side and this side and this side as well and the second thing is going to be that our user defines this symbol so whichever symbol our user wants to use in order to draw this shape we are going to use that symbol that he enters those are two things that we need from our user and then it is up to us to really think and figure out the algorithm that we are going to use in order to draw this triangle shape here so let me explain to you how we are going to do that so we are going to have two for loops and those are going to be nested for loop so if you're not familiar with for loop nesting I'm going to link my video on here so make sure to watch it so our outer for loop is the one that is going to control this height of a triangle so in this particular case it is going to have five iterations one two three four five and our inner for loop is the one that is going to control the width of this triangle and if you really look at this triangle you can notice that our outer for loop really goes from 1 up to the number that our user has entered so it has 5 iterations in this particular case because our user has entered 5 for the length of this triangle so for the length of its sides so that is the behavior of our outer for loop it goes from 1 up to 5 in this particular case and then the behavior of our inner for loop is going to be the following so in the first iteration of our outer for loop our inner for loop has only one iteration after that in the second iteration of outer for loop inner for loop has two iterations then in the third iteration of outer for loop inner for loop has 3 in a fourth iteration of outer for loop inner for loop has 4 and so on so that means that our inner for loop goes from 1 up to the current value of the counter of outer for loop so let's translate that into our C++ code let me return this picture here okay so before we start to write that algorithm I am going to create a variable which is going to hold the length that our user enters so I'm going to call that variable length okay and then let's write out a message to the user so that he knows that he should enter length like this and let's store the value in our length variable so that is the first thing that we need from our user and then the second thing is going to be a symbol so there is going to be of type char like this so I'm going right out Oh see out symbol like this so that our user knows that you should enter symbol as well and let's store that symbol and our symbol variable so after we have acquired these two things from our user let's translate the algorithm that I just explained into C++ code so as I said we are going to have two for loops outer for loop which is going to have countered that I'm going to call let's say I and that outer for loop it's counter goes from 1 up to the value that our user has entered and it increases by 1 in each iteration okay so I'm going to say I is equal to 1 and then I is I is less than or equal to length so going that our user has entered and then please increment that I in each iteration so that is going to be outer for loop and then inner for loop is going to go from 1 up to the current value of outer for loops counter so in the first iteration is going to execute only once so this main to have only one iteration in the second iteration of outer for loop it is going to execute twice in the third it is going to execute three times four times five times so how we are going to write that we are going to say for int and then our inner for loops counter I'm going to called J and J goes from 1 up to the value of I so up to the value of outer for loops counter and it increases by 1 as well in each iteration and in each iteration it has to write out this symbol that our user has entered so let's say C out simple like this okay and then there is one more thing that I want to explain and that is going to be after each iteration of outer for loop really the next iteration starts in a new line so we are going to write that here here I'm sorry so at the end of our for loop our outer for loop we are going to say C out and line okay and now if I run this program it asks for length I'm going to say that length is let's say Phi and then symbol is going to be start symbol and as you can see it has really written out a triangle that has the length five of these symbols that our user has entered and there is one more thing that I want to do in order to format this shape here to be a bit prettier and that is going to be really to add a function here which is going to assign to each of these symbols that our user enters so that our for loop writes out width of two fields and that is going to be done using a function that is called set W meaning set width and this function here is going to give the space of two fields to the symbol that comes after it and in order to use this function here we have to include its library and that is going to be IO manop library so I'm going to say include like this io medic oh okay and now this underlined has went away so if I run my program once more and I enter let's say for length six and then for a symbol I enter this this symbol here as you can see our triangle shape looks better now so it has the height or actually the length of six of these symbols that our user has entered and it has also used this symbol here

in both of these triangles but there is one key difference and that is going to be that in this triangle shape our outer for loop counts from 1 to 5 and then in this reference triangle our outer for loop really counts from 5 to 1 so if we modify that we are going to have this reverse triangle so let me move these and then I'm going to really copy this here so I'm going to use ctrl C and then ctrl we and now let's really add a couple of end lines between these two okay like this and then let's really modify this triangle shape that we have just explained and draw and as you could see on this image here our outer for loop counts from 5 to 1 which means from the side that our user has entered from 1 so that means that if we change our outer for loop we should get that reverse triangle shape so it goes from the length like this and it really goes while our eye is greater than or equal to one and that our eye decreases in each iteration so it decrements and now if I run my program it asks me for length let's say that length is going to be 5 and then symbol is going to be lets say this plus symbol and when I pressed enter we have gotten both of these triangle shapes so this one that we have drawn first and then this reverse triangle shape as well I hope that now you have really seen the real beauty of programming you learn some basics and then you can use those basics in the most
