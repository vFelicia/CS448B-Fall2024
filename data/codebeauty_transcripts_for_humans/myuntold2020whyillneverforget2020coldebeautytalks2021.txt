00:14 - so
00:16 - 2020 was a year of finding myself
00:19 - in the midst of pandemic and all the
00:21 - unfortunate events that came with it
00:24 - i decided to open a youtube channel
00:27 - seeing people losing their jobs and
00:29 - students not being able to go to schools
00:31 - and knowing that all of them will be
00:33 - looking for some sort of knowledge that
00:35 - will give them a promise of a better
00:37 - future
00:38 - a work that they can do from their home
00:40 - and knowing that i can do something to
00:42 - help
00:43 - that gave me a strong sense of purpose
00:45 - and it gave a meaning to all the free
00:47 - time that i had
00:49 - on that journey i have personally
00:51 - learned so much
00:52 - and when i look back at my first video i
00:55 - think to myself
00:56 - oh god i would do this so much better
00:59 - now
01:00 - i was so shy and i was forgetting every
01:03 - second word
01:04 - but you know what it is important to
01:07 - start
01:08 - and seeing the difference from a few
01:10 - months ago and now
01:11 - is what makes me realize that i have
01:13 - made progress
01:14 - myself and that i have learned so much
01:17 - from you
01:18 - i know that a lot of you who are
01:20 - watching my channel are struggling with
01:22 - programming
01:23 - i know that feeling when a programming
01:25 - problem gives you a headache
01:26 - when you don't feel smart enough or you
01:29 - feel like giving up
01:30 - i have been there i've experienced it as
01:32 - well i still do
01:34 - and i'm sharing this because i want you
01:36 - to see that side of me as well
01:38 - i want you to see that i am someone that
01:40 - you can relate to
01:42 - more than you think and the best advice
01:44 - that i can give you
01:46 - is to be kind to yourself to understand
01:48 - that there is a learning curve and that
01:50 - it is normal to struggle
01:52 - and don't forget about the people that
01:54 - your code affects
01:56 - it's sometimes easy to see just numbers
01:58 - and letters and code
01:59 - but when you consider the impact that
02:01 - your application is making
02:03 - on the life of each person who is using
02:05 - it
02:06 - that gives you a sense of purpose which
02:08 - is much greater than just
02:09 - writing code sitting in front of a
02:12 - camera
02:12 - and talking to 10 000 people for someone
02:15 - who is a programmer who is introverted
02:17 - by nature
02:18 - it's not easy but i do it for you
02:21 - reading all the nice comments and seeing
02:23 - that people actually like my videos is
02:25 - what makes me going
02:27 - so thank you for that thank you for
02:29 - every like
02:30 - and share and comment and i appreciate
02:33 - so much
02:33 - each one of you who are subscribed to my
02:35 - channel and who watch my videos
02:38 - you guys have given me the voice and the
02:40 - opportunity to speak and stand up for
02:42 - the things that i believe in
02:44 - i managed to raise interest for
02:46 - programming among young kids in my
02:47 - country
02:48 - giving them the opportunity to learn
02:50 - things that will help them to have a
02:52 - better future tomorrow
02:54 - encouraging more girls to enter this
02:56 - industry because it doesn't really
02:58 - matter your gender
02:59 - your race age the way you look those
03:02 - things don't really matter
03:04 - as long as you are using your knowledge

03:08 - meaningful with it
03:09 - the world will appreciate it and you
03:11 - will feel happy
03:13 - and that is the only thing that truly
03:15 - matters

03:23 - countries
