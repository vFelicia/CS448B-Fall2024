00:00 - in this video I'm explaining one of the
00:02 - data structures that every developer
00:03 - should know about an array array is type
00:06 - of collection that has fixed size and it
00:08 - stores elements one after the other in
00:10 - memory every element has an index so you
00:13 - can access each element by using the
00:14 - name of the array and the index of the
00:16 - element you can imagine an array as a
00:19 - garage that has fixed number of parking
00:21 - places let's say 10. they are all one
00:23 - after the other and each parking place
00:25 - has an index so you can Traverse the
00:27 - entire garage and find any car that you
00:29 - want very fast but adding more than 10
00:32 - cars is impossible because the garage
00:34 - has fixed size and in order to add more
00:36 - cars you would have to buy a bigger
00:38 - garage and then move all of your
00:40 - existing cars there and then add new
00:42 - cars and this is very time consuming
00:44 - this is the main characteristic of array
00:46 - data structure traversing it and
00:48 - searching data inside an array is very
00:50 - fast but if you want to write a program
00:52 - that will often add new elements and
00:54 - remove existing elements then it is
00:56 - better to use a different data structure
00:58 - for example a linked list
