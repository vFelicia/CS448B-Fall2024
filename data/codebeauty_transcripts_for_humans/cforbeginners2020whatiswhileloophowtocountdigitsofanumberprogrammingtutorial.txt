00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:02 - welcome to another video of C++ for
00:04 - beginners and before we start this video
00:07 - make sure to subscribe to my channel and
00:09 - also click that now I can so that you
00:12 - are notified when I publish my next
00:13 - video because on this channel I'm
00:15 - teaching you how you can become an
00:17 - excellent programmer and that's what you
00:20 - want you really want to build great
00:22 - applications and have a good job and a
00:24 - lot more benefits that come with being
00:26 - good in this job so without further ado
00:29 - let's see what we're going to do in this
00:31 - video today I want to talk about while
00:34 - loop and I have already made one video
00:37 - on this topic any if you haven't watched
00:39 - that I'm going to link it here so make
00:42 - sure to do so and why I'm making this
00:44 - video because I really believe that
00:45 - watching one video and doing only one
00:48 - example is not going to be enough for
00:50 - you to really master a certain concept
00:53 - it wasn't for me it is not going to be
00:55 - for you as well and that is completely
00:56 - ok so we are going to show you how this
01:00 - one loop is used on one more example and
01:02 - the program that I want to build today
01:04 - is going to be a program that has to
01:07 - count how many digits the number
01:09 - contains so our user is going to enter a
01:12 - number and then we are going to write a
01:14 - program that is going to count how many
01:16 - digits there are in that number so let
01:20 - me copy the text of that program like
01:24 - this and it says count digits of a
01:29 - number so let's do the first thing that
01:33 - we know that we have to do and that we
01:35 - know how to do as well so that is going
01:38 - to be write out a message to our user so
01:40 - that he enters that number and then also
01:42 - allow him to enter that number so I'm
01:45 - going to say C out and then I'm going to
01:48 - say number like this and then I'm going
01:52 - to allow my user to enter that number
01:54 - before I can enter it I have to really
01:58 - declare a variable that is going to hold
01:59 - that number so here I'm going to say int
02:02 - number like this and then here after we
02:06 - have written out this message to our
02:08 - user we are going to say C in
02:12 - number like this so after our user has
02:16 - entered his number we really have stored
02:19 - it in our number variable and now we are
02:22 - going to write out the program that is
02:23 - going to count the number of digits of
02:26 - this number here so let's first see one
02:31 - specific situation that can happen and
02:34 - that is going to be when our user enters
02:36 - number zero so this number holds value
02:39 - of zero and in that situation I'm just
02:42 - going to write out a condition so I'm
02:43 - going to say if my number like this is
02:48 - equal to zero in that situation is
02:51 - situation please just write out a
02:53 - message to my user like this you have
02:57 - entered zero okay like this and I don't
03:05 - need semicolon here this looks better so
03:09 - this here is a situation where our user
03:12 - has entered number zero and in that case
03:15 - we just want to write out that he has
03:17 - entered zero and now we are left with
03:19 - the main problem of this task and that
03:22 - is to count the digits of the number
03:24 - that our user has entered and that part
03:27 - I'm going to put in my else block like
03:30 - this and if you are not familiar with if
03:33 - statements make sure to watch that video
03:35 - it's going to be liked here so here in
03:39 - this else block I want to write the
03:41 - program that is going to count the
03:42 - digits of a number which is not zero
03:45 - definitely because if we come here that
03:47 - our number is definitely not zero so how
03:50 - we are going to do that well let me show
03:54 - you the algorithm on an example let's
03:56 - say that our user is going to enter a
03:58 - number one three to five for example
04:01 - that is the number that our user enters
04:03 - so how we are going to count the digits
04:05 - of this number
04:07 - well first we are going to have a
04:09 - variable that is going to be called
04:11 - counter like this and initially we are
04:15 - going to set the value of that counter
04:17 - to zero so that is initial count of our
04:20 - digits of number and then we are going
04:24 - to use while
04:25 - to iterate through all the digits of
04:28 - this number and in each iteration we are
04:31 - going to do following so we are going to
04:33 - come here and then we are going to say
04:36 - okay take this last digit of my number
04:39 - and really remove it I don't need it
04:42 - and as well increase the number that my
04:46 - counter is holding so increase the
04:48 - number of digits because we have removed
04:51 - one digit and then in the next iteration
04:53 - we are coming here and we are as well
04:55 - saying okay so take that last digit and
04:58 - increase my counter like this and then
05:02 - in the next iteration take the last
05:04 - digit increase counter and in the next
05:09 - as well take last digit increase counter
05:13 - and then when we come next time we
05:16 - really have nothing more to count so
05:19 - there are no more digits left our number
05:22 - and this situation here is going to be
05:23 - equal to zero and then we are going to
05:26 - know that there is nothing else to count
05:29 - and then we are really going to leave
05:31 - our while loop and we are going to write
05:33 - out the value that our counter variable
05:35 - is holding which is at this situation
05:37 - for so let me show you how how we can do
05:40 - that in our code so I'm going to delete
05:43 - this part here we don't need it anymore
05:46 - and then here I'm going to write out the
05:49 - following so as we explained already
05:51 - first thing that we need to do is we
05:53 - need to create a variable that is going
05:55 - to be called counter like this or a
05:58 - digits counter however you prefer and
06:02 - that variable I'm going to assign a
06:04 - value of zero initially and after we
06:08 - have created this variable here now we
06:10 - need our wild loop so while like this
06:16 - and then inside these parenthesis here
06:18 - we really write out a condition that our
06:21 - while loop is going to check each time
06:23 - that it wants to run each time that it
06:26 - wants to iterate and that condition here
06:28 - is really going to be please check
06:31 - whether my number is greater than zero
06:34 - okay so in any case where our number is
06:38 - greater than zero
06:39 - our while loop is going to execute this
06:42 - block of code that I put inside these
06:44 - parentheses and what we are going to put
06:48 - inside these parentheses well as we
06:50 - already explained previously first thing
06:54 - that we need to do is we need to say
06:56 - number is equal to number divided by 10
07:01 - and what this line of code is going to
07:05 - do well let me show you that on an
07:08 - example let's say that our number so our
07:11 - number holds the value of 1 2 3 like
07:14 - this and this line here really says the
07:19 - following it says please do this
07:20 - expression here so calculated and
07:23 - whatever this expression here results in
07:25 - a signed edge to my number variable and
07:28 - one two three so 123 3 divided by 10
07:32 - because this here is whole number so
07:35 - it's integer and this here is whole
07:37 - number as well the result is going to be
07:39 - whole number and that is going to be 12
07:42 - we're at twelve point three but but
07:45 - because a result has to be the whole
07:46 - number that point three part is just
07:48 - deleted bye-bye
07:50 - so then this 12 in this situation is
07:53 - going to be assigned to our number
07:55 - variable okay so that means that this
08:00 - number divided by 10 is really going to
08:03 - take away that last digit which we have
08:05 - previously explained so I'm going to
08:08 - delete this part here okay and this one
08:13 - of code there is really one more way to
08:15 - write this so write the same thing so
08:18 - I'm going to comment this here and I'm
08:20 - going to write out number divided equal
08:23 - so number are like this okay okay so
08:30 - this line of code here and this line of
08:33 - code here are exactly the same this is
08:35 - just shorter way to write this here and
08:38 - this looks prettier to me but you can
08:40 - leave whichever of these two you prefer
08:43 - okay so after we have taken the last
08:46 - digit from our number what we are left
08:48 - to do is to increase our counter
08:50 - variable by one
08:52 - so we can do that using our increment
08:54 - operator here so this part of code has
08:58 - really in each iteration taken away one
09:01 - digit and then increased counter
09:04 - variable so what we should do now after
09:08 - our while loop finishes we should really
09:11 - write out how many number how many
09:13 - digits are a number contained so we are
09:17 - going to write out count number contains
09:23 - this and then let's write out the value
09:27 - that our counter variable is holding
09:30 - like this what is this oh it says card
09:35 - instead of C out okay and then let's
09:41 - write out just digits like this okay so
09:48 - our number contains whatever our counter
09:51 - variable is holding digits so now I can
09:56 - really run my program and let's do that
10:00 - so it asks us to enter a number let's
10:03 - enter a number 1 2 3 for example and it
10:07 - says that our number contains 3 digits
10:11 - which is correct
10:13 - so let's very quickly explain one more
10:16 - time how this has happened so I'm going
10:20 - to stop my program and I'm going to say
10:23 - here that our user has entered number
10:26 - let's say 1 2 3 so our program in this
10:30 - situation comes here to our while loop
10:33 - and it says please check whether the
10:35 - number that our user has entered is
10:36 - greater than 0 and that number is 1 2 3
10:39 - so 123 which is greater than 0 so that
10:43 - our program can really start executing
10:45 - this while loop so it enters here and
10:48 - then it comes to the first line of this
10:51 - while loop and it says please do this
10:53 - expression here and this expression here
10:55 - really just takes the last digit of our
10:58 - number away and that is going to be 3 so
11:01 - we are going to take that away and then
11:04 - the next
11:04 - that needs to happen is increase the
11:06 - value of our counter since previously
11:09 - the value of our counter was 0 now the
11:12 - value is going to be increased by 1 so
11:14 - that is going to be 1 and after that our
11:17 - program comes here and because of the
11:19 - nature of the while loop
11:20 - it goes back here it checks again
11:22 - whether our number is greater than 0 our
11:25 - number is 12 now so the one digit has
11:27 - been taken away so that is still greater
11:30 - than zero so then our number really
11:32 - comes here and then does this line of
11:35 - code again so it says again please take
11:37 - away one digit from my number so then it
11:40 - takes away this two part and then it
11:44 - comes here it says now increase my
11:47 - counter because you have taken away one
11:49 - digit and that is going to be 2 now
11:51 - after that our program comes here and
11:53 - that goes back here checks whether our
11:56 - number so whether our 1 is greater than
11:58 - 0 it says yes and then it comes here and
12:01 - it says please divide my number by 10 so
12:04 - take away that one digit so that one
12:06 - digit is taken away and we are left with
12:10 - 0 and then our counter is increased by 1
12:13 - and then we are really going to come
12:16 - here again and then our program goes
12:18 - back and says please check whether my
12:20 - number so whether 0 is greater than 0
12:23 - and then our program says no it is not
12:26 - so our while loop is not executed any
12:29 - more and then it comes here instead and
12:32 - it writes out that our number contains 3
12:36 - digits and there is one more situation
12:39 - that I want show you and that is going
12:41 - to be what is going to happen in a
12:44 - situation where our user decides to
12:46 - enter a negative number so let's run our
12:49 - program and let's see how our program is
12:51 - going to behave in that situation so now
12:54 - I'm going to enter a number of minus 3 3
12:57 - 5 for example and you see that our
13:00 - program writes out that our number
13:02 - contains zero digits why has that
13:04 - happened because our program has come
13:06 - here so it has increased our counter it
13:11 - has actually assigned our counter a
13:12 - value of 0
13:14 - and then it has come here and it is it
13:16 - has really tried to check whether our
13:18 - number is greater than zero but because
13:21 - our number is minus three three five
13:23 - that is not greater than zero so our
13:25 - program then really is not going to
13:27 - execute this block here but it's just
13:30 - going to go here directly so then it's
13:33 - going to write out that our number
13:35 - contains and the value that it has
13:37 - assigned to our counter here which is
13:39 - zero
13:40 - so our number contains zero digits and
13:42 - that's the message that you see here so
13:45 - that is the explanation of this behavior
13:47 - and we need to solve that now how we are
13:50 - going to solve that well it's pretty
13:52 - simple so here when we come to this else
13:55 - block in this situation this 14th line
13:59 - of code we are really sure that our
14:01 - number is not equal to 0 because we have
14:03 - checked that here but here we really
14:06 - don't know whether our number is less
14:08 - than 0 or greater than 0 so here we
14:12 - really have to check whether our number
14:14 - is less than 0 and if it is we really
14:17 - need to get the absolute value of our
14:20 - number which means if it is negative we
14:22 - have to convert it to the positive
14:24 - number so here I'm going to write out
14:27 - the phone link condition so I'm going to
14:29 - say please check if my number is less
14:34 - than 0 like this and then if this here
14:37 - results is true I'm going to write out
14:40 - here a way for my program to convert
14:43 - this number in case that it is negative
14:45 - into a positive number and how we can do
14:48 - that well we can really multiply that
14:51 - number by -1 so we can see number is
14:55 - equal to minus 1 times number like this
15:01 - okay so now if I run my program and if I
15:08 - enter value of minus 2 3 6 for example
15:12 - our program now writes out that our
15:15 - number contains 3 3 digits which is
15:17 - correct so how has this happened our
15:20 - program has come here it has really
15:22 - checked that our number is less than 0
15:25 - and then it has
15:27 - come here and it is sad please do this
15:29 - expression here and then assign that to
15:31 - my number so minus one times two minus
15:35 - two three six those minuses are going to
15:38 - really convert into plus sign and then
15:41 - one times 236 is going to be 236 and
15:45 - after that we are going to do the same
15:47 - logic here so we are going to write out
15:50 - that our program that our number
15:52 - contains three digits which is correct
15:54 - answer okay so that is the one situation
16:01 - that I wanted to explain and there is
16:02 - also another situation that I want to
16:04 - explain to you and that is what is going
16:06 - to happen in the following situation
16:08 - here so let's see let me enter a number
16:12 - that is very very very large
16:15 - I cannot even read this number here so
16:18 - how our program is going to behave in
16:21 - death in this situation here we write it
16:23 - in the comments down below please before
16:25 - I execute this here and now if I press
16:28 - ENTER what is going to happen well our
16:33 - program has list a little bit and after
16:36 - that it has written out that our number
16:37 - contains ten digits but this is
16:40 - definitely more than ten why has this
16:43 - happened if you are not familiar with
16:46 - datatypes and overflow and concept
16:50 - concepts that I have already talked
16:52 - about in one of my videos I am going to
16:55 - link that video here so make sure to
16:57 - watch the video and now I am very
16:59 - quickly going to explain what has
17:00 - happened here but make sure to watch
17:02 - that video so when we have entered this
17:05 - number here let me stop this program and
17:09 - let me put let's see let me put a
17:12 - breakpoint here and now I'm going to run
17:16 - my program and what this breakpoint is
17:18 - going to do it's really going to stop
17:20 - the execution of my program at this line
17:22 - here and we haven't talked about
17:25 - breakpoints or debugging programs
17:28 - previously but if you want me to include
17:30 - that in one of my next videos make sure
17:32 - to write it in the comments down below
17:34 - because I really believe that it is
17:35 - important for you to see how your
17:38 - program is executed line by line
17:40 - to be able to follow it and and that way
17:42 - you can really discover any bugs in any
17:45 - situations that are tricky and that
17:47 - aren't happening inside your program so
17:49 - you can see and control that better so I
17:53 - have put here a breakpoint and let's now
17:55 - enter a number that is going to be a
17:58 - very large number okay so if I press
18:03 - ENTER now you see that my program has
18:06 - really stopped the execution here on
18:08 - this line here so after I have entered
18:11 - my number and then even though I have
18:14 - entered a number that is pretty large
18:17 - let's hover over this number variable
18:20 - you can see that it is holding a value
18:22 - of 2 billion and 147 million in
18:25 - something so this value here is
18:28 - definitely not equal to this value here
18:31 - but because our program has really
18:34 - gotten the value that is much larger
18:36 - than the maximum value that our int
18:39 - variable can hold it has really assigned
18:42 - the maximum amount that our int can hold
18:45 - to our number variable so that is what
18:48 - has happened in this program and if I
18:51 - click continue now you can see that our
18:53 - program writes out that our number
18:55 - contains 10 digits because it really was
18:58 - holding a 10 digit number so that is the
19:02 - maximum amount that our int type can
19:04 - hold ok so that is the last situation
19:08 - that I wanted to explain to you and I
19:11 - hope that you like this video and if you
19:14 - have learned something new make sure to
19:16 - subscribe to my channel share it with
19:18 - all your friends anyone who would like
19:20 - to learn programming thanks for watching
19:22 - and I'm going to see you in my next
19:24 - video bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another video of C++ for beginners and before we start this video make sure to subscribe to my channel and also click that now I can so that you are notified when I publish my next video because on this channel I'm teaching you how you can become an excellent programmer and that's what you want you really want to build great applications and have a good job and a lot more benefits that come with being good in this job so without further ado let's see what we're going to do in this video today I want to talk about while loop and I have already made one video on this topic any if you haven't watched that I'm going to link it here so make sure to do so and why I'm making this video because I really believe that watching one video and doing only one example is not going to be enough for you to really master a certain concept it wasn't for me it is not going to be for you as well and that is completely ok so we are going to show you how this one loop is used on one more example and the program that I want to build today is going to be a program that has to count how many digits the number contains so our user is going to enter a number and then we are going to write a program that is going to count how many digits there are in that number so let me copy the text of that program like this and it says count digits of a number so let's do the first thing that we know that we have to do and that we know how to do as well so that is going to be write out a message to our user so that he enters that number and then also allow him to enter that number so I'm going to say C out and then I'm going to say number like this and then I'm going to allow my user to enter that number before I can enter it I have to really declare a variable that is going to hold that number so here I'm going to say int number like this and then here after we have written out this message to our user we are going to say C in number like this so after our user has entered his number we really have stored it in our number variable and now we are going to write out the program that is going to count the number of digits of this number here so let's first see one specific situation that can happen and that is going to be when our user enters number zero so this number holds value of zero and in that situation I'm just going to write out a condition so I'm going to say if my number like this is equal to zero in that situation is situation please just write out a message to my user like this you have entered zero okay like this and I don't need semicolon here this looks better so this here is a situation where our user has entered number zero and in that case we just want to write out that he has entered zero and now we are left with the main problem of this task and that is to count the digits of the number that our user has entered and that part I'm going to put in my else block like this and if you are not familiar with if statements make sure to watch that video it's going to be liked here so here in this else block I want to write the program that is going to count the digits of a number which is not zero definitely because if we come here that our number is definitely not zero so how we are going to do that well let me show you the algorithm on an example let's say that our user is going to enter a number one three to five for example that is the number that our user enters so how we are going to count the digits of this number well first we are going to have a variable that is going to be called counter like this and initially we are going to set the value of that counter to zero so that is initial count of our digits of number and then we are going to use while to iterate through all the digits of this number and in each iteration we are going to do following so we are going to come here and then we are going to say okay take this last digit of my number and really remove it I don't need it and as well increase the number that my counter is holding so increase the number of digits because we have removed one digit and then in the next iteration we are coming here and we are as well saying okay so take that last digit and increase my counter like this and then in the next iteration take the last digit increase counter and in the next as well take last digit increase counter and then when we come next time we really have nothing more to count so there are no more digits left our number and this situation here is going to be equal to zero and then we are going to know that there is nothing else to count and then we are really going to leave our while loop and we are going to write out the value that our counter variable is holding which is at this situation for so let me show you how how we can do that in our code so I'm going to delete this part here we don't need it anymore and then here I'm going to write out the following so as we explained already first thing that we need to do is we need to create a variable that is going to be called counter like this or a digits counter however you prefer and that variable I'm going to assign a value of zero initially and after we have created this variable here now we need our wild loop so while like this and then inside these parenthesis here we really write out a condition that our while loop is going to check each time that it wants to run each time that it wants to iterate and that condition here is really going to be please check whether my number is greater than zero okay so in any case where our number is greater than zero our while loop is going to execute this block of code that I put inside these parentheses and what we are going to put inside these parentheses well as we already explained previously first thing that we need to do is we need to say number is equal to number divided by 10 and what this line of code is going to do well let me show you that on an example let's say that our number so our number holds the value of 1 2 3 like this and this line here really says the following it says please do this expression here so calculated and whatever this expression here results in a signed edge to my number variable and one two three so 123 3 divided by 10 because this here is whole number so it's integer and this here is whole number as well the result is going to be whole number and that is going to be 12 we're at twelve point three but but because a result has to be the whole number that point three part is just deleted byebye so then this 12 in this situation is going to be assigned to our number variable okay so that means that this number divided by 10 is really going to take away that last digit which we have previously explained so I'm going to delete this part here okay and this one of code there is really one more way to write this so write the same thing so I'm going to comment this here and I'm going to write out number divided equal so number are like this okay okay so this line of code here and this line of code here are exactly the same this is just shorter way to write this here and this looks prettier to me but you can leave whichever of these two you prefer okay so after we have taken the last digit from our number what we are left to do is to increase our counter variable by one so we can do that using our increment operator here so this part of code has really in each iteration taken away one digit and then increased counter variable so what we should do now after our while loop finishes we should really write out how many number how many digits are a number contained so we are going to write out count number contains this and then let's write out the value that our counter variable is holding like this what is this oh it says card instead of C out okay and then let's write out just digits like this okay so our number contains whatever our counter variable is holding digits so now I can really run my program and let's do that so it asks us to enter a number let's enter a number 1 2 3 for example and it says that our number contains 3 digits which is correct so let's very quickly explain one more time how this has happened so I'm going to stop my program and I'm going to say here that our user has entered number let's say 1 2 3 so our program in this situation comes here to our while loop and it says please check whether the number that our user has entered is greater than 0 and that number is 1 2 3 so 123 which is greater than 0 so that our program can really start executing this while loop so it enters here and then it comes to the first line of this while loop and it says please do this expression here and this expression here really just takes the last digit of our number away and that is going to be 3 so we are going to take that away and then the next that needs to happen is increase the value of our counter since previously the value of our counter was 0 now the value is going to be increased by 1 so that is going to be 1 and after that our program comes here and because of the nature of the while loop it goes back here it checks again whether our number is greater than 0 our number is 12 now so the one digit has been taken away so that is still greater than zero so then our number really comes here and then does this line of code again so it says again please take away one digit from my number so then it takes away this two part and then it comes here it says now increase my counter because you have taken away one digit and that is going to be 2 now after that our program comes here and that goes back here checks whether our number so whether our 1 is greater than 0 it says yes and then it comes here and it says please divide my number by 10 so take away that one digit so that one digit is taken away and we are left with 0 and then our counter is increased by 1 and then we are really going to come here again and then our program goes back and says please check whether my number so whether 0 is greater than 0 and then our program says no it is not so our while loop is not executed any more and then it comes here instead and it writes out that our number contains 3 digits and there is one more situation that I want show you and that is going to be what is going to happen in a situation where our user decides to enter a negative number so let's run our program and let's see how our program is going to behave in that situation so now I'm going to enter a number of minus 3 3 5 for example and you see that our program writes out that our number contains zero digits why has that happened because our program has come here so it has increased our counter it has actually assigned our counter a value of 0 and then it has come here and it is it has really tried to check whether our number is greater than zero but because our number is minus three three five that is not greater than zero so our program then really is not going to execute this block here but it's just going to go here directly so then it's going to write out that our number contains and the value that it has assigned to our counter here which is zero so our number contains zero digits and that's the message that you see here so that is the explanation of this behavior and we need to solve that now how we are going to solve that well it's pretty simple so here when we come to this else block in this situation this 14th line of code we are really sure that our number is not equal to 0 because we have checked that here but here we really don't know whether our number is less than 0 or greater than 0 so here we really have to check whether our number is less than 0 and if it is we really need to get the absolute value of our number which means if it is negative we have to convert it to the positive number so here I'm going to write out the phone link condition so I'm going to say please check if my number is less than 0 like this and then if this here results is true I'm going to write out here a way for my program to convert this number in case that it is negative into a positive number and how we can do that well we can really multiply that number by 1 so we can see number is equal to minus 1 times number like this okay so now if I run my program and if I enter value of minus 2 3 6 for example our program now writes out that our number contains 3 3 digits which is correct so how has this happened our program has come here it has really checked that our number is less than 0 and then it has come here and it is sad please do this expression here and then assign that to my number so minus one times two minus two three six those minuses are going to really convert into plus sign and then one times 236 is going to be 236 and after that we are going to do the same logic here so we are going to write out that our program that our number contains three digits which is correct answer okay so that is the one situation that I wanted to explain and there is also another situation that I want to explain to you and that is what is going to happen in the following situation here so let's see let me enter a number that is very very very large I cannot even read this number here so how our program is going to behave in death in this situation here we write it in the comments down below please before I execute this here and now if I press ENTER what is going to happen well our program has list a little bit and after that it has written out that our number contains ten digits but this is definitely more than ten why has this happened if you are not familiar with datatypes and overflow and concept concepts that I have already talked about in one of my videos I am going to link that video here so make sure to watch the video and now I am very quickly going to explain what has happened here but make sure to watch that video so when we have entered this number here let me stop this program and let me put let's see let me put a breakpoint here and now I'm going to run my program and what this breakpoint is going to do it's really going to stop the execution of my program at this line here and we haven't talked about breakpoints or debugging programs previously but if you want me to include that in one of my next videos make sure to write it in the comments down below because I really believe that it is important for you to see how your program is executed line by line to be able to follow it and and that way you can really discover any bugs in any situations that are tricky and that aren't happening inside your program so you can see and control that better so I have put here a breakpoint and let's now enter a number that is going to be a very large number okay so if I press ENTER now you see that my program has really stopped the execution here on this line here so after I have entered my number and then even though I have entered a number that is pretty large let's hover over this number variable you can see that it is holding a value of 2 billion and 147 million in something so this value here is definitely not equal to this value here but because our program has really gotten the value that is much larger than the maximum value that our int variable can hold it has really assigned the maximum amount that our int can hold to our number variable so that is what has happened in this program and if I click continue now you can see that our program writes out that our number contains 10 digits because it really was holding a 10 digit number so that is the maximum amount that our int type can hold ok so that is the last situation that I wanted to explain to you and I hope that you like this video and if you have learned something new make sure to subscribe to my channel
