00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:02 - welcome to another HTML and CSS for
00:04 - beginners and in this video I want to
00:07 - talk about CSS selectors so that is a
00:10 - topic that is very important for you to
00:12 - understand and it is something that you
00:14 - are going to come across very often in
00:16 - your programming career and you should
00:18 - understand it so make sure to watch the
00:20 - entire video because I do have some
00:21 - important tips and tricks to give you
00:24 - when it comes to this topic but before
00:26 - we start make sure to subscribe to my
00:28 - channel and also click the bell icon so
00:30 - that you are notified when I publish my
00:32 - next video and also if you want you can
00:34 - follow me on my other social media
00:36 - platforms the link for those is going to
00:37 - be in the description so as I already
00:41 - said in this video I want to talk about
00:43 - different types of CSS selectors but
00:46 - first I want to explain what is selector
00:49 - so selectors we usually use when we want
00:53 - to select or defined an HTML element
00:55 - that we want to style so for example in
00:59 - this body section I'm going to add a
01:01 - paragraph of text so for that I'm using
01:04 - key tag and let's say that inside this
01:07 - paragraph I'm going to write a message
01:10 - this is a message like this and let's
01:18 - copy this paragraph three or four times
01:22 - so okay four times that is going to be
01:25 - enough and this element selector is the
01:29 - first one that I want to show you and
01:30 - element selector is something that you
01:32 - have already seen on my channel so how
01:35 - do you use element selector here in this
01:38 - head section I'm going to add style tag
01:41 - like this and then in this style tag I'm
01:44 - going to write the syntax of element
01:46 - selectors so you just write the name of
01:49 - your element which is B in this
01:51 - particular situation and then you open
01:53 - and close these curly brackets in which
01:55 - we are going to put the style for all t
01:58 - tags in this body so here I want to
02:02 - write the style for my paragraphs and
02:05 - let's save this for now and I want to
02:08 - open this document for
02:10 - to see how it looks without these styles
02:13 - which we are going to add later so I'm
02:15 - going to close this and then here is my
02:17 - HTML document and let's open it let's
02:21 - say open with Google Chrome oh I have
02:24 - opened it already so here we have this
02:28 - is a message and that paragraph is
02:31 - written four times okay so now if I open
02:35 - this document we want to style that
02:38 - paragraph with a different style so
02:40 - let's say that for example for this
02:42 - paragraph we want to style font size
02:46 - like this and let's say that the font
02:49 - size is going to be 20 pixels okay and
02:54 - then let's say that we want to align
02:56 - this text to the center as well so for
02:59 - that we are going to use text align
03:02 - property and we are going to say that
03:05 - the value is going to be Center so now
03:08 - when I save this and refresh it here as
03:12 - you can see this is a message has moved
03:15 - to the center and the font is larger as
03:18 - well so that was the example of element
03:22 - selector and another type of selector
03:25 - that I want to show you is going to be
03:26 - class selector what is class selector
03:29 - and how we use class selector for
03:32 - example let's say that all of these P
03:34 - tags are not the same so all these
03:36 - messages are not the same but let's say
03:39 - that this first one is going to be this
03:42 - is let's say error message like this and
03:46 - then the second one is going to be a
03:48 - warning like this so this is a warning
03:52 - message and then this third one is going
03:55 - to be in full message for example and
03:57 - then this fourth one let's say that is
04:00 - going to be error message as well okay
04:03 - like this so now we have written out
04:06 - different types of messages and when i
04:09 - refresh this you can see that they look
04:12 - pretty much the same and what I want to
04:14 - accomplish is for these messages to look
04:17 - different so according to their purpose
04:20 - let's say so we want this error message
04:22 - to
04:23 - for example red background and this
04:25 - warning message to have yellow
04:28 - background for example and then info
04:30 - should have blue or green I guess and
04:33 - that error again should have red
04:35 - background and how we are going to
04:37 - accomplish that for that I'm going to
04:39 - use something called class selector so
04:42 - here I am going to write class like this
04:47 - and then in these quotation marks I'm
04:50 - going to say that this P element is
04:52 - going to have a class that is called
04:55 - error like this so here I have created a
05:00 - paragraph element which has class that
05:02 - is called error and here you can put
05:05 - whatever name you want except that you
05:07 - cannot use a number to start the name of
05:10 - a class so I have called my class error
05:12 - and now I'm going to create that class
05:15 - here so the style for that class and how
05:18 - we do that you say dot and then you put
05:22 - the name of your class which is in my
05:24 - case error and then you open these curly
05:27 - brackets and in inside these curly
05:30 - brackets we are going to put the style
05:31 - for this error class so for the element
05:34 - that has this error class and let's say
05:37 - that we want to style that element so
05:39 - this paragraph here we want to style it
05:42 - with background color which is going to
05:46 - be let's say like Oh white quarrel okay
05:51 - so we want this white red color to be a
05:54 - background color of this element here
05:57 - and we want to copy this class on this
06:01 - paragraph element as well because this
06:03 - is error message as well so here I'm
06:06 - going to paste it and now after I have
06:09 - saved this if i refresh where is it if i
06:14 - refresh my page you can see that this is
06:17 - error message and this is error message
06:20 - as well is written here and we should
06:22 - correct this too this is an error
06:24 - message so I'm going to correct that
06:27 - very quickly I'm going to seed this is
06:29 - an error message and then this is an
06:31 - error message as well okay and then here
06:35 - this is
06:36 - an inflorescence like this so after i
06:40 - have styled my error messages i want to
06:43 - style these other paragraphs as well so
06:46 - here on this warning message I'm going
06:49 - to say class and then here I want to
06:52 - give it a class that is called warning
06:56 - like this and then here I want to create
06:59 - that class I'm going to copy the name so
07:02 - that I don't make mistake
07:05 - so warning class is going to have
07:08 - background color where is it background
07:13 - color so this light golden yellow
07:17 - something is going to be background
07:19 - color of our warning message so this is
07:23 - yellowish color and then I'm going to
07:25 - give a class to this info message as
07:28 - well so I'm going to say class and I'm
07:32 - going to call that class info like this
07:35 - and I'm going to create info class here
07:39 - as well so dot and then the name of your
07:41 - class and then in these curly brackets
07:44 - you put the styles that you want your
07:47 - class to have so here I know here I'm
07:52 - going to say that this info message is
07:55 - going to have background color of let's
07:58 - say white blue so it is going to be this
08:02 - one here it's a light blue color and now
08:05 - after I have saved this if i refresh it
08:08 - here you can see that now our warning
08:11 - message has this yellowish background
08:13 - and then our info message has this blue
08:16 - background okay
08:19 - where is my document so that was an
08:24 - example of a class selector so you write
08:27 - the name of your class in this class
08:29 - attribute and then here in your style
08:32 - tag or in your external CSS file you put
08:36 - dot and then the name of your class and
08:38 - then inside curly brackets you write the
08:41 - styles for that element so for the
08:43 - element that has that class
08:45 - and there is one thing that I want to
08:47 - show you and there's going to be really
08:49 - the priority so priority between this
08:51 - element selector and then this class
08:54 - selector so for example if I put here in
08:58 - this P style if I see a background color
09:02 - so this property here and I see that
09:05 - background color is going to be this
09:07 - line color so it is greenish color and
09:10 - then I saved this what do you expect for
09:13 - our paragraphs to have so which
09:14 - background color this line or this white
09:18 - coral light yellow or light blue so
09:22 - after I have saved this and if i refresh
09:26 - it here you can see the DS state with
09:29 - their previous background color so this
09:32 - one is red this one is yellow and then
09:34 - blue and then red as well and why is
09:37 - that the case because these classes the
09:42 - styles that you write in your classes
09:43 - have a higher priority than the styles
09:46 - that you write in your element selector
09:49 - so this has a higher priority than this
09:53 - here and whenever you bright the styles
09:56 - for a certain property in your element
09:58 - sorter and then you repeat that property
10:00 - in your class selector your class
10:02 - selector is going to have the priority
10:04 - over your element selector so this here
10:08 - is going to be overridden by this here
10:11 - or it is here or this here depending on
10:14 - which P tag we owe which P tag we are
10:17 - talking about and then there is another
10:20 - type of selector that I want to talk
10:22 - about and that is going to be really ID
10:24 - selectors so what is ID selector well
10:27 - let's say for example that this
10:31 - paragraph here is not just a simple
10:33 - message but it is a critical error
10:36 - message so this is critical error
10:42 - message for example let's say that we
10:44 - want to have a critical error message as
10:47 - well and we want to style that paragraph
10:49 - as an error so with this class that is
10:53 - this one here so this error class but we
10:56 - want to give it a specific style so
10:58 - which is going to be unique for this
11:00 - element only and for that we are going
11:03 - to use IDE so we are going to say I D
11:06 - like this and here I want to specify the
11:10 - name of this element and let's say that
11:14 - that name is going to be critical like
11:18 - this and this ID selector is really
11:22 - something that is used only once in your
11:25 - webpage so only one element should have
11:28 - this ID which is called critical you can
11:31 - give other IDs to your other elements
11:34 - but this one should only be present on
11:36 - one element so it is going to be this
11:38 - one here and after I have created this
11:41 - ID which is called critical I'm going to
11:44 - style it here and how do you style your
11:47 - ID selector you say hash tag and then
11:50 - you put the name of your selector which
11:53 - is this one here like this and then in
11:56 - these curly brackets I am going to write
11:59 - the Styles for this element here so for
12:02 - this element that has the ID of critical
12:05 - and let's say that I want to style this
12:09 - element so that it has higher font so
12:13 - I'm going to say font size and I want it
12:17 - to have font of 30 pixels o pixels like
12:22 - this and then let's say as well that I
12:25 - wanted to have color of text which is
12:28 - going to be white so I'm going to say
12:30 - color like this and that I want to give
12:35 - it a value of white so now if I save
12:38 - this and then refresh my page here you
12:41 - can see that now it has this error class
12:45 - and it is styled at center it has
12:47 - background color which is red and then
12:49 - it has this this font size of 20 pixels
12:53 - like the others and then it as well has
12:56 - this color a front which is black and
12:58 - now after i refresh it you can see that
13:01 - now it has gotten this higher so this
13:03 - this larger font and then this color of
13:06 - text which is white okay so that we have
13:11 - done use
13:12 - this ID selector and how do you use this
13:15 - ID selector you say the name of your
13:18 - element so the ID of your element you
13:21 - put that using your ID attribute and
13:24 - then in your Styles you specify this
13:27 - hash tag and then put the name of your
13:29 - ID and then in these curly brackets you
13:32 - put the Styles that you want to really
13:35 - style your element with and in this
13:37 - particular case it is this paragraph
13:40 - element here and there is one very
13:43 - important thing when it comes to the
13:44 - priority of this ID selector because
13:47 - this ID selector is more specific than
13:50 - the previous one ones that we have
13:51 - mentioned that mean is that it has the
13:54 - highest priority so it has higher
13:56 - priority than this element selector and
13:59 - it has higher priority than this class
14:01 - selector as well so these these ones
14:04 - that means that for example here if I
14:08 - specify background color so I'm going to
14:11 - copy this here and if I specify
14:13 - different background color than the one
14:15 - that we have specified here this element
14:19 - is going to have whatever we have
14:20 - specified in our ID selector styles so
14:24 - here I'm going to say for example red
14:26 - like this and now if I save this this
14:30 - should override this style here even
14:33 - though our paragraph element has both
14:35 - this class error and then this ID
14:38 - critical so after I have saved it if I
14:41 - come here and refresh it you can see
14:44 - that our critical your paragraph now has
14:47 - this really red background color that we
14:49 - have specified in our ID selector oh
14:53 - okay where is it so here's our code so
14:59 - let's repeat one more time we have
15:02 - talked about three types of selectors
15:04 - the first one was element selector and
15:06 - then class selector and then the third
15:09 - one was ID selector and we have said
15:11 - that lowest priority has this element
15:14 - selector so this one here after that
15:18 - priority has this class selector and
15:20 - then the highest priority of these three
15:23 - has this ID so
15:25 - but I really want to show you some more
15:28 - tips and some more different ways to
15:31 - style your elements so for example if
15:34 - you want to say more specifically that
15:37 - you want to style let's say this element
15:40 - here so you want to style your paragraph
15:43 - element and this one here this one that
15:46 - has this info class and you want to do
15:49 - that in a more specific manner than just
15:51 - writing the name of your class you can
15:53 - say for example I want to style the
15:56 - element the TAS class info like this and
16:01 - then in this particular situation this
16:04 - has priority over this because this is
16:08 - really more specific than this here so
16:12 - here you say please give me any element
16:15 - that has this info class and then here
16:18 - you say please give me the element that
16:22 - has info class or all P elements that
16:25 - have this info class and that here for
16:28 - example if I say background color
16:32 - background color like this and let's say
16:36 - that here I want to specify for example
16:38 - this yellow green so this greenish color
16:42 - previously we had this blue color so
16:45 - this like blue color on our info element
16:48 - and now we have specified background
16:50 - color which is this one here so this
16:52 - greenish color and now if i refresh my
16:56 - document as you can see our info message
16:59 - now has this light green background
17:02 - color because this here has higher
17:07 - priority than this here
17:09 - and if you want to specify even higher
17:11 - priority than this one you can use for
17:14 - example nesting so you can see I'm going
17:17 - to copy this and paste it here and
17:21 - instead of saying please give me all the
17:24 - elements that have this info class and
17:27 - there are P elements so that our
17:29 - paragraphs you can see for example body
17:32 - here so this would mean please give me
17:35 - all the elements that have this info
17:38 - class
17:38 - that are of type P and there are child
17:42 - of this body element which means that
17:44 - are inside this body element and if I
17:48 - specify here for example even another
17:52 - color so I say silver and then I say
17:55 - this and then I come here and refresh it
17:59 - you can see that this info message has
18:01 - gotten this silver background color why
18:04 - has that happened well because this has
18:08 - even higher priority than this one here
18:10 - meaning that the more specific that you
18:13 - are when you are specifying your styles
18:16 - and selecting your element that is going
18:18 - to have higher priority so that is going
18:21 - to be of a higher priority that when you
18:23 - specify a more general role so one more
18:27 - time we have talked about different
18:29 - types of selectors the first one that we
18:31 - have mentioned was our peak selector
18:35 - which is our element selector and we
18:37 - said that this one has the lowest
18:39 - priority so element selectors have the
18:42 - lowest priority because they are general
18:44 - they are very very general after that we
18:47 - have talked about these class selectors
18:50 - which you use really with this dot
18:52 - notation so you say dot and then the
18:54 - name of your class and how you use these
18:57 - on your tags you say class and then you
19:00 - specify the name of your class and then
19:03 - here whatever you put in your class that
19:06 - is going to override your element
19:08 - selector and after Dad so after your
19:11 - class selector the priority has this ID
19:13 - selector so how you use these id
19:16 - Software's you say hash tag and then the
19:20 - name of your element so the ID of your
19:22 - element which you specify using this ID
19:25 - property so this ID attribute on your
19:29 - start tag and then you really write the
19:32 - Styles inside these curly brackets and
19:35 - those Styles are going to override
19:37 - whatever you have put in your Styles
19:39 - that you have written in your class
19:42 - selector and then here we have specified
19:45 - a couple more ways that you can style
19:47 - your elements with
19:49 - and those are very specific situations
19:50 - where you want style an element that for
19:53 - example has bought a class and also you
19:56 - want to specify the name of that element
19:58 - so the type of that element and here we
20:02 - have a small specified the way for you
20:04 - to select nested elements on a specific
20:07 - way so you can write the name of the
20:10 - class or ID that that element has and
20:12 - then the name of that element itself so
20:16 - the tag that you have used which is in
20:18 - this particular situation P tag and that
20:21 - here you specify the name of the parent
20:24 - of that element and this nesting can go
20:27 - really however deep you need it so you
20:30 - can have here even more classes even
20:33 - more children if you need that so that
20:37 - was something that I wanted to show you
20:38 - in this video and I hope that you
20:41 - understood these examples and I hope
20:43 - that you understood different types of
20:44 - selectors if you have any questions
20:46 - write those in the comments down below
20:48 - and I'm going to answer those and also
20:52 - make sure to subscribe to my channel and
20:54 - click the bell icon and like this video
20:56 - if you learned something new and follow
20:58 - me on my other social media the link for
21:00 - those is going to be in the description
21:02 - on my channel thanks for watching and
21:05 - I'm going to see you in my next video
21:07 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another HTML and CSS for beginners and in this video I want to talk about CSS selectors so that is a topic that is very important for you to understand and it is something that you are going to come across very often in your programming career and you should understand it so make sure to watch the entire video because I do have some important tips and tricks to give you when it comes to this topic but before we start make sure to subscribe to my channel and also click the bell icon so that you are notified when I publish my next video and also if you want you can follow me on my other social media platforms the link for those is going to be in the description so as I already said in this video I want to talk about different types of CSS selectors but first I want to explain what is selector so selectors we usually use when we want to select or defined an HTML element that we want to style so for example in this body section I'm going to add a paragraph of text so for that I'm using key tag and let's say that inside this paragraph I'm going to write a message this is a message like this and let's copy this paragraph three or four times so okay four times that is going to be enough and this element selector is the first one that I want to show you and element selector is something that you have already seen on my channel so how do you use element selector here in this head section I'm going to add style tag like this and then in this style tag I'm going to write the syntax of element selectors so you just write the name of your element which is B in this particular situation and then you open and close these curly brackets in which we are going to put the style for all t tags in this body so here I want to write the style for my paragraphs and let's save this for now and I want to open this document for to see how it looks without these styles which we are going to add later so I'm going to close this and then here is my HTML document and let's open it let's say open with Google Chrome oh I have opened it already so here we have this is a message and that paragraph is written four times okay so now if I open this document we want to style that paragraph with a different style so let's say that for example for this paragraph we want to style font size like this and let's say that the font size is going to be 20 pixels okay and then let's say that we want to align this text to the center as well so for that we are going to use text align property and we are going to say that the value is going to be Center so now when I save this and refresh it here as you can see this is a message has moved to the center and the font is larger as well so that was the example of element selector and another type of selector that I want to show you is going to be class selector what is class selector and how we use class selector for example let's say that all of these P tags are not the same so all these messages are not the same but let's say that this first one is going to be this is let's say error message like this and then the second one is going to be a warning like this so this is a warning message and then this third one is going to be in full message for example and then this fourth one let's say that is going to be error message as well okay like this so now we have written out different types of messages and when i refresh this you can see that they look pretty much the same and what I want to accomplish is for these messages to look different so according to their purpose let's say so we want this error message to for example red background and this warning message to have yellow background for example and then info should have blue or green I guess and that error again should have red background and how we are going to accomplish that for that I'm going to use something called class selector so here I am going to write class like this and then in these quotation marks I'm going to say that this P element is going to have a class that is called error like this so here I have created a paragraph element which has class that is called error and here you can put whatever name you want except that you cannot use a number to start the name of a class so I have called my class error and now I'm going to create that class here so the style for that class and how we do that you say dot and then you put the name of your class which is in my case error and then you open these curly brackets and in inside these curly brackets we are going to put the style for this error class so for the element that has this error class and let's say that we want to style that element so this paragraph here we want to style it with background color which is going to be let's say like Oh white quarrel okay so we want this white red color to be a background color of this element here and we want to copy this class on this paragraph element as well because this is error message as well so here I'm going to paste it and now after I have saved this if i refresh where is it if i refresh my page you can see that this is error message and this is error message as well is written here and we should correct this too this is an error message so I'm going to correct that very quickly I'm going to seed this is an error message and then this is an error message as well okay and then here this is an inflorescence like this so after i have styled my error messages i want to style these other paragraphs as well so here on this warning message I'm going to say class and then here I want to give it a class that is called warning like this and then here I want to create that class I'm going to copy the name so that I don't make mistake so warning class is going to have background color where is it background color so this light golden yellow something is going to be background color of our warning message so this is yellowish color and then I'm going to give a class to this info message as well so I'm going to say class and I'm going to call that class info like this and I'm going to create info class here as well so dot and then the name of your class and then in these curly brackets you put the styles that you want your class to have so here I know here I'm going to say that this info message is going to have background color of let's say white blue so it is going to be this one here it's a light blue color and now after I have saved this if i refresh it here you can see that now our warning message has this yellowish background and then our info message has this blue background okay where is my document so that was an example of a class selector so you write the name of your class in this class attribute and then here in your style tag or in your external CSS file you put dot and then the name of your class and then inside curly brackets you write the styles for that element so for the element that has that class and there is one thing that I want to show you and there's going to be really the priority so priority between this element selector and then this class selector so for example if I put here in this P style if I see a background color so this property here and I see that background color is going to be this line color so it is greenish color and then I saved this what do you expect for our paragraphs to have so which background color this line or this white coral light yellow or light blue so after I have saved this and if i refresh it here you can see the DS state with their previous background color so this one is red this one is yellow and then blue and then red as well and why is that the case because these classes the styles that you write in your classes have a higher priority than the styles that you write in your element selector so this has a higher priority than this here and whenever you bright the styles for a certain property in your element sorter and then you repeat that property in your class selector your class selector is going to have the priority over your element selector so this here is going to be overridden by this here or it is here or this here depending on which P tag we owe which P tag we are talking about and then there is another type of selector that I want to talk about and that is going to be really ID selectors so what is ID selector well let's say for example that this paragraph here is not just a simple message but it is a critical error message so this is critical error message for example let's say that we want to have a critical error message as well and we want to style that paragraph as an error so with this class that is this one here so this error class but we want to give it a specific style so which is going to be unique for this element only and for that we are going to use IDE so we are going to say I D like this and here I want to specify the name of this element and let's say that that name is going to be critical like this and this ID selector is really something that is used only once in your webpage so only one element should have this ID which is called critical you can give other IDs to your other elements but this one should only be present on one element so it is going to be this one here and after I have created this ID which is called critical I'm going to style it here and how do you style your ID selector you say hash tag and then you put the name of your selector which is this one here like this and then in these curly brackets I am going to write the Styles for this element here so for this element that has the ID of critical and let's say that I want to style this element so that it has higher font so I'm going to say font size and I want it to have font of 30 pixels o pixels like this and then let's say as well that I wanted to have color of text which is going to be white so I'm going to say color like this and that I want to give it a value of white so now if I save this and then refresh my page here you can see that now it has this error class and it is styled at center it has background color which is red and then it has this this font size of 20 pixels like the others and then it as well has this color a front which is black and now after i refresh it you can see that now it has gotten this higher so this this larger font and then this color of text which is white okay so that we have done use this ID selector and how do you use this ID selector you say the name of your element so the ID of your element you put that using your ID attribute and then in your Styles you specify this hash tag and then put the name of your ID and then in these curly brackets you put the Styles that you want to really style your element with and in this particular case it is this paragraph element here and there is one very important thing when it comes to the priority of this ID selector because this ID selector is more specific than the previous one ones that we have mentioned that mean is that it has the highest priority so it has higher priority than this element selector and it has higher priority than this class selector as well so these these ones that means that for example here if I specify background color so I'm going to copy this here and if I specify different background color than the one that we have specified here this element is going to have whatever we have specified in our ID selector styles so here I'm going to say for example red like this and now if I save this this should override this style here even though our paragraph element has both this class error and then this ID critical so after I have saved it if I come here and refresh it you can see that our critical your paragraph now has this really red background color that we have specified in our ID selector oh okay where is it so here's our code so let's repeat one more time we have talked about three types of selectors the first one was element selector and then class selector and then the third one was ID selector and we have said that lowest priority has this element selector so this one here after that priority has this class selector and then the highest priority of these three has this ID so but I really want to show you some more tips and some more different ways to style your elements so for example if you want to say more specifically that you want to style let's say this element here so you want to style your paragraph element and this one here this one that has this info class and you want to do that in a more specific manner than just writing the name of your class you can say for example I want to style the element the TAS class info like this and then in this particular situation this has priority over this because this is really more specific than this here so here you say please give me any element that has this info class and then here you say please give me the element that has info class or all P elements that have this info class and that here for example if I say background color background color like this and let's say that here I want to specify for example this yellow green so this greenish color previously we had this blue color so this like blue color on our info element and now we have specified background color which is this one here so this greenish color and now if i refresh my document as you can see our info message now has this light green background color because this here has higher priority than this here and if you want to specify even higher priority than this one you can use for example nesting so you can see I'm going to copy this and paste it here and instead of saying please give me all the elements that have this info class and there are P elements so that our paragraphs you can see for example body here so this would mean please give me all the elements that have this info class that are of type P and there are child of this body element which means that are inside this body element and if I specify here for example even another color so I say silver and then I say this and then I come here and refresh it you can see that this info message has gotten this silver background color why has that happened well because this has even higher priority than this one here meaning that the more specific that you are when you are specifying your styles and selecting your element that is going to have higher priority so that is going to be of a higher priority that when you specify a more general role so one more time we have talked about different types of selectors the first one that we have mentioned was our peak selector which is our element selector and we said that this one has the lowest priority so element selectors have the lowest priority because they are general they are very very general after that we have talked about these class selectors which you use really with this dot notation so you say dot and then the name of your class and how you use these on your tags you say class and then you specify the name of your class and then here whatever you put in your class that is going to override your element selector and after Dad so after your class selector the priority has this ID selector so how you use these id Software's you say hash tag and then the name of your element so the ID of your element which you specify using this ID property so this ID attribute on your start tag and then you really write the Styles inside these curly brackets and those Styles are going to override whatever you have put in your Styles that you have written in your class selector and then here we have specified a couple more ways that you can style your elements with and those are very specific situations where you want style an element that for example has bought a class and also you want to specify the name of that element so the type of that element and here we have a small specified the way for you to select nested elements on a specific way so you can write the name of the class or ID that that element has and then the name of that element itself so the tag that you have used which is in this particular situation P tag and that here you specify the name of the parent of that element and this nesting can go really however deep you need it so you can have here even more classes even more children if you need that so that was something that I wanted to show you in this video and I hope that you understood these examples and I hope that you understood different types of selectors if you have any questions write those in the comments down below and I'm going to answer those and also make sure to subscribe to my channel and click the bell icon and like this video if you learned something new and follow me on my other
