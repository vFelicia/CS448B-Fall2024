00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:02 - welcome to another HTML and CSS for
00:04 - beginners and this video is going to be
00:07 - the one where I show you how you can
00:08 - build your own website and why I decided
00:12 - to make this video this early in the
00:14 - course it is because I really want to
00:16 - show you how you can build something
00:18 - practical even if you have very very
00:21 - beginner knowledge of HTML and CSS so
00:24 - rather than me showing you a bunch of
00:26 - concepts that you are not going to know
00:28 - how to combine and how to put together
00:30 - in order to build something I wanted to
00:33 - show you myself how you can build
00:35 - something practical and useful even if
00:37 - you are on a very very beginner level of
00:40 - learning HTML and CSS and that is going
00:43 - to be a very basic website so the things
00:47 - that we learn in this course are really
00:49 - going to be the core the foundation and
00:51 - are going to be applicable throughout
00:53 - this course and the later in the videos
00:55 - of this course we are going to learn how
00:57 - we can really add more elements and how
00:59 - we can really style this website so that
01:02 - it looks much more presentable that it
01:04 - is going to look in this particular
01:06 - video so here I have this website that I
01:10 - want to show you how you can build and
01:12 - as you can see it consists of three
01:15 - sections so three pages it is this home
01:18 - page and then this courses and social
01:22 - media part as well so when I navigate
01:25 - myself on this home section here I want
01:28 - to show you how you can put an image to
01:30 - your website and I have also I have
01:33 - written some description about my
01:34 - channel and I have to put description
01:36 - about one of my previous courses that I
01:38 - have made so it is C++ course if you are
01:41 - interested you can check it out on my
01:43 - channel it is beginner course as well so
01:47 - that is about this home section and then
01:50 - on this course is part of my website you
01:52 - can find all of the courses that I have
01:54 - made so far and published on my channel
01:57 - and then here on this social media part
02:00 - of my website I have listed all of my
02:03 - social media platforms so for example if
02:06 - you click on this code Beauty YouTube
02:08 - channel as you can see you are going to
02:10 - be navigated to my code Beauty
02:12 - YouTube's profile so here you can find
02:16 - all of the videos that I have published
02:18 - so far and this one is not ready so it
02:21 - is private that's why it does not have
02:23 - thumbnails yet so I'm going to close
02:25 - this and then there is one thing that I
02:28 - want you to pay attention and there is
02:29 - going to be where is this link going to
02:32 - be open so for example if I click on my
02:34 - Instagram account so I click on this
02:37 - link here I want you to pay attention
02:39 - that it is going to be opened in a
02:41 - separate tab and that is because we
02:44 - really don't want to navigate the
02:46 - visitors of our website away from our
02:49 - website but we want to open this in a
02:51 - separate tab so when I click it as you
02:55 - can see it is opened as part of a
02:56 - separate tab oh I have notifications
02:59 - nice and the first thing that I want to
03:02 - do is going to be to create a folder on
03:04 - my desktop and we are going to use that
03:06 - folder in order to put all of the files
03:08 - that we create in this tutorial so I'm
03:11 - going to create a folder on my desktop
03:13 - and I'm going to call that folder
03:15 - website like this and then let's create
03:19 - three HTML documents inside this folder
03:23 - and those three are going to be our home
03:25 - page our courses and then our social
03:28 - media so I'm going to name those index
03:30 - dot HTML which is going to be our home
03:32 - page and then our course is going to be
03:35 - courses dot HTML and then social media
03:38 - dot HTML and for that I'm going to use
03:41 - my visual studio code okay and I'm going
03:46 - to say new file and now I'm going to
03:48 - create my index dot HTML so I'm going to
03:51 - save this file this empty file in this
03:55 - website folder and I'm going to name it
03:58 - index dot HTML like this so this is
04:02 - going to be our home page and then let's
04:05 - create two more so this one I'm going to
04:09 - save also inside this website folder and
04:12 - I'm going to name it courses dot HTML
04:17 - like this and then the third one is
04:21 - going to be saved also in this folder
04:24 - and
04:25 - is going to be social media HTML like
04:32 - this okay so we have created these three
04:36 - files and the next thing that I want to
04:38 - do is going to be really to put our
04:40 - basic HTML structure inside each of
04:43 - these three files so here I'm going to
04:45 - paste this basic structure and I'm going
04:48 - to save it and then here as well also
04:51 - save it and then in this third file as
04:54 - well I'm going to place my basic HTML
04:57 - structure and let's first create this
05:00 - index dot HTML page so here what I want
05:04 - to put in my body section is going to be
05:06 - an image and I want to put a paragraph
05:09 - of text where I'm going to describe
05:11 - really what this website is going to be
05:14 - about and let me show you something and
05:17 - that is going to be this images folder
05:19 - here so here I have prepared all of the
05:23 - images which we are going to be using in
05:25 - order to build this website so here I
05:27 - have six images so I'm going to put this
05:32 - images folder inside my website folder
05:34 - so that we have all of the files that we
05:37 - are going to be using in this website
05:39 - folder okay
05:41 - and if I open this website folder you
05:44 - can see that it consists of these three
05:46 - files these three HTML files which we
05:49 - have just created so index courses and
05:52 - social media and then this images folder
05:55 - as well okay so the first thing that I
05:58 - want to do now is going to be to put
06:00 - this banner image on my index dot HTML
06:03 - so I'm going to open my visual studio
06:06 - code and in order to put an image to
06:09 - your HTML file you have to use tag for
06:13 - that so I'm going to use image tag so
06:17 - you say IMG and then in order to specify
06:20 - which image you want you have to put
06:22 - source to that image so you have to
06:25 - really specify the location of that
06:27 - image so you say as RC and then here in
06:32 - these quotations you specify the path to
06:36 - that image
06:37 - and as you can see the pet of our index
06:39 - of HTML is this see users Selena desktop
06:44 - website and then our images are really
06:48 - as well in this website folder but in
06:51 - another folder so one folder deeper and
06:54 - that is images folder so we have to
06:57 - specify that here I'm going to say
06:59 - please look on this location here but
07:02 - only one folder deeper so that folder is
07:05 - images like this and then the name of
07:10 - our image is going to be banner okay I'm
07:14 - going to save that and I'm going to
07:16 - check one more time so the name is
07:18 - banner and then one very important thing
07:21 - is that you have to specify the
07:23 - extension of your image and how you can
07:26 - check out the extension of your image
07:28 - you can right click on your image
07:30 - properties and here you see that the
07:33 - extension of my image is dot PNG so I
07:37 - have to put that here as well so I'm
07:41 - going to say banner dot P and G like
07:45 - this okay
07:46 - and now I'm going to try to open this
07:50 - index dot HTML so I'm going to look for
07:53 - it in this folder where I have created
07:55 - it and here I'm going to say right click
07:57 - and then open with Google Chrome okay
08:01 - and this has opened I'm going to close
08:04 - other tabs and as you can see we have
08:07 - shown this banner image on our web page
08:10 - so that was the first thing and beneath
08:13 - this image I want to put a paragraph of
08:16 - text which is going to be this one here
08:19 - okay so it is just basic description so
08:24 - I make programming videos on YouTube
08:26 - code beauty YouTube channel and then
08:28 - here is a description of one of the
08:30 - other tutorials that I have made on my
08:32 - channel it is C++ for beginners if you
08:35 - want you can check it out I'm going to
08:37 - link it here and also in the description
08:39 - of this video and then another thing
08:42 - that I want to add is going to be
08:44 - heading so here I'm going to use h1 tag
08:48 - I'm going to say that the heading for my
08:51 - index dot HTML is going to be cold like
08:55 - this so now that I have saved it and if
08:59 - i refresh it you can see that our text
09:02 - and then our title so our heading
09:04 - actually has appeared here so we have
09:08 - finished this index dot HTML for now
09:10 - let's focus now on our courses dot HTML
09:15 - and this courses dot HTML I'm going to
09:19 - use in order to list all the courses
09:21 - that I have made on my channel and for
09:24 - that I'm going to use a tag which is
09:27 - called unordered list
09:29 - so here I'm going to say you ow
09:33 - meaning unordered list and then in order
09:37 - to put items inside my list I'm going to
09:41 - use another tag which is going to be
09:43 - list item like this so Li and then here
09:49 - as the first item I want to put for
09:52 - example C++ for beginners like this so
09:58 - this is going to be the first item of
10:00 - our list and then I'm going to copy this
10:03 - a couple more times
10:05 - ok and then let's say that my second
10:09 - course was C++ functions like this and
10:13 - then third course was C++ interview
10:18 - questions like this and then fourth
10:24 - course is this one which is HTML and CSS
10:29 - okay so this is an ordered list which
10:33 - has four items
10:35 - the first one is C++ for beginners text
10:38 - after that we have C++ functions C++
10:42 - interview questions and then HTML and
10:44 - CSS and let's also add heading for
10:47 - discourses dot dot HTML as well so I'm
10:51 - going to use h1 tag and I'm going to say
10:55 - that the heading for this is going to be
10:58 - courses like this
11:01 - so now I will have to open this courses
11:04 - dot HTML in order to see the changes
11:06 - that we have made so here I'm going to
11:10 - really copy this path and then I'm going
11:13 - to open a new browser okay like this and
11:18 - then here I'm going to just modify this
11:21 - index dot HTML into courses dot HTML
11:25 - like this so oh it is
11:28 - courses not vs. okay and as you can see
11:33 - our page has been open so this is also
11:36 - one way to navigate yourself to your web
11:39 - page so you can navigate yourself
11:41 - directly through this address bar or you
11:45 - can right click on your file and say
11:46 - open with and then choose your browser
11:49 - so here we have our courses dot HTML and
11:53 - it is ready as well for now and then the
11:57 - third one is going to be this one here
11:59 - so social media dot HTML and here I want
12:03 - to specify links to my social media
12:06 - profiles you are going to specify the
12:08 - links to yours but the first thing that
12:10 - we have to learn is going to be how you
12:12 - can really specify a link so for that we
12:17 - use anchor tag which is this tag here so
12:20 - you say eh
12:21 - and that here as content you put the
12:24 - text or an image or whatever you want to
12:27 - be shown to your user so you put that
12:30 - here and then here in this start tag you
12:35 - use href attribute in order to specify
12:38 - the link so here I'm going to say each
12:41 - raft and then the link that I want to
12:45 - navigate my user to is going to be this
12:48 - link here so I'm going to just paste
12:51 - this link here like this and then the
12:54 - text that I want to show to my user is
12:57 - going to be just this one here so I'm
13:00 - going to say if you want to navigate
13:02 - yourself to code Beauty you are going to
13:06 - be really navigated to this link here
13:09 - and you will have to click to this text
13:11 - here so now if I say
13:13 - if this and then I'm going to really
13:17 - navigate myself to my social media so
13:20 - you can do that either really modifying
13:23 - this address text or you can right-click
13:27 - on your file and say open with Google
13:31 - Chrome and here as you can see we have
13:34 - this code beauty link so now if I click
13:37 - on this you can see that we are going to
13:41 - be taken to my YouTube channel
13:44 - okay and the thing that I wanted to show
13:48 - you is going to be really how you can
13:50 - open this link in a separate tab and for
13:54 - that you use attribute which is called
13:59 - target like this and then the value for
14:04 - that active attribute is going to be
14:05 - blank like this okay so now that I have
14:10 - saved this and if i refresh my page and
14:13 - click on this link again you can see
14:16 - that my YouTube channel is going to be
14:18 - opened in a separate tab and my
14:22 - connection is a bit slow but as you can
14:24 - see it has been opened in a separate tab
14:27 - so now I'm going to close this and as
14:30 - you can see here is my link so now we
14:34 - are going to use this logic here in
14:36 - order to build a list of links okay and
14:41 - the one more thing that I want to show
14:44 - you before that it's going to be really
14:46 - as I already said you can specify text
14:50 - here or you can put an image or really
14:52 - any other element so here I want to put
14:55 - an image so as a content of my anchor
15:00 - tag I'm going to put image and text as
15:03 - well so we are going to use image tag
15:06 - and the source of our image is going to
15:10 - be specified by a source attribute and
15:14 - here we are going to put the location of
15:17 - our image and that location is going to
15:21 - be images /youtube so
15:26 - it is this location here so it is C user
15:30 - Selina desktop website which is really
15:33 - the location of our HTML document and
15:36 - then this folder here so images and then
15:39 - YouTube dot PNG okay so I'm going to
15:45 - specify that part of that here so I'm
15:47 - going to say images slash YouTube okay
15:52 - YouTube dot P and G like this so now my
15:58 - dot HTML document is going to look for
16:01 - this image on this here and then it is
16:05 - going to add this images folder and the
16:07 - name of my image is going to be YouTube
16:09 - dot PNG it is really important to
16:13 - specify this extension of your image so
16:16 - now that I see this and refresh my page
16:19 - you can see that this image has appeared
16:22 - but we really have the problem with the
16:25 - size of this image so I'm going to
16:27 - change the size of this image I'm going
16:30 - to say that this image is going to have
16:33 - the width of for example 30 pixels I
16:37 - think that is going to be enough so now
16:41 - that I have saved it and if i refresh it
16:44 - you can see that our image has been
16:46 - proportionally scaled so we have set the
16:49 - width of our image to 30 pixels and it's
16:51 - height has as well been scaled so we
16:55 - have specified one link here and let's
16:58 - format this so that it looks a bit more
17:01 - readable so we have anchor tag which is
17:05 - going to navigate as to this location so
17:08 - to this youtube / c / code beauty which
17:12 - is my channel and it is going to open
17:14 - that in a new tab so because we have
17:17 - specified this target attribute and what
17:21 - is going to be shown to our user is
17:22 - going to be this image so this YouTube
17:26 - dot PNG and that this code duty text as
17:29 - well okay so now I really want to
17:32 - specify other lengths so links of my
17:35 - other social media
17:37 - I'm going to use a list for debt so I'm
17:40 - going to use once more unordered list so
17:43 - I'm going to say ul and then as first
17:46 - list item I'm going to use this code
17:50 - here so this is going to be the first
17:52 - item off my list so I'm going to cut it
17:55 - from here and then paste it here okay
17:58 - and then the second list item is going
18:03 - to be linked to my for example Instagram
18:07 - so I'm going to copy this okay and then
18:11 - here I'm going to specify the link to my
18:13 - Instagram profile so I'm going to copy
18:16 - that
18:17 - it is this link here like this
18:23 - okay and then here I'm going to use my
18:27 - username on Instagram which is this one
18:30 - here like this and here I want to
18:33 - specify image of so Instagram icon
18:36 - Instagram image and the name of that
18:38 - image is Instagram oh okay and it is as
18:44 - well on this same pad so on this same
18:46 - location as my YouTube dot PNG and it
18:49 - also has the same format as my YouTube
18:52 - image but if you need you can check that
18:55 - here so you can really check the name of
18:58 - your image and the extension as well
19:01 - okay so now that I save this and I try
19:08 - to reload it you can see that we have
19:10 - built a list that consists of two items
19:13 - the first one is this code beauty
19:16 - so YouTube channel and then the second
19:18 - one is this true code beauty so
19:20 - Instagram profile and let's add one more
19:23 - oh I have closed this so let's add one
19:27 - more and it is going to be my Twitter
19:29 - account so I'm going to copy this list
19:33 - item once more and here I'm going to
19:35 - specify href so I'm going to specify the
19:38 - link to my Twitter profile so I'm going
19:41 - to copy that from here and I'm going to
19:46 - paste it so this is my Twitter
19:50 - and I'm going to use this Twitter name
19:52 - here and here I want to use Twitter
19:56 - image so I'm going to say Twitter and as
20:00 - well I know the name of this image and
20:03 - its extension you will have to check
20:04 - check that one out in your folder so
20:07 - here I have this Twitter image which has
20:11 - the extension dot PNG and I have
20:13 - specified it here so I'm going to close
20:16 - this and now that I have saved this I'm
20:19 - going to reload my page once more and as
20:23 - you can see my Twitter my Twitter item
20:26 - my Twitter profile has appeared here as
20:29 - well and if I want to test this I'm
20:31 - going to click for example on my
20:34 - Instagram anchor tag here and as you can
20:38 - see my Instagram profile has been opened
20:42 - in a separate tab so I'm going to close
20:44 - this and now we have really built all of
20:49 - these three pages so we have our index
20:52 - page we have our courses and then we
20:54 - have our social media as well
20:56 - so the next thing that I want to show
20:59 - you it's going to be really how you can
21:02 - link these three together so now we are
21:04 - going to build the menu so that we can
21:06 - navigate ourselves through these three
21:09 - pages and for that I'm going to use so
21:14 - let's start building that on our index
21:16 - dot HTML so here and for that I'm going
21:19 - to use another tag that I haven't shown
21:23 - you and that is going to be a div tag
21:26 - and this div tag is really used in order
21:29 - to group elements together so let's say
21:32 - that it is a kind of a container and for
21:35 - now I'm going to use that div tag in
21:37 - order to put my menu tags together and
21:41 - in order to create a menu I'm going to
21:43 - use anchor tags as well so let's say
21:48 - once more that I'm going to create
21:49 - anchor tag and here I put a text or an
21:55 - image content that is going to be shown
21:57 - to my user so here I want to write let's
22:00 - say
22:01 - and then here in my start tag I specify
22:07 - each raft attribute and here I specified
22:11 - the path that I want to navigate my user
22:13 - when he clicks on this text here and the
22:17 - path that I want my user to be navigated
22:19 - to when he clicks on this home is going
22:22 - to be index dot HTML so I'm going to say
22:25 - index dot HTM L like this so this is
22:31 - going to be linked to our index page and
22:34 - then I'm going to copy this three more
22:36 - times like this and then I want to put
22:41 - here my courses so I'm going to say
22:44 - courses like this and I want to navigate
22:49 - my user to course this dot HTML when he
22:55 - clicks on this courses text and then my
22:58 - third page is going to be social media
23:01 - so here I'm going to say social media
23:05 - like this and then when my user clicks
23:08 - on this social media text I want my user
23:11 - to be navigated to my social media dot
23:14 - HTML so here I'm going to put that
23:16 - perhaps I'm going to say social media
23:20 - like this so now we have really created
23:25 - this menu only on this index dot HTML
23:28 - page so I have saved it and now if i
23:32 - refresh my index you can see that this
23:34 - whole courses and social media has
23:37 - appeared ok and now I want to copy this
23:43 - menu on my other pages as well so on my
23:46 - courses and on my social media so I'm
23:49 - going to take this deafed which is going
23:52 - to be my menu and I'm going to paste it
23:55 - here so at the beginning of my courses
23:58 - dot HTML and then in the beginning of my
24:03 - social media dot HTML as well so here ok
24:07 - and now after I have saved all of these
24:10 - three pages if I come back to my index
24:14 - that
24:14 - EML I'm going to refresh it one more
24:16 - time and now I can really expect to
24:18 - navigate myself to these other pages so
24:21 - when I click on home I am at home when I
24:24 - click on courses I'm going to switch to
24:26 - courses and then when I click on social
24:29 - media my user is going to be switched to
24:31 - my social media page so now I can really
24:34 - close these two okay and let's add one
24:39 - more thing that we are missing which is
24:42 - going to be really a horizontal line
24:44 - which is going to separate our menu from
24:46 - this content and for that I'm going to
24:50 - use tag which is called H R like this so
24:55 - that's going to add a horizontal rule so
24:57 - it is going to add a horizontal line
24:59 - after my menu so I'm going to save it
25:03 - and I'm going to copy this HR tag to my
25:07 - courses here and then to my index dot
25:11 - HTML here as well okay
25:16 - and now if I try to refresh this you can
25:19 - see that this horizontal line has
25:21 - appeared and it is really on all of my
25:25 - pages and I have noticed one thing and
25:28 - that is that our social media page is
25:30 - missing heading so our courses has this
25:33 - courses and then home has home heading
25:37 - but our social media is missing a
25:38 - heading so I'm going to add that so here
25:41 - on my social media dot HTML I want to
25:45 - put head Inc
25:46 - so after this horizontal rule I'm going
25:49 - to say h1 and here I want to say my
25:54 - social media like this okay so I'm going
26:00 - to save this heading and now if i
26:04 - refresh my page you can see that my
26:05 - social media heading has appeared so now
26:09 - the thing that I want to show you is
26:10 - going to be really how we can style this
26:13 - so in my previous video I have talked
26:15 - about external CSS and now really I want
26:18 - to show you how you can apply that logic
26:21 - of external CSS to your web site so how
26:25 - you can use one file in order
26:27 - style your website so I'm going to close
26:31 - this and then inside this website folder
26:34 - I'm going to create a new folder which
26:37 - is going to be called styles like this
26:42 - okay and then here I want to create a
26:45 - new file which is going to be our style
26:48 - and for that as well I'm going to use my
26:51 - visual studio code so I'm going to say
26:53 - file new file so I'm going to save this
26:56 - file and place it in my Styles folder
27:00 - and I'm going to name it file dot CSS
27:03 - and save it okay and now what we have to
27:08 - do in order to have this style to be
27:11 - applied to our pages is really to link
27:15 - this style and for that as I already
27:18 - mentioned in my previous video we use a
27:21 - link tag which we've put in this head
27:24 - section okay so here I'm going to say
27:28 - link and then I'm going to say the
27:31 - relationship is going to be style sheet
27:35 - like this and then the path to my style
27:39 - file is going to be specified using H
27:42 - ref attribute and the pet is going to be
27:46 - Styles slash style dot CSS okay so there
27:53 - is one thing that I'm going to add to my
27:55 - Styles dot CSS so that we can really
27:57 - test whether this has been applied so
28:01 - whether this this link works so here in
28:04 - my spouse I'm going to add for example
28:09 - I'm going to say that I want to style my
28:11 - body tag and I'm going to say that I
28:13 - want to add a background for my body tag
28:17 - so I'm going to say that background
28:18 - color background color of my body is
28:24 - going to be lets say this beige color so
28:28 - I'm going to say that and now I'm going
28:31 - to refresh where is it
28:33 - I'm going to refresh this social media
28:35 - and as you can see this beige color has
28:38 - been applied to
28:40 - my social media page but if I navigate
28:43 - myself to my courses you can see that
28:46 - this page does not have any styles nor
28:49 - this homepage so I will have to link
28:52 - this Styles dot CSS on these two pages
28:57 - as well so I'm going to copy this and
29:00 - I'm going to paste it on my courses dot
29:02 - HTML and save it and paste it as well on
29:06 - my index dot HTML and see what so now if
29:11 - i refresh this and if i navigate myself
29:14 - to these other pages you can see that
29:17 - they they have this beige color of body
29:21 - so this page is beige and now you can
29:25 - decide for example that you want all of
29:27 - your headings to have a similar style so
29:30 - you come to this Styles dot CSS and you
29:34 - say please style all of my h1 tags with
29:39 - this background color off for example
29:42 - white green so when I save this and
29:47 - refresh my home page
29:48 - you can see that this heading has gotten
29:51 - this light green background and then on
29:54 - my courses my heading is as well this
29:57 - light green background and then on
29:59 - social media as well heading has this
30:01 - light green background so I hope that
30:05 - now you have really seen the practical
30:08 - use of this external CSS which we have
30:11 - mentioned in my previous video and I
30:14 - hope as well that you have understood
30:17 - how you can build a website I know that
30:20 - this is a very very simple one and not
30:22 - very presentable one but the core
30:24 - principles are there so you are going to
30:27 - have some navigation and then you are
30:29 - going to put the content on each of your
30:32 - pages and as we progress in this course
30:34 - we are going to learn about new elements
30:37 - and we are going to learn new CSS which
30:40 - we are going to use in order to put new
30:43 - elements to our web page and also in
30:45 - order to style them so that they look
30:47 - presentable and nice so if you enjoyed

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to my channel welcome to another HTML and CSS for beginners and this video is going to be the one where I show you how you can build your own website and why I decided to make this video this early in the course it is because I really want to show you how you can build something practical even if you have very very beginner knowledge of HTML and CSS so rather than me showing you a bunch of concepts that you are not going to know how to combine and how to put together in order to build something I wanted to show you myself how you can build something practical and useful even if you are on a very very beginner level of learning HTML and CSS and that is going to be a very basic website so the things that we learn in this course are really going to be the core the foundation and are going to be applicable throughout this course and the later in the videos of this course we are going to learn how we can really add more elements and how we can really style this website so that it looks much more presentable that it is going to look in this particular video so here I have this website that I want to show you how you can build and as you can see it consists of three sections so three pages it is this home page and then this courses and social media part as well so when I navigate myself on this home section here I want to show you how you can put an image to your website and I have also I have written some description about my channel and I have to put description about one of my previous courses that I have made so it is C++ course if you are interested you can check it out on my channel it is beginner course as well so that is about this home section and then on this course is part of my website you can find all of the courses that I have made so far and published on my channel and then here on this social media part of my website I have listed all of my social media platforms so for example if you click on this code Beauty YouTube channel as you can see you are going to be navigated to my code Beauty YouTube's profile so here you can find all of the videos that I have published so far and this one is not ready so it is private that's why it does not have thumbnails yet so I'm going to close this and then there is one thing that I want you to pay attention and there is going to be where is this link going to be open so for example if I click on my Instagram account so I click on this link here I want you to pay attention that it is going to be opened in a separate tab and that is because we really don't want to navigate the visitors of our website away from our website but we want to open this in a separate tab so when I click it as you can see it is opened as part of a separate tab oh I have notifications nice and the first thing that I want to do is going to be to create a folder on my desktop and we are going to use that folder in order to put all of the files that we create in this tutorial so I'm going to create a folder on my desktop and I'm going to call that folder website like this and then let's create three HTML documents inside this folder and those three are going to be our home page our courses and then our social media so I'm going to name those index dot HTML which is going to be our home page and then our course is going to be courses dot HTML and then social media dot HTML and for that I'm going to use my visual studio code okay and I'm going to say new file and now I'm going to create my index dot HTML so I'm going to save this file this empty file in this website folder and I'm going to name it index dot HTML like this so this is going to be our home page and then let's create two more so this one I'm going to save also inside this website folder and I'm going to name it courses dot HTML like this and then the third one is going to be saved also in this folder and is going to be social media HTML like this okay so we have created these three files and the next thing that I want to do is going to be really to put our basic HTML structure inside each of these three files so here I'm going to paste this basic structure and I'm going to save it and then here as well also save it and then in this third file as well I'm going to place my basic HTML structure and let's first create this index dot HTML page so here what I want to put in my body section is going to be an image and I want to put a paragraph of text where I'm going to describe really what this website is going to be about and let me show you something and that is going to be this images folder here so here I have prepared all of the images which we are going to be using in order to build this website so here I have six images so I'm going to put this images folder inside my website folder so that we have all of the files that we are going to be using in this website folder okay and if I open this website folder you can see that it consists of these three files these three HTML files which we have just created so index courses and social media and then this images folder as well okay so the first thing that I want to do now is going to be to put this banner image on my index dot HTML so I'm going to open my visual studio code and in order to put an image to your HTML file you have to use tag for that so I'm going to use image tag so you say IMG and then in order to specify which image you want you have to put source to that image so you have to really specify the location of that image so you say as RC and then here in these quotations you specify the path to that image and as you can see the pet of our index of HTML is this see users Selena desktop website and then our images are really as well in this website folder but in another folder so one folder deeper and that is images folder so we have to specify that here I'm going to say please look on this location here but only one folder deeper so that folder is images like this and then the name of our image is going to be banner okay I'm going to save that and I'm going to check one more time so the name is banner and then one very important thing is that you have to specify the extension of your image and how you can check out the extension of your image you can right click on your image properties and here you see that the extension of my image is dot PNG so I have to put that here as well so I'm going to say banner dot P and G like this okay and now I'm going to try to open this index dot HTML so I'm going to look for it in this folder where I have created it and here I'm going to say right click and then open with Google Chrome okay and this has opened I'm going to close other tabs and as you can see we have shown this banner image on our web page so that was the first thing and beneath this image I want to put a paragraph of text which is going to be this one here okay so it is just basic description so I make programming videos on YouTube code beauty YouTube channel and then here is a description of one of the other tutorials that I have made on my channel it is C++ for beginners if you want you can check it out I'm going to link it here and also in the description of this video and then another thing that I want to add is going to be heading so here I'm going to use h1 tag I'm going to say that the heading for my index dot HTML is going to be cold like this so now that I have saved it and if i refresh it you can see that our text and then our title so our heading actually has appeared here so we have finished this index dot HTML for now let's focus now on our courses dot HTML and this courses dot HTML I'm going to use in order to list all the courses that I have made on my channel and for that I'm going to use a tag which is called unordered list so here I'm going to say you ow meaning unordered list and then in order to put items inside my list I'm going to use another tag which is going to be list item like this so Li and then here as the first item I want to put for example C++ for beginners like this so this is going to be the first item of our list and then I'm going to copy this a couple more times ok and then let's say that my second course was C++ functions like this and then third course was C++ interview questions like this and then fourth course is this one which is HTML and CSS okay so this is an ordered list which has four items the first one is C++ for beginners text after that we have C++ functions C++ interview questions and then HTML and CSS and let's also add heading for discourses dot dot HTML as well so I'm going to use h1 tag and I'm going to say that the heading for this is going to be courses like this so now I will have to open this courses dot HTML in order to see the changes that we have made so here I'm going to really copy this path and then I'm going to open a new browser okay like this and then here I'm going to just modify this index dot HTML into courses dot HTML like this so oh it is courses not vs. okay and as you can see our page has been open so this is also one way to navigate yourself to your web page so you can navigate yourself directly through this address bar or you can right click on your file and say open with and then choose your browser so here we have our courses dot HTML and it is ready as well for now and then the third one is going to be this one here so social media dot HTML and here I want to specify links to my social media profiles you are going to specify the links to yours but the first thing that we have to learn is going to be how you can really specify a link so for that we use anchor tag which is this tag here so you say eh and that here as content you put the text or an image or whatever you want to be shown to your user so you put that here and then here in this start tag you use href attribute in order to specify the link so here I'm going to say each raft and then the link that I want to navigate my user to is going to be this link here so I'm going to just paste this link here like this and then the text that I want to show to my user is going to be just this one here so I'm going to say if you want to navigate yourself to code Beauty you are going to be really navigated to this link here and you will have to click to this text here so now if I say if this and then I'm going to really navigate myself to my social media so you can do that either really modifying this address text or you can rightclick on your file and say open with Google Chrome and here as you can see we have this code beauty link so now if I click on this you can see that we are going to be taken to my YouTube channel okay and the thing that I wanted to show you is going to be really how you can open this link in a separate tab and for that you use attribute which is called target like this and then the value for that active attribute is going to be blank like this okay so now that I have saved this and if i refresh my page and click on this link again you can see that my YouTube channel is going to be opened in a separate tab and my connection is a bit slow but as you can see it has been opened in a separate tab so now I'm going to close this and as you can see here is my link so now we are going to use this logic here in order to build a list of links okay and the one more thing that I want to show you before that it's going to be really as I already said you can specify text here or you can put an image or really any other element so here I want to put an image so as a content of my anchor tag I'm going to put image and text as well so we are going to use image tag and the source of our image is going to be specified by a source attribute and here we are going to put the location of our image and that location is going to be images /youtube so it is this location here so it is C user Selina desktop website which is really the location of our HTML document and then this folder here so images and then YouTube dot PNG okay so I'm going to specify that part of that here so I'm going to say images slash YouTube okay YouTube dot P and G like this so now my dot HTML document is going to look for this image on this here and then it is going to add this images folder and the name of my image is going to be YouTube dot PNG it is really important to specify this extension of your image so now that I see this and refresh my page you can see that this image has appeared but we really have the problem with the size of this image so I'm going to change the size of this image I'm going to say that this image is going to have the width of for example 30 pixels I think that is going to be enough so now that I have saved it and if i refresh it you can see that our image has been proportionally scaled so we have set the width of our image to 30 pixels and it's height has as well been scaled so we have specified one link here and let's format this so that it looks a bit more readable so we have anchor tag which is going to navigate as to this location so to this youtube / c / code beauty which is my channel and it is going to open that in a new tab so because we have specified this target attribute and what is going to be shown to our user is going to be this image so this YouTube dot PNG and that this code duty text as well okay so now I really want to specify other lengths so links of my other social media I'm going to use a list for debt so I'm going to use once more unordered list so I'm going to say ul and then as first list item I'm going to use this code here so this is going to be the first item off my list so I'm going to cut it from here and then paste it here okay and then the second list item is going to be linked to my for example Instagram so I'm going to copy this okay and then here I'm going to specify the link to my Instagram profile so I'm going to copy that it is this link here like this okay and then here I'm going to use my username on Instagram which is this one here like this and here I want to specify image of so Instagram icon Instagram image and the name of that image is Instagram oh okay and it is as well on this same pad so on this same location as my YouTube dot PNG and it also has the same format as my YouTube image but if you need you can check that here so you can really check the name of your image and the extension as well okay so now that I save this and I try to reload it you can see that we have built a list that consists of two items the first one is this code beauty so YouTube channel and then the second one is this true code beauty so Instagram profile and let's add one more oh I have closed this so let's add one more and it is going to be my Twitter account so I'm going to copy this list item once more and here I'm going to specify href so I'm going to specify the link to my Twitter profile so I'm going to copy that from here and I'm going to paste it so this is my Twitter and I'm going to use this Twitter name here and here I want to use Twitter image so I'm going to say Twitter and as well I know the name of this image and its extension you will have to check check that one out in your folder so here I have this Twitter image which has the extension dot PNG and I have specified it here so I'm going to close this and now that I have saved this I'm going to reload my page once more and as you can see my Twitter my Twitter item my Twitter profile has appeared here as well and if I want to test this I'm going to click for example on my Instagram anchor tag here and as you can see my Instagram profile has been opened in a separate tab so I'm going to close this and now we have really built all of these three pages so we have our index page we have our courses and then we have our social media as well so the next thing that I want to show you it's going to be really how you can link these three together so now we are going to build the menu so that we can navigate ourselves through these three pages and for that I'm going to use so let's start building that on our index dot HTML so here and for that I'm going to use another tag that I haven't shown you and that is going to be a div tag and this div tag is really used in order to group elements together so let's say that it is a kind of a container and for now I'm going to use that div tag in order to put my menu tags together and in order to create a menu I'm going to use anchor tags as well so let's say once more that I'm going to create anchor tag and here I put a text or an image content that is going to be shown to my user so here I want to write let's say and then here in my start tag I specify each raft attribute and here I specified the path that I want to navigate my user when he clicks on this text here and the path that I want my user to be navigated to when he clicks on this home is going to be index dot HTML so I'm going to say index dot HTM L like this so this is going to be linked to our index page and then I'm going to copy this three more times like this and then I want to put here my courses so I'm going to say courses like this and I want to navigate my user to course this dot HTML when he clicks on this courses text and then my third page is going to be social media so here I'm going to say social media like this and then when my user clicks on this social media text I want my user to be navigated to my social media dot HTML so here I'm going to put that perhaps I'm going to say social media like this so now we have really created this menu only on this index dot HTML page so I have saved it and now if i refresh my index you can see that this whole courses and social media has appeared ok and now I want to copy this menu on my other pages as well so on my courses and on my social media so I'm going to take this deafed which is going to be my menu and I'm going to paste it here so at the beginning of my courses dot HTML and then in the beginning of my social media dot HTML as well so here ok and now after I have saved all of these three pages if I come back to my index that EML I'm going to refresh it one more time and now I can really expect to navigate myself to these other pages so when I click on home I am at home when I click on courses I'm going to switch to courses and then when I click on social media my user is going to be switched to my social media page so now I can really close these two okay and let's add one more thing that we are missing which is going to be really a horizontal line which is going to separate our menu from this content and for that I'm going to use tag which is called H R like this so that's going to add a horizontal rule so it is going to add a horizontal line after my menu so I'm going to save it and I'm going to copy this HR tag to my courses here and then to my index dot HTML here as well okay and now if I try to refresh this you can see that this horizontal line has appeared and it is really on all of my pages and I have noticed one thing and that is that our social media page is missing heading so our courses has this courses and then home has home heading but our social media is missing a heading so I'm going to add that so here on my social media dot HTML I want to put head Inc so after this horizontal rule I'm going to say h1 and here I want to say my social media like this okay so I'm going to save this heading and now if i refresh my page you can see that my social media heading has appeared so now the thing that I want to show you is going to be really how we can style this so in my previous video I have talked about external CSS and now really I want to show you how you can apply that logic of external CSS to your web site so how you can use one file in order style your website so I'm going to close this and then inside this website folder I'm going to create a new folder which is going to be called styles like this okay and then here I want to create a new file which is going to be our style and for that as well I'm going to use my visual studio code so I'm going to say file new file so I'm going to save this file and place it in my Styles folder and I'm going to name it file dot CSS and save it okay and now what we have to do in order to have this style to be applied to our pages is really to link this style and for that as I already mentioned in my previous video we use a link tag which we've put in this head section okay so here I'm going to say link and then I'm going to say the relationship is going to be style sheet like this and then the path to my style file is going to be specified using H ref attribute and the pet is going to be Styles slash style dot CSS okay so there is one thing that I'm going to add to my Styles dot CSS so that we can really test whether this has been applied so whether this this link works so here in my spouse I'm going to add for example I'm going to say that I want to style my body tag and I'm going to say that I want to add a background for my body tag so I'm going to say that background color background color of my body is going to be lets say this beige color so I'm going to say that and now I'm going to refresh where is it I'm going to refresh this social media and as you can see this beige color has been applied to my social media page but if I navigate myself to my courses you can see that this page does not have any styles nor this homepage so I will have to link this Styles dot CSS on these two pages as well so I'm going to copy this and I'm going to paste it on my courses dot HTML and save it and paste it as well on my index dot HTML and see what so now if i refresh this and if i navigate myself to these other pages you can see that they they have this beige color of body so this page is beige and now you can decide for example that you want all of your headings to have a similar style so you come to this Styles dot CSS and you say please style all of my h1 tags with this background color off for example white green so when I save this and refresh my home page you can see that this heading has gotten this light green background and then on my courses my heading is as well this light green background and then on social media as well heading has this light green background so I hope that now you have really seen the practical use of this external CSS which we have mentioned in my previous video and I hope as well that you have understood how you can build a website I know that this is a very very simple one and not very presentable one but the core principles are there so you are going to have some navigation and then you are going to put the content on each of your pages and as we progress in this course we are going to learn about new elements and we are going to learn new CSS which we are going to use in order to put new elements to our web page and also in order to style them so that they look presentable and nice so if you enjoyed this video and if you learned
