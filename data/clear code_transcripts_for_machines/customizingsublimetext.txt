hello there in this tutorial we are going to customize the sublime code editor to make it look much nicer so we are going to start with this setup and change it to make it look like this and i feel this is much more enjoyable to work with because it just looks cleaner and well it's quite easy to achieve so let's jump right in alright so here i am in my desktop and i have a very basic version of sublime open there is a script right now that says print one and if i execute it i get one in the console quite easy and let me maximize it so that we can take the entire screen space and the first thing i want to achieve is to get rid of a couple of elements so i want to get rid of the tabs and i want to get rid of the status bar at the bottom and all of these can be very easily hidden all you have to do is go to view and here you can hide all the different things so the first one let's hide the tabs so i click on hide tabs and they're gone then i click on view again and then i can hide the status bar which is the bar at the bottom so i click on that and now we already have much more space and finally for the sidebar i can go to sidebar and hide sidebar so already with that we have much more screen space that feels much cleaner to work in the next thing you can do is to set all of this to full screen so if i press f11 we would have even more space and what you can do now is if you go to view again you can also click on hide menu and if i click on that now the entire page is just code so i still have my print and i can still run it but now all of this is looking much cleaner and i can just focus on my code if you want to have your menu bar back all you have to do is click on alt and then you can see it again and if i click on alt again it disappears so you only see it when you actually need it now there's one more thing that might be annoying you but to see that we have to have a bit more code so let me insert a few more lines and now we have quite a bit more code and you don't have to understand any of this this is just a placeholder effectively but what you can see now in the top right there's a minimap of our code which i generally feel is well mostly useless but you can use it if you like to get rid of it all you have to do is go to view and go to height minimap and now this part is gone and now we have what i feel is a much cleaner setup that feels more enjoyable to work in and you could leave it exactly like this and work perfectly well with it but what you can also do if you want to customize it even further is to change all the colors and the styling so let's go through that the very first thing we have to do is to open the command palette and this is a tool in sublime that lets you install a few more external modules and to open it press ctrl shift and p and then you should be seeing this menu and what i want to do in here is to type install package control i already get the preview and this package control would allow us to install different color themes for example so i select this one then nothing is going to happen for a second but then we get the message package control was successfully installed cool and now on the surface nothing has changed however now i can reopen the command palette by clicking ctrl shift and p and if i now type again install package and now i click enter now we get a option of all the different color schemes that we could be installing and there is a very great amount of different kind of styles in here and also a couple of extra modules that can add extra functionality in my case what i want to do is install a color scheme that is called base 16 color schemes so i just click on it and now again nothing has changed however if i open the command palette again now i can select a color scheme and now we can see all the different colors and some are much brighter than others and in here you can well check whatever you feel like in my case i went with a theme that's called base 16 google dark so i just select that and now we have a much darker color scheme which i feel is looking much nicer so this would be a color scheme and this would change how all the colors look in the actual font editor but what we can also do is if you look to the right we can see for example the scroll bar and this would be an element that is only influenced by a theme and so far we only installed a color scheme so those are two different elements so to change these elements we would have to install a theme and this happens in the same process so again i hope ctrl shift and p and i go back to install packages and now i would have to look for different themes in my case the one i went for is called theme cyanide so if they selected i press on enter and again nothing is happening although after a short amount of time we get the message that the theme was installed but that really doesn't matter all that much but so now what i can do is with the command pad open again i can type select theme and now i can select different themes and this is affecting all the other parts of sublime as well and in my case i went with a theme that is called alert which is a bit more on the red side although you can't really see too much of the theme the color scheme is much more impactful but it does add tiny details that make the entire thing look a bit nicer but okay let me go back to my previous code example so i go to view sidebar and show sidebar and here i have all of my code open and all of this is starting to look much nicer there are a couple of small things that i do want to change for example the size of the text and i don't want to have this blinking text cursor i want this to be static and these are things that you can influence in the settings menu so i click on alt again to see my menu i go to preferences and settings and here sublime is going to give me a whole new window and in here i can add a couple of more settings that i want to change and let's start with a really simple one i want to change my font size and to change that all i need is font underscore size then a double colon and now i need a number with the size of my text and you can see it here all of these are the default settings so right now the default setting is 10. and let's go with 16 for now just to make it a bit larger so now if i press ctrl s and save the entire thing we can already see that our bond size has become much larger so this would be one thing i do want to change another thing i would like to change is the blinking cursor because this one really annoys me and to target this one we need what is called the carrot style and here we have a couple of different options the one i want to go for is called solid and if i save now you can see what happens now the carrot or this blinking cursor is not blinking anymore which i feel is making the entire setup a lot more calm what i also want to achieve is that the line i'm on is highlighted so that i know exactly where i am and to achieve that i have to add a new entry in here that is called highlight line let me just spell it properly and all we have to do in here is type the word true and now if i save it we get our line highlighted which makes it much clearer where stuff is or where i'm working in there is one more minor thing that can be changed although that's not too important that if you look at the scoreboard to the right it looks quite large and it's annoying me a little bit but the theme we have installed right now actually has a much smaller scroll bar so i want to show the scroll bar of the theme not the default one and to achieve that what we have to do is type over lay scroll bars and this one has to be the text enabled also in quotation marks and now if i save we get a much smaller scroll bar that is in line with the theme i don't actually know why you need this line specifically i feel like this should be standard behavior but never mind and this is all i needed now there's one more thing that i would like to change and let me close the settings and right now i want to hide this sidebar so i go to view sidebar and hide sidebar but now the problem is that opening and closing this thing again can be kind of annoying so i mapped it to a specific key the key that i don't really know the name of it's the key that's below escape and above the tab and since i never used that key i just mapped it to open the sidebar and to change that all i have to do is go to preferences and key bindings and let me maximize this as well and in here we have all the key bindings of sublime and if you have this bar selected you can press ctrl f and look for different things the one i want to look for is the side under scroll bar and it's not supposed to be focus it's supposed to be toggle so all i have to do is copy the entire line here and paste it into the user settings so all of these are the default ones and these are the ones i specifically changed and right now we could use control plus k or control plus b but i don't want to use either of them so i'd get rid of them and instead what i want to do is to use the key i described earlier so if you just press it you get this symbol and now if i save nothing happens on the surface but if i close this now i can press this button and open and close the sidebar very easily and change between different parts of my code or different code files entirely and alright this is all we needed so i hope that was helpful and i will see you around
