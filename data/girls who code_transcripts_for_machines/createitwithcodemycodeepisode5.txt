I hey guys it's Janet Marga here's Audrey here Brittany here in today's episode my code is called create it with code we will be talking about what you can create and what we have created with code let's get started cody is one of the most creative skills of person can have with code you can write software for literally any technology it's like a paintbrush or canvas that will help you make your next masterpiece not only can you program something technical like saving usernames and passwords you can program an effective video game and the list of things that you can create with code is endless because you can create things with code that have never been made before with code you can do anything you want with the technology that's always around you you can turn your slideshow into a website or you can code a video game for your English project I've created a few games through code one was a pingpong game that was space themed where the ball was an alien egg and you had to shoot it up at the stars to gain more points after seeing the negative effects of anonymous social media something I created with code was a website that allows you to send other people complements I've created a few websites with code one of these is my personal website which is basically just a digital resume that I can send any tech companies that I'm applying for jobs with some other minigames I've created our color code GREEN healthy buns and space cleaners in code green and healthy bunch I worked with other girls to inform players how to recycle and how to make healthier food choices I also made my own original game which was kind of similar to Oregon Trail it was a survival game where the player had to be on an island and try to escape the island while also keeping themselves fed watered and rested and not dying from all the dangers of the island I want to create video games with code while the few textbased games that I've worked on have been really fun to code they're not quite up to the stand that most people expect from video games today so someday I hope that I can make games that have fullon physics awesome mechanics pretty good graphics millions of people drive to work every single day with only one person in the car with code I can create an app that makes it easier for people to carpool as I advance my programming skills I want to be able to open up my own school a school where students will learn science math all the other subjects and be able to tie it back with code I want to create a lot more games of code because I love making them and I love playing the monks are done I also like adding cool objectives and features and different levels and letting my friends try them out so by now it's pretty obvious that all your favorite things that you use each and every day were created with code and that's why I code because I want to create really cool things that people can rely on each and every day in order to make all these things we have all gone through a bunch of trial and error and that is a huge part of coding that's what we cover next week how coding has made us more confident you can check out our past episodes up here and if you want to join our conversation comment below see you next week see you next week see you next week bye
