accessibility and ux and project management and all of the fun stuff so that's why i work at girls who code and a fun fact about me is that i'm a yoga teacher and today was international selfcare day and i taught yoga for my colleagues on zoom today so that's my fun fact let's meet some of our panelists so first up we have sasha diamond i'm the director of web experiences at new york life insurance company we're really happy to hear sasha in her role she utilizes marketing web analytics and product management knowledge to lead strategy and execution of engaging customer facing digital experiences and i was talking with sasha before this event where we're gonna really dive into what that means and what she does all day when she's not working she loves sailing that's awesome and enjoys learning about neuroscience thank you for being here sasha next up we have lisa mcgarth wait lisa is a staff user experience designer um at ge uh and a defining moment in lisa's life was watching toy story everybody loves toy story the first computer animated movie that she had seen inspire and it inspired the technology excuse me it inspired the technology could be functional and creative and she pursued paths in graphic design and computer science such a cool combination lisa i can't wait to hear more about that when she is not at her computer we all live at our computers she can be found with her nose in a book and i'm also a huge reader lisa so i would love to hear what you're reading when we get into some more introductions um and last but not least we have maria garcia a user experience designer and strategist from athena health she enjoys breaking down complex problems to create simple more usable software and customer journeys maria has over a decade of experience working in healthcare and consumer products and while she's worked on everything from voice to television interfaces healthcare enterprise software has become her passion i mean we all need healthcare and software drives everything so i can't wait to hear more about it maria thank you for being here so for all the folks in the chat i can see people leaving comments i appreciate that feel free to introduce yourself tell us where you are in the country i'm in chicago we've got someone in milwaukee here we've got folks in new york we've got my colleague alyssa online in new jersey feel free to introduce yourself in the chat but i want to turn it over to our panelists here for a little bit of an icebreaker i would love to hear about a piece of media that you've been consuming lately that is inspiring you so that could be music that could be a tv show a book a podcast anything you'd like and also while you're at it if you could just share the name you prefer to use and your pronouns um and then we'll really get into this conversation maria would you mind kicking us off with a piece of media inspiring you sure so i am maria uh she her i am working at athena health as emily said in the introduction i am a user experience designer and i'm sure we'll get to talking what exactly user experience is when we dig into this um i am not currently consuming ted lasso but i'm eagerly awaiting ted lasso coming second season coming out tomorrow so really excited about that i have a watch party scheduled with my friends too thank you maria and i just wanted to point out we have folks okay we've got london virginia new zealand middletown connecticut plano texas california thank you all for being here for spending your thursday night with us it's great to have you um sasha what are your preferred name pronouns and a piece of media you're loving today yes i'm sasha diamond i go by she her and first shout out to afifa ali from trinidad my mom is from trinidad so i'm pretty sure um there's a bunch of cousins that you may know down there that of mine so wow small world small um so i'd like to share actually a learning platform that i find extremely influential it's called mind valley if you haven't heard of it it's it has some personal development professional development so if you consider yourself a lifelong learner definitely check it out one that actually really inspired me recently is around lofty questions so it's a question and affirmation method where instead of saying an affirmation like i am influential you ask yourself a question why am i influential and then it kind of does a brain trick where you start doing the little things to really become truly influential so it gave me such a sense of excitement and motivation so just wanted to share that wow the tips and tricks are coming and we're just doing our icebreaker thank you sasha that's so cool and lisa could you share with us a little about yourself and your media choice yeah lisa mcarthur she her i'm another user experience designer at g healthcare uh media is well nontraditional outside of my work but i really am binging on the renaissance of like victorian aesthetics and cottage core and dark academia and just the escapism movement that happened from the pandemic and how we're going back in history so that movement is just really interesting oh i love that thank you for sharing um and just to clarify i'm emily moss also she her and my um piece of media these days i found i was never a podcast listener pre pandemic but now i find when i'm puttering around my house and i'm folding laundry or cooking i've been listening to the daily from the new york times basically every day and each day is sort of a compact story and i really love it because i felt like i've become a lot more aware especially of international news and stories that maybe i wasn't following so if you're looking for a way to get more informed like a little 20 30 minute podcast every day from the new york times the daily that's my my tip so one thing i noticed when i was reading and stumbling over your job descriptions my bad is that you all have complicated job titles so the first thing that i want to ask you is just to tell us a little bit about what your job title means specifically like what do you do all day um and what you know we heard ux we heard strategy we heard all these terms um so sasha would you kick us off remind us what your title is and then what does that actually mean right and i appreciate how that question is positioned what does it actually mean because the same job title can mean different things across companies especially depending on what department you sit in so i sit in the marketing department at new york life insurance company the title of director of web experiences means that i am the lead web producer for our brand's website new yorklife.com so that means the projects i focus on are what you would see if you visited the site whether it's the design of the site subsite sections built for special initiatives or landing pages built for marketing campaigns okay thank you sasha we're going to get into more of that in a moment um maria what is your title what does it actually mean so i think my title now is user experience architect um we kind of switch titles somewhat regularly um and my job is a fairly unique one i think in terms of user experience so user experience as a field is thinking about the usability and the general experience any anyone has with any kind of interface it could be a voice interface it could be your standard software interface it it could even expand out towards customer experience which i'm dabbling a little bit more in so when you think about apple they're the the kings of customer user experience thinking about the whole journey that someone takes when they're using their products so user experience is this it's a it's a somewhat fledgling field it's only been around since uh really in its current form probably about 25 years 30 years and i'd say even 25 years ago it was not something well known so what i do in my daytoday job is i work so athena health is a medical revenue cycle an ehr so electronic health record software um so what you go in when you go see your doctor and they're typing into the system they're typing into one of these kinds of ehr systems and i work on the billing side of it so if you give them their insurance how you get paid so i'm really looking at all of the different users that impact um doctors getting reimbursed for their for their whatever work they're doing um so it's it's really thinking deeply about not just your typical oh it's the you know twitter user it's the but really like what is your medical biller doing in the system and how can we make it easier for them to to do their work how can we make it easier for a doctor not to burn out on spending time trying to just get reimbursed um so i love my job actually i think it's it's really fun to think about this level of complexity thanks maria i think one thing and we'll get to you in a second lisa one thing i want to point out is that we think of tech as being only a specific type of company but actually you know tech underlies so many things that guide our lives whether it's health care or our financial systems or the arts and the tv that we watch and the podcast we listen to there are engineers and ux folks and designers at every type of industry these days so when you're thinking about what you could do in tech that really is an endless field lisa can you tell us again about your title and what that actually means yeah so i am a staff user experience designer at ge healthcare i'm not in the actual creation of our physical machines but i'm actually on the digital side and in my roles like a staff level i work across products and uh so i touch on i mean more in the education space for the people who use our machine so helping them learn how to use say a ventilator a ct machine they have to have a lot of training to know how to use the machine proficiently so i work across that whole kind of education experience of like how can they get aware of the training get by the training take the training and ask and have questions and get support that's awesome i mean unfortunately and sadly ventilators are something we've all been thinking about so much lately um i want to take a moment and note for folks that joined us later that at the bottom of your screen there should be a button that says live transcript and if you want to turn on your closed captions we have enabled that for this event it's something that's new to me and i want to own that at girls who code we're thinking about accessibility for our programs really differently and trying to learn what the best practices are there and so captions are available at the bottom of the zoom now um i want to talk a little bit about what accessibility in tech that's the title of our conversation today for us at girls who code what we're thinking about is when we have a program like this conversation online how do we enable more people to be able to participate with the choices that we've made so for example if we had this event in new york city almost all of you could not have come right even having this event online in some ways is an accessibility choice on the other hand for somebody with different types of disabilities having an event on a computer screen is not their ideal setup right and so we have to be thinking about these balances and different tools like captions to make our programs across the code more accessible so i would love to hear from each of you a little bit about when you're in your work what does accessibility in tech mean at your organization or for your particular job and maybe lisa you could start this one sure so i'm on the digital side uh technology for me ours is i would say in where william at accessibility is kind of fledgling it's not i really thought about they have like a bias to thinking that everybody's ablebodied who operates our machines or who buys our machines uh for me when i'm doing this um my job is more about inclusion so if you can access it that means we're included you could buy this product you could use it and so that's kind of where i go from it awesome thank you for sharing sasha how about you what is accessibility in tech mean at your organization or with your work absolutely with my work as i mentioned it's the website consumer facing experiences what you may see when you come to new york life.com and our team needs to be strategic in the decisions we make so that it balances the user's experience and their needs and also meeting our businesses needs all while meeting the consumer needs so with the user experience and our website we need to ensure that any potential visitors coming to the site can access information in the best way that is for them and anyone coming to the website may have a certain range of abilities or disabilities and there's actually with the americans with disabilities act there's guidelines that we have to follow in order to make sure that our website is accessible but i know that their guidelines are not as they're not laid out very clearly so there's actually another set of guidelines the web content accessibility guidelines that most organizations follow and i won't get too into the details right now but there's so many different pieces of the guidelines that we consider when we develop our web experiences so definitely happy to dive deeper into those yeah we'll come back to that sasha because i would love to think about some of the things that you consider in that work um maria excuse me how about you does this all sound familiar or do you all think about it a little differently so um the we we have kind of a tale of two cities in terms of our software because we have patientfacing software and websites that must be accessible um because it is medical medical so you know getting your health record getting your billing getting all that so we have a big emphasis on the patientfacing side but then when you go to the the user interfaces that the doctors use that the billers use that software was designed 1520 years ago when accessibility wasn't really a thing so what the company is trying to do what athena health is trying to do is figure out how we as we roll out new features and develop new ui user interfaces and uis and experiences how can we make those new experiences accessible and i think that the other thing that i'd like to think about about transactionality is it really is improving how we design overall it's not that we need to to to do something weird in some way that's only going to benefit someone with color blindness or someone with a hearing impairment or someone that has um some sort of cognitive impairment doing those things and keeping those types of users in mind is actually gonna benefit everyone overall um so that's been a very persuasive argument i've found as i've been arguing to have more accessibility standards in organizations that look it's really important to think about tab order and how a screen reader might read this this particular screen because if a screen reader can read it a person that doesn't need a screen reader is probably going to be able to understand and go through it more easily as well i love that point we were talking in our prepresession conversation about how for example at girls who code we got some feedback from one of our students who doesn't have a hearing impairment but does have adhd and she mentioned to us that captions on videos really help her stay focused and get the most out of her sessions and she's been talking to her professors at school about adding captions to online lectures and finding ways you know i love what you said it benefits everybody right um one innovation that you might remember is like on a sidewalk where it goes down into the street they add those little bumps right for people who have sight impairments to know where the edge of the sidewalk is but how many of us have been walking on our phones not paying any attention and then you feel that bump and you're like i should not walk into traffic right these things they benefit all of us um i want to stay on screen readers for a moment maria because that's just a really interesting concept do you mind explaining what a screen reader is for folks if they're not familiar and if there's any other examples of kind of common accessibility tools that we might not be familiar with and sasha and lisa you can add on in a moment as well i'd love to just talk about some of those things that these days are kind of considered the baseline sure so a screen reader you can um i haven't actually used a screen reader in a while to test out any of the the uis that i've developed but um a screen reader will take the code the html code and look at the tags on images and read the information that's on the image out so that the any user who is using a screen reader will be able to understand the structure of the page based off of how the screen reader reads that information so it's super important to think about how you're laying out the elements on that page even if uh you think about the the the design of the visual versus the design of just the code and that is a really important difference because you don't have to have those be onetoone in the sense of you can have styling that makes it render a certain way but then you can have the code be very clean and have it have a screen reader be able to read through it in a way that is very smooth sometimes you go through a screen reader and listen to how it reads a screen and it is the most excruciatingly painful experience you might have might ever imagine because it's it's saying a bunch of links that have bizarre numbering and it's it's awful so um so that's that's one of those tests that you can do as you're developing frontend uis to just listen to it i mean that's amazing i've noticed the trend in a good way on instagram where people write uh image descriptions so that if someone's using a screen reader on instagram and they're not able to see the image they still get a description of what was there and that's just like a very basic best practice um i don't know if you see the chat here payal just mentioned that netflix posted two versions of a trailer today one with an audio description with a voiceover describing the action if there's no dialogue that is such a cool innovation thank you for sharing that um sasha i would love to hear from you if there's any tools that you've seen becoming more common or that you've noticed that have really sort of changed the game around accessibility in tech yeah i'd actually love to first add on to what marie was saying with the screen readers where there's some of the guidelines around making sure you add alt tags for the images to describe what is in the image so when you look at the best practices for writing those descriptions you have to describe what you're seeing not what it's for so if you have a screen reader that's reading through the content and then it pauses on an image you don't want it to say marketing campaign image one you want it to say family enjoying picnic at the park so that's definitely um one of those screen readers and as far as other devices assistive devices i'm not too familiar with uh voice to text but i know that there's also um you know those who are have limited mobility being able to navigate websites with their voice um again not too familiar with those but i think that's super cool that they're able to do that and another one that i've been realizing is becoming more popular is being able to translate websites and apps into braille so i know the google play store has a device that is able to connect to it and translate so that is super innovative and exciting wow that's so cool i hadn't even heard about that um my colleague alyssa who's managing our zoom today just posted in the the chat and she said i love the text to speak uh tool for copy editing we've noticed that girls who code that you know if you write an essay or a blurb and then you have somebody read it out to you including your computer you notice copy editing mistakes and typos and that's like an incredible tool maria to your earlier point that benefits anybody but is designed to support people who need that specific skill um lisa what have you noticed in terms of new trends or innovations in this space so a lot of different things uh to prove the captions if you actually those are in movies you can have a different caption tracks one that has the audio like birds terping or it's just the dialogue and you can get that on the web um and the braille thing another one is you gotta think of there's tools for low vision users they actually use a screen magnifier where they start to blow up parts of the screen so you need to have a very structured content um trying to think oh i love the voice text like on the phones are getting so much better with their accessibility things um just be transparent i am hearing impaired um you can feel free to ask me about that i have been for almost half my life now i wear hearing aids so when i use my phone i have different settings that i can use that can connect to my hearing aids there are if you have vision problems you can bump up the size of your text you can increase the contrast ratio you can have the text voice so there's different ways of even using a touch device to make it accessible so cool and thank you for sharing a little bit about your personal story lisa um i do encourage folks to ask questions not just of lisa but of all of our panelists you can put them in the chat and if we have time in a few minutes we would love to hear your questions um you know one trick that i read about recently you know sometimes when you check a box it turns green like if you're filling out a form online and it shows you that you've completed that section because it it's green but if you're color blind maybe you don't see the change and so one of the design best practices is not only does it turn green a check box also appears right you're thinking about the iconography and the way that these images convey information um so i know we have two ux designers on the on the line here um i would love if we have students that are like really passionate about this kind of work and they want to learn more about accessibility in tech maybe they want to work in this field what have you noticed like what should they be studying in college or what kinds of industries should they consider working is ux the right field are there other areas to study um what would you give advice to students that are interested in studying um maria maybe start us off with this one so the the basic guidelines are the web accessibility guidelines that are published by the the government the wcag whatever i forget version they're on at this point um so just even starting by looking at what those guidelines are is is where i'd recommend getting your baseline they're extremely to session point they're a little confusing and and very thorough but there's lots of great websites and blogs and sources out there that go pretty deep into accessibility i think that it's an interesting field to go into right now um just because i do think that we're starting to build out more user interface frameworks that have accessibility built into them and so if you're interested in building components that will be used potentially by a lot of different applications that's a really interesting way to get involved is to find a place that's that's creating pattern libraries and working in that kind of space awesome lisa would you like to add anything yeah so i think there's books if you want to go into human factors or even uh psychology has a big play and um human computer interaction i would also if you're really interested in this i go seek all those people those communities that are disability communities i mean pick out like there's probably groups there is the deaf community they have these communities like there's the blind community the deaf community if you want to talk to them to learn more about it just expose yourself because i think the more you have exposure to that the more you you start to care about it and you might get more passionate about it and figure out what do these people what do the struggles do they face i think that's a great point as well rather than assuming what folks need talking to actual users which as we know is one of one of the basic components of user experience for anybody right we don't just take a guess we actually talk to our users um by the way alyssa has posted a couple of resources that have come up in the chat so you can grab those to look at later we'll also put them in our followup email sasha any other thoughts for folks that are curious about studying this or making a career in this field absolutely i think what maria mentioned around getting familiar with those guidelines is a good first step and then as lisa mentioned good next step is to actually speak to those who may be in those communities and then even challenging the status quo of what those guidelines are even looking at them today i feel like there's so much more that we can address that if you want to be innovative and think of new ideas there's so many opportunities to explore something else that i recently read is that microsoft has launched games that are completely controlled by eye movement so a lot of the guidelines don't address mobility maybe mobility around being able to navigate sites using your keyboard and tabbing but imagine if you can control every screen with your eye movement to scroll down or move to the side whatever it may be i mean we really are i think living kind of on the cusp right now of really incredible innovation um those are all really good pieces of pieces of advice and sasha something i love that you said was sort of challenging the status quo this goes for all of our college students and young professionals when you get into a new job if you see an opportunity to improve something a process or a product especially to make it more accessible i would personally say that's a pretty good way to impress someone right away if you were to say hey like i noticed that we don't have alt tags on our images you know could i do a project around making our uh making this more accessible for screen readers like if i were hiring you as an intern or an entry level employee i would be very impressed by that kind of initiative um so i actually would like to take a step back for all three of you to think about your early careers a little bit and without doing a whole resume of how you got to where you are but i would love to hear a little bit about maybe where you started and some advice that you wish you had known about the industry that you work in because i could tell you that i just i thought like okay there are doctors and teachers and lawyers and dentists and i'm not sure what else is out there until i got out there and so i would just love to sort of hear a little bit about that moment in your own career sasha would you start this one definitely and i love telling this story because it's a lot of selfrealization moments um so starting way back when i was in my teens probably i was always the kid who was on the web funny i'm now working with the web but i i was you know modifying my aol profile with if you guys know what aol is with with um the html code and myspace and customizing it i had no idea i was working with code at that time i was just googling things and making my own special profiles um so after that you know going to college i actually interned at madison square garden and continued an additional five years of my career there in the traditional marketing space in that space i was able to dabble a little bit in web analytics and realize that i really loved to combining my subjective and objective mind and being able to make objective decisions using data so i actually switched my career path took a huge risk and learned a new skill and from there i started working a little bit more with web experiences analyzing them and being able to offer insights to enhance the user experience and then a next step from that i really loved the insights that i was sharing and everything i was observing that i wanted to be part of that journey in making the changes so i transitioned into this web experience a web producer role so it's all come full circle from customizing my aol profile to now customizing our brand's website if i could actually add through that journey i was always focused on job titles what do i want to do what's that job title i want what i wish i would have known is that focus on what you actually want to do because as i mentioned earlier not all job titles are the same your job title can be different things at a company and you may not be looking for it because you don't know that the role description is exactly what you want that's such good advice and i think you know if you're interviewing asking a question of like what is my daytoday going to be in this role is this going to be a lot of spreadsheets is this going to be a lot of copywriting am i going to be in meetings all day is this project based trying to get a handle on that and then the selfknowledge to know what will actually bring you satisfaction um is really good advice lisa what advice and and tell us a little bit about your early career trajectory all right so i want to see if i was inspired by toy story i actually wanted to be a computer animator i couldn't find a four degree animation school in minnesota if my parents wouldn't pay for out of state so i went to computer science and graphic design and so boy that most of the college career i thought i was going to be a frontend web developer content creator uh graphic wise there and then i got exposed through an internship with uh other students with disabilities and i figured out no i really want to help people with technology and so then i went back to college and i heard about this usability testing i was like oh i want to get in there so i went to grad school and i got a master's in human computer interaction and that was more the start of the path down how do i help people how do we make sure that the things that we create are actually solving a problem and somebody's really facing and so then i went on to my career and i was a software engineer coming out for my first job but then i got to transition that career in that company and i actually built up they never had a ux designer before and i actually got them to switch me over to be a ux designer that's a really great story could you um is gonna indulge me here would you recommend a master's program in human computer interaction or under what circumstances would you recommend that kind of program yeah so this is that kind of program is if you really want to get in depth there are a lot of ux boot camps but a lot of them they don't give you a lot of depth to the field and what is available i would think in a degree if you want um to be really taken really seriously having a four year like having that masters coming out like yeah your user experience is like you got a masters you know what you're talking about so i had like instant credibility um you don't have to though so if you're already in the field and you're in your career and you want to make a switch then you don't have to get a master's you can start transitioning take those bootcamps takes those classes and you can still turn over i i appreciate that advice because everyone's situation is different right sometimes people can't afford to go to grad school they need a quicker transition or they need something parttime but there is a difference right between a boot camp that helps you kind of get your foot in the door versus the indepth kind of program you're talking about and you know i think credentials in some ways can be really problematic and in other places i think especially for women sometimes having a credential can help you make the case for yourself and it shouldn't have to be that way to be super clear but sometimes you need that kind of backup um thank you so much for sharing some of that maria i saw you like nodding along with that conversation i would love to hear about your early career and some advice you might offer sure there's a lot of overlap here um so my earliest sort of ambitions going into college was that i wanted to study the brain in some way um i was very interested in biology and i thought i was going to go and work in a lab and cure cancer or something that was what i wanted to do as a high schooler i got to college i worked in the lab and it was miserable i hated it but the degree program i was in was a joint program between um it was called mind brain behavior so it was a joint degree program psychology biology um philosophy and computer science amazing um and so it sort of melded all these different areas that i was really interested in um and i graduated had no idea what i wanted to do with my life i was like maybe i should be an architect so i went and i worked at a landscape architecture firm and then i said no that's not right either and then i went to work for a professor who was in the psychology area and that wasn't really what i wanted to do either but he let me know about a master's program in human computer interaction um because that's the program he'd come out of and so he kind of sold me on it it took me a few years to really commit to it but then i i went and i got my master's degree and and it was an amazing experience the program that i was in was a very practical program i think that's another sort of factor you need to take into account when you're looking at a master's program in something that's related to user experience there's super deeply technically like human factors playing and i need to understand how to optimize for war kind of human factors and then there's a very practical program like the one i went to which is actually teaching you how to run a usability study how to um do certain methods teaching you statistics and business savvy that you need for user experience um so after that long and winding path to figuring out that ux was a good place for me i've been in ux now for almost 12 years and haven't really looked back i noticed if you see in the chat asthma wrote this sounds a lot like my experience with college haha i think you're not alone right this um i think each of your stories did you notice this you all started out doing something different and wound up here i mean we had landscape architecture we had computer science software development we had marketing right it's just fascinating and i think one thread i want to pull out for our listeners is that you are not committed to the first thing that you do right my first job was in advertising i worked on the ziploc account um and now i work at girls to code right like there's a journey here there's a path you're not locked in and i what i also love about your story maria is that like at each point you were learning like oh i don't really like this so i'm going to shift this direction okay i don't really like that as much and you find your way and it's just you know i think when you are 20 or 21 and you're considering your options it can be really overwhelming and you think well the first job i take is going to be what i do for the next 40 years and that is not the case um so thank you all for sharing those journeys i would like to put one last question to you and this is just in your first job and i'm going to start this round i would like to hear a piece of advice for making the most of your first job whatever that field turns out to be whether it's landscape architecture or marketing or something totally different and i'll start so my piece of advice for folks when you're in your first job is to raise your hand and volunteer for things and we talked about one example already where you if you see something that is not as accessible as it could be you could do the research and figure out how to make it better and that could be something you could raise your hand for but i think it goes more beyond that you could say you know can i sit in on that meeting and just listen in right and invite yourself to meetings and sometimes your boss will say no that one's above your pay grade and that's fine but sometimes you get to listen and then afterwards you can ask questions and you can learn can i work on that project is there a way that i can help and starting to put yourself forward will give you opportunities that you wouldn't get if you sort of sat back on your heels so that's my advice in your first couple of jobs let's start with sasha advice for your first job sure i'll add on to yours and say that part of my internships at madison square garden which i will consider my first job is that i was able to hop around from department to department over the course of three semesters and they all worked together so what really made me a great employee once i was hired is that i understood how they all work together so i was a great partner within all of our projects i understood what they needed i understood how to speak to them and that's the same even when you start exploring how to speak to wider departments how does tech speak to marketing how does marketing speak to business etc so definitely agree with that one the other piece that i would say is as you're mentioning raise your hand but take the projects that scare you if you're not scared you're not going to learn and then you'll look back as you grow and say wow that i could actually do that in my sleep now that's some good advice for everyone at every stage in their career frankly because you otherwise you get stuck in a rut and you know i'm gonna file that one away from myself thank you sasha uh lisa uh so i started as a software developer that's not where i wanted to be so i would say keep your eyes out uh when your first job look around always be aware of the opportunities that exist for you and if you work hard and if you bring up a sound case of why you want to explore something and how it benefits that business they're likely to say yeah go ahead and and try it and we want we want to support you on that at least that's been my experience i love that um especially at large companies which is where a lot of our students start because there are great you know rotational programs and associate programs if you're looking left and right and you're like well that that's interesting i want to try that pitch it i mean maybe not on your second day give it a shot first right but that's such good advice man this has been such an amazing conversation um i i want to thank you all it is a busy thursday in the middle of july i am amazed by we have over 50 young women here with us today that's fantastic listening to this conversation for the listeners we are going to send a followup email to tomorrow and we're going to include some of these links the web standard guidelines the accessibility guidelines some of the recommendations um sasha i don't remember the name of the website you posted the very beginning but we're going to include that too ted lasso for everybody who wants to watch some great tv we're going to put all these recommendations together and we hope that you got something out of this experience whether it's starting to think more critically about accessibility in our lives and our technology or just more broadly thinking about career paths and how winding and creative they can ultimately be i got a lot out of it i filed some advice away so i'm going to ask alyssa to put up a survey for you um for our listeners you can just grab your phone and take a quick screenshot or a quick photo and it will take you to our survey it's like a one minute real quick we would love to hear how this conversation was for you this is an ongoing series if you have ideas for our next conversation we would love to hear them um and i just want to plug for all our listeners that we do have a big event coming up in september it's the grocery code hiring summit so we will have 26 corporate partners some of the companies represented here will be there as well um hiring internships and entrylevel jobs so i'd love you to mark your calendar for september 15th and you will be on our email list that's probably how you got here tonight and you'll hear a lot more about that but we would love to connect you to some of these companies i mean think of the women that you met tonight and think of all the people that you can meet like that um oh ava said is there a different way to get the survey it'll be in the email for you tomorrow and thank you ava for your dedication to filling out our survey i appreciate it and i'm glad that you you're listening in on your phone that's an accessibility thing unto itself
