hi Audrey here I'm Margo Shannon here Britney here and welcome to this week's episode of my code this week we'll be talking to you about what's it like to be a girl who codes let's get started to be a girl who codes is so rewarding to be a girl who codes we sometimes have to break the gender rules sometimes we might be the only girl in our computer science class your gender does not expect how good you are at computer science the main difference is in how other people treat you some people might think that it means you're worse at coding or that you deserve some kind of special treatment it's important to remember that your gender and your coding skills are not related being a girl who codes definitely pushes me to work harder because I know a lot of people aren't used to seeing women in Tech and might be doubtful that I even know what I'm doing but that just gives me the extra motivation to prove them wrong that feeling when you finally debug your code or when you finish a project makes you feel un stoppable I've heard comments before like oh you're a girl and you like coating you must be really into web design or since you're the only girl in our group you can work on the front end part of our project and make it really pretty I think one of the biggest myths I've encountered as a girl who codes is that we aren't as good as coding as boys which is entirely untrue anybody can be great at coding one of the biggest myths I've heard about coders is that if you're not a white male wearing a zipup hoodie then you're not going to fit into the coding seen some people might say that a girl who codes can only code that she can't be a girly girl or an athletic or a nature lover we like to hang out with friends listen to music and play sports a girly girl can be a coder or an athletic star can be a coder as well being a girl does not limit what parts of computer science you're allowed to like and be good at my absolute girl code is to support one another don't tear each other down or view each other as competition I think it's really important to finish any tasks you start and also keep any commitments you make my girl code is to dream every day learn as much as you can strive for the best my girl code is sometimes you just got to try it that doesn't mean you should work yourself to the Bone however if you need a mental physical emotional break take one as a first generation child I'll be the first in my family to go to college and I'll also be the first in my family to pursue a career in the stem field as a computer programmer if people are doubting your abilities the best way to prove them wrong is to stay focused and get your work done because the only thing better than saying what you're going to do is actually doing it people will underestimate you but if you view their criticisms as a challenge and if you stay persistent nothing will stop you thanks for tuning in to our hashir code episode we want to know what your girl code is make sure to write them down in the comment section below see you next week to talk about what code actually is thanks bye thanks bye guys
