hey there I'm Shannon I'm Audrey I'm Brittany I'm Margo we're girls to code and this is our show my code each week you'll hear from us about what it's like to be a girl who code as well as some tips and tricks about learning computer science in my free time I'm a cheerleader a boy scout and it also teach kids in my local community how to code in my spare time I like to do martial arts like karate and I also like to play a lot of video games I love to go kayaking also hiking painting my nails bike riding and so much more I love playing the ukulele as well as playing the violin and filming editing and directing videos I learned to code because I love creating things I want to understand how the apps on my phone work or how my favorite social media sites like Facebook function I learned to code because it gave me the potential career in life I've never thought of before I've always loved games like flappy bird and rolling sky at the time it seemed like magic when I learned that they made this stuff through code and then I could learn the code that they used I thought why not learn it coding lets me create literally anything I could imagine just like typing into my computer I can create the next Facebook Sims or simply code a robot that can perform amazing surgeries I just remember technology always being a huge part in my life I've always been fascinated with technology even when I was really young I wanted to know how everything around me worked I was like how do planes stay in the air how do people make movies why do microwaves get hot how was it possible that with the swipe of a finger and a push of a button all these cool animations would pop up but I always thought the actual technology behind it and the actual coding would be too difficult to understand the fear of coding was only in my head and I shouldn't let that stop me girl should learn how to code because we're a minority in this field since computer science is dominated by men not a lot of products are created for the needs of women code allows you to be as open creative and expressive as you can be but as more women join the field we can have a larger set once you know how to code you become instantly way more valuable for all kinds of jobs software engineering genetics biology even know coding may seem hard and difficult to understand it's actually very fun you can create your own personal website or an app that all your friends can download from the App Store technology is such a big part of our world but there are millions and millions of jobs sitting out there waiting for someone like you to go get them girls have a lot of great problemsolving skills and great ideas companies are looking for you they want you so you should go out and take those opportunities thanks so much for tuning into our very first episode of my code we'll be back next week to talk about what it's like to be a girl who codes questions you can leave those in the comment section below and I'll see you next week bye guys thanks thanks bye you
