hello everyone my name is Ali and today's video is in partnership with girls who code right now I'm going to be joined by one of my dearest friends and a very special guest Frankie hi guys I'm Frankie and I'm 14 years old and I've known Alli for eight years so basically in today's video we are going to be answering some questions that girls who code gave us and talking about our friendship and ourselves so yeah the first question they provided us with was how did you get started in coding okay so we first started in science class in fifth grade when we were asked to build a robot so we built our robot and entered it into our school science fair and the thing that it did was the chacha slide and we made a music video for it that's my thoughts on coding is that a great way to just start thinking more logically and I think it's great that girls who code is helping girls get into coding what are your thoughts in coding Frankie um so I really like coding it's sort of like a logic puzzle that you have to that you have to unlock run code cuz sometimes you do something and you'll get it right but then you'll do the exact same thing and it may be wrong you have to sort of find out what to do well the next question is why don't you think there are as many or why do you think there aren't as many girls in computer science as guys I think that's because in the media definitely um jobs like that are in the realm of maybe more difficult or maybe a little bit more like brain engaging I think they're typically sort of aimed so it doesn't look like girls can do the same things um and I feel like we can and that's probably why yes so next I'm gonna tell you some experience that I've had in coding over the past few years so last year I took a girls who code class and what we did was made a whole website on girls Powerman so we had times you could go to the woman's March and stuff and then we had a bunch of different famous women like Rosa Parks and we wrote all about them so yeah that is super cool so if you're interested in doing that you should totally sign up um so the most fun parts of coding are definitely when you finally get it right after trying and trying and trying and we're doing it and we're doing it I'm making sure that the code is perfect and runs smoothly that's probably the best part yeah I agree yeah definitely okay we need to change basically the question next question is why do we need to change that which is a followup of the question of why do you think there were guys and computer science and girls so um do you wanna answer this one sure so I think we really needed to change that we need to change the stereotypes against remain that they can't really do anything or aren't smart enough because we know we really are and that we can really make a difference in the world yeah um well said Frankie anyway fun facts so fun fact about Ally is that she is a bunny named Chester who's right here he's been sitting on my lap the whole time he's very jester this part of the video he's he just he's not biting me don't worry he's licking because he licks and he's just so sweet a fun fact about Frankie is that she absolutely adores unicorns I'm wearing a unicorn necklace right now I'm not kidding this is like really cool fun guys you can't really see it but it's a unicorn that's really cool thank you anyway we hope you enjoyed today's video um if you did and you're really interested in going to one of these camps um you can go to WWE my campus and email campus at girls who coat dotcom um again the six cities are DC um New York City LA Chicago Denver and Minneapolis sign up fast spots are limited there are many amazing girls in the world who want to code yes go girls yes go girls go girls go girls go girl uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh anyway we hope you enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up if you liked it um and yeah
