I wanted to be a part of girls who code because it was an opportunity for me to try something new I wanted to be a coding experience it's really hard to find like classes and my school doesn't have any clubs it first it's kind of intimidating and you feel like you're not going to get through it and you don't know really how it gave me the confidence to believe that I can learn this sort of thing and I thought that it would be really hard it's become really easy to learn these things and I think that's really cool currently I teach computer science prior to that I was at Howard University I returned to pursue a doctorial degree in computer science education with a focus on artificial intelligence so girls who code is a really good pillar that these girls can stand on to see Tech professionals who look like them who talk like them who sound like them and they encourage them to be the best that they can be and use computer science and everything that you do I personally really enjoyed 2048 just because you sit there and you play the game on your phone and you're like this must have been so hard to code and like you're having a great time but you know I I did it we did it we we can do that stuff we reach this moment where it clicks and then you get the there and it's really great and it's one of the best feelings I've ever had also we get to like bond with each other like even more Sisterhood yeah it's been like really cool watching everyone become so close she had a lot of interest in the same things that I was interested in we're both coming up with different ways to like redefine what our project can be and it's so great to have someone else who's also coming up with ideas I think it's so important that we girls have girls who code for us because computer science field really could use women in technology and seeing how much like I like it and how everyone else in the program likes it just makes me think about how many other girls we can impact with programs like girls who could so we have a summer program we call it our summer immersion program where we put girls 20 girls at a time in a technology company and they learn the fundamentals of computer science they learned you know coding languages they learned how to build a mobile app how to build a website the last two weeks they actually have their own projects where they design or create something whether it's an algorithm or whether it's app I definitely wish I had a program like girls who code when I was growing up um because when I was a freshman in college in my first introduction to computer science course I was one of the few girls in that class and I was definitely one who had never ever had an opportunity to code before so as far as I'm concerned we run the internet you know women Facebook more they tweet more they make 85% of all consumer purchases I think our world is just going to be a better place with more female engineers and soft programmers we should be sitting on the other side
