I think getting out of bed every morning and changing the perception of what it means to be a person in 2018 is really what motivates me I wake up thinking you know what I don't have to hold on to what was okay yesterday I can change that narrative my name is Gia career I am an artist a singer an entrepreneur and a creative never moving me for students for educators for supporters and then maybe the first question under that is what is us or who is a supporter I had started my year at school and I was working at the Whitney and there was this exhibition up and it was all about cybersecurity and how information is being used that's when I thought wait a minute I actually have no idea how the internet works I don't know how my mission is being used and I don't really know what's happening on the backend of social media sites in the social media networks that I'm using on the on a day to day basis like Facebook Instagram snapchat for example I remember the girls who code summer immersion program and I decided to apply because it was the only option that I knew of to learn how to code it was just like there's so many opportunities that our educational base yeah not necessarily have to do with the class I'm thinking a lot of Wiggins we're sort of breaking down the barrier of what it means to be a student and what it means to be a teacher because I think students can learn so much from their teachers but I think teachers can also learn so much from their students when people walk into the girls who code classroom you're surrounded by people who want to see you grow it wasn't about reaching a standard it wasn't about proving to other people that you were smart but it was about learning for your own personal benefit and gain especially in America there isn't a lot of time set aside for figuring it out you have it either have it figured out or someone created a plan for you but there's not a lot of agency in terms of like creating your own path like I'm a connector in many senses so not only do I connect people I can connect to people most recently I've been challenging myself to work with young creatives who are sort of creating their own movements creating their own brands through my organization exploratory year at hoping to encourage people to take on these real world opportunities and continue to pursue their passions because I believe that people shouldn't have to risk everything to follow their dreams we don't have to wait for people to tell us what we need to learn if there's something that we want to know about or learn about we can ask we can search we can create by me personally adopting the philosophy of listening to people and understanding that every person can contribute value to my life I've learned so much about how to help so much about what I can do to better position myself to live the future that I'm trying to create for myself you
