Carrollton is quiet it's more or less just a small royal town everybody has to familiar face so you like always run into people that you know I believe that Carolyn is a wonderful place to raise a family the economy in Carrollton it's gotten a little better over the last couple years but people work and still have challenges making ends meet I mean we work hard but we have kids to raise so that takes a lot of money wake up work and it's got me pretty stressed out to the point where I don't don't really eat like I should I'm a fueler for a rental company they feel that you're constantly like trapped in the rush and while I'm out there on the road I'm thinking about being back here what I'm missing out on it's a constant fight to balance being with your family and going to work do I work these double shifts or do I stay here and followed behind financially in the winter time it's a lot more strenuous he works you know anywhere from 700 in the morning until 400 in the morning the next day seven days a week straight for two months straight he feels like if he tries to get one day off in two months straight but they're gonna fire him it's like there is no job security it's gone poof my work is dangerous I'm basically driving a bomb around the truck full of fuel yeah I mean I know his job is really difficult but he keeps the good eye on himself he won't do anything that you know would put his life in jeopardy my dad works a lot he wakes up early and comes home late I wouldn't want Kourtney to do what I do I wanted to go to college I want her to have more opportunities in life that's why I put Courtney encoding the goal was really just trying to get them comfortable not being afraid to make mistakes and what's that math for when you click to show where it will go okay so every job is gonna I believe have more of a technology component to it company has taught me that nothing comes easy girl see code is a lot more than just coding we cover a lot of life skills asking questions working together and teamwork coding makes you like be able to create stuff I get to see my what I create come to life I put her in these extracurricular activities so she can advance and have a career that's less laborintensive something that she had more time with with her family I think coding will give them you know more opportunity for not only employment but it's also sort of the next craft so what I want for the club members future is to believe in themselves to have selfconfidence just for them to not have fear and find something that they're passionate about Courtney is the center of my world I have had full custody ever since I was in the military she's kept me strong and focused my goal before I die is to just make sure that her life's as comfortable as can be and I'm here as much as I can be for her I like to make stories which means I would like to make them come to life my dream is to probably work at Cartoon Network what she always when she puts her mind to it she can do anything she wants poorni smart she's kind and she's a coder you
