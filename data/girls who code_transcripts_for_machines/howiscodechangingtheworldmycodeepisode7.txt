hi Margo here it's Audrey it's Janet it's Britain today we're talking about how to change the world with code when you think of coding of course there's TVs and phones and computers so there's also a lot of really cool things in the works like selfdriving cars or space shuttles for people who aren't astronauts from Margaret Hamilton whose code got humans on the moon to apples code who got iPhones to work code is changing the world by changing how we use transportation and how we get around it code even influences something is this spaceships one technology that's getting really big recently is 3d printing if you don't know 3d printing is kind of like regular printing on paper except it's with plastic that's melted down then reprinted into whatever kind of 3d object you want code is changing the world by improving lives medicine human interaction and so much more all this technology is definitely going to change the world for the better and it's driven by code what probably cut in solving is how we cure illnesses using code scientists can test out a variety of vaccine and try to find a cure to El if I don't know if you guys have seen the movie big hero 6 but it's basically about a guy who codes a robot to do a whole bunch of medical functions killeen can teach others importance of recycling making healthier food choices and about the lesser known issues such as facetoface driving is one of the most dangerous activities that we partake in on a daily basis because we as humans are prone to make errors and when you're driving a heavy piece of machinery like a car those errors could potentially be fatal if the technology for selfdriving cars was approved and perfected however that would be completely gone my heart belonged to social issues I believe that we can use our programming skills to code for the butter I think it's really important we keep our Earth's safe and livable for as long as possible and we don't damage it horribly for future generations every single day our air and our oceans are getting more and more pollutants code can help solve this issue by making more efficient card and making easier to handle we have a lot of drops going on in this world that I feel like if we are cheaper better for animals more efficient and renewable ways of defaulting water we'd be able to solve at least some of our drought problems we can create apps and other programs in order to make change even if we don't make a hundred percent change Alys we're helping in the process so you've heard about some problems that can be solved with code along with the causes that we're passionate about now we want to hear about an app that you would create to solve a world problem you can share those in the comments section below and we'll see you next week to talk about our mentors attack see you then see you then see you then bye
