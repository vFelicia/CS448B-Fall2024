in our first 10 years as an organization girls who code has proven time and time again that we're about more than just teaching girls and nonbinary students how to code we are growing a movement of over 450 000 students served now and counting my favorite thing from grocery code definitely has to be the community that we build really amazing to know that everyone around you is following a similar life path that you are or at least enjoy something that you do so there's always something to talk about when i was in high school i was interested in learning how to code so i joined the grocery code club at my library and those experiences allowed me to explore my interest in computer science and gave me the confidence to pursue a degree in computer science in college i graduated with that degree in may of 2021 and i'm really excited to start my first computer science job in just a couple weeks i got that job through a girls who code hiring summit and i'm just really grateful for the programs i got to attend and the support i received from girls who code because it really got me where i am today and it's just been so great being a part of such an amazing and supportive community i wouldn't be where i am today without girls who code i've always known that i had an interest in technology but i simply just didn't know where to start but after being introduced to girls to code it has unlocked the door to unendless possibilities in my career in high school i was very timid shy and felt like gender roles held me back from what i could and couldn't be but after finding the girls who code chapter and finding my community i was able to learn how to program become a teacher a mentor a public speaker and it led me to pursue computer science at uc berkeley in college now i'm a software engineer at microsoft and i'm so grateful for girls who code for being that community that let me know that it's okay to be myself and as a queer woman of color and someone with a disability this was so immensely important for me so in girls of code when i was in high school i had no knowledge of what computer science is and i realized that there's such an intersection between arts and tech and it's kind of like a big reason of why i decided to pursue it in college because i learned that oh my gosh i can do something that i really really love which is dance and be able to use cs as a tool to create a whole new version of storytelling you guys really impacted my life like in three main ways so first you guys inspire me every day with your social media um and your newsletter where you inform of what you do second you guys uh encouraged me to make or create a coding club for girls at my school using the code at home curriculum third of all you guys gave me the confidence to apply to a hackathon with my friend where we won the category for best health hack and you guys really turned my life around and i wouldn't be doing any of what i'm doing now if my mother had hadn't discovered you and said and shared you guys with me and i'm just so grateful you
