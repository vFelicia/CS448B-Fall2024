leading global human capital initiatives across the United States Europe and Asia Chelsea loves indoor cycling and actually purchased a cycling bike to bring SoulCycle to her living room because Chelsea's not playing in games after being housebound due to Cove in nineteen and one final fun fact about her they both have supported the girls who code alumni team prior to joining tonight's panel so we are especially thankful that you're giving us more of your time tonight so thank you both for our viewers as always we encourage you to share your thoughts and questions in the chat box and a member of the girls of codes staff will respond and so we want to kick off tonight's conversation with an icebreaker for our panelists the question I'm going to ask you both to think about is what's the most valuable piece of career advice you've been given and who gave it to you and so for our viewers while our panelists are thinking about that give me one second I'm seeing the pull to and cannot see my notes sorry about that for our viewers will be posing a similar icebreaker question for you to answer using the polls feature this will be the first of three polling questions and you will have 30 seconds to respond so for now join us and share your answer to the icebreaker who do you look to for career advice and so Keanu while folks are thinking about that for 30 seconds I want to start and ask you to kick us off by sharing who's giving you the best career advice and what was that advice thanks for asking this is very nontraditional this is someone who has less career experience than I do but the person who gives me the best career advice is my younger sister so she is five years younger than me and she is an amazing freelancer in the graphic design space and her advice is always solid and someone who is always on the go need to make sure things are perfect and I never sit down and head for her the reason of why she gave me was to just sit down and breathe just take a step back and just relax and for her one thing that she does is to take a daily walk so I started taking those opportunities with her to do that thank you so much Kiana that's actually amazing your sister sounds wise beyond her years because that whole sit down and take a moment that's wisdom right there Chelsea I want to ask you the same question what would you want to share with us Chelsea are you there listen I know we had Chelsea so the question is where is she now because I see her so I'm gonna give Chelsea one minute for our girls who code team let's just doublecheck if we can get oh I see Chelsea you're muted that could be a huge factor I do see that you know what we can do let's actually look at some of what our answers are and then we can come back to Chelsea to try to get her answer to this question hopefully that works for our girls who code teen maybe we can start looking at some of the answers we got to our poll in terms of who folks look to in terms of career advice so what I'm seeing here is that our top three answers work parents no surprise followed by teachers or professors and then folks said you know that larger category of just other folks while we're waiting for Chelsea I'll say that for me it is definitely I would say my girlfriend's the folks who are at that same point in their career as I am who I can turn to and just sort of say what do you think about this when the best piece of I've ever gotten is to even if it doesn't seem like to basically give something a shot even if it's not exactly in your comfort zone and I've really appreciated that it's made me think about things that I wouldn't may have may have in the past just said oh I don't want to do that and they've kind of pushed me to say why don't you think about it why don't you give it a shot so any word from the girls who code team whether we have Chelsea and if she's able to join us either audio video or both I think we're looking to get in contact with her okay I'm gonna do something back listen I know she's coming back the question is when and so with that I might keep us moving a bit so thank you everyone viewers for participating in that Quick Poll we definitely want to get Chelsea back but as we're working to do that I want to keep our conversation going because there's so much for us to talk about and we recognize that all of us can use a little bit of advice as Kovach 19 has the tech landscape and opportunities continuously changing and so as we move into tonight's panel discussion we want to find out how students can better navigate all of these changes and so if you're a returning viewer you know that we look to address the concerns of our college staged alumni and students across the country who are in varying stages of their college experience our first question for panelist really has are rising college and firstyear students at the forefront of our minds and so we've all seen the articles and reports stating that hundreds of companies have canceled their internship programs and have Rison rescinded offers many of the cancellation stem from things that you can imagine logistical challenges or from costcutting at companies that are being cautious or who have suffered economic damage from the pandemic this makes it really difficult to land an internship if an offer has not already been confirmed and so the question that I want to sort of start off with for students who are in this predicament with no professional experiences lined up for the summer what alternative skill building at tivities gapfilling experiences or professional opportunities should students pursue in lieu of internships I don't know whether Oh Chelsea you're here thank goodness I was about to say Chelsea you're on but I was going to take a risk so with that I'm gonna let you both answer that question and also if you don't mind just tacking on that little bit of you know the best career advice and who you got it from so we can get like a twoforone yes yes everyone I'm so excited to eat meet you today and to be on this panel best advice I ever received was from my first mentor when I graduated Spellman college and I started working in finance I I was given a mentor to help me assimilate and they said only pursue this career if you're passionate about it and you know at the time we often hear that comment do what you're passionate about do what you love but it really has been one of the most important things that I ever received in my early career years because I've been able to really find work that is authentic to who I am okay so that's that's the answer to that question and then I'm your next question oh I love this question because I've been thinking about it is there's so many brilliant students across the country who are finding themselves in this situation right because of coded and the thing is there's so many things that you can do without an internship and that's the first thing I want to mention to you even that you have a vision for a dream internship you can use this time to really hone in on a skill set explore a new hobby or interest I was speaking with my mentee earlier today and she said I lost my internship what do I do and I said what are you passionate about she said marketing you know I want to get into the marketing space and I said you know what with technology you have every resource within front of you from YouTube to podcasts to TED Talks to books everything is in front of you so you really want to make sure that you're taking advantage of those resources so that's what I would say for students leverage what you can lever what's within your reach Chelsea thank you so much I love that answer because it's so accessible and it's stuff that you overlook because it's a party or day to day and you don't think it's a skill building activity when it can be keanu what do you think about this question especially with these internships potentially evaporating what advice do you give around the skill building component my advice is actually similar to Chelsea's and in the regards of building on your skills or even building on skills that you hope to learn for example there are so many free courses now and I feel like right now people are willing to have informational interviews and show your even job shadowing opportunities one advice that I gave my sister was to build your own curriculum like you may not be in a summer internship and you can build your own summer curriculum 900 to 500 you should be doing something whether it's informational interview at 1000 to 1100 and then 1100 at 1200 you could be taking free Coursera courses in that at 12 to 1 you can be volunteering at a local nonprofit to support their social media campaign I think volunteerism is something that's really overlooked and that's an experience where you can really gain those transferable skills even though you may not be getting paid for it I love that answer also and what's amazing about it is that you're kind of marrying empowerment but also structure because this is a really tough time for a lot of people where a lot of these internships sort of giving you structure in the absence of that sometimes it can be daunting so I love the tiny blocks as an idea so thank you so much for sharing that I also want to be really transparent about where how we've thought about this at girls who code we also made the tough decision to cancel our summer internship program for college aid students considering the significant financial obligation and the inability to guarantee office space for our interns however we are still very much interested in providing collegeage alumni and students with the opportunity to join a college loop nearest their location for more information or to enroll click on the link that has just been placed in the chat box and you'll hear from a girls of code staffer in the near future and you know moving along in terms of other questions our next question speaks to current college students who may need internship opportunities to fulfill course requirements which is a whole other thing we know not all hope is lost for college students because all internships have not been cancelled we know a number of banks and technology firms have shortened their programs by a few weeks or have converted to virtual experiences so here comes our second poll for our viewers please let us know the status of your summer plans and if you feel prepared for internship opportunities by answering the poll question on your screen please remember you have 30 seconds to respond and while we wait for viewers to respond Keanu and Chelsea our next question for you is what should students do to prepare for virtual and post kovat 19 internship opportunities what types of candidates are employers looking to hire currently and overall and maybe I'll start and just ask Chelsea if you'd weigh in on that question yeah sure I'll start with the skills first if I think you know that's something that that's a little easier to discuss and the skills front I actually had been doing quite a bit of research there's an organization called the National Association of Colleges and employers and they're all the universities and colleges across the country and many employers of early career talent and I was looking at their report of the most important skills that are necessary for for students and what tops the list is I'm solving being a strong critical thinker communication skills written and oral your ability to manage time intercultural fluency which is how you connect with who are different from you which right now we could be all learning about the importance diversity inclusion and equity right that matters for organizations and so those skills are going to be pivotally important data analysis okay that's very very important how do you use technology certainly girls who code is leading in that space but across the board how do you use technology to communicate with people it's likely you will be on a global team or you'll have colleagues who are across the country so you want to be prepared with those skills and so I would say that that's really important on the skills piece the second side of this conversation has to do with what you can do right for some of you who don't have a formal internship you can be using now to refine your story you can think about the marketing material your marketing materials your resume your cover letter LinkedIn and you can make sure that those are topnotch because when you do get on campus it's likely that employers will start to explore options for the Fall getting back in in terms of engaging students in a way that they can this is what I'm hearing and so you don't want to say I'm gonna wait until the fall you want to start to build your story and start connecting with employers now that's gonna be critically important the last piece all share is LinkedIn I have heard that girls who code scholars have lengthens that's what episode I've told you want to make sure that you're getting used to LinkedIn I'm connecting with people certainly kuna and I we want to hear from you and anyone else who you connect with you and each other start to build those connections virtually because they're gonna be important when you start your job search thank you so much Chelsea that is an amazing answer and so thoughtful before I hear from Kiana I'm actually gonna tell you what our viewers said so 5% of our viewers have secured an internship and feel prepared for the experience so that's amazing shout out to you for feeling that way 8% of our viewers have secured an internship experience and do not feel prepared so again some of this talk is very much focused on being able to support you 60% of our viewers have not secured an internship and don't know how to prepare thank you for sharing that this informs this very conversation and we'll try to be as responsive as we can to that and finally 19% of our viewers haven't secured an internship but feel prepared for the experience which is also great we want to thank viewers for your bravery and candor and just letting us know where you are because it really helps our panelists and with that Kiana do you want to also respond to sort of the preparation and just what you hear coming out of this polling data from our current viewers yes thank you all for sharing your your situations and where you are right now it definitely is helpful as I'm speaking for the to the next point and that next point is to keep looking for opportunities there's still opportunities out there there's still time there are companies who are seeing what's happening and are getting creative so whether it's a parttime internship an unpaid internship or even a virtual platform that they're building so that and students can get in touch with their coworkers air colleagues and employers those are still out there from what I would start with your career services office I as a university recruiter I know there is a strong network of university recruiters and career services out there who really want to support students during this time so start with your career services office set up time on their calendar just to figure out what would be the best game plan for you and you never know who they mean who they may know and what opportunities that are on their desk from there take advantage of virtual career fairs and virtual platforms that are out there I know Chelsea mentioned mace that's aligned AT&T now has a summer virtual platform and this is an opportunity for students to gain professional skills some that Chelsea mentioned such as problem solving time management these are courses that you can take on your own on your own case and you can still put this on your resume as a certificate or a program that you've done throughout köppen 19 and how you build on your skills and they're really interactive so you feel like you're gaining something from them and then lastly is to work on your contacts so whether it's through your career services office or your own personal branding and folks in your network on LinkedIn but even also your alumni of girls to code or alumni of your University definitely leverage what's out there because there's still are opportunities so don't want you to feel like it's time to give up one thing that Chelsea mentioned was problemsolving skills that is so important as a candidate and that is why employees are always looking for that's something I look for in candidates especially right now this generation is the biggest problem solvers they're the biggest group that I know to be able to get creative during this time and figure out how they're still going to navigate and figure out their summer plans another one is curiosity and positivity I know it is hard to be positive especially with all that's going on right now and this week in the news and media but that's definitely something that we look for and candidates and how they really put a spin on things you make it seem like no I didn't on an internship during this time I was able to bid on XYZ skills through these opportunities can I thank you so much for that and it's especially meaningful because we know that you actually run the now virtual internship program at Xander's your perspective is so valuable I guess I have a followup question both for you and for Chelsea where should students actually be looking for internship opportunities are there websites companies influencers in the tech space that you think our viewers should be following and just thinking about right now because obviously everyone is on the hunt for something Chelsea do you want to start with that sure sure can't I already got us started on that by talking about LinkedIn that's a big one I will tell you I was on LinkedIn an hour before this session I feel that every time I get on LinkedIn someone is posting a new internship opportunity something that they're designing for for students right so this particular organization called guild education out of San Francisco area um they just announced today an internship first they market it for graduates but then they said we want to support recent grads too and so it is a projectbased internship seven different seven to eight different divisions and they're gonna create a project so it won't be the full internship experience maybe you're used to but you're still gonna get the skills you're still gonna connect with new people you're still gonna understand this ecosystem of Education and reform and Workforce Development so every day people are trying to get creative to support your generation link and Chelsea's opinion is essential for students and for certainly if you're a graduate and I think it you know lengthens important regardless of your industry or sector because that is really like a virtual it's like your virtual rolodex of relationships it's like replaced all these business cards that maybe you were used to collecting at one point now have it all online like sign me up for that right so card is what are you saying that's but I do appreciate you saying that so pointblank you need LinkedIn so if anybody's on on the line today Lily and even they're an amazing organization because they put a lot of free content out for students as well on the college code website and I believe it'll be shared in the email in the chat you will see one thing we have is the LinkedIn checklist it's basically for people who need help refining your page it's a onepage or LinkedIn is created for students so you have an optimal profile that helps you connect with employers and professionals that's the kind of stuff that you want to be using handshake is another one connected to colleges and universities and then indeed I think is just another search engine that it doesn't hurt for you to check that if you want to talk about local opportunities in your city or your state Canon did I miss anything amazing Chelsea especially the concrete resources that you're pointing to and we're gonna try to capture as much of what you said to share with our viewers because those were amazing and kyaaa that is the right question what did Chelsea miss if anything Chelsea that was amazing I think you cover it up most of it and with LinkedIn I feel like people get at least I can say from my personal experience I was worried about LinkedIn because I needed to pay for a premium or I needed to put in split some cost down to take their courses I think this is a great time and check in with your university they may have with your Career Services offices office they may have an opportunity for you to gain free courses through LinkedIn through Coursera and check out some other open internships some of those may be a future math they have an internship program where their deadline is tomorrow at midnight so you still have time intern hacks comm is an opportunity for students to participate in a projectbased internship and also check out some awesome like freelance opportunities one freelance job or that I like and I referred to my younger sister is up work so that's where you can literally just put them profile together what are some of your skills that you want to build on or you want to share you can even get paid for it so those are some platforms that I would take advantage of and that is I'm using I feel like we are absolutely inundated with some really really cool resources that our viewers can immediately go on and check out and hopefully build their own profile and gain access to some of these opportunities that might not be readily clear people are still out there so we appreciate that very much I also realized that we should plug our girls who code hire me our career readiness platform specifically for our lungs we have internships and job opportunities posted there from our corporate partners who are looking for talent so please don't hesitate to check that out or reach out to us should you have questions around that and I want us to pivot actually to focus on how virtual internships will impact soontobe graduates full time employment opportunities we talked about different folks who make up our network and we really want to think about soontobe graduates with this question so the typical internship includes opportunities for professional development leadership interaction and time for special projects some students fear the virtual internships will deprive them from the most important aspects of the experience networking opportunities that could lead to fulltime employment everyone knows that that FaceTime that connection the way that you you know have that opportunity to come in contact with all these professionals could help who could help you with your professional trajectory this is a really big fear so companies who have little to no experience with remote work before the summer and will be using this opportunity to establish a set of best practices which if we're going to keep it real may mean that they you know experience might be a bit rocky in these virtual settings so the question for both of you are virtual internships worth it and will employers see them as valuable professional experiences when applying for fulltime roles and so Keanu I'm gonna start with you and then ask Chelsea to weigh in thank you I definitely see virtual internships being worth it and something employers are looking at especially this summer and I'm looking for fulltime hires after Coppa 19 as we mentioned there are many transferable skills that you can build through virtual internships and through projectbased internships and the most important ones that we mentioned were problemsolving time management and a curiosity and also the networking piece that you mentioned those are still things you can get from a virtual internship or even you billing your own summer curriculum I feel like now more than ever people are leading connection and feeling the need to reach out to folks and have conversations on a regular basis since we're not in the office chatting with people in the cafe or in the restroom like this is the time where people definitely are putting their hands and arms out there to reach out to folks who are looking for opportunities jobs or internships so I think that networking piece you can definitely hone in on as well as the other skill sets that you're looking to build through a virtual internship me personally with our Xander internship we are doing a lot to make sure that our students still feel a part of the business and supported that sense of belonging but also guilt building on those skill sets that they're looking for so there is a way that companies are getting really creative with these opportunities so I won't I definitely don't think you should miss out on them thank you so much Chelsea what would you add to that first of all it's so awesome that Xander's keeping their program I mean that that's huge because there's so many organizations who have had to pivot and to cancel listen this is the thing it's less a question about preference and more a conversation on the reality of where we're moving with work and for some of you you've probably heard the term and maybe not future of work it's this buzzy fancy topic that's like what's the future of the workforce what's the future of how people will get jobs what's the future of the skip what's the conversation on the skills and jobs that are necessary and this is really a conversation about how work is changing it's a conversation about can you work effectively remotely could you be in California or sis or New York City and get your work done or do you need to actually be in physical space with with your colleagues now I'm a fan of working with with people but it's a business conversation so students what's the point for you you're building a skill even if inter even if virtual internships is a thing of the past there's a skill that you're building in connecting with your colleagues who are multicultural multigenerational they live in different places in the country you are building the skill of being able to communicate over a computer or over the phone and so I would look at it more as even if this is the only time I do it how can I maximize this experience so that I have a new skill set under my belt that's what you want to be asking yourself because again it's likely for some of you you will try a virtual internship and your full time offer could be virtual some organizations may say we're going to go completely virtual it's very possible and so you weren't gonna start flexing your muscle and look at it as an opportunity Chelsey I love that answer and it resonates so much because you're right we're talking within this one moment this one paradigm where everything is turned on its head because of the pandemic but truth be told we are moving closer and more fully into understanding virtual taking up rather than like five percent of a company's time it's upwards of 30 50 70 everyone was kind of coming to this understanding collectively and I love that you said it's about skills and that no matter what a virtual internship is still a valuable skill building experience so thank you so much for sort of wrapping up our panel portion of the discussion on that wonderful high note I want to thank you both in terms of just you know how amazing you've been in answering those questions and we want to pivot now to actually open it up to Q&A so we selected questions from our girls to quote alumni in community who are viewing this conversation and would like further items the first question comes from Andrea W there are a lot of unpaid and remote internship opportunities online now do you foresee internships being remote from now on since they can be more flexible and they potentially paste students less so very similar to what we were just talking about with a little twist especially that part you know being a little bit more flexible and paying less I don't know count if you want to start by just giving us your thoughts in response to that this question I definitely thought of the future work how many companies are going virtual anyway at the same time there is a value in on onsite interviews so I'm not too sure there are definitely key points and a value of it for example the candidate experience and really being able to show the culture of a company that's something that you really get from a onsite experience and that's something that companies are considering right now as we're hosts or like figuring out open 19 for us personally up dinner I know there is also like onboarding considerations and onboarding is the most important part of an employer and an insurance experience at a company that can to pick if they stay at the company or not how long they're there if that onboarding piece isn't right then it could slip and that's something that companies are also thinking about so it's a it's a toss up we shall see what happens the last point on internships virtual internships being more flexible and students being paid less I'm not quite sure about it I think I think internships are still they I won't say I want to sue that they're all very as much flexible even though their virtual they still have 900 to 500 900 to 600 and students are still expected to be at their computer and their dust during that time even though we can't actually see what's happening they're not still in expectation and for many internships where students were already getting paid for the opportunities but it changed virtual they're still getting those hourly rate wages or salary for that opportunity so I wouldn't assume that for all opportunities or all virtual internships thank you so much Kiana for giving us so much info on that especially the kind of spicy question about pay or accountability or what it may look like and the assumptions we have about it being less than in fact it might be very equal to what the other inperson experience is so thank you for weighing in on that Chelsea what would you what's your response to that well you were you were speaking so eloquent eloquently about it because I was going to say I think the presumption is that you're getting less or that it is unpaid when in actuality in many ways employers will save money large companies mediumsized companies are intern programs there's an investment right there's a fee and having your interns how much you're paid interns but then also all the programming all the free swag and snacks you get even though all the events and so there's a cost to that and so now that sadly that won't be a part of summer 2020 or even fall you know forward fall intern recruiting a lot of this is speculation we don't know but I would say I think most employers want to do the right thing by early career talent you are a part of their future workforce and really a part of their career employee base and so you know they want to make they want to make you happy they want you to be excited about your role so I think most people are going to try to keep pay and competitive pay and benefits and perks where they can even even through times like Kovac so this year we might see a shift in an adjustment but I think when you think about the full space of university recruiting culture and let's also talk diversity and inclusion this is girls who code there's also a big focus on how do we provide diverse offerings and benefits to our employees so I don't think it's something that people are ignoring you know I appreciate that and I think both you and Kiana touch on sort of like all of a sudden onboarding doesn't go out the window all of a sudden valuing you know people who are coming on board doesn't go out the window these are still internships that could result in a full time opportunity and wanting to bring you into that full experience so I'm glad to hear you kind of support that companies are giving this thought and that folks shouldn't assume that as you said that it would be a less than experience so thank you for sharing that so our next question is from Lena G what skills or experience should internship and job seekers highlight on their resumes to get noticed by recruiters during this time Kiana do you want to start with that one yes I think we mentioned some of the soft skills that some of the hard skills such as the skills that I would recommend that employ candidates or interns have on their resume are any certificates or courses that they're taking during this time there's a way that you can add that onto your resume you can put it on there you can have a link to it and the date site you took that course and a brief description of it you can also put any volunteer opportunities that you're currently involved in or expecting to leave all involved in you can put that on your resume as well and continue to ask folks especially with LinkedIn now your virtual resume you can ask folks for endorsements or recommendations through LinkedIn so even if it's a freelance opportunity that you're doing ads out on the add them on your portfolio I think employers definitely want to see that and I can make your resume stand out thank you so much for sharing that Chelsea what would you add if anything yeah yeah the two things that come to mind the first more technical quantify quantify your experiences some of you say what does quantifying means you're telling a story by telling me the impact of every statement that you have for every role or responsibility leadership role internship that you've had just simply saying I'm a part of the marketing Club I send out social media I take care of all social media efforts you had to give me more information how many people are you reaching through social media how often are you posting what platforms are you using when you give an employer all that information they can really think about your impact they can think about all that you did to make a difference and so I want all of you to think about your resumes and make sure that you're telling strong stories the next thing is you want to make sure that your resume really speaks to who you are you want to be authentic I say it all the time never add anything on your resume just be very truthful to what you cook that's really a part of who you are because when it comes to the interview it's just gonna make that process a lot more easy because people will be using that as their guide to interview you I can remember my Wall Street days where there were some students who fluff their resume with hobbies and skills that I really care about and it came up in the interview and their response turned the interviewers off because it wasn't authentic and it completely you know messed up their chance of getting the internship so be yourself highlight your skills highlight your story and don't shy away from it because that's gonna be the competitive advantage that you have to stand apart from the rest I love that thank you so much that is sound advice and you know it's always important that you never add extra things to your resume that you don't need to add to your resume so thank you for doubleclicking on that we have we're down to our last question and so it comes from Lance ET do you think the possibilities for international students would be lower if everything would be virtual to get sponsorship for work a work visa after graduation so that's a little bit of a curveball I don't know if either of you are prepared to think that's through a little bit but anything that you can say in support of our international students that would be helpful at this time we will take it and you know Chelsea I know you just spoke but why don't you jump in and tell us what you're thinking and then I'll ask Keanu to wrap up that final Q&A question yeah I mean the biggest thing I could say about inner international students so much of it is employer to employer sponsorship is very much employer to employer stay in the game that's the biggest thing I could say because and I think we talked about this earlier keep that hope keep that grind going keep those connections strong don't tap out because right now it's difficult and I want to acknowledge I understand the current the current situation okay it's something many people are very aware of and so you want to be mindful of what where we are now but understand in the fall things can shift dramatically so you want to be ready right you want to continue to connect with people you want to continue to build your story and your marketing materials your resume your cover letter your LinkedIn and you want to explore all options I'll end at this point sometimes we have one particular lens or pathway that we think is B pathway but we were talking earlier it was brought up up work I believe I'm piano Matthew mentioned up work or five or any of these freelancing opportunities you gotta work the skill if you have a skill that skill can be leveraged at a company it can be leveraged at a nonprofit it can be leveraged for small business for a freelancer themselves think about your skill and how that can be used in the marketplace and I believe that that will help you advance in your early career days see thank you so much for that keyonna what advice do you have for international students my voice is very similar to keep the grind going keep your relationships that you have and keep on working on yourself because as Chelsea mentioned you never know what's going to happen one thing I didn't mention in the last question and this goes to all students is your skills that you're building definitely feel free to add those especially if they're like concrete visual skills for our technical folks are creatives out there if you have a github or project you've been working on definitely add that to your portfolio I know from my sister that's one example she does graphic design and it's been hard for her to find an opportunity so definitely for her I'm not encouraging her to keep on working on your portfolio you want to continue working on typography this is the time to do it you know start watching videos staying connected with folks and adding whatever you're building or you're learning put it on your your resume you can create your own website now and a lot of those are free now so those are some things I would keep in mind and as Chelsea mentioned keep the connections going you never know what can happen and what is next to come so I would say one thing with that is follow up is so important I feel like people reach out to me and we have a great conversation but I don't here for them I don't hear from them for like months or never at all so I think it's important to follow up especially during this time you can send a brief message to someone who you looked up to or someone whom you haven't spoken to in a while but you really admired go for it and just saying hey I've been thinking about you and I enjoyed your conversation that we had about XYZ I'd love to check in I'd love to follow up I love when students I've worked from the past they give me an overview on like what they've been working on or like what's happening or and update a life update I love that because I never know you never know when an opportunity can come up and like hey I just had that conversation with Alex let me hook him up or let me share this opportunity with him and may I just add one more man add something really quickly because I think that piece about follow up is so essential even if that's the one thing that you take away from today I just I have to speak to that because I'll give a very out of a quick example a week ago a similar webinar it was a global webinar so we had about 800 students on we had 100 come to LinkedIn and connect with us on LinkedIn but I had two who found my email they found my email someway somehow they found the email and they were the only two of 850 who actually went that far they took it one step further to send an email to connect we're busy but we make time for persistent persistent I'm the students and professionals what's my point those two students emailed me I didn't initially respond they followed up and I said about 45 minutes to speak with both of them and now like we're connecting them to different resources stay committed and consistent please when use when you don't hear from someone don't think that means they're not interested in speaking with you people have a million and one things that they're doing but your persistency and patients at the same time are really important to make sure that you keep the connection strong I love that story 800 but two who followed up and then followed up again because you can get back to them right away and then you were able to connect them I love that our networks are so vital and so remember our sisterhood is also this network the fact that both of you have made yourselves available tonight you will as we talked about here from our very diligent resilient persistent alums and other women who are in our network so look out for those and I just encourage our network to realize and sort of soak in all of this wisdom around followup and the network because it's such a powerful thing I want to thank you panelists for your amazing you know responses I want to thank our viewers for the questions that came in and for everything that you shared on your candor and responding to our polls we have come to the end of our
