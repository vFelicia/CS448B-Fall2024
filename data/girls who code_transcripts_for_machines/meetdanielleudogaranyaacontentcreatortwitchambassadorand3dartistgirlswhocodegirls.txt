hey y'all my name is Danielle I also go by ebonics and I've been modding for The Sims for up to seven years you'll probably know me from this hair this one most likely this one this Kitty and if you play with moddy note this logo I love what girls who code did with girls who code girls which is a desktop and mobile experience to get girls into coding by allowing them to create their very own Femme or nonbinary video game character using Code I was mind blown with all of the opportunities that I was able to see using code to create and build a video game character I was like Wow Wow is this will be missing so here is my coded girl and I had to bring her to the Sims so in doing that I took myself to blender to create the outfit and then went to the Sims to match my coded girl in girls who code girls so we gave her the same outfit the same hairstyle same physique and everything and you know what this is really important to me by allowing players to create cards that look like them it really gives you a sense of self and so this is what I want y'all to go visit girls who call girls I need you to go check out girl2codegirls.com to go and code your character and then mod your character into the game that you're playing I would love to see it let's give this industry an update please we need it
