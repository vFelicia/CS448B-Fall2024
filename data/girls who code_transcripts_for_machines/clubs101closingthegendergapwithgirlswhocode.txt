hi there thank you so much for taking the time to learn more about girls who code and our free clubs program for third through 12th graders of all genders my name is Anna I use she her pronouns and I am the manager of Outreach Communications and events at girls who code my goal today is to give you a better understanding of how we can work together to close the gender gap in Tech by bringing girls who Codes free clubs program and resources to your community in this webinar you'll learn about girls who codes impact and our Global movement to close the gender gap in technology we'll then dive into the club's program and how it works and finally you'll learn how easy it is to start your own free club with our support so let's get started girls who code is an international nonprofit dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology and empowering the change makers of Tomorrow our organization tackles issues impacting the gender gap representation Workforce Development and opportunity for historically underrepresented groups in Tech we do this by providing free computer science programs that Inspire educate and equip young women and nonbinary individuals with the skills they need to pursue 21st century opportunities our vision is to build a pipeline of technologists we want to send more young women and nonbinary individuals into the tech Workforce achieving gender parity and entrylevel tech jobs by 2030 it's an ambitious goal and with your help we know we can achieve it since launching in 2012 Gru code has served over half a million young people through our inperson and virtual programming out of the 580,000 individuals we've served thus far we've welcomed 530,000 Learners into our free clubs which introduced third through 12th graders to our pipeline of programs more than building skills and interest we work to position our alom to secure technical jobs early in their careers our Workforce Development programs have supported 6,000 participants in critical career defining phases with opportunities like our hiring Summits putting our skilled alums directly in front of interested hiring partners and it all begins with clubs club members receive priority consideration for placement in girls who codes Workforce programs we're proud to say 53% of program participants are from historically underrepresented groups in Tech and we have almost 200,000 college and postol age alums even more exciting these alums are earning computer science and related degrees at seven times the national average and for our sixth through 12th grade Club participants specifically we see incredible gains in computer science skills career awareness and awareness of the contributions of women in Tech behind our stats are real stories of professional and personal development we're so proud of alums like Winfred Frida and Gabrielle who started in clubs they fully embraced the values of girls who code and went on to top colleges and universities with scholarships Awards and a passion for computer science of course it's one thing for us to tell you about the club's program it's another to directly hear from club members obne Angela Alyssa and Mia are Club participants who joined us last year to talk about their experiences with the program let's hear what they have to say about the impact of clubs participating in girls who code has helped me take away like the fear of like computer science from like this like abstract concept to actually something that's easy to do and or not easy every time but something that's like feasible and like a stepbystep process I think having that like more relaxed environment where people can just like gather and like work on what they want to work on and just talk with each other in the process really creates like a really conducive environment for learning yeah I think the club built a really strong community in our school and like everyone in the club hangs out with each other outside of school and we help each other with assignments not even for computer science sometimes it's for like other subjects as well being in a club that is just only all girls who all want to work on the same projects or just pursue the same computer science it just makes me feel more motivated to want to pursue computer science in the future wow these stories offer powerful testimonials about club's impact on young people we look forward to bringing the club's experience to your communities and Young Learners so let's shift gears and dive into the details of girls who code's largest program girls who code clubs are free programs for third through 12th graders of all genders and skill levels and they can be used in diverse nonprofit settings like schools libraries community centers and other nonprofits designed by expert Educators clubs prepare Young Learners through a unique combination of projectbased content and complimentary resources to support short and longterm success we believe all girls and gender nonconforming young people can change the world through code and we aim to serve them all especially those who are underrepresented in computer science in terms of race Creed or background who are free and reduced lunch eligible who have little to no access or exposure to Computer Science Education and those who identify as female regardless of gender assignment at Birth or legal recognition our clubs specifically welcome members of all genders and that includes boys our club's program content is rooted in an educational philosophy defined by three Central pillars by emphasizing more than code clubs go beyond computer programming skills to support a culture of bravery and confidence building our club's curriculum hones young people's computational thinking problem sing abilities and creativity clubs also Empower members to be brave and take risks building resiliency and a growth mindset to tackle challenges in Tech and Beyond club's emphasis on Sisterhood creates safe environments where members know they belong members feel supported through an emphasis on community and diverse representation in the club's curricul ulum Sisterhood activities strengthen social emotional development and gwc Tech spotlights on diverse innovators change the image of what a programmer looks like and does for young people plus once someone joins our supportive and diverse Sisterhood they are a member for life with access to a network ready and excited to offer community and career support of course we understand that Young Learners need more than programming materials to be successful by PR prioritizing real world relevance and impact clubs Show members how they can use computer science to change the world and we Empower them to use CS skills no matter what they want to accomplish as part of this all clubs have access to Unique virtual events like Computer Science Education week workshops featuring volunteers from our industryleading corporate partners and gwc challenges presenting real world thematic Tech challenges with opportunities to win prizes to cater to the unique learning needs and styles of students in different age groups we've divided our clubs program into third through fifth grade clubs and sixth through 12th grade clubs the third through fifth grade clubs program follows a book club model that teaches beginner level concepts with the option of completing unplugged or online challenges in scratch after reading chapters in our fiction and nonfiction books meanwhile our 6 through 12th grade program teaches computer science concepts of all difficulty levels through a flexible plugandplay curriculum and selfguided tutorials while a typical Club meets one to two hours per week for 10 or more sessions during the year clubs can be structured to fit your schedule your Club can meet more frequently for less time or even over a handful of days for boot camp style learning the main focus for third through fifth grade clubs is developing bravery and confidence in computer science skills each third through fifth grade club meeting consists of three main parts an optional community building Sisterhood activity starts the meeting then club members dive into guided lesson plans centered on girls who codes books they are learn to code and change the world and the friendship code optional online coding challenges and scratch complement offline reading based activities and finally each meeting ends with a wrapup an opportunity for reflection and feedback to nurture a growth mindset our 6th through 12th grade curriculum is structured simp similarly starting with a welcome and Sisterhood activity and ending with a wrapup key differences include our girls who code Tech spotlights and learn to code activities gwc's Tech spotlights on diverse innovators change the image of what a programmer looks like and does for Young Learners club members explore bravery resilience creativity and purpose through real life examples of computer scientists women and nonbinary people using CS skills and a variety of fields bus 6th through 12th grade club members work through learn to code activities to hone their coding skills in diverse programming languages including HTML CSS JavaScript Python and Swift from Apple our learn to code activities include videos and text based instructions to guide club members to explore game design web development creative coding cyber security data science and artificial intelligence they offer a range of difficulty levels for beginners to more advanced Learners club members can choose their learning pathway individually or as a group based on programming language project theme or skill level plus we offer 6th through 12th grade scope and sequence guidance that describes what skills and content to teach the recommended order to teach those skills and content and for educators specifically how our club activities meet the csta K through2 computer science standards and did you know girls who code also provides funding and swag to eligible clubs this year we're thrilled to offer our clubs fund and swag benefits to clubs with three or more members

create an immediate sense of community for your club members so now that you know all there is to know about clubs let's talk about how to start one clubs are designed so that anyone can start a club absolutely no computer science experience is needed all you need to start your Club is a nonprofit host site technology and internet and a facilitator we'll explore each of these a bit further so first your host site can be any nonprofit like a school library or Community Center and clubs also offer the flexibility to meet in person or virtually through Google Classroom Zoom or any other conferencing platform technology and internet connection are required for 6th through 12th grade club members but are optional for third through fifth grade clubs the club's program is compatible with PCs Macs and Chromebooks iPads are also an option but can only be used for beginner selfguided tutorials in the coding language Swift finally every Club needs a facilitator to submit the club's application and oversee the club facilitators must be 18 or older and pass a background check if they are not an employee of the club's host site employees of host sites for example teachers at schools are not required to go through a separate background check most importantly facilitators do not need computer science or technical experience to facilitate a club due to the resources and support girl who code provides as you start to think about who might facilitate your Club it can be helpful to know that our club facilitators come from a variety of diverse roles including teachers Librarians nonprofit Pro program staff and community volunteers such as parents local Tech workers or even college and university students clubs frequently operate with one facilitator leading the curriculum however there are other options you may also have a club where there's more than one facilitator or clubs where the facilitator acts in an advisory capacity and the club is run by members
