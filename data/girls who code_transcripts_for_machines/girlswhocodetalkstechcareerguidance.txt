hi everybody welcome to girls who code talks my name is emily heismos i'm the director of alumni programs at girls who code and we are so glad that you're here with us today i'm really excited that you're joining us for our girls who code talk on tech career guidance we have a couple of great guests but i first want to introduce you to our moderator this is kiana campbell a recruiter for university and diversity programs at zander an at t company she has a background in higher education and nonprofit work where she was able to fulfill her passion for supporting students of color kiana

name is kiana campbell and i'm super excited to be here to introduce our panelists for today who will be discussing discussing tech career paths and how to prepare for the workforce after receiving a compsci degree for our viewers welcome i enjoy reading the chatter in the chat box continue to use that chat box to share your thoughts and questions throughout tonight's conversation and a member of the girls who code staff will respond with that i'm pleased to introduce our panelists our first panelist is natasha valani who's the vice president of human resources at fox natasha focuses on talent management performance recruitment diversity and the overall employee experience within technology and finance prior to fox she worked at mastercard where she received the 2016 mastercard global hr excellence award for her work involving mastercard's performance management process to be geared more towards the employee experience second we have linda tanil who is a manager of gps experience hire recruiting at deloitte linder plays a key role in recruiting highly clearly cleared technical talent mentoring and coaching candidates as well as her team in addition to building and implementing strategic recruiting strategies to drive business objectives in her free time linda linda and her husband greg enjoy time outdoors such as running hiking and spending time with their two pups sunny and blondie so with that let's virtual applause to our panelist speakers and i'm really excited to speak with you both this evening as we get set up we're going to start the night with an icebreaker afterwards we'll follow that by questions that will address the concerns of girls who code collegeaged alumni and students across the country who are either beginning matriculating or even ending their college experience then we'll wrap up the evening with a conversation focus on q a segment segments and questions from our viewers without further ado let's get started so welcome natasha and linda our first icebreaker question is what do you enjoy most about your role and i'm going to ask you to answer in the order that you were introduced as for our viewers stay tuned and get ready to answer your own icebreaker question using the polls feature this will be the first poll question of the evening so stay alert because you only have about 30 seconds to respond after it pops up on your screen so join us and let us know your thoughts as well for the icebreaker that pops up for our panelists again what do you enjoy most about your role and let's start off with natasha yeah great first of all thanks for having me i'm so happy to be here and spend my evening i'm based in new york city with you guys um so thanks for having me um for the icebreaker question what do i enjoy most about my job um i think it's really the people interaction i never thought i would venture into hr i have a marketing background um i decided to dip into hr because quite honestly um it paid the most and out of school i was coming out with a lot of college debt so i took the first job that that paid the most but going in hr and using my marketing skills around consumer behavior i think the people interaction engaging with our tech employees is always phenomenal um it's you know it's really a joy and a pleasure to recruit and on board um our employees engage with them talking about the full talent life cycle um you know whether it was that mastercard or even at fox today but um i think that's probably my answer for you thank you and linda great hi good evening um i'm actually located in northern virginia centerville so for me talent i've always been interested in talent you know from early on working for a temporary staffing agency i then got involved in more of the recruiting getting to know the candidates and loved making the matches for me now working for deloitte you know meeting with the candidates working with the leaders setting up the interviews and then you know seeing seeing them in the office when we were in the office so it's that full life cycle helping getting to know what's important to the candidate and you know bringing them on board nice thank you for sharing that and definitely see the alignment between the both of you and your focus on candidate experience and really making sure that folks not just have a great experience while they're interviewing but especially once they join the company and again viewers definitely stay tuned for your own question of your own that's going to be popping up on your screen uh with with that that question is what excites you most about your future career in tech so really excited to hear some of your thoughts and what comes up from there for natasha and linda a sizable portion of our viewers are rising college students and a lot of the questions we received for them was around ways to prepare for their professional careers now they may know they love coding but aren't entirely sure what's available to them so our first group question is specifically for this group of viewers prior to entering college what were some of the steps and valuable resources that would help high school age students explore different career paths in tech linda what are your thoughts for me i think there's a there's a lot of things that you can do either through your local community college or campus whatever's nearby there are events that you could attend there's a lot on like linkedin just doing your research even youtube reading articles even googling even in in my in my role if i don't know something i mean just google it and then you can just learn so much more about you know what what you're thinking might interest you nice thank you how about you natasha yeah i am you know i echo what what linda is saying too i think leveraging google leveraging the assets available to you virtually um i know you know wasn't as readily available for some coming out of high school but i think it's just grown much more popular nowadays mashable is actually a really cool site i'm sure most of you are on it or check it out but sometimes they do have job blogs that actually i sometimes go on just to see if there's anybody cool that we might want to recruit from a tech perspective um definitely check that out the other thing i would say too coming out of high school we there are some companies you kind of have to dig a little bit but there are some companies that offer internship programs for high school students and it doesn't hurt to try something different if you're into coding but you want to switch careers and want to do something more on the engineering side or devops or something on the application front um i look and dig again echoing linda go on google find those internships i know i had worked at a company called terrex corporation in connecticut they love they do a high school intern program and they do a little bit of a soft rotation so that's one example i know some of you aren't local to the connecticut market but um definitely do some digging and research thank you both especially for the the tangible tools there and i know our viewers you had an opportunity to also chime in on what excites you about your future career in tech so if you're curious just as i was about 54 of you said solving problems using technology and 40 mention learning new technologies so hopefully you gain so much more insight with with what excites you about your future career in technology now that we have a greater sense and understanding of what can be done to learn about career paths this question is specifically for our alumni who have been looking at professional opportunities um from for example from software engineer to ux designers we see roles posted on the girls who girls who code hire me and linkedin but what do these jobs entail for the viewers who specifically asked for information around what it means to be in these certain career roles or opportunities this question is for you but first audience members we definitely want an opportunity to hear again from you so complete the poll and inform us on this question do you already know what your dream job is or do you need assistance figuring it out perfect um so as those results come in linda and natasha we're interested in hearing from you what questions should job seekers ask to help them stand out what questions are taboo let's start with you linda what questions um good questions uh you do your research on the company um and i would ask more openended questions you know tell me more about the role tell me what you are looking for um in in finding you know the applicant things to stay away from um i would stay away from compensation or benefits um depending on who you're talking to they may they may not know the answer um in my role those types of conversations stay in talent and when you're talking with a hiring manager they're more around you know the actual role responsibilities the duties you know what what we're looking for in this individual and um another good question you know how you can add impact to what they're looking for and really kind of um you know i'm not you know see yourself in the role and just ask more ask ask a lot ask questions show interest i think it just goes a long way nice thank you natasha yeah um completely agree i am while i'm not a fulltime recruiter in my job i do work very close with recruitment and i do um i also interview at the director level plus just from a culture fit because they are typically managing people at fox but some of my favorite questions um i'll start there is when candidates ask things like you know what does success look like for this role in the next six months um what are some challenges that you guys are facing now that i could or the potential candidate could help alleviate i think it shows initiative to to linda's point um and you know i think it really helps bridge the gap and also for hiring managers to hear that specifically all always kind of makes them feel like wow this person is already ready to take some work off of my plate which goes a long way um so i think those are probably my top two favorite questions curiosity is key to linda's point ask a ton of questions um but don't definitely openended right um you don't want it to just go to yes and no and then questions to refrain from that's actually pretty interesting i agree on the comp front um i also think coming out of school you don't want to come off too money hungry compensation is important and one thing i do want to stress is you know while maybe the facebooks and the netflix might be a little bit higher on base and bonus always look at the full package yes um while some companies may not be able to go as high on base and bonus immediately um they do offer things like educational assistance if you want to further your education benefits programs um always look about that full that full spectrum but keep reserve those questions for recruitment or the hr person you'll be connecting with as it relates to comp yep thank you for that um that's really really helpful to hear and with our poll question that we asked it was how many of you actually know what your dream job is or do you still need assistance figuring out we actually got 60 68 percent of viewers said no they do not know what their dream job is and that is very very normal you're not alone especially where you are in your education and in your experience a followup question is outside of software engineer roles what are some other job titles for those majoring in compsci that they can qualify are qualify for and what are the associated responsibilities would either of you linda or natasha be able to speak towards that question i can go first if you want sure yeah um so some i'll tell you some of the hot jobs i'm seeing today especially within media tech cyber security is always really hot especially right now we're obviously preparing for the elections um coming up so that's definitely a hot market but we're always looking for automation engineers people who are actually passionate about the cyberspace so that's that's one area data science is super hot as well app development either backend engineers or frontend developers are always critical too we are hiring for a lot of roku and android developers engineering experience is cool but it's not needed i think the biggest thing for us is just making sure you have an appetite for the position especially if it's more entry level um i'd say that's probably what i'm seeing is what's hot right now nice thank you i can add to that you know i'm with a consulting firm and we are hiring this background as well you know we support our clients both on the commercial and the government side so it's cyber security the data science um front end back end developers devops is hot um so there's you know i feel it's just it's growing you know just tapping into so many different markets that's definitely helpful helpfully here especially with covid pandemic and how it hit the job market so many markets were were affected especially across the board and the tech industry is growing and transitioning and really adapting so that's helpful to know as our alumni who may be new graduates are looking for future opportunities in the tech space with that we're also interested in as we ask a bit more about what are those skill sets for those types of roles out of curiosity what are some of the basic skill requirements needed for internships or entrylevel jobs in terms of coding languages years of experience types of projects etc uh natasha can you kick us off there yeah for for our intern programs um it's you know we understand going in that there won't probably be a lot of years of tangible experience on your resume and that's okay it's not always needed we do have an mba internship program too that requires at least a year out in the field somewhere but for our our basic college internship program it's really just the interest in studying in that field the thought is that you know whether it's zero to one we're not we're not too high up on making sure that you come out with five years of experience otherwise we'd hire a fulltime employee um so the internship we're a little bit more relaxed on um i would say top three things is your major um you know if you're majoring in communications but you're going for a cyber internship you may not get the full foot in the door we might look at your resume depending on what your interests are and have a conversation with you i will say in speaking to some of our hiring managers on the floors hiring for interns i think they're always just looking especially on the internship level for pure interest it's it's really having a passion about the space our managers are really good at training and shadowing allowing you to shadow so you learn a lot um coming in from an internship but again from an experience perspective we're not requiring a ton i echo the same you know they're not look we're not looking at the experience it is the interest um and the academic you know background they will look at technical skills but again at a very junior level i mean they're not expecting you know years and years of experience a lot of it is um coming in to really see if you if you enjoy this type of work a lot of it is you know could be shadowing or um having that kind of that visibility a six week program so i hope that helps no that really does help in hearing your experience and typically what you look for and what some of these some of these questions are some of these responses that you're having related to opportunities out of curiosity where can alumni learn more in detail about the titles you just mentioned such as cyber security etc um i would say just to kick it off uh google definitely google it you can always go to fox careers if you're interested in a in a job with fox all of our jobs are posted in real time um i think we do have a section tailored to more of the entry level positions too um so definitely check that out most companies i you know if you're passionate about the brand of a company um i know mastercard does a really good job at that too definitely look at the company's site but linkedin is great to look through indeed is an amazing tool to look through um actually one cool um one cool site that i just came across it's actually a compensation site it's called levels.fyi um and they actually break down real compensation data similar to a glass store but from companies like google and microsoft facebook netflix is up there uh check them out because they also have a lot of repetitive job titles that you might be interested in so you might get a sense of what you might want to get into and i don't get anything yep same check out deloitte's career site google it um a lot of times you know i have found just being in this space a title could be different from just maybe a company has their own leveling just using deloitte as an example you know we have consultants and it could mean a variety of different responsibilities you could be a data science but you come in the firm and you're a consultant so maybe google you know it could be i'll just take data science as an example you know you like python and then you could see different titles that do come up that could be of interest so read more of the description responsibilities um there i think it just could allow open up other opportunities and not just you know maybe the the three or four that are maybe most common in the market that's so true especially in the tech space like titles can vary you can be a solution consultant or solutions engineer or technical account manager all of those titles are very similar right so it definitely helps to focus on the skills as you're looking at those job descriptions uh another question we have is does the college i receive my diploma from determine much job uh which job opportunities will be available to me and how much i can request for my salary let's start with you linda um i don't feel the college um just for speaking from deloitte you know we do uh recruit from a number of different schools but all of our opening or postings are on our career site so folks are i mean you could anybody can apply um coming in as an entry level analyst that is our title which could be data scientists like i had mentioned a lot of it is training so as you're interviewing or applying you know look at companies that are not only going to give you the handson keyboard skills but maybe more of the training background to help you um you know tap into the market get off get get with your career i think compensation as natasha mentioned you know it's total package like look at that it's not just dollars it could be the training and development education tuition you know assistance pto you know all that is part of compensation yeah and i i would i would say um to add to that for for our roles no i think that the college education piece i'm actually a huge fan of you know give me a college dropout that's interested in coding and has done like a ton of stuff on the back end i mean we're really trying to be a little bit more diverse in our approach so you're you know while going to a great ivy league school i mean kudos to you making through making through that um i think that's great but it's not necessarily going to break make or break anything from a comp perspective we always look at purity so if you're an entry level coming into fox at an engineer the the title for that would be an associate engineer all of our associate engineers coming out of college or they get paid the same so i wouldn't worry too much about oh if i'm graduating from mit does that necessarily bring me up like 10k more than some of my other peers coming from state schools that's not the case we're very big on purity we're very big on diversity too so we do look at you know and in complete honesty there are high school dropouts probably making more money than all of us on this call right now so you know we are we are very keen on that yeah i agree very true uh i see a lot of call a lot of employers that are focused a bit more on the experience and skills versus the education and that's very common thinking about diversity of thought and perspective as you're hiring new folks a company so it's great to hear about deloitte and fox our other question is do companies offer development programs for college students who are entering the job market to help them adjust to their first time role uh we'll start with you natasha yeah it's a it's a good question um you know we're we're probably not the best at it just yet um i think coming on board what you do get especially at fox i know some other companies actually mastercard is pretty good at that too but um there's a lot of onthejob training a lot of shadowing your managers will probably buddy you up with somebody who's a year or two ahead of you that you can learn a lot from when it comes to specific hard skills to learn versus the soft skills you know we do have linkedin learning is our goto learning channel and we have access you know unlimited access to all of the virtual training opportunities there so if it is something in python or it's coding or something that might up your skills a bit we do have that at you know free disposal to all of our employees um but coming in it's really you know working with your managers who are also very handson and your peers nice thank you anything you'd like to add in linda sure yes so you know with coming into deloitte there's we offer it's a robust orientation program again you have a mentor it is a lot of um handson shadowing learning listening linkedin learning we love um i've even participated like i am such a huge fan so we offer a lot of different programs um training that folks can do on their own time as well and i think that's has shown a lot of success uh depending on where folks want to continue to you know learn new skills nice thank you for that i've also heard of coursera yeah um and if it's not through girls who code also your universities may be willing to pay for these opportunities which is something to take advantage of now uh we have some bonus questions as well for you so i know you mentioned this a bit linda can you share a bit more and then natasha what are some of the rotational programs that your company may offer for some of those for some for folks who are like just now joining their the workforce and their first fulltime opportunity so speaking of of deloitte they will may meaning um more at the i'll call it at the analyst level there's a rotation program where you may be on a project for a couple it could be six to 12 weeks and then they will roll you off just to give you that experience they have found great success in that and also you know talking with individuals of where's the interest you know did you enjoy that project and where are you looking to kind of add value to go to that next project so um that happens a lot um at the analyst level so you know learning really what what you enjoy doing uh and where you can see yourself stretching nice thank you and natasha yeah so from a rotation program perspective um as it pertains to tech there is one pilot we're doing there's a little bit more on the arizona front but we have a new tech center being built out there it's on the media and broadcast operation side um it is something that's probably going to be about nine months long where you spent about three months on the medium broadcast operation so it's like eyes on screen making sure all of our media is sort of being plugged in where it's supposed to no shows are going down and then you'll probably spend about another three months on the cyber front and then another three months on either a devops or engineering side so we're still finalizing that program it's a little hot off the press um it'll probably launch in 2021 once we're fully live with our our tech center so that is one rotation program that we're building out as it pertains to tech but we're always looking to do more i think now you know because of covid and the virtual setup i think there's a lot more we can do on this front um we're just sort of and i think many companies might be facing this too trying to reshift a little bit on how they manage these programs i think when you're on site it's a little bit easier to be a sponge and learn more and ask peers for questions so it's taking us a bit of time to mold something perfect for a virtual setup nice those are both like really exciting opportunities and it's kind of like we got the the sneak peek before everyone else did natasha so thank you and hopefully folks were taking note of that program to look into in 2021 thank you another question is what is the difference between working for a consulting firm like deloitte or working for a corporate company like fox can you share your thoughts on that starting with natasha yeah so i've actually um never been a consultant i've been poached to be a consultant before but i never took that route um i work with a lot of consultants though um some phenomenal ones i think personally and linda keep me honest here with this but um on the consultant front it's definitely much more project based right and i think you have different exposure to many different employers i think it's actually probably a little bit cooler in a sense where you can maybe be on a sixmonth engagement working for a media company and then pivot to a tech company and then pivot to fintech or whatever it might be i don't think you'll ever get bored to be honest and not to say that i'm bored of my role but a lot of our consultants are amazing they're great partners we have a lot of consultants on site too some of them in which we turn into fulltime employees if the consulting company is open to that just because that relationship is you know beyond great um coming from an actual employer um and just being a fulltime employee versus a consultant it is um it is different you know you're kind of a little bit more focused on on the job projects can change depending on your position too um but you're solely focused on that specific brand and that specific employer i think that's probably the the biggest difference and and linda of course this consulting piece is more up your alley so i'll let you you hit it i mean it's project based it's summer short term some are long term some can change overnight just depending on the nature of the project the client they could change gears or just decide to slow down so i think having a career in consulting is you know working with project teams you will have the opportunity you could you could support our government side you could support our commercial side there's even global opportunity um and just work with leaders on the client side and then you'll have your folks you know within your network that you're you know working with as well each project could be different so you could be on one project with one team and then once that project is over you could be roll on to another team completely new set of folks which you know is exciting too nice those both sound really exciting uh natasha we're getting questions in the chat can you repeat the program that you mentioned oh you i see you just put it but feel free to repeat it um so it's uh we don't have an official name but it is going to be in arizona it's likely going to be a nine month rotation program in tempe arizona which is where our new tech center is going to be housed once it is launched i think we're going to have a dedicated page on our fox careers page for the rotation program i know there was a question about high school i think we're targeting college students first let's see how it goes with the pilot before we go down into into high school students want to make sure it's a successful opportunity for you guys they don't want to rush too quickly but more to come in early 2021 nice thank you for that sneak peek um and then we're receiving a few questions from viewers and i'm it's kind of a good thing that i sped through the first part of this panel because now we have 20 minutes you actually get into depth with our viewers questions and really what's important um to them right now in the moment so some of those questions i'll be asking you now the first one is from lanique would you be able to linda and natasha compare different tech roles um for example thinking through about some of the tech roles that you hire for uh what are some some of the skill sets that may be required for each for example a back end engineer versus a front end etc or even a data analyst versus a data scientist what are some of the skills that you look for as you're comparing those roles i can i can go um depending on the role if it's a back end or front end um the technology is typically the musthave depending on the project they might need you know what i'm finding i'm not proficient in it i can talk about it you know they look for javascript you know python um sql you know different technologies there is flexibility so you know look at python as a programming language if you know r there is you know they'll take r over python so just depending on the work in the nature and also the project what the client is looking for since we're client focused um we tend to partner you know with our with our clients to learn more about their delivery and what's what's important to them and what do they need in hiring this individual and to add a you know i would say go to go to any career site and look at the job descriptions we're very keen on differentiating between a back end and a front end um aws is really hot right now um so that's that's a top skill that i'm seeing in a lot of our a lot of our jd's that our managers are posting um i actually took a sneak peek at one github and jarrah is also something that's um that's top up there too i'm starting to see repeats of that from a data perspective if you're interested in the data front um i think being a data scientist actually it's pretty cool but you know passionate about obviously assessing trends gathering data but looking at data sort of thoroughly to provide business updates in terms of you know six months out from now this is probably where we need to pivot or what we should focus on um i think data engineering is really helping us with our data platforms and ensuring that wherever we're sourcing data and you know obviously for media companies there's a plethora of data out there whether it's nielsen data on our ratings or how many viewers are on our apps or subscribers so pulling that data in a thoughtful way and in in a consistent way for our leaders to look at um i think is obviously important and i'm going more high level than the actual terms in a job description but my recommendation is look at those jd's it may not pop out at the very front because we always want to give like a quick intro in terms of what we're looking for but look at those bullet points because it'll it'll start coming out yeah nice thank you for sharing that and hopefully um this is really helpful because i i also hear the computing space or the cloud space is a huge one so aws is a huge focus along with cyber security which i think was cyber security awareness month this month so that's exciting uh another question we received is relate related to um the the job while you're in the job in particular so this is coming from mia in school we have assignments that we have to complete how does that work at a actual like corporate job what do you what kind of assignments do you have um in your daytoday that you may have to complete this can be related to your role or even to a more tech focused role we can start with natasha yeah so assignment based i think you know rather than the specific assignment i think project management skills is definitely needed across the board um what i personally took from school is how to up my pm game to make sure it fits within companies so you know if my manager gives me a specific task at work or even our tech folks i think the first thing we do is always build out a roadmap and look at the milestones of what we need to hit to make sure we're executing flawlessly um so i think from an assignment perspective whether it's a threemonth assignment or six months i mean personally i'm in hr one of the things that we're working on from an hr perspective is a it's a kpi dashboard of all of our metrics within hr so how many people were hiring are we hittering our diversity quotas are we looking at things like um obviously looking at some different schools and things like that too but how are we putting this in a dashboard format i gave my team about a month to help me complete this we're on track to to complete it by the end of the month but again i think the one thing i do want to stress here i think it's more of the the project management skills making sure you're hitting your deadlines if you're not going to hit your deadlines how do you communicate that to your team to stakeholders like your managers that this might fall because of xyz and how can we sort of rectify that so linda i'll pass it to you for yeah i agree project management skills i think in every role that i've been on for somebody new coming into the workforce you know being prepared give yourself time plan if you're having trouble or not able to meet the the goal you know raise your hand you know go to your project manager ask questions if if you're not sure i mean you know ask those questions to make sure you understand what what the ask is and what you need to deliver thanks for sharing that out of curiosity are there any project management tools that you can suggest or courses that you've taken or that's offered at your companies i will look at linkedin learning for some virtual courses um you know i think scrum masters are are big here too and they deal with a lot of some of the project management efforts too um looking at tickets and also making sure that we're we're hitting our deadlines um google look for like a really cool pm template a project management template on google sometimes you can actually get like a really cool download of like what a you know realistic road map could look like um i've i've used that i i mean i google throughout college i still google throughout my career so i i would you know definitely try to search for for keywords like that yeah i agree 100 nice thank you i know you've already mentioned project management but what are some other software hard skills that companies are typically looking for today and this question is coming from tasfia we can start with linda um so other skills like a project management roles that could be um in my space you know i we tend to hire folks with experience so they'll look for somebody that may have their pmp certificate somebody that has um the project management skills not to get too you know technical but like scrum masters you know they'll look for that type of background i think if you were to google maybe project management roles i i think you'll that could open up a lot of different jobs out there and just reading about them again the title could vary depending on the company and it's kind of their structure you know it may not be a project manager but it could be you know just another term doing the same thing or very similar that's helpful thank you linda and this can be not just project management but openended what are companies typically looking for for those softer hard skills i think on on our end um and and some of the other companies i've worked for i think on the softer skill side learnability and curiosity goes a long way so you know we've seen brilliant engineers come in but they're not um you know if the company pivots or the direction of a project pivots they're just really focused on their role they don't go in my opinion as far as the engineer who is always has an appetite for innovation um who's always asking the right question question everything to be honest i mean i think that goes a long way just because a company does a process for so long that doesn't mean it's right you know ask why um i think you know that's helped me in my career in in leveling up and and getting to where i'm at um but i've i've always questioned our processes it's you know and because we do it one year go through a full cycle sometimes too before you question every single thing um see how it's done and then i think taking a serious intake on the inventory of why we do it and then even providing don't just question it um but also providing thoughtful sort of responses as to you know i see we've done it this way for some time i wonder if we could probably introduce this part into the process because i think it might save us time or money or whatever it might be so that curiosity component i think will take you very far in your career thank you and now we're on to our last question uh this question is if we are majoring in computer science but we don't really know if we like coding um we'll graduating with the computer science and coding experience allow me to get a job in the tech sector that won't necessarily deal with coding in other words let's say i graduated with computer science and coding but i'm not sure if i want to do coding what kind of degrees or role maybe roles can i look for at your companies we'll start with natasha for this yeah so you know computer science degree is interesting i i do think the degree itself it doesn't really lend itself to that specific sort of job here i think you know if you wanted to be a developer if you wanted to do even get into the engineering track but you're fresh out of school we're not always looking at what you graduated with or what your major was um i also think taking certificates like aws is offering a ton of certificates you could be aws certified in six months if you wanted to um i think putting things on your resume that you've done a course or you know even outside of traditional schooling maybe you did something in jira or you did something in python or whatever it might be i think some of them are probably more condensed um programs that you can you can look into i think adding that to your resume if you don't want to do the traditional computer science path um can go a long way um i'm always happy by the way too i know this is our last question but to look at resumes and help out i do that on my free time when i volunteer too um so if you always you want to hit me up on linkedin and send along your resume i'm always happy to give some some guidance there nice thank you definitely take that off for y'all and linda can you share a bit more with us sure um i think you know the degree opens the door and again go after what you're passionate about what you're interested in the certificates that that you're interested in i think it's it's great you know put it on your resume um that i have seen folks with a computer science degree and then they're going into more strategy because they just found that passion be openminded have an open aperture join a firm ask questions be innovative um you know network learn from other folks you know their career path look people up on linkedin you know if you find a company that you're interested in you know look at somebody's career path trajectory you know oh well you were a computer science but now you're you know everybody has a story um that i think you just need to you know go after what you know what what you're truly interested in and there's a lot out there i'm happy to review resumes as well um i'm on linkedin ping me so you know good good luck to everybody you know if this is our last question yes that was our last question and
