hey there it's jannon it's Audrey this is Margot it's Britney and this is our career episode of my code we're going to be talking about our dream jobs and how coding ties to them so let's get started my dream job growing up was to be an author I loved reading stories and I really wanted to write and illustrate my own books that people would read and be positively affected by in the same way that my books affected me GR up I dreamt about becoming a teacher I remember having a small black chalkboard and sitting my Brad stalls as if they were in a classroom when I was younger I wanted to be in the CIA I went through this big phase where I was really into things spy and going undercover and all these cool secret missions my dream job when I was younger was to be a famous actress I was obsessed with watching TV shows and movies such as the princess diaries now my dream job is to be a video game designer I play games a lot and I love everything about them from their mechanics to their story lines the way the player interacts with them I hope someday that I can make video games that millions of people can enjoy my dream job now is to be a fulltime computer programmer coding apps and video games and any other program that can help change the world now that I know how to code I'm not sure exactly what I want to do but I definitely know that whatever job I choose I will be incorporating code my dream job now is to be an engineer at a digital film company such as Pixar it would combine my childhood dreams of being an artist and an actress with my current dreams of becoming a computer scientist I want to study computer science in college I think it'll serve any of my career goals pretty well plus I love coding in computers and I want to learn as much as possible about them I think it would also be pretty cool to tie computer science with another subject such as government economics or even medicine I want to study computer science in either business law biology political science or video productions I want to study computer science and maybe double major in business or computer animation right now the possibilities are endless code fits with my career goals as a game designer because at their core video games are code even if you don't have to be an expert coder to know how to design a good game I still think it's important to understand every aspect of any game I might work on a good thing I found out while researching jobs with coding is that employers really like someone who knows how to code and that knowledge will help you out in most jobs but coding can be connected with anything whether you want to be a dancer astronaut or doctor coding can be found in everything coding fits into my career goals because I want to work in the tech industry and that means every single day I'll be exposed to code and writing code of my own thanks for tuning in to this week's episode of my code next week will be our final episode of season 1 we'll be talking about how you can join our movement of girls who code check out the previous episodes here and if you have any questions or comments make sure to write them down in the the comment section till next week see you soon see you soon see you soon
