hi again it's Shannon it's Mario again it's Britney it's Audrey in this episode of my code we're going to be talking about our mentors who have inspired us to have one of my mentors is my older brother he and I always used to make movies and games together using this program called scratch when we were kids he started actually selling these programs when he was a teenager to people online which is really crazy interesting and I like want to be like that my mentors name is Ashley she works at Instagram as a project manager and she went to school for computer science my mentors are Margaret Hamilton who can vote the code to get humans on the moon Reshma the founder of girls who code and my mom my mentors are older women who have already been in the fields of computer science for a while it's really nice to talk to someone who's or had different jobs at different companies and take their career advice the best piece of advice about coding that I've ever received is to not be afraid to use the internet to help you with your problems coding is not a pop quiz most of your problems can be solved with just a quick internet search I don't think I've ever made a single program without stopping a dozen times to look up how to do things I was really interested in biology and I thought that I wouldn't be able to incorporate code into my love for biology but she introduced to me biomedical engineering and a lot of other possibilities that I could have and overall just help me to understand that I can incorporate coding into anything I love to do we can spend time dreaming about all the possibilities we can create with code but we have to take the time to code it sometimes we psych ourselves out or explore ourselves we can't do something but if we face every single situation thinking why not or I can do this no problem we'll be able to achieve anything some advice that I would give to a girl to inspire her to code is to remind her that the science community is not nearly as closed off or as elitist as it might seem to an outsider even if there are super crazy smart coders they're learning all the time too whether you don't know what code is you've never coded before or find it too difficult i will tell you to just do it coding is like having a superpower you can solve the problems that affect you and your community you can create products that your peers will use and depend on every single day there is absolutely no harm in trying and at the end it will be worth it now that I learned how to code it's constantly pushing me to go out there and learn more about the world around me and if you want to become more aware of what really goes on in this technical world we live in then coding is your perfect guide it's a lot easier to start something new when you have the support of mentors and a community that's what we're creating a movement of girls who code to support one another we want to read your favorite piece of advice leave it in the comments section down below next week we're going to talk about the different careers you can have with code see you then see you then see you then till then bye guys you
