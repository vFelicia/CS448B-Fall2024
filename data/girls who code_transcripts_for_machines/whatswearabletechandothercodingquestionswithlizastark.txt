my name is Liza and I am Annie textile practitioner and educator so wearable tech is a in my opinion it's a big term because wearable tech can basically mean anything that is technology that's worn on your body like in some ways you could even clean your phone is wearable but usually people think of things like fitness trackers that you wear on your wrists or Apple watches right but there's also this whole other side of wearable tech that involves what you could call soft circuits or electronic textiles and this is where you take these new smart materials and you embed them with electronics into fabrics to create garments or other objects and accessories that you can actually wear so I got involved in the wearable tech field because I was in a graduate program at person's called design technology and I went there with absolutely no background in technology and I had to take a bunch of coding classes and my second semester I took a physical computing class which is basically where you program electronics small computers and a soft circuits us where you work with conductive fabric and conductive thread to build your own sensors and circuits and all of a sudden it clicked for me that I could actually take this practice that I had around sewing and craft and combine it with technology which blew my mind and opened this to me of what was possible at the same time there was a whole other community all around the world that was also doing this and so I researched around so what these folks were doing got in touch with them looked up their work and eventually you know started making work with them and it's been an incredible community to be a part of so I think the first thing that makes it different from me is the physicality of it so usually when you're programming on the screen for for a screen it's something that's a little bit more abstract and you can't really touch it with this field you're talking about programming things that live long textiles or you know because they live on the body you have to be aware of what that feels like and you're also working or with electronics it's also physical so I think that changes the way that you can approach coding with it the thing that's exciting about this field is that it is still emerging and it is still relatively new and people don't really know what the entire field is gonna look like so there's a lot of opportunities there's only a ton of experimentation that's going on right now and there are a lot of issues being brought up as a result of this because you know when you put something on your body that has to do it and technology you start to think about privacy when you're working with materials that are textiles and and waste like electronics that creates a waste you start to think about sustainability so there are so many really fascinating questions that are happening right now on this field so learning to code I think the most surprising thing to me was how much I liked it first of all it was magical when you program your first led to light up your entire world changes because you just need that things like you did that and then all of a sudden you start to think about other ways that you can make things in the world interact with you in a different way it was definitely a struggle at first learning to code which is dies and it was interesting and surprising to me also how much I had to sort of paint program myself or the idea that I couldn't be good at this and once I overcame that or I'm still overcoming it cuz that's what happens it really just changed the way that I thought about what I could do and how I could create I am most excited to introduce these girls to a whole new set of tools because when you think about if you're an artist or a programmer or a mathematician whatever you are interested in you have a set of tools that you use to help you realize things and put them out realize ideas and put them out into the world so I think when you have a whole new set of tools it generates a whole new way of thinking about the world and so I'm just really excited to see what they design and the stories that come out of those designs and the way that they use systems so here's the advice that I would give to girls who are looking to merge their creative endeavors artistic expression with technology my top ten list ready number one great things to see how they work do not be afraid to take things apart just open it up see where the wires go tinker with it break it number two harness your curiosity don't ever be afraid to ask a question there is no stupid question I know it sounds trite but always ask you'll be surprised with to learn number three embrace failure and learn from failure is totally fine just iterate on it right do it again see what works better number four experiment with simple and complex ideas you might be surprised by what you find number five being patient learning these skills takes time and that's okay number six find a community who shares your interests you can learn from that they can learn from you and you can support each other number seven don't listen to haters and trolls you are the one who determines the type of feedback that you get around your ideas in your projects and following from that number eight own your voice your voice is incredible and so are your ideas number nine it does not have to be complex to be awesome the most simple or the simplest circuit involving just a button in an LED can be incredible in the right context and finally number 10 have so much fun with it this is fun just go crazy go wild be fantastic you
