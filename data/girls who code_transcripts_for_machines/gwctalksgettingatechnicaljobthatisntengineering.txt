introduce yourself and let us know a little bit about who you are and where you're from oh awesome rachel teaches compsci at a community college oh my god and you're a volunteer with the girls who code club we absolutely love to hear that thank you so much for volunteering hello roxanne studying cs in dc um for folks just joining we're gonna start in about a minute or two and we're just introducing ourselves in the chat so you can see who else is here participating in this session tonight oh my gosh hi michelle hello at ut austin oh my god cs majors hello alex hello losa we have compsci in business at usc it's so great to see so far we've got like every every coast i'm in chicago third coast hi jessie hi hello hello hi amanda hi tanya hi ayanna so great to have you all here ayanna i've seen your name before yeah girls who code alumni uh if you're an alum from girls to code programs feel free to tell us about that for everyone that just joined we are introducing ourselves in the chat we're going to start this panel in about 30 seconds to a minute i'm really excited to have you all here get settled grab a glass of water hi shreya yay hi bella hello everybody we have sip alums and an instructor from suny binghamton brianna hello hello lots of alyssa my colleague your colleague wrote i love seeing all these college loop members so glad to have a lot of our girls to code college loop folks here hello m hello elisa hi polak um thank you all so much for being here we know that your time is really valuable it is a busy time of year it is a thursday night i'm in chicago it is pitch black outside i'm sure it's the same for you unless you're in you know a better climate in which case congrats to you we are going to start our conversation tonight this is part of an ongoing webinar series called girls who code talks and this series came out of the pandemic and i have to say it is one of the silver linings of an otherwise very tragic and traumatic experience and the silver lining here is that we're able to bring you expert speakers from across the country and you are able to join us from literally all over the country and i think we have a couple of international folks here too which is amazing and this is something that we weren't able to do before the pandemic or may rather we were able to do but we didn't think to do and it has been just an incredible series uh we've had a number of different talks on different topics all year long this is our last one of 2021 so thank you uh for being here and jl great question yes this will be recorded we will send out the recording tomorrow um but to to kick it off just to introduce myself i'm emily heismos i'm the director of alumni programs at girls who code i've met a lot of you i see a lot of familiar names which is really incredible and i'm really excited about the topic tonight we are talking about getting a technical job that isn't engineering and i just want to say that's no shade on the engineers in the house if you end up an engineer at any point in your career that is amazing we support you that is part of our mission too but there are so many different technical roles in the industry and i think a lot of times when folks are new to this field you think like computer science engineer and you don't necessarily think about the full spectrum of options that are out there and that's what this is going to be a conversation about so with no further ado i'd like to invite cadence daniels to join me on stage cadence is our amazing moderator tonight and cadence is a senior ux which is user experience interaction designer we want to define our terms tonight at ge which is a girl suit code partner we are so happy that she is here to moderate this panel we've met earlier she has really big plans for you tonight and is you know pretty uh recently in this field herself and knows exactly what this transition is like um at ge she leads the growth of an inhouse design system and component library and cadence you can tell us what that means after two years as a software developer and ui designer so here again we've got moving between different fields exploring different roles and beyond her efforts to elevate inclusion entrepreneurship and community development cadence is a devoted advocate for everyday people through innovation of human interaction creativity and empowerment kings that is a great bio that is a really wonderful video i would love to turn the floor over to you and you can tell us more about what that means and bring on our other panelists absolutely hello everyone i'm so so so excited we can talk about the bio but in reality it's just a fancy way of saying my job is to advocate for everyday people so thinking like engineers thinking like pms thinking like the people that actually use the tools that we build that's what i do on a daytoday basis um and so i absolutely get where you guys are coming from and trying to navigate which of those functions you want to play a role in i get it i have had engineering roles i have had project management roles and so i completely understand and like emily said i'm not that far out i'm only four years into my career and so happy to sit here and mediate this conversation around all the different opportunities that you have um and i'm joined today with three amazing panelists we have lily mew who is our director of product management at transperfect we have mary d'angelo gutierrez who's the security consultant at accenture and marissa schmidt who is our senior director of product management at citrix i'm going to give them their own opportunity to introduce themselves and when you do so if we're going to talk about all the different career options we have we might as well take it from the beginning and when you introduce yourself i want you to tell me when you were a kid before college what did you want to be when you grew up and then tell me a little bit about what it is that you actually do now let's go lilly um hi i'm lily um well before i don't know i never really had a career path or very specific career that i wanted to pursue i guess in high school when i first started to have my first computer and that's how i had my interest in in learning more about computer getting into everything about a computer so when i went to college um i pursued a major in computer science um but i also learned that i really didn't enjoy programming that much so i ended up changing my major to information science and policy um it's um it's less programming i learned more about the internet um how to build website using frontend and backend uh technology like firm and as an html uh to code the uh what you actually see today and when you log into a web page that's who you see and the backend is basically the server that hosts the the website so all of that i have more interest in that so i changed my major to that um after i graduated um i had a little bit hard time finding a job right i'm not i wasn't a programmer which uh most of the jobs out there um they have software developer programmer and that's not what i enjoy to do so i look for everything like webmaster uh web designer that kind of keywords so yeah and then i took on different uh odd jobs um like anything that has web in its job description so i applied for them i ended up working at a law firm and then a film academy not expecting that it's it's very weird like i i only dedicate about 10 of my time doing web tasks um and finally i um i got a call from from my current company and they're looking for a localization engineer and at a time i didn't even know what localization is later i learned it's really just another word for translation you're translating content for a specific region and that process is called localization so i started off as a localization engineer and then i moved to being a solutions engineer the difference is really one localization is you more working for production and then solutions engineer it's uh you're working more clientfacing providing solution using the company's software so as i was working on both position i was involved with the initial product that my company had developed and i really and i wasn't really um handling the product as a product manager but i was um i was very interested in using the product gave a lot of feedback to our developers so slowly i sort of become unofficial product manager for the for the products so i finally i'll tell my my managers that i wanted to focus on managing the product because i see a lot of areas where i can spend more my my time and focus on um so i turn myself into a fulltime product manager after all the engineering tasks so here i am i'm going to ask you more about what it means to be a product manager but there are many times that we get stuck in unofficial roles and have to actually ask to be in them officially so i get it what about you marie d'angelo so good evening good afternoon everyone so when i was a kid i wanted to be a fashion designer um yeah little did i know when i was um i was eight years old they i grew up in peru so they have these first computers those big ones grayish uh beige and i love them because they follow my instructions [Laughter] and that's when i became in love with computers nice so fashion designer now it's a hobby i go window shopping i love to learn about the latest and evers but computers were all started to become my first love after that i moved to the u.s and english wasn't my first language i had to learn the language and i guess the easiest classes for me were math so it was easier for me to do the math because you don't require a specific language it's just universal numbers and then after that i went to a community college i found the passion for computer science for my first job was as a tutor master or computer science tutor and that's when i learned to enjoy working with people right after that i moved to college i went to rochester institute of technology and there i went for computer science i believe that i wanted to have a strong technology background in order in order to see a lot of opportunities however the project the the degree requires a year of internship scopes and and i've entered in different companies and what i learned is that coding wasn't my passion anymore but it was uh the organization of everything um how this uh how testing worked um how software engineers work what was the what was the link between them what was missing between them how can you organize it in a way that it it works seamlessly and right after i i graduated actually two weeks after i joined accenture i've been at accenture for five years and i've worked as a security analyst cyber security analyst that's how i started i i love it because i wear many hats in consulting i'm able to do some project management so technology stuff assessments for different companies in different industries and i've i'm an ass um i i weren't learning anything that has to do with cyber security yeah nice i like that you talked about even though you wanted to be a fashion designer it's still a hobby right all the interests we have time don't go away they just have different roles in our lives so marissa what was it for you well when i was a kid all you did is watch the small tvs that show uh um either an actress or a singer or a dancer i wanted to be i wanted to dance i do love dancing yeah uh so i that was when i was still really young in um in the philippines and then uh we moved here in the bay area when i was young um and uh i wanted to get my radio working and it would not work so i took the radio apart put it back together and and see if you know uh how i can fix it and that and that to me was interesting uh taking things apart and so when when i uh went to high school and i was told to do something in a computer and i did the same thing i took the i opened the computer and figured out what's in there and i'm trying to figure out how to get the c prompt and all those things so so that was interesting to me so then my counselor says you know you like math you should do uh engineering that's how i went to computer engineering at cal poly and um but i still like dancing so throughout you know i took the dance classes i you know hiphop dancing you know i grew up from oakland right so i want videos i want videos um yeah so so that is um so so even though i went to cal poly um in computer engineering i continued that that hobby of dancing and now i do you gem dancing while here but i went to the back to silicon valley um after college and i did do the going into the lab really getting into the details of how the whole networking infrastructure work how we create this cl uh cloud computing all these different things and and so yeah so that was a passion to me because it was again putting things together uh taking it apart um and making the internet work right um in one of the demos i was uh it was told to go in front of the customer and present on the product and that day i realized wow this thing is fun like showcasing the product uh you know besides telling what the product is and so forth and so that was so interesting to me and at the point where i got to know the product manager and and then after a few years uh working with the product manager and he's telling me how i should create this product and i said why do you think we should create that so i started to question all the things that he's asking so then one day because i said i really like the being in front of the customer i said i want to do your job and then the the gm the general manager at that time said i think you could i think it's a great um segway for you because you do like being in front of the customer so i did so i went to product management and uh i've been product management ever since and it's talking in front of customer about the technology i still have to be geeky and get technical with with with uh all of them and you have to but now in my uh ways of of speaking and i i traveled to 25 countries since then and and pretty much spoken in in in all different events from russia to korea to japan you name it um yeah uh talking about the product and i love it and i still do dancing so nice awesome i think the one thing i heard in all of your introductions is that before you even knew what opportunities were there there were certain skills that you had that other people saw and said okay they're going to be awesome in this other role summers i'm actually going to come back to you and ask the first question which is before we even get into depth about what those different jobs and roles are what were the skills that you just saw were so important to have in tough regardless of whether or not you're an engineer ah very good question question cadence um definitely the ability to establish rapport with the people that you're you're um they're talking to and just having that soft skills man i didn't know and trained that and i didn't when i was taking computer classes no one told me that i should be a great speaker uh or or just being able to speak to your to your colleagues and and explain something in whiteboards and things like that i did not know that i should be learning how to do powerpoint for goodness sake right uh soft skills definitely key and and really having that eye to eye connection with the engineer is actually very important and and and being in front of those customers no matter what job you take whether it's marketing product management whatever roles that uh comes that ability to communicate and and really establish that relationship across to all your different teams is critical yeah nice and elia i remember you were talking about when you were really really early fresh out of college you were looking at those different jobs and roles what sorts of skills did you see then that were kind of common across and and you even still see now that you think whether or not you're an engineer this is a core skill to have in the tech world um i would say soft skills is definitely a lot important than hardcore skills i mean i learned a lot of technical skills on my own through school but you'll find that a lot of these skills don't really aren't that used i mean it's not useful hundred percent i think a communication be able to communicate effectively and also ask questions um when you start out in a new company i think asking questions learn um communicate with colleagues definitely helps to get your um yourself started okay nice um mary dance i'm gonna ask you the next question which is a lot of the people in this audience are in school right now and so they're trying to figure out okay what skills do i have and for a college student the best association for a new job is their major and so for people that are maybe similar to you in which they like all the technical stuff but maybe you don't want to be the ones executing it what sorts of majors um do you recommend for them or or how can they they translate a major that they're currently in into a nonengineering role that's a great question so i'm gonna give you a little background i have my sister she major in biology and i have convinced her for years i tried to convince her her skills are wonderful for the technical role she works in a nonprofit job where she deals with communities she deals with different issues and what i would say is no matter what degree you are in when you become a problem solver you will apply it to anything that comes to mind uh that is the biggest uh skill that you should have besides communication which is top number one i couldn't agree more with maurice and lily is problem solving skills because uh sometimes the problems can be even in terminology companies can be even as easy as emotional problems within the team and you need to be able to really understand okay why are people feeling why is it not being done this way how can we improve that um and if you have i it is more comfortable when you have a science background to move into the technical background so find your passion have um do what you really enjoy doing in college but besides that build yourself skills uh the best classes weren't the ones that were the technical as lydia mentioned where marisa mentioned where uh joining the leadership institute from my school working being part of groups starting my own club with my best friend we started a salsa dancing club and that showed me how to start something how to build a foundation how to um how to create relationships so that we can find someone that teaches it you will use those skills every day in your life yeah john yeah marissa i saw that you answered a question um in the chat and i actually think i want you to answer it for everyone so the question was do you think a cs major is necessary for the product management role um and then i also want to ask the the second part of that which is if that's not necessary what other majors may help for that role good question and i i tried to answer um in one of them is the so it depends on the company and the product that you're getting into uh usually in silicon valley especially at google facebook you name it you do need to have that engineering major where there's computer science i'm computer engineering so i could be both hardware and software so i wasn't tied to one thing so that helped me to actually be more broad so i was able to apply in different companies so it depends what uh but you know you don't have to do the computer programming apps outside of the college but having the engineering degree gives you more credibility in front of those engineers because you're telling them what to do product management is the owner of that product uh you know my in my company i own 80 of the product uh from a business perspective that's over 400 million right yeah so it's critical when that they have to listen uh you need to at least know and speak their language um and so yeah it's tough classes but at the end of the day you don't need to be a computer programmer but just finish an engineering degree whatever it is okay um lily i said i was going to come back to you with this question while we're talking about product managers can you help us differentiate product management versus project management versus program management to somebody not in tech those all mean the exact same thing well i think that these well program manager and project manager might mean different things in different companies in my company um project manager for production team they manages all of the the jobs are coming from clients scheduled um scheduled tasks for engineering work for translation for translator like they have to set timeline so that kind of things so it's not very technical at all we have a program manager program manager uh it's more for communication with a client um help them uh understand what their what their needs are in terms of getting getting their their products or their software uh translated and what is the scope what solutions we have um from our company uh like what technology we have in order to provide them uh the kind of solutions and the program manager are also they don't need to be technical but they do need to know uh the the software how it functions what functionalities are in there uh so that they can uh communicate to the client uh if there is anything that's too technical like for example if our clients is uh very technical and they ask certain questions that the program manager cannot answer then they they will contact um either product manager for more information or if product manager like myself cannot answer the question i go to our developers uh to find out more information um yeah so product manager for me i um the product that i'm managing is more technical than some of the other ones i know some my colleagues they don't have engineering background and there are managing some of the products as well so managing being a product manager doesn't always have to have engineering background but like marissa said it really helps a lot because when you communicate to uh developers especially you can define the requirements better you speak their language right so um you're not just uh putting your users requirement their words uh as uh the um requests to the developers i mean some developer has more understanding of what you're asking but sometimes they they don't always ask enough question back to you to define things more specifically and what would end up happening is the software gets developed and the functionality don't really meet the requirement of the user because of the the miscommunication so um so i mentioned communication is very important it's in not just in product management but in all areas right so um yeah so i guess um do you need a software engineering background i would say it helps and if you want to be a product manager you definitely should learn even if you don't have a degree in engineering but you um you do need to expect yourself to learn because uh if you don't uh keep up with the skills and knowledge uh you're not going to be successful yeah it's a combination of having literacy of engineering in general plus being able to be a planner plus kind of having that like sales aspect of being able to work with the people who are actually putting the money behind your project and who are deciding what kind of things they want the product to do in the future um and i will talk a little bit more about what it looks like to actually get these roles right like the interview process how do you navigate salaries and stuff like that but mary angelo i want to give you an opportunity to talk about your role as well um there's a couple questions that came in so one can you just explain to us what a tech consultant is because when i was in college consulting just sounded like answering questions if you look up the rule definition um but what is it actually and then on your daytoday what does it look like so consultants are people that solve and define problems for our clients that's how i can resume that an undefined meaning because when we get our client tells us this is the problem and 95 of the time it turns out that the problem is not that one but it's something else and understanding the entire perspective from the business eye as well as the technical side is very important when we start in in consulting first you are analyst and your job is to understand the culture of the consulting company to learn as many skills as you can um certificate so you get trained depending on the company that you are in and then you can specialize in a particular service option or you can diverse for example uh i started as an identity and access management analyst it means every time you log in in your system uh we put the middleware in between um that platform and authenticating you verifying that who you are and where you are and so on and so forth and after that i also learned about security policy which is more of the standards of more like a law degree a small law degree then i also work in application security that's more handson technology and i'm currently in data loss prevention meaning a company should store their data in such a way that if there is a hack that forbids they are able to retrieve that data immediately and solve the problem as soon as possible but there are many steps into that and many companies forget about that and they apply it at the end so uh usually is a as a security consultant it's it is very difficult to sell a business person that security is important but it's but when the hacks happen and you don't know when it happened yeah now we have allnighters and a lot of work to do right exactly that makes sense okay so boom we've gotten everybody's scope we know what everybody does on their day to day but we are only four people in a massive industry um outside of what you guys do what are the actual other opportunities that are in this field that are not um not necessarily engineering roles but just what else is out there maurice i know you talked about this a little bit for someone's question but how would you describe the entire scope of the options that are in tech okay i i can do it um so as a product so in tech uh it's a big silicon valley over here right uh usually it starts with the product yeah that product has um you know there's the engineering side which i know um is a is an option but um not the only option after the product is about to go launch you can have product marketing technical marketing field engineering they're the one hanging out talking to the customer daytoday you can have do field marketing marketing that product in a specific region uh or market in in other regions uh lo lilly was talking about localization you can have uh field marketing for japan for example which is different from uh the ones that are in korea so they have different field marketing the different regions uh there's manufacturing supply chain all these different folks that's that works in my building uh that all supports the product uh they're not necessarily have to be technical like me with engineering but they support my product they're the one creating the web web designs and the website doing that collateral data sheets uh for my product and and they put all of the blogs the the webinars all this different planning for the products so many many different ways but based on a product in silicon valley or if you're at google facebook is similar thing and you'll need marketing you need uh field sales all those things does that help yeah i think so it's kind of like in these different pillars right so you have the people that are like the strategic thinkers you have the the product managers the program managers project managers and then this isn't about engineering per se but you have different engineering functions everything's not coding there are people that manage security there are people that manage making sure that everything stays up and doesn't shut down there are people that manage the front end side that the users do there are people that manage the back end which is all the data and where things are stored and then there's there's the designers and even within designers there are different types of functions right there's the people that manage research and testing there's the people that manage um the ui of it which is kind of like an advanced version of graphic design and there's the people that do experience that are pretty much like behavioral psychologists in a way um and then there's even the people that manage you know like when we talk about infrastructure the testing of the of the product and all of that at first glance that sounds very overwhelming because it's going to be hard to find an article that shows you this massive map of what all your opportunities are right and a lot of this stuff you have to work your way up to it nobody is going to get a director of product management position right out of undergrad it's just not gonna happen unless you did undergrad after you know halfway through your career and so um lily i think i'll ask you this question is for the larger scope what are the actual entry level jobs that our students may be seeing or which ones are the easiest to kind of get started and prepare for now with the with engineering background or without engineering background let's talk about without without engineering background in the technology industry um i think let me try to think um well my company is a translation company it wasn't a technology company um to start with uh initially uh chance perfect well i started uh with translation.com so um the company started as a sister company for chance perfect um it specializes in um translating websites for different companies we used to use other companies technology so we well it cost a lot of money to pay for our company to use their software so what we ended up doing is we um hire our own group of developers and build our own tools um so my experience is a little bit different i start off with a localization engineer i know that not all of my colleagues have engineering background so through trainings and um from the from the experienced colleagues it is doable even though it had the title has engineer it's not as scary uh as software engineer that you have to know how to code and it's it's not technical but it definitely requires um i guess a mindset to solve problems all right so um localization engine i think one of the the question uh someone had asked uh about that um so the company uh has to process a lot of different source file in order to get that translated so that process requires the engineer to know different uh different file formats um and you like office files are the most common ones that majority people know and then there are also the the website uh file formats like html php now it's more json file uh json files uh xml files these are the most common types of files so i think um localization engineer is is a good one it does require some engineering learning as you serve maybe a project manager would be a good start i know someone who has been working as a project manager for years and then she she learned how uh to use uh our products and she uh she's more familiar with the product and she wanted to be a product manager after a few years of working with product uh in fact there's some mike not on my team but someone else that i know um she worked as a localization engineer and then she um she move on to being a qa quality assurance of the products so she has more exposure with the products and then now she's also a product manager so it's all about um learning a new tool new learning about the uh the applications whether it's a mobile application web application or desktop application so anything that you use on your computer your mobile app if you have interested on it do some research just just google um like product management software development they just have some basic idea what it is and then you know like uh if you do interview at least you're you're not completely clueless of what it is right um yeah yeah nice um married angela what would you say are some of the entrylevel roles that people can kind of start getting looking at or things that they may expect to see either titles that they could be comfortable feeling like they could actually get into out of graduation sure i would say a great way to see what you want is that many companies many companies that are not necessarily tech companies so broader your horizons think about okay you want to work in a fashion design brand or you want to work for a bank many of these companies have programs specific for entrylevel students that they rotate you through different positions and they hire people from uh from physics degrees psychology degrees uh really i work with many many of them some of them get hired during the inter process some of them get higher and right before school you graduate before school so my suggestion is always go to the career fairs during your last year before graduation apply for as many jobs as possible because those programs are directly targeted for that they start some of them start as early as july and then october october maximum november if you go to conferences and so on and so forth but that's the time frame uh yeah i think without um flying i i interviewed for about a hundred companies so i brought down well i learned what i wanted how what it meant to interview how what culture i like what culture i didn't like what was my expectation how to make my expectations and how to have a broader perspective i chose consulting because i never i get bored easily so i want to try different things but there are other opportunities consulting is not the other only one is just about being informed following the trends in recruiting your career department is the most useful always make your best friend out of them it doesn't matter what your your degree is i would say go for it um don't only target the tech companies because you know those are going to be they are looking for a specific stereotype uh so besides those look somewhere else yeah they will they will impress you yeah you just told my entire career story and you didn't even know it so story time um when i was a junior in undergrad i was involved in the national society of black engineers who has a very large national convention every year just like many other collegiate and academic organizations at that career fair the strongest interview i had was with ge general electric i was hired as an intern for the summer between my junior and senior year as an internship for ge's rotational program end of the internship these this is the thing that's really nice about rotational programs because you end the internship and then they offer you the job for after graduation and so when i graduated i had a degree in what our school it had a different name but it was basically a human computer interaction and design program which i saw somebody in the chat talk about the gang gang um and i also had a minor in cs because i was one of those people where i was like i'm going to work in tech don't really want to do coding but i don't want it to be a fallback because it's not seen on my resume somewhere and so i got it as a minor entered into this rotational program where i moved every six months and tried out different functions right there's a there's they'll put you in a design role that puts you in an engineering world they'll put you in different types of management roles and last year's when i finished that program and entered into a different design role at ge ge is not a tech company don't let anybody convince you otherwise ge is an industrial company that does tech and just like lily what you were talking about is there are plenty of companies out there that have tech jobs so you do not have to go after the googles and the microsoft's and the apples um there are tech jobs everywhere because what we talk about as tech today is something that is globally needed and it's always going to be right the skills may change but it's always going to be in demand um and so for me and i'll i'll just kind of touch on this a little bit because we don't have any other designers here i knew that i wanted to go into design because like i said i just i really care about everyday people i really care about what we call business to consumer products that are directly to people and so for the people out there that are questioning whether design is right for them let me break down a couple of things for you because this field can be confusing when people talk about ux they're talking about user experience and they're talking about ui they're talking about user interface the difference um if someone who specializes in in ux specializes in the overall experience that any user has in a product so it's a mix of how they feel about the product how easily they can get their tasks done when you get um when it's time for you to get your grades back from a teacher how quickly can you log in check your grade and go handle your feelings if that takes 10 minutes it's probably not a good user experience if it takes 30 seconds you might be doing something right the product might be doing something right user interface people that specialize in that are probably visual designers so they specialize in making sure the buttons are gorgeous and that the layout is on point in a way that the user can very easily scan the information and get to what they need to do people enter the ux field because remember ux involves the interface right the entire experience also includes what it looks like people enter that field from all over from engineering from product management from roles that have nothing to do with tech because it is just about your ability to advocate for a user right it's not about um it's not the same as market research right where you're trying to sell somebody something no these users are coming here to do something they probably don't have a choice um and so when you're thinking about whether or not this this field is right for you or you know that it's what you want to do and you're trying to figure out how to get there what you'll hear the most is that the most important thing to get you an interview in this field is being able to communicate your design process right so having a portfolio online that has examples of your projects and how you think through the design thinking process which google that later how you think about iterations how you take what our product managers here will provide you as a new feature okay the user needs to be able to do this thing in our tool now and then how you translate that into what the actual visual and technical experience is going to look like is really important to have documented somewhere because this field is different than other ones in that this is a field where you have to have something that speaks on its own in order to make it through the interview process right um and so there are a couple questions out there about ux if you have more just throw them in there and i'll try to answer them either through our discussion or on my own um but where that does bring us is i do want to talk at least one person answer a question about the interview process so let's say we have our students out there that are they know what they want to do they have everything with their degree set up the way that's going to get them recognized marissa how does someone prepare for the different types of interviews that might come up for tech roles and how do they navigate salaries like all of that good question um uh for tech technical interviews definitely you do need to know the basics uh even just i know you're not gonna do programming things like that it depends what roles you're applying for but look at the requirements of the job description and they'll tell you actually this is a plus you need to know c c plus plus python whatever it is if those are required you probably should make sure you at least know and open your your um or your notes on this area because that will probably be in the interview so most of the time anything that requires um uh in the in that job description they tell you exactly what you need if you if you need some information for amazon how do you set something up in amazon or azure google cloud those are our important things to at least highlight and understand those before the interviews so very very good one to know and then um so that's for any technical interviews understanding and what you should also do is check out who your interviewer is go check him i know it's like stalking but you know in linkedin they have their profile there get them who they are yeah okay so um we only have a couple minutes left and so i want to provide the students with one last piece of advice so just really quick round robin what is the one piece of advice you would give to someone in this position of trying to look for a role being in school and wanting to see what opportunities are not necessarily engineering lily what would you say um well i think uh i mean if you want to get into the tech industry you probably have some idea what you want to do right so based on that do some research to see what kind of jobs are out there product manager it's very broad for uh like marissa said it could be hardware it could be software so if it's a software that you're you want to get into there's also um software that's not that that's not requiring a very technical background so um if that's what you want to do um just look for those and just check out different uh industry not necessarily the the big uh to name uh tech companies right so even your local um company that you know of um check to see if they have any job offer uh maybe some somebody wants to have a product manager for for um yeah for website um and also ux i mean i i do mockups for ui um but definitely not anywhere close to ux um but ux is super important for us for software development for mobile app for web application so anything any software that for a particular function you have to click 10 clicks in order to get to something it's it's really bad design so there's a lot of uh jobs out there with me people in ux uh experience like if you're you're very good at pinpointing these types of problems as you uh look at the the online application uh you're probably this is probably your area that you wanted to get into yeah yeah okay mary d'angelo really really quick one piece of advice one piece of advice is be confident no matter what you started what where you come from what your skills are be confident of who you are and show that in your interview yeah nice what about you marissa be yourself have fun uh you know the i want the kid to know that they can do what they want and and have that confident and have fun right yeah awesome and mine would be just to create your own experiences so thanks guys welcome back emily y'all i can't believe how fast this went by the questions in the audience were just so amazing um we will put some of your best advice in our followup email tomorrow i would like to ask all of our attendees to just grab your phone and tell us your thoughts um one thing i'll tell you is as a team we're planning more of these talks for

also just cadence lilly marissa mary d'angelo like each of you had different experiences different journeys but the themes felt so similar and i feel like all of our attendees i'm hoping you took away some of these really concrete themes you know to believe in yourself to experiment to do research to consider different options not just the exact paths that everybody else is thinking about i also found your stories really inspiring um marissa i love that you continue to dance you know i love that you all shared a little bit about yourselves outside of work because we are all whole human beings that love tech and are interested in computer science but also have other interests and um this was just a delightful conversation and cadence thank you so much for bringing your moderation skills to us tonight and to all four of your companies for sponsoring this event um you will get everybody we'll get an email tomorrow there's a recording if you want to come back to like one of those great
