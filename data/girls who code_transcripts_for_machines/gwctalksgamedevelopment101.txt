it's our amazing panelists my girls who code colleagues but it's also all of these other folks that are joining in to be part of this conversation tonight and i hope that you take some hope and excitement and enthusiasm from that that there are so many people here who want to be part of this conversation we are delighted that you're spending some time this evening with us we know that you're

our panelists uh to introduce you our really incredible speakers for tonight's conversation about the industry of game development first we have diana laura who is a licensing production manager for star wars at zynga and those are probably two things you're familiar with star wars and zynga diana is a bronx new york city woman at heart currently living in texas she works in gaming is a performer i'm reading her bio right now and wow it is like blowing me away she produced your own video game tv show started a podcast quote unquote before it was cool i'm not going to ask you when that was diana but you can tell us about it if you want and has worked at companies like sony deep silver astro gaming and ubisoft and i asked diana before this whether it was ubisoft or ubisoft because it's okay to admit when you don't know something and she pointed out it depends on what country you're in which i loved um in her role she manages the relationship between the lucasfilm license and the game and marketing team and we're going to talk a lot about what that all means if that sounds like a whole bunch of what does she do all day long kind of gibberish we're gonna talk about that um and when she is not working diana likes to read knit and play video games she loves going to the movies as well as cooking yummy meals um before we move on to our second panelist uh diana what uh what are you reading these days what am i reading what i guess when i'm what am i not reading i'm i'm actually uh i actually took a break in all sincerity and i just took a break from reading and i'm back to uh reading my comic books so i like to take like six months off and get everything everything uh like a backlog going and then i just like kind of binge it all so i love it i love graphic novels too we can if you have a favorite graphic novel feel free to drop it in the chat i bet diana and i are taking all your recommendations um i just found out the saga series is going to have new issues so that's what oh yeah it came back it came back a few weeks ago it's amazing oh we've we've got recommendations going in the chat bring it everybody yeah um our second panelist tonight is valva kante hi val who is the director of strategy product innovation for merkel which is a densu company in her role val uncovers cultural trends design strategies and next generation product innovations we're going to talk about what all that means impacting the way that people connect and experience the world val has like eight side hustles she's the founder of calabsco where she pioneered the first ever connected play landscape she's an awardwinning uh digital product designer and it has experiences created experiences excuse me across iot i think that's internet of things is that right val iot yes ar augmented reality virtual reality robotics and beyond um her portfolio features 50 brands including ones you've probably heard of like hasbro and mattel and disney um and outside of work you can find her anywhere creators are designing the future i love that museums accelerators incubators gaming events popups arcades you two sound like fun do you have fun [Laughter] we're gonna start with an icebreaker um i'm loving the chat already uh let's oh i cut out that's what happened there thank you everybody um i'm back uh we're going to start with an icebreaker to get this show rolling and then we're going to dive into conversations about what their careers have looked like how you could consider careers like theirs though of course there's many versions out there and the way we want to start is a childhood game that you enjoyed playing and why um and if we want to start with val and folks in the chat feel free to answer yours cool so um one of my most favorite games as a kid um actually taking it way back was um was sitting in arcades or pizza joints with my dad and playing the likes of our atari classics like centipede and pacman but uh but fast forward a bit i would have to say when it was i got my first console which was an nes so again taking it way back you guys to the super mario brothers days and it was great because it was premultiplayer experience so your multiplayer experience was your friend sat next to you in the room and so we play together learn the game together die replay learn it you know peruse the nintendo magazine together so those were those one of my favorite um super mario definitely one of my favorites i love it um and how about you diana so for me um i my family and i we moved uh we moved from the jamaica republic to the united states and we didn't have that we didn't go anywhere and we were and we moved to louisiana in the middle of nowhere and so we really didn't socialize how about very much of anything so we had video games and so my dad they said so either my dad or my mom i don't know which one but most likely my dad uh brought in an atari uh an atari like 7 800 or something like that and then um that was uh that was how we played um and then once we got the nintendo like all bets were off like that's i mean we were we were at the cutting edge of technology there uh and so it was fantastic so we um and so my favorite game uh to play was the legend of zelda um and i played it with my mom and so my mom would say you know i'd come back i come home from school and she'd go do you need to finish your homework and of course i finished my homework uh fantastic and then once i was done with my homework uh she was like okay let's play and so we would we played uh we played the legend of zelda and that was fantastic and awesome and a great memory uh i love it and i don't know if you can tell but the enthusiasm coming through in the chat everyone has an answer to this question um i'll answer for myself i think it was natasha maybe earlier who said sims i was a sims kid i used to like have to go to bed and then everyone would go to sleep and i would sneak back downstairs because there was some milestone that was about to happen in my sims game somebody was going to age up or get married or get a promotion at work and i just like man it was so addictive that feeling i i have to admit during uh the height of the pandemic i redownloaded sims and it's uh it's still there i don't know any other sims folks we do in the chat sport has taken so much of my money i understand that so i i want to start us here because this is such you can see the enthusiasm both from youtube the panelists but also in the chat people love games they love playing games it makes them feel good it makes them feel creative makes them feel connected and i think one of the most exciting things to think about for our community at girls who code is how you might take your love of games and turn it into a career and we talk all the time at girls who code oh minecraft excellent choice ariana we talk at girls who code all the time about how you know when you think of computer science you think i have to be an engineer and i probably have to work at google like that's the path right if i'm interested in tech or computer science that's what i'm supposed to do and that's by the way an awesome path if that's the path you go but there's so many roles in the tech industry that you can have and there's so many places to do that work and i want to start by really understanding your job titles so diana i want to start with you here you are a licensing production manager for star wars at zynga tell us what that means so um so it's kind of to rewind a little bit how you said uh you know not having like uh not really having like your standard sort of engineering um engineering role um that was never that was never me um so i like to say that my career has been kind of windy um i think folks think that in order to be in the gaming industry like you said you need to be like an engineer or you need to uh a code in some in some particular way um but i'm kind of i like to say that i'm kind of proof that's not true um i i actually my my my degree in college was i went to i went to college for musical theater um so um i like to say that i can sing dance and act at the same time and i have a degree to prove it hey so uh so i i i that's that's what i did for like the first couple of years of my life uh theater kid yes um uh because and you know what's funny is that theater kids uh there are a lot of theater kids in the um gaming industry um i think it's just because it's just because it's a creative it's another creative outlet um it's artsy as somebody said in in the chat um it's so it's a way to sort of transfer your skills obviously i'm not you know singing singing and dancing i mean debatable if you know me in in the in the office i'm usually doing that on the in the hallways but like um but when it comes to like the relationship uh relationship building when it comes to the interpersonal relationships because when you're creating a a a show and you're putting a show on broadway or offbroadway or you know um in in my case you mentioned a a video game tv show it was like on public access in you know ups in like new rochelle um past the bronx new york and so that's when you're putting together a show you're all kind of working together and you're working towards a common goal and putting it out there so that folks uh can enjoy and that's really like the core thing of theater and you're all coming together and you're kind of like a family and um really that's uh that's that's the gaming industry and it and it really really translates and i try to explain that to folks because um i used to i used to actually i used to actually downplay uh that you know when i when i first started in the industry and and then i realized wait a minute like all of the skills that i learned working um in in um in theater and performing in theater all translate to this now that was a very long way of saying what my job is my job is um i take um that i'm kind of like if i want to use a theater term i'm kind of like a sort of a stage manager of some sort let's use it let's use that um where uh in a very very loose way where i need to sort of um i work with everybody i touch everything so i need to work with engineers i need to work with the artists i need to work with uh producers um the executives the vice president like the high the high people as well um people who own uh who who run the company so i need to work with everybody i need to be able to sort of like you know adjust how i talk to when i'm talking to an engineer um when i'm talking to an artist when i'm talking to um you know a narrative designer um i also need to know uh i need to know uh the stories and i need to know the characters um and so i kind of interact with all that internally at zynga but then also to add an extra layer i'm also interacting with the people at lucasfilm for star wars so i'm interacting with all those those same exact folks um in um at lucasfilm and then also like taking like their feedback and any sort of questions that they may have about the production about the show that's not the show back in theater terms in the game uh that were that we're making and bringing and bringing that back to make sure that like we're honoring or honoring uh the star wars uh the star wars property um and then also giving the studio uh the power and the creative agency to be creative and to be awesome and to make awesome games um so that was a very long longwinded way of saying what my job is but um i like to say that i'm the glue that connects everybody everybody together and a cheerleader i love that and i i love a few things about it you know people think of working in tech sometimes is really isolating like oh i just sit at my computer and i code all day right and in fact depending on your role it might be really collaborative it might rely on communication it might be really creative um you know it's not necessarily just you in a dark room coding unless it's problem solving yeah it's also problem solving you know it's also being you know understanding kindness um i think people there are too many hard skills that people think about when they think about going into the gaming industry and even in just in jobs in general and soft skills like thinking about you know collaboration and and kindness and and understanding and patience these are all things with all different kinds of people right exactly thank you um that's i'm i'm excited to learn more as we go on today um val okay similarly you have this title director of strategy comma product innovation for merkel a densu company i don't know how any of this fits on a business card but tell us what that means well the good news is we don't really have business cards anymore right so so linkedin and twitter give you the character limit right um but yeah so um basically my role at merkel is really kind of uncovering cultural trends uh working with teams similar to diana um you know what uh all crossfunctional teams right so it's like designers engineers um even subject matter experts as well in different areas um and so wearing multiple hats as well but really in addition to kind of uncovering those cultural trends it's also creating new products and services for our company but also teaming up with our clients to help them uncover those opportunities as well as early prototypes on new products that they might come up with and i'm really fortunate that i've worked with such great brands like hasbro and mattel where play um and mixing and merging not only physical toys and games but also now that we're living in a connected world um connected experiences so how does this physical toy engage whether it's an app play experience whether it's a gamified experience um you know i think everybody heard all about the travis scott fortnight event that happened during the pandemic well what was really cool about that is um you know you had brands like hasbro who are launching a physical product um at the same time that this event was happening in fortnight and uh launched all on the same day and that involved a ton of different people right so that's everybody from like a uh industrial designer who's making that nerf blaster you know to the manufacturer to oh by the way the folks over at epic right launching that experience as well and coordinating you know all of the different bits and pieces um and then in terms of how i started my career so i've always i've always been a nerd a digital techie whatever person at heart i mean like i told y'all back back when i was a little kid playing playing pacman and centipede uh but my career didn't take me straight to gaming so just like diana's it's like i didn't i didn't start in gaming um my first actually my first first role out of university um it was at uh a agency in london an advertising agency and at the time you had sort of traditional advertising you had like tv you know and blast all these sort of ads everywhere and then there was like this relatively new thing called digital and i applied for two roles there and i was you know called to come in they wanted to make me an offer i i and this was in london i hop on the 28 bus i get down there and i'm wearing like one of my three sort of nice suits that i bought myself went down there looking all nice and then uh and this lady she was sort of like wincing and making all these faces and all these emotions i'm like did i get the job i mean y'all called me down here and so so she's like well you know everybody loved you and they thought you're great but and i'm like my gosh say it she's like we only have the digital opportunity you know and i was like oh that's cool that's the future like that's completely cool yeah and so it was great in that um i was able to um actually the team were really open because we were creating things that hadn't been done before whether it was new technologies content management systems how people interact with physical and digital products um and so i had a lot of autonomy and i was able to work with crossfunctional teams and learn from them so i was really thankful for the experience and it's i love that you use the word windy diana to describe your career and now val you're telling the story where it like took a hard left where the job you thought was going to be available maybe wasn't and those kinds of things happen it's not a straight line right especially when you work on the cutting edge in technology and gaming and creative fields there's always new stuff to learn and i actually wanted to ask you both work kind of adjacent to the technical work you talked about working with engineers communicating with technical folks you know value talked about working in internet of things and ar and vr when you have to learn a new technology like let's say you're starting on a project that you're not really familiar and you've got to learn how to speak the language learn the basics like how do you approach that maybe we can start with you on this one bell yeah i mean in terms of any any new technology that's out there you know i really just try and educate myself on it because it's it's new right so like people don't always know how to talk about it i think about way back in the day um when the internet became popular it was like people didn't know how to talk about it they called it the world wide web they called it the information super highway like how many words is that to say i mean now it's just the internet right you just or go online um and so at that time like we were learning how to talk about it and even with mobile phones when those became common you know people would say oh do you have a cellular phone like no one talks like that anymore so um so i think it's it's basically you know for me it's it's learning about it i also write as well and so um i'm always looking at like how are people talking about things and then when i'm writing and researching and talking about these new things as they come out i always want to make it as easy for people to understand as possible um when i'm communicating out so i try and absorb how others are talking about it and distill it down into like just regular people language you know uh and yeah so that's my my take i love it how about you diana when you encounter some new technology and and you have to learn the ropes yeah i mean i'm whenever uh and this has always been been a constant for me it was like always have a natural sort of curiosity towards things and so i uh much like that i kind of do do the research i research about it i read about it i also ask asked around like hey what do you know about this um and then uh occasionally uh check out a couple of youtube videos if anything anything exists about it so i i like i i i read a lot and um and then also uh depending on the on the form of technology um i'll either like uh purchase it or like uh or or ask somebody hey can i uh come come over to your place and use it um like in the in the vr for example like when it first when it was first coming out um for for a home um and i was sort of debating it i had a friend who who who was programming for it and i was like can i just swing by and just like check out your your oculus or whatever like what can i just check that out so i just you know i would do that as well so i really really make the effort to um to educate myself and just and just learn it and then sometimes i just jump in like for example when i worked at ubisoft um i was using um they have a proprietary uh uh platform that they use uh called snowdrop and so um that's that's not available anywhere unless you work at ubisoft and so i was like oh okay so this is pretty cool um it kind of you know kind of unique let me try it out and it was and so you know so like i would i would take like my lunch times in a couple a couple of hours uh you know throughout the week and and i and i jump in and i and i try and i try things out and i even like i i even went to like the audio team um and i was like hey i heard y'all needed help um i have some free time uh what can i do and they were like oh we need somebody to add steps in the game and i was like sign me up i will be the step person 100 and so that's what i did and so the steps that you hear in in the game that was me i did that so that's so that's it it's really neat and uh and so that's that's what i did and um and that's what i edit what i normally do is i just jump in and learn i love it and i love that you mentioned like youtube videos and googling and reading people think that engineers like somehow memorize everything no no everybody is googling everybody's watching youtube videos everybody's looking it up on stack overflow right and i don't know if you can see in the um in the chat i asked folks what they're learning and everybody is teaching themselves something right now we have folks learning python we have powershell somebody else said what is powershell i love that we're all learning new stuff i'm learning react i'm making a visual novel game using python oh my god kayla sounds amazing that's so cool um free code camp is an amazing resource there's so many of these so i just want to thank everybody who's been sharing resources in the chat um i want to talk about the industry a little bit game development is a huge umbrella and i would love to know about like what are the trends that you see in the field so most of the folks listening in not everybody is in college or recently graduating and if they're thinking about like where is this going what roles and fields might i consider i would love to know as an insider what you think the options are and if you could also talk about some of the big buckets of types of work right like engineering is a bucket design is a bucket uh product marketing and licensing and i don't even know what all the other buckets are um diana i'm just pingponging back and forth here tell us about your thoughts on the industry at the moment uh i think they were at a very exciting moment in the industry i actually just did a licensing um a licensing twitter spaces uh last that last week time has no meaning i don't remember yes so that yes it was last week um where we where we talked about you know the future of licensing and and um and uh and partnerships and how you know companies uh in some cases these you know like i use i use my example like in my case like uh like zynga star wars um lucasfilm uh slash disney slash marvel such those guys um and how how these particular uh companies are are starting to sort of branch out into um not just being a part of gaming and not just also uh not just doing movies either but also getting into gaming and not just also doing gaming but also how that kind of connects into um like somebody mentioned gummy bears like they're like licensing gummy bears like yeah i know right with like with like the character faces so things like that like you know so you see that you see that everywhere um but now you're starting to see these like major um video game companies starting to move in into that so like ubisoft as an example um is starting to uh like moved into uh tv film even though they've they've had movies even though they've uh they've they've done um they've licensed things out now they actively are like wait a minute we should we don't have to give it to anybody else to take like i'm not giving i'm not giving my property or my ip to you now we can actually do all the work we have a humongous amount of talent in our studio oh we could take a narrative designer from this game and they could ride a movie you know so it's like so these are the sort of the sort of ways that um the industry is is expanding in that like it's not just about making video games and so anymore it's sort of making a like a making uh a video game into it is an industry but more um uh more like because when you think of like when you know when you think of like the uh the gaming industry at least some folks still think of it as a young industry and it's not as mature as like movies uh movies and tv and so now like you know the these video game companies are starting to expand and really try to try to mature uh the industry and and that stuff is really really exciting which means that that opens up you know those buckets to not just being an engineer now now they're going to need obviously legal but not just like legal for gaming they're going to need legal for for shoes and legal for food legal for for movies um or or just just lots of different i just muted myself um lots of different uh types of of people um who aren't um who who aren't just um just engineers as well thank you um it's like such an exciting time and it's a growing space right um now what have you noticed about trends in the industry the skills and roles that are available what are you seeing yeah um i loved what diana said about that because i mean in short i would say gaming is the new hollywood right so like you know over time we had it was all about going to the movies watching your favorite tv show but it is completely flipped gaming is influencing culture gaming is influencing ip right so intellectual properties and licensing so that's why there's all of these incredible opportunities out there and what it means is you know as if you're a game designer if you're a writer you know because narrative is really important in terms of like what is that story that happens in the game play so um so if you're a really great writer you know that's that's an ideal opportunity to look at hate maybe it's being becoming a narrative writer in a game um the other thing is in terms of design as well you know there is game design but then we're seeing more things like these virtual events um and also with gaming influencing culture it's also influencing i touched on toys a moment ago like those physical toy plays so that means hey we need toy designers to shape those experiences uh but also events as well right so i know like the world's opening up we just had south by southwest here in austin for the first time since 2019 uh gdc right is happening right now right the big game developers conference out in san francisco is happening right now and so all of the the sort of gaming communities there um there's there was an incredible excuse me incredible event prior to covet called game xp down in brazil and it actually had all it has the world's largest esports screen by the way if they ever bring it back amazing how big are we talking i don't have the measurements of it but it is it is uh it is massive and like it is it is a true claim that it is the biggest um but with an event like that bringing um like fortnite into the real world they have like a whole drop thing they had crash bandicoot and they had people on scooters that's right so extending that ip into those physical play experiences um and then i think the other wave of it too to consider is as as new technologies become more accessible right so we're thinking when you think about web ar for example so augmented reality it's all been kind of appbased for a while folks have been experimenting with augmented reality glasses but i think where we're going to see a big experience shift our folks experimenting with um web ar experiences so uh there's company called the eighth wall they were just acquired by niantic who are the creators of pokemon go um and they have a great platform so for those of you who know just a little bit of unity right now um who are kind of experimenting with unity you know you can go on niantic and experiment with light ship if you want to look at kind of creating a make the world your your gamified experience and experiment with that that's one of the big things i really encourage folks to do or some of these tips and tools are completely free and accessible um so really get out there and experiment i i myself i'm not a trained engineer i am not a train coder um we're actually having a chat before the session today and sometimes for for me when i'm trying to communicate an idea i might just experiment with different technologies to um create a light prototype so that i can demonstrate you know with with a designer with um an engineer in order to to realize that idea so um again kind of flipping it gaming is the new hollywood and it's really you know the possibilities are endless i love that um we're getting some questions about like let's say you have an idea for a game like a story or um an arc that you want to experiment with and you know you mentioned unity there's so many technologies out there have either of you seen anything creative about how someone can start building a little prototype or making a little game or what tools or software maybe folks are talking about in that space any ideas for people who just want to kind of mess around and get creative whoever wants to take this one first go for it yeah i think there are there are a lot of uh there are a lot of of of tools out there i mean i think didn't somebody i think mentioned twine uh you know like they were creating a story um a visual novel or something like that which i think is there are a lot of those those uh it really i always tell people that you can always say i want to make a game everybody wants speaking everybody's got an idea to make a game it doesn't matter my mom has an idea to make a game everybody does but like the key is actually doing it and so and actually take making that effort i know that sounds very very silly to say but it's and it's easier said than done but it's really literally just like there are i mean there there are so many uh uh uh uh programs and tools and things that you can do to just make like you can make your own simple game and and create you know a particular uh uh mechanic that is uh that is super interesting that then you could you know bring to uh bring to uh you know a discord that you know that you're in uh where you're talking and you're like hey i have this really great mechanic with where where there are other people and they're like oh let's all let's all let's let's let's make something else and then but the first step is actually like taking that step because everybody can talk talk talk talk talk about it but once you finally move in there um move in and start and start actively like you know doing it then that's that's honestly the the first step in and frankly it really is the hardest step and once you just start you you find that you can't stop um it just sort of tumbles forward and and that that's uh um and that's what i found i'll add one piece before i turn it to val which is just find some friends to do this with because doing this as a group is so much more fun and when you get really frustrated you have people to troubleshoot with um but val what were you going to say yeah i was also just going to say it is it is getting started and it doesn't have to be super complex i think the main thing is just to communicate your idea um it can be even with paper for example you know so if you just wanted to get some sketches together with paper or you know just use google slides and try and you know even if it's like a mood board or some gifs to communicate the idea or even things um you know when i know i was talking about augmented reality and lightship and maybe knowing unity even taking it a step back and experimenting with like snapchat lenses for example and just getting in there and and having a play um and i think too from a game design perspective you know we talked about um obviously video games mobile games augmented reality vr but there's also um connected experiences as well there have been a number of companies who've worked with smart speakers for example so there's things like alexa that you can uh experiment with physical digital play with board game play so hey if you're a board game fan and you're like you're and you have a friend who's like a super into music or into sound i mean you guys get together and and do some experimenting i love that and val i really love your focus on play as like a worthwhile pursuit like that is how you experiment with things that's how you learn that's what keeps it fun i just really love that approach i have one last question and then we'll take a few from the um group the audience so audience folks feel free to drop questions you can put them in the chat or you can drop them in the q a i see a couple already in the q a that i'll try to get to my last question for you too is about a little more practical you're trying to get an internship or a job let's say you're trying to do it in this field you're picking your classes you're looking for summer internships maybe you're teaching yourself some things on the side what practical advice do you have to really prepare yourself to apply for jobs as an early career person in this space diana why don't you take it away to start um can you repeat the question one more time just just so that i don't because there's two different ways that you can interpret that practical advice for getting ready to apply for jobs in this field maybe that's classes to take types of tips to look for skills to build well i mean it really uh that's so that's that's that's actually very a very hard question um simply because that can it really depends on what sort of career path you want to take i mean i i for me um you know i can only use myself as an example um i like to think that every class that i that i took in college in some way uh you know that obviously except for except for that what because i took volleyball like as a passive class so i was like oh i've got an extra credit let me just take volleyball just for fun um so maybe the volleyball may not count but like everything else that i've taken um feeds into uh feeds into like my my experiences um i think that when you have your a specific sort of skill set that you're trying to go into if you're trying to do uh a um like tech art or art um there are obviously there are those those particular courses i always tell people that the best way to go to go forward when when you're um when you're in college in session high school is to really find your find your group like um i mentioned earlier find your find discords um you know there are there are a lot of like uh uh uh um groups like this that that are um that uh have networking um uh networking possibilities where you can connect with other people who can help you uh connect to uh uh connect or guide you um in the direction that you need to go um that you would like to go um and i think that in in your early in your early early days of of your of your career i think the most important thing really is just soaking in as much information as you can um really uh doing um doing things that you're you know in your in your free time in your spare time uh learning uh if for whatever reason you're not you know you're you're the courses at your at your school or um don't offer unity as an example then like okay you know that unity is is is is um is important uh for for uh game development then you know do that on your spare time um there are there are a lot of resources right now where uh that where you can you can actively learn you know me growing up i didn't have any of that so i pretty much had to learn on the job um but now i'm just i'm just amazed at the amount of information and research not research um um uh what's the word the amount of things advice tips advice is the content networking that that's out there right now um so that's that's something free content yes thank you thanks jolene um i do think that's great advice um val what do you think sort of practical getting ready for careers type uh type advice yeah i think that it's really important um and i i say this from experience you can have a lot of anxiety like oh my gosh is this the thing i'm going to do for the rest of my life no um so but find out what your you know what you've studied what you have interest in and really think about the companies you want to work for like do you want to work for a big company do you want to work for a small company um and really look at the type of companies and culture you want to work for um look at the the job descriptions that they have you know see what are the kind of roles um that you might be interested in so maybe it's not a right out of college role but hey if it's something with you know the the first step and then that'll give you a sense of maybe the type of classes or the type of um activities to do and i think there's a ton of value in building your own portfolio um so whether um whether that is doing something on the side for a company an internship but even if an internship isn't available if there's something that you have a point of view a prototype or an interest um build it make it include that in your portfolio use that in your you know in your interview when you have that um it's again i just ca like it as deanna said there's so many tools out there that you can empower yourself and your creativity with and i think it's also being yourself too is really important so whether it's building your portfolio your resume and then the last thing i'd like to add to the group here is really network i mean again linkedin free tool out there find find people who um who might inspire you i mean a lot of people are happy to um talk with people coming out of university you know who have an interest they may not have a job for you off the spot like when you reach out to them but they may have advice or they may be able to connect you with someone or they may have a friend and so while you personally may not have a big network you know just start building it and there's a ton of people out there who are happy to help where they can i suspect both of you are going to get a lot of linkedin requests later today i also want to thank the folks in the chat and the chat excuse me who have been sharing some other ideas about how to like stay up on the business i think um setting google news alerts for topics that you're interested in can be really great um there's a list somebody shared here about tick tockers to follow or instagram accounts to follow um twitter is super important in the tech industry as well but really you can just start reading you know and you'll start to start to figure it out um i appreciate julian your linkedin is important i just want to say that we also have a discord server um janelle shared that a couple of if you scroll up we have a girls who code discord server and this conversation you've been having in the chat where you're saying hey i i'm curious about resources for this is anybody else learning python that's what's happening on our discord so please like join if you're going to a cool event like another virtual panel invite everybody say who wants to come to this with me or say hey i found this awesome person to follow on twitter you all should follow them as well um really share your resources with this community and people will share back with you i want to take a couple of the really great questions people have asked um this one is well we've gotten this in a couple of ways it's sort of a question that caitlyn asked somebody else asked it in the q a um it's about balancing work and life and specifically around personal projects and interests and maybe growing those things and you're nine to five where you know you get a paycheck and health insurance i hope um so val why don't you start with this how do you think about that balance so i mean i will say it it is a challenge i mean it is it is a challenge um you know if you're working and i think particularly when you're working in something you enjoy um and again it's me personally i've had challenges with this because when i'm enjoying my work and i'm i'm solving a particular problem working through a creative idea um i get immersed in i want to keep going um for me running is really important and just general fitness so the volleyball is okay but you know fitness is important uh spending time with my family is important and so a good gauge is like if i'm not running as much as i was or um if i'm not doing the regular activities then i know i need to check myself you know i know like okay i have this this stint where it's gonna be intense like whether we have a big big launch or something coming up but then after that and i try and manage that with my family as well like look we have this big event this launch and then after that you know we need to work i always say like get back to regular so that is you know running that is spending the time but i mean when you do what you love it can be a challenge i love naming that and finding what your regular is and that's going to look different for everybody is so important how about you diana well for me um i i have uh in the last couple of months have been very uh very transparent about uh my burnout um because i i experienced burnout um i worked you know i i worked in in game development obviously and so game development was uh it has uh has it you know depending on the studio a terrible worklife balance to be frank that's just you know that's how it is but thank goodness things are changing and i think what val said earlier about when you're looking at at companies and you're looking at you know um uh you know where you want to work it's important that you know the companies that you work at uh provide that that important uh worklife balance um otherwise you become burnt out like i did um and so uh and so for me um because i think uh one of the things that we need to we need to you know as women we need to constantly remind ourselves is that like we have because we have to work a lot harder you have to work harder um we have to pr we have to prove ourselves um a lot more and so you know i found myself just working uh too many hours um i found myself putting a lot of pressure on myself um i thought i found myself taking taking work that didn't um uh taking work that you know frankly wasn't my job and uh because but because you know i was not um because i wasn't uh you know feeling like i was you know being treated equally um i felt like i needed to work extra and that significantly burnt me out um and i crashed and i needed um and i needed to take a break and so uh what i so i i would be lying to you i would be lying to you if i said oh yeah you know i just you know go i i go running because i i literally could not get up like get get off my couch because that's how tired i was uh my brain was you could just could not um put that together and i'm giving you all this information because i i think it's important that we we talk about the about burnout um in this industry um and we also talked that we were also honest with ourselves um and it yes you're so right caitlyn it takes such a long time to recover from i'm just recovering from it um i when you asked me emily what book i was reading um earlier i didn't pick up a book for about five years and because i just could not i could not put i could not read so i just read i just finished reading a book a couple months ago and now i'm back in my comics and all this other all this other uh really really great things um but uh what i've started to do is punch out so i punch out at a specific time um every day and i say i'm done and then you know i i have a laptop for work and then i have my own pc and i shut down my laptop and then i hop on and i you know play final fantasy or i or i you know go and play something else or i i get up um and i go for a walk i i have my i have my dogs that i love very much and i go take them out for a walk i started gardening um so i find like i find like it's necessary that we need to have uh that that it's important that we advocate for ourselves for that worklife balance um value you're not in your head i feel like you need to say something go like i'm like oh i'm like whoa amen yes because because i've definitely been there in a couple of stents throughout my career um i've definitely been there one actually one time happened my son was really young and he i was working a ton of hours i was traveling a lot um and he just happened to be jumping on the bed and he actually gave me a concussion like by the kid's got a hard head but uh he actually gave me a concussion and knocked me out for about six weeks like where i was not not but i was conscious but it but it i had to take work off for six weeks and the doctor told me he's like you're going to have to put your type 8 personality on the back burner so i like this like i'm like i'm like a b now like like and then but i i got to that point and then um and then sure enough it creeped back up again i was in a very um executive role i was the only woman who had ever been in that kind of role uh definitely the only mom who had ever been in that kind of role so as you were talking about that's that responsibility or feel like having feeling like you're having to like do more you know to prove your worth to prove like i can do it too you know i definitely i'm like oh i'm like i've definitely been there and i think it is really important you know that hey we i think one we hold ourselves accountable but we also are vocal in that and we set those boundaries you know it's like uh here's you like you say you like you punch out and you go play final fantasy i mean mine's like i got my oculus in there but i need to get it but it is and and now kind of um that that's where i am now it's like i know i need to get i know when i need to get back to my regular and i am vocal um you know at i will say at dinsu uh and merkel our team our team's there they appreciate that and they value that and i also encourage everybody else to you know hey raise your hand if you're if you can't take you know if you can't take on something else or communicate hey i've got this you know this is when i i will um and be being vocal and being your own advocate i think is super critical finding a place where you feel safe enough to be like hey you know you need to find find find that that positive place that where you know that you can you know you can go to your teammates and you can go hey um i don't feel very good i woke up with a headache or hey um i have i have cramps today i and if they're killing me so i'm gonna go take a nap and so they'll be like yeah sure go for it so that's that's the sort of positive environment um that uh that we we need to we need to bring which i think comes with those soft skills it does come with the soft skills and it also comes i think with more diverse people working in these spaces and being able to share themselves and i'm going to end this on a positive note because it got a little heavy and i i say that in a good way like sharing some of the vulnerabilities and the coping and also the times when the coping doesn't really work that happens sometimes so i want to end on um a very fun question this is from vanessa she asked what's a moment from a video game that has always stuck with you and that's going to be our last little quick question for the group and then just for the audience we're going to share some upcoming girls who code events and programs and then we're going to rap because we respect all of y'all's time and it's uh it's a late evening so a video game moment that has always stuck with you whoever's got one drop it i've got one okay i'm gonna take it all the way back to pacman like when they go in the middle you know and they kiss like i love that um mine is mine is a uh is it mmo final fantasy uh so there were two final fantasy 14s there was the first one and then they relaunched it again because the first one was not as successful but the really neat thing that they did was they in the first one they made it so that like for like a couple of months there was like this like meteor that was just like over here somewhere and then it got closer and closer and closer and it would be like the impending end of the world and so everybody and so like everybody signed on and we sat there as this like meteor came and it's nothing and it came and like destroyed the world and then a a cut scene showed up that was like amazing and then it started it started the next one that was one of the best game moments of my life i thought that was fantastic these are amazing and vanessa answered her own question which i love too about seeing herself represented in a game i mean these are amazing um we're gonna rap because time is valuable um val diana i feel energized i hope our audience does as well um for the folks in the chat there's so many amazing resources here and i hope you're taking notes but we're gonna send you an email tomorrow with lots of them um and we're gonna um also invite you to join the
