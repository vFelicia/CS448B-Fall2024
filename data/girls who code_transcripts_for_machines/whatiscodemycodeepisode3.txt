hey there Shannon here Brittany here Audrey here I'm Margo and welcome back to another episode of my code in this episode we'll be explaining what code actually is code is the message you use to convey things code is a set of symbols created by computer programmers to help give meter to certain tasks when you're writing code you're basically giving your computer to do lists and then it runs through all the commands and does whatever you wanted me to do you can think of code as the recipe for your favorite chocolate chip cookies the recipe will tell you what ingredients you'll need how many of each ingredient you'll need and what exactly to do to make those cookies so if you type into a calculator 2 + 2 and it gives you back four you've just committed a calculator that's basically how code works except the commands get way more complexity you can build all kinds of awesome programs when I go to get into the car and I flip through the radio station channels all these things were coded so I can interact with them and control them the code means to create and write out the instructions for our computers whether it's brainstorming how you're going to structure a program or physically typing it out these both are part of the process of coming to code it means to communicate with a computer in a way you can only understand it for instance you can talk to me in English you can say like Oh Margo or Ola Margo and I'll understand throat code is a way of talking to a piece of technology like your computer and having it respondents subway when you write code you're basically giving you a computer a bunch of commands and then it gives you back the result of whatever those commands work code means to write out exactly what you want your computer to do the code is a transfer your ideas onto a computer using a programming language you can code a website a video game a robot or anything you wish all you have to do is type out some commands in the correct order it's fans you have yourself your very own coding creation I use code to do a lot from when I wake up in the morning and my alarm clock goes off to when I go to get a cup of coffee for my Keurig it's coded to let me know what time it is if I need to fill it up with water what size cup I should choose I use code to solve the problem that I encounter every single day for example when I had trouble keeping track of all my homework I created an app that told me when assignments are due it made me a thousand times more efficient and it made me proud of my coding skills I use code to make small tech space projects and then you just like Java sometimes these projects are simple with like a basic calculator but other times I'll spend weeks or even months creating like a choose your own adventure game I use codes create programs that can either help me or help change the world for the better you can use code to create art or to create the inventions that you want to see a reality all these things are coded so I can interact with them and control them I have been coding for the past four years and those four years I've mainly coded video games and in those video games I teach players how to recycle better and about social issues that are unknown these projects are really fun to make and they help me practice my coding skills well we hope you're a little more familiar with code now next week we'll be talking about programming with and what exactly they do questions write them in the comment section below see you right here next week bye guys bye
