the test bed is closely following behind the psyche spacecraft as it progresses through the launch procedure my shift begins when we first communicate to the spacecraft since liftoff and this is done through something called commands Now commands are directions that we give to the spacecraft which we tell it what to do and what kind of inform of information that we need from it the room will be making sure that the spacecraft is in a safe State while the test beds are sending the same commands and simulating the same data that we would get from the spacecraft if anyone in the team or in the room was curious about a specific command we would first test it on the test bed to see that we get the expected response
