interviews emily moss is a director of alumni programs here at girls who code where she has worked for three years on student recruitment and new program development emily has worked in tech in tech education for nine years as startups big companies and nonprofits she believes the world will literally be a better place with more diverse voices when more diverse voices are involved in designing building and leading the tech world and love seeing the incredible things girls who code alumni have accomplished some fun facts about emily emily is a gentle dictator of her long branding book club she teaches yoga on the side and is now on zoom so hit her up if you're interested uh and she's the only girl to code team member living in chicago i'm going to kick it over to emily hi everybody um thanks so much for joining us this evening we are so excited that you're here this is our newest iteration in the girls who code talk series i'm very excited tonight we're going to be talking about prepping for technical interviews how do you get ready for them how do you make the most of that experience we have a couple of really amazing panelists joining us today i want to start with margaret poteet who's the director of advisory services at kpmg one of our girls who code partners in her role margaret utilizes technical and industry knowledge to identify complex client issues and build longterm business relationships with key executives through engagement delivery and networking in professional organizations that is a lot and margaret is going to tell you more about it when she is not working margaret loves going to the gym hiking in the spring summer and fall and skiing in the winter thank you so much margaret we're really glad that you're here with us our second panelist this evening is maggie falter maggie is a technical sourcer for hbo max and cnn digital we all know what they are at warner media another partner of girls who code and in her role maggie focuses on building tech teams for hbo max and cnn digital when she's not working she loves exploring museums parks neighborhoods and is especially drawn to different cultures foods and experiences to margaret and maggie thank you so much for being here with us today yeah there they are we're going to start off the evening with an icebreaker just to get the ball rolling and remind us that we're all in this together um so i want to start off with a question that addresses a concern girls of girls who code college age alumni have mentioned many times with us um and we're gonna start with this icebreaker and then move into some questions y'all have submitted in advance we have great discussion questions and q a all right here's our icebreaker share a time that you had an interview that did not go so well this is a big one what did you learn from the experience and how you applied that knowledge in other future interviews in your professional career so let's start with uh margaret hello everybody happy to be here today um um that one there it actually shaped how i approached interviews in the future as well as how i approach uh difficult situations um i was on an interview one time and everything was going great at the end the interviewer asked me why are you leaving now you know why are you even considering leaving your job and my response was around the quality of the people and i was talking about my current employer in a very poor fashion and from that i knew based on his eye contact that that wasn't a good thing so the interview was going well and i said to myself you really blew it this time so what i learned from that afterwards and every interview that i ever went on i looked at the situation and every difficult situation i was in i looked at it from the standpoint of yeah i may be talking about the quality of the people however taking that negative and turning it into a positive and using it as an opportunity to develop other people around me yes they may not have the same skills um but at the same time people are diverse people bring different things to the table so as everyone here every day inclusion and diversity and when you look at inclusion and diversity you're looking at different skills different ways of approaching things um so taking that particular lesson i said to myself okay that's an opportunity to leverage different skills and different approaches in order to make the team stronger in order to get to that objective in the end but taking a different path instead of looking at it as people are not of the quality that at that time early in my career i thought they should be and then the other aspect is embracing that diversity looking at the capabilities that people do bring thanks margaret i think uh watching how we talk about our coworkers is a good lesson for everybody in most circumstances before i turn over to maggie i want to let you all know that we are going to have poll questions interactive questions during our event tonight so when that pops up on your screen you've got to answer quickly we'll capture your responses in about 30 seconds and then we'll think um together about what it means when we get those responses back so while we wait for that first poll i'm going to turn it over to maggie oh it's a poll it should have popped up on your screen go ahead and answer and we'll come back to your responses uh in just a few moments uh maggie while folks fill out the poll can you tell us about a time when your interview didn't go well yes and first i just want to say thank you so much for having me um if you do hear some background noise i live in new york city and i don't have control of my heat and it is blasting in the back so hopefully that will go off soon but um first off one one time i remember i i showed up um in a suit and you know the the coordinator who scheduled my interview had told me um we're very casual here at up nexus which is where i had the interview so you can feel free to wear whatever you like but i was traveling and all i had was a fullon suit um and i felt like that would be really intense i walked into the office and i looked around and everyone was wearing jeans and hoodies and i felt very out of place um but luckily i did wear some nike air force one shoes with my suit and really nervous um and felt very out of place um during a water break i kind of went to the bathroom and someone complimented me on my outfit and you know made me realize everyone can dress whatever the way they would like um and so that kind of set my my nerves but that was a funny scenario and then another time um i think the interviews i just knew i did not do well in and kind of felt embarrassed right um were the times that i didn't answer authentically and honestly so of course we have all of these prep questions that we can think of scenarios for um ahead of time but um there were definitely some times right after college or during college where i didn't have professional experience to speak to i only had you know restaurant experiences that actually could answer the question pretty well instead of going in and explaining a true experience that i had personally um maybe working in the restaurant to answer the question i like fibbed and just used an example from like one of my coworkers um in one of the internships i had and it came across definitely inauthentic um the interviewer probably could tell i was lying or you know fabricating in some way and so with that um i kind of reflected on that experience and realized that it's okay to um to tell your authentic story and actually that comes across better for the interviewer even if you need a moment to to you know think and if you don't have a specific scenario that you think is the best um in reality if you just speak to to your true um honest experiences yeah don't fake it till you make it thank you ashley because they probably will recognize that you're faking it so yeah itself is what i kind of learned from that experience those are both great pieces of advice um the results are in from our poll so about 62 of our participants feel not really prepared so i what i want to emphasize here is for folks on the line you're not alone you are in the same bucket as so many people and about another 38 felt somewhat prepared so nobody feels perfectly brilliantly prepared walking into these interviews so just know that and feel some solidarity with your fellow students here i'll keep mine brief but one thought i had is i've actually interviewed a lot of people as i know margaret and maggie have as well and um i was interviewing a young woman for an internship this is way back in the day and i live in chicago and uh i asked her you know why do you want to work at our organization and she said well my friend said it's really cool to be in chicago in the summer and i thought well what that doesn't answer my question that tells me why you want to live in chicago that doesn't tell me why you want to work at our organization and i think that points to another area that people struggle with which is really thinking about what is exciting to you about this opportunity in this company because bringing that enthusiasm can be a great starting place for any conversation i want to jump into some of the discussion questions here um we have students from a lot of different levels on the phone um and so we've sort of structured these questions to reach different audiences at different times uh so the first one is around rising college students folks sort of at the more early start of their college journey and we've received a lot of questions about the interview process as a whole and especially around around what makes interviews unique and different um this is like really uncharted territory for a lot of folks so one sort of big picture question here is what is the difference between a regular interview and a technical interview and when should candidates expect to be at these different stages in the interview process maggie do you want to take this one first yeah um so i in my experience both at xander and then now warner media we definitely start off with um more of a behavioral interview so most likely um at you know big time big and small tech companies um you may chat with a recruiter such as myself first so they're they're in hr so they're really just kind of trying to gauge um if it would make sense to move you forward and um those will mostly be behavioral and just kind of touch on a little bit of your experience so really just chatting through your resume most the time and then from there you might chat with um someone more technical and that would be maybe a couple more behavioral questions in the beginning but then potentially a coding test um or or some type of technical assessment um just to make sure that it would make sense to move forward that you kind of have that baseline tech knowledge um and then usually from there there would be more of that white boarding and um live inperson technical and behavioral assessments with members of the team that you would join so usually it kind of gradually goes from behavioral to tech and then a mix of the two and kind of see how you communicate while being technical and things like that um i think that answers the first bit but happy to elaborate after after margaret if you have some things to add that's a great start so just to summarize you usually start with that behavioral interview like are you a good fit for this company and if you get past that moving into whatever versions of technical interviews that company might have exactly great to know margaret has that been your experience too is there anything you can add yes that that is the same experience and in the beginning when the resumes come in of course we're looking for certain skill sets to really pop on that resume so when you're talking about exploring the entry level people coming out of college we're looking at what courses have you taken what are you doing on your internships and so forth so after that we we do a screening with that screening it's around okay what are your actual technology tools and what did you learn on your actual engagements as far as your not necessary engagements but your internships and what was your role role is very key when we actually bring you in the first interview we're not going to have you sit there and start to include coding on the board that that's normally not it we're trying to like maggie mentioned it's more around the behavioral aspects um at the same time when we actually take you to that next interview and we're looking at your technical skills we may present a case study to you what is very key to note it's not about having the best technical solution what it's about is what is your approach and what is your critical thinking skills so that's one of the key aspects that college students need to realize no one is expecting you to have all the answers all the time because throughout your entire career you will never have all the answers all the time so it's more about being able to critically think through the problem what is your approach and quite frankly you make it to a point that you don't know the answer so how do you get that answer so that's more or less what we're looking for within those energies thank you that's so informative i think it's really reassuring to hear that even folks that have been around the block and have interviewed for many jobs and interviewed many people you don't always know the answers in the interview in fact you may not may not know the answer ever and you may still get that job if you do a good job communicating your process and asking good questions exactly um thanks to you both for those answers um one thing we hear a lot about is like applying for your dream job or your dream internship and it's nervewracking and you get that call for your interview and you're like so excited you're jumping for joy you're telling your friends you're calling your family um and then it is just so scary and you have to prep for it um and so we're gonna put a poll question up for the audience first which is around what resources do you use to prepare for interviews and if you have specific resources you use here websites tools books please post them in the chat like share with each other things that you have found really helpful and then the question i want to ask margaret and maggie here is around the resources that you might recommend and so some that we've heard are leak code and cracking the code which are resources online available for students but i think the broader question here is what are your tips for preparation any tools or strategies you might use getting ready for that dream job interview and margaret why don't we start with you on this one sure number one within uh when you go to the internet there are so many sources out there it's almost to the point it's information overload some of the ones that i have seen and and pretty much i actually asked a couple of our employees you know what did you use what was relevant what was useful and they came back with freecodecamp.org that there it provides over 6 000 tutorials it has videos articles interactive codings lessons that you can take it actually has study groups out there so the key point it's free so that's very key uh hacker blank that's another dashboard that you can take advantage of and they have various resources out there and interview prep kids tutorials and so on so the good news is there's a ton of free information so you really don't have an excuse in the end for not using them to sharpen your skills and keep in mind even after you get that great job you can still use these to continue to sharpen your skills so the and i always say the internet is your friend google it find the information out there and take advantage of it i love that um can i just repeat you said freecodecamp.org was there a second name of a website you mentioned yeah heck of ranking sure i also loved the point about study groups which is you know really important like you don't necessarily have to do this by yourself you could gather a group of friends for example your girls who code college loop or you could get a group together online and on zoom hold yourselves accountable here um working together to prepare um before we move over to maggie uh just so you all know it looks like interviews and blogs or excuse me interview blogs like uh blog posts about interviewing was the most popular resource people use 37 percent of you use that and then next up was interactive websites 26 so lots of different options there free is great love that margaret it's out there um maggie what can you add here yeah um so definitely going off the actually you know what i'm gonna back up a bit i think the one main thing that you can do for both behavioral and technical interview prep is first kind of like going in within yourself um and really doing like a little bit of a check in terms of what why you really want that role um what your career goals are um and just kind of tap into your own selfawareness really quick i know that's really cliche but i think that that is um really important and it'll end up going a long way now in terms of actual you know all the things you really need to know um i also think that company blogs so for example xander which is the advertising technology group under warner media they have a really robust blog where you can see about um articles that have been written from anyone from interns to senior executives and they explain lots of things like what their specific team is doing what kind of data they're doing what kind of processes and languages and systems they use so if you do a deep dive of like the tech stack of the company that you're interested in i think that that can also be really helpful um and then yeah also like reviewing old homeworks if you have any specific problems or problem sets that that you had worked on um in school or even that your friends or or family members you know that took great courses um you can access those and then um finally just kind of focusing on the three areas that i think a lot of tech companies um interview on are um which are data structures algorithms and system design so kind of working through um how you would think through a system design problem um one of the main you know aspects of of technical interviewing that we look at as margaret had kind of alluded to earlier is kind of just like how you think and how you work through a problem so just working through that and if you hit um a crossroads just not feeling uncomfortable to ask the interviewer a question or whoever you're prepping with um a question about you know what they would do and where to go from there well this is so much good advice i know we have a note taker behind the scenes taking notes but i want to be like writing all of this down right now i loved what you said maggie because data structures algorithms and system design like those are starting points you can go find free curriculum on those three things on the sites that margaret mentioned right like if you're like i don't know what that means system design start googling find one of your professors and start to ask them ask a friend who's a few years ahead of you what kinds of questions they saw in interviews uh this is just such excellent advice and maggie i want to reiterate one other thing you said there which is you know companies they're tech stacks those are not secret you can ask them what kind of technology they use if you were at a recruiting fair and you were chatting with a recruiter about a potential role that's a great question to ask them you could even say you know i'm considering these three courses next semester what would you recommend you know this stuff is not secret yeah um just really quickly going off of that the good thing about kind of how most processes work is that you do chat with a recruiter or someone more behaviorally focused at first so you can ask them you know um very candidly what the team that you're going to interview for or that you're interested in uses you know what language and systems they use and then kind of have a little bit of a you know a leg up before you get to the technical portions thank you this is so great um i want to move on to our third discussion question which is um around uh the sort of key information you should be highlighting and this comes from questions we get around like what should i be sharing in an interview should i only be talking about things that are on my resume should i be talking about projects or courses that i'm taking we know that resumes especially for college students should really be one concise page but what key information should people make sure that they get across both in their resume in that technical interview in particular maggie why don't you kick us off here yeah i think um all of those things you mentioned are definitely the most important um i think the way you lay it out if you put your languages and systems that you're most strong in at the very top that will definitely catch um you know the the recruiter whoever is reviewing your resume's eye very quickly and then also just don't be afraid to include projects that are completely on your own you know if you weren't um directed by either a class or um you know a company like an internship to to go all in on a specific project and it's just something you did on the side feel free to add that if you were a volunteer somewhere and you know offering your um technical knowledge for for free you know even that would be great to add and any other kind of extracurricular activities or um volunteer things that you're passionate about i think are important to add if you have the room because yes it is important to stay kind of concise and within one page if possible awesome thank you margaret what do you want to add there um one other point is highlighting your work experience just because you do not have an internship does not mean that it's not relevant so one of the key aspects is when when you're in school you're very busy but holding a job while you're in school shows that you can multitask you can handle multiple uh responsibilities and still make the grade so that speaks volumes uh to give you an example i interviewed a young lady at one of the conferences and she had never had a job she was a senior never had an internship and she had a 4.0 gpa another candidate they worked two jobs they had internships and the gpa wasn't as strong we leaned more towards that second candidate than that first candidate so job experience no matter what it is it's relevant because everybody doesn't necessarily have an internship or the ideal internship but at the same time some people they're working their way through school and trying to juggle it's very difficult so i know that person is going to work that much extra hard versus the individual with the 40 and they're cracking the books constantly that's such a good thing and it comes back to the point maggie made up front about being authentic to yourself if you're someone that is pulling late nights at a second job you don't have to hide that that's part of your story and that's your accomplishment yeah and then i'll just add one other aspect around um community outreach that that resonates significantly and even when you're in social organizations a lot of the social organizations whether they're sororities or other types of organizations they do have a community outreach arm to it you know emphasize that as well so it's it's looking at the individual as a whole it's not just what type of coding you can do and it's not only the soft skills around leadership and communication it's looking at the overall individual as a whole thanks yeah such great advice um we have solicited questions from all of you in the audience uh in your registration so we got some questions direct from students and we pulled out a couple that we heard over and over again um and so the first one i want to turn to here is one of our students who wrote i've had a couple of technical interviews and the interviewers always seem to ask the similar and same types of questions i would love to know if there are standard questions or types of questions we can be expected to answer outside of what's on our resume and i you both mentioned things margaret you mentioned case studies we've talked a little bit about whiteboarding algorithms could you talk about some of the broad categories of types of interviews and technical interviews that folks might face uh margaret why don't you start well the types of when you say the types of interviews or are you more or less leaning towards the types of questions uh i guess types of questions if you think that yeah let's do types of questions if you've got some ideas on that well everyone knows they're going to ask you the technical questions everyone knows they're going to ask you to solve skills questions some of the ones that we tend to throw in and it makes people think why should i even hire you what are you bringing to the table that the other candidates are not bringing that's that's the key one um and then we always want to present our best self while we're on the interview so when they throw the question your way what was a challenging situation that you failed at and what did you learn from it that one there it's amazing you know how many people we've interviewed and then you get to that question they're doing great you get to that question and they struggle with it because we always want to present our best self so it's it's okay to take that less desirable situation turn it into a positive what did you learn from it and present it in that manner so that's that's one of the questions that i see people constantly um they they do struggle with that and then when they ask you the question of what do you know about my company it's amazing how many people cannot answer that we're in the age of it's the internet age let's go to the website you know explore their website what do they do and understand what do they do uh um as you can see i work at kpmg you see that in my background and the one thing that everyone always believes is the only thing we do is audit and that is not true so therefore i always advise the campus recruits just go and look at the website we do advisory we do a lot of technology work and we do tax and we do audit but we do not just do one thing so no matter where you go if you go to a google if it understand what google does google does more than the search engine that we see here google has a lot of and number two google's uh know the umbrella that google falls under understand what the company does so that's one of the key things just make sure you do your research so you can answer that question this seems to be a theme do your research about the tech stack do your research about what the company does these are you know these are think about questions in advance that you might how you might describe your own work experience maggie can you add anything around types of questions and types of interviews folks might face yeah um as i had mentioned before data structures algorithms and system design those are definitely the types of questions for technical interviews but behaviorally i would say questions that focus on crossfunctional collaboration which is just a fancy word of really how do you work with others you know what is your style of communication when things go wrong how do you handle those when when working with peers and and even you know managers or clients um going more towards the client end as well if you have customers or clients that you need to you know adhere to customer service is definitely a big portion as well kind of um again how you communicate if you communicate clearly concisely effectively um and then yeah in those technical interviews as well just kind of um if there is a roadblock or they notice a bug or something like that and they ask you about it kind of be prepared to answer something that you may not know the answer to right away um that those are the main subject areas because all teams really do work within other teams meaning if you're an engineer you're still going to need to meet with the product teams and um and you know the marketing team potentially and other teams like that so it's like how do you collaborate crossfunctionally with them as well yeah i think those are some of the main kind of focus areas that we have questions about and um i can't give away like specific questions but um definitely depending on the team the very specific team um they'll come up with kind of their own questions yeah like case studies um and with that you can only really prepare for that by going very into the job description and analyzing kind of every single bit of what that team does um and getting a really clear picture of that before you kind of go into those technical interviews i'm gonna go off script for a second and just ask a follower let's say you're in a technical interview maybe it's a white boarding interview or an algorithm challenge and you really you totally draw a blank like you don't know what to do next what would you recommend saying or doing in that moment is sitting in silence and trying to figure it out the right thing should you ask questions you know how would you address like everyone draws a blank every now and then even on things we know any ideas i mean i i would start by saying um a little bit of both so definitely don't be afraid of pauses um we've like prepped interviews at least in my interviewers in my experience to um be comfortable with silence and so you may feel uncomfortable you know sitting there like oh my gosh they need an answer right now um but but sit with it a minute you know rack your brain think about the different courses or experiences you've had um and then if you do need you know some help definitely ask them you can be candid and say you know i thought about this approach at first but it just doesn't seem like it would it would work so um what are your thoughts on that and and maybe do you mind giving me a nudge in the right direction and then maybe they'll just say one word and that word will trigger you right back to a class or a practice problem you had and then you'll feel confident going down the right the right path and again most of the time there's not necessarily one specific right path and they really are just trying to see how you go about um you know discussing and really digging into the question i love that because if you say here are three paths i was considering that tells them so much about you already that tells them what's happening in your brain even if it's not exactly what they were looking for margaret do you want to add anything to that yeah i agree with maggie you know flipping it back and asking the questions and making it more of an exchange dialogue and that way like you mentioned you may have three approaches all three may be appropriate all three may not be appropriate but the whole aspect is it's the factfinding that you're going through and the critical thinking that's what they're really looking at it's not necessarily do i have the right answer and then if you have a story to tell along with it when you get to the end and say this situation happened to me once before whereas i didn't understand the particular topic so what i did i went and i did the research in order to find the answer and then this is the outcome and the result so you can you can turn it into a story in the end and that's what they're more or less looking for this is really great very reassuring um let's move on to another one of the submitted questions from our students um we've talked a little bit about this so maybe we can move through this one a little bit quickly but i read that to stand out in an interview you should mention the company's mission statement in your answer to show that you support the bigger picture are there any other tips that you suggest we talked about a bunch of tips but anything you want to add that we haven't covered um if you don't mind i can start on that oh please take it away well one of the aspects that that's an easy find um over and beyond the mission statement go to their website pull down the earnings report tell us earnings tell us what an earnings reported margaret you may not all know what an earnings report is okay every every company when they report their quarterly earnings they have a conference call with their stockholders and they have a presentation and they post that presentation to their website so how do you find it always go to the very bottom of the website and it's at the bottom it will actually have uh what let me see if i recall the words correctly um uh stockholder relations something like that it's on that effect so you go out there you pull down the earnest report there's a presentation and it will tell you the direction of the company it will tell you about the recent acquisitions and it will tell you what their strategy is pick up you don't have to memorize it but pick up a couple of key points and you can use that within that interview to actually show that you know over and beyond that you did your homework that you know over and beyond what's in that mission statement so that's one aspect another aspect if you go to the company website they always post their articles and their announcements so if it's a tech company you're also going to find a suite of case studies around their customers like okay this is the software i sell and this is how it helped whether it's um let's say united airlines we provided xyz to do their air traffic control systems and so on so they will have these stories case studies of how they have served their clients and how their products have served their clients go and read them so just pick up a couple of items that you can actually use to have an exchanging dialogue during your interview so articles announcements earnings report this is gold um i saw someone in the chat asked about private companies uh looking at their blogs or their press pages is a great idea nonprofits like us girls who code we have an annual report at the bottom of our website if i were interviewing someone and they had read our annual report and asked me a question about it i would be extremely impressed let's just put it like that um maggie do you want to throw another tip uh this stuff is gold y'all so bring it i was just gonna say um definitely do your research on the mission statement and kind of company values and culture but um especially with you know remote uh interviews where you kind of can read from you know you know your resume or or online materials don't read word for word like your favorite line um personally i think that it goes a lot longer of a way if you pull just a couple key words and explain why that resonates with you and then maybe dig in more to the culture of not just their mission statement but are they living out their mission statement um you know look at their their ergs which are employee resource groups look at how they're representing and serving um you know underrepresented groups and if you identify in a specific group that interests you see if they have that resource or any type of engagement externally or internally and then maybe speak to that definitely just of course as always you know be authentic to your own personal um identities passions and um values that you may see in that company um that definitely then then just kind of reading oh their mission statement says this and that sounds nice most mission statements will sound pretty nice um this is such good advice um i want to do a quick lightning round we got two questions submitted one is a scenario and i think it'd be really valuable for everyone to sort of hear the scenario and hear your advice from both of you the scenario is i have an interview scheduled on monday the 30th that's around the corner i've been studying for a month and i understand the material but i can't solve the questions in 45 minutes so this person has been practicing they've been timing themselves it takes me hours i want to ask my recruiter to postpone it for another month is that unprofessional or disrespectful or is there something else that i can do this is a really great tough question what do you do if you've got this interview coming up you've been working really hard you don't feel quite ready what do you think anyone can go i i just would go and say um not to you know jump to conclusions but what would one more month um do for you would would you really be able to get it down from maybe you know two hours to 45 minutes um if you do think that you could you could get it closer and closer maybe ask for another week or two but i will say you know hiring is kind of um a race in terms of there's a lot of applicants and the hiring manager usually wants to find someone quite quickly um and so i would go with um just leaning into it and maybe ask for a couple more days but but just go with your gut and be confident and at the end of the day i've seen many many interviews occur especially entry level where the candidate can only get really halfway through the problem you know they don't find a solution all the way but it was still enough to show their thought process and their tech skills to push them around to to the next um to next round so always be confident and and um you know know that you've done your best and that a whole you know month could could really help margaret yeah if you're at a couple of hours and you're trying to get down to 45 minutes um i'm with maggie i don't think a month with help and more than likely the problem that they've given you it probably is not solvable in 45 that's very very very tricky so they're so what they're more than likely you know we're we're really thinking through this now so we're thinking through it on the fly here so more than likely they're trying to see how you will deal with the stress and the pressure yeah that is such a good point it might be intentionally harder than you can solve right exactly so go and be confident and do your best if you feel as though you have done everything you can to do your best you will walk in there and you will do well even if you don't get it done in 45 minutes thank you um i did just want to add one more thing if you do have um a learning disability though um or you know just know that you actually do need more time than potentially you know the other person um i would just share that information with your recruiter and see what they can do um because oftentimes i mean no all times there should be accommodations made for that that is such an important point just to reiterate that if you require accommodations for a learning disability you can ask for that of the interviewer in a timed interview or something like that that's really what a tip um we have one more level margaret um all right last lightning little question we got here in the chat is um someone says i'm a freshman here by the way do you still have a chance if you find yourself that you don't know the answer to a problem that they ask you if you just flat out don't know it do you still have a chance oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah you do it's back to the last question that we were just starting i know yeah yeah it's it's the same thing and um you do have a chance and it's it's back to the point on me it's not about having the best technical solution it's all about the approach i'm a freshman i haven't learned data structures yet unfortunately i don't know how to answer that all right we are going to start to wind down here um i want to add my last piece of advice and then i'm going to give it over to maggie and margaret for one last pro tip just a quick one if they've got one mine is you gotta send a thank you note i've interviewed a million people when i get a quick note it doesn't have to be three paragraphs it can be five sentences that say thank you so much for your time i really enjoyed learning about your organization you know i would value the opportunity to continue this conversation thank you so much like it shows me that you want this role it's thoughtful um and it shows that you kind of cross the t's and dot the eyes so a thank you note is my my final tip for the evening um margaret do you have a final tip you'd like to offer it's funny you said thank you note i remember one job i went for and instead of doing the email i'm not saying that you have to do this but it's just a story i actually typed the letter printed it out and i nailed it wow and when i went for my final interview whereas i walked in and she said oh no this isn't an interview i just wanted to see the person that actually mailed me a letter and she had it right up on her it was taped up to the wall she said no one sends me this they just keep giving me all these emails did you get the job margaret i got the job all right she got the job maggie oh sorry margaret last tip before we we close out for the night any final tip from you margaret yes uh and and i i just continue to stress be confident in all that you do yes there is no job that you cannot get if you're prepared prepare prepare prepare that's key you will do well on that interview thank you those are really good words maggie last tip of the evening you should be a team ad not a team fit so do not try to mold yourself to fit in what you think that they are looking for they are looking for someone who will add value to their team and on the flip side make sure that the team you're interviewing with will add value in your life as well i will love it it's wonderful advice so um we are going to close out for the night but before you run off am i correct both of you margaret and maggie that there are internship programs at your respective companies i'm guessing that there are internship company internships at your companies yes yes there are uh kpmg if you go to our website we constantly post all of our internships and it actually tells you about the various levels of our programs there's a wealth of information out there for you the reason i ask is because some folks in the chat said where can i find information about inter or internships and there's lots of sources we'll put some in our followup email and in our recap but these two amazing companies kpmg and warner have those and if i were you if i were a college student on this call tonight i would go find maggie and margaret on linkedin tomorrow and i would send them a thank you note for their advice tonight and i would remember them when i go looking for internships for my next uh summer gig so we put up a survey please pull up your phones this is for our student friends and just hold up your camera to your screen this takes one minute and it really helps us thank you margaret she posted it in the um chat for all of you we have one more girls who code talk in december um thank you everybody who came the chat the questions amazing margaret maggie like i am 32 and i wrote down all your advice i'm gonna use it in mine thank you so much for being here with us tonight um everyone have a great night and a safe holiday thank you for having me bye everybody bye
