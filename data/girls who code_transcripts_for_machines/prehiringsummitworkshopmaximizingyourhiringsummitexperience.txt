first thing I'm going to do before I dive into any beirs exciting beair features uh I want to take a moment to remind everyone on this call the resources that are available to you to prepare for this Friday so by now you have received through email an attendee guide teaching you how to navigate the vs platform and best practices if you're thinking Julio I have no idea what you're talking about what email uh just give me one moment and I'll show you where you can access this guide in the the Affairs platform we highly recommend that you view this guide before Friday to set yourself up for success and even if you have checked it out already it wouldn't hurt to refresh yourself to be up to speed ahead of the event all right so as I just mentioned if you have any trouble finding the attendee guide that I shared um that our team had shared you can access it through the platform so once you've already logged in um you will see a resources tab in your navigation bar you're going to click on that and you'll get a drop down menu with the VF far's guide as the first option you'll click on that you'll get a popup um and you'll get a popup with the option to download the guide so again if you're like I have no idea where you what you're talking about I did not get no email uh please check out the platform and it'll be there waiting for you right and maybe you're thinking Julio I read this guide a 100 times I know better than my best friend and I still have questions during the event itself so we do have an info desk we will have links to learn more about girl who codes programming and the opportunity to chat with someone from vf's or girls who code for day of help so from the lobby which is what you'll see practically as soon as you log in is that you can click on the info desk in the middle of your screen and once you do so you'll see this page so again there will be links to learn more about our programs also if you have day of questions you can chat with v fars or girls who code V fars for technical support and girls who code for hiring senent programming questions we do encourage you to have the guide on hand and see if your answer is living there as it may be quicker to help been waiting for someone to respond okay so we are hoping for your success and an enjoyable experience so please remember that we are here to support you above all else so now let's talk about the exhibit hall be sure to click in from the lobby on your left hand side to see all of our company boots and you don't see it pictured here but again it's also in the navigation bar of the platform so you can click through exhibit hall on the lobby itself or through the navigation button it'll take you to the same spot um when you first log in you will see a bird's eye view of all of our booths and you get to choose which one to visit we recommend you visit as many booths as you can even with companies you may not be too familiar with all right I do want to say I know Logitech is the image here unfortunately Logitech is not with us this this go around but I thought the picture was pretty so I wanted to keep it uh for this presentation so when you visit a company's Booth they'll have tons of information about their companies there will be a number of links below their booth that you can choose from that may include like career Pages their about us page maybe some video links about A Day in the Life at their company you know world is their oyster on what they are sharing with you after you've done some exploring you can chat with one of their Bo Representatives who are current company employees feel free to ask questions and learn more about what you saw from their Booth to start you're going to click on the chat button below the booth to open a chat box there's also a little chat widget that sort of hides in the corner of your Zoom window on the left um that is also an option to open the chat either one is good to go so once the chat box is opened you will be able to communicate with the companies Booth reps if it's not already present please be sure to click on the join chat rooms button and pick the company you are currently visiting to begin messaging you can type in a question or even share your contact card which is Will click which will quickly share your contact information with Booth Representatives again use this time to learn more about a company you may not be too familiar with keep in mind that the company chat box or that chat room is specific to the booth you are currently visiting so if you're in the log or there's no Logitech but if you're the in the Accenture booth and you're in the Accenture chat room um that chat is specific to that Booth you're currently visiting and no other booths will be able to see those messages um just to help reduce foot traffic and you know keep all the messages where they need to be um quick little note some of our partners not all of them some of them may have a link an additional Link in their navigation bar that reads something along the lines of live talk to a rep that will bring you to a video call where company reps are just standing by answering questions on video um that may be a little bit quicker than chat um but again not all partners are doing that some are and you will see who on the day of so if you PR to chat over video that is an option for you okay okay so I know I gave a very quick rundown of our booths but that is not all that is happening on Friday I'm a little biased because I'm in the auditorium which is a lot of panels

trails in her new home in Colorado so I'd love to thank you all for joining us this evening um and let's jump into our discussion so our first question uh for our panelists is regarding you know preparation uh for the hiring Summit for some folks the hiring Summit this Friday may be their first career fair or their first virtual career fair uh so what should attendees do uh to best prepare for this dayong event I can kick things off um I think uh one of the first things to really be ready with is your resume uh ensure that it's up to date ensure your LinkedIn profile is also up to date um and ensure that both you have uh they're both sharable I think it's also good to have a very concise elevator pitch ready and what you would typically want to include in that is what you are doing right now um and what you're looking for or your professional experience ience I think that's great uh and I would Echo that same thing I always tell people to figure out your intention when visiting and going into this perspective and what I mean by that is when you're coming either virtually connecting is your intention to find a job is your intention to learn is your intention to just be present and take it all in if it's your first experience that intention will drive what actions you would probably need to take so having your elevator pitch is great having your content together is great but also an exercise that we do even within the corporate function years into a career is what are your skill sets so just knowing yourself right so what am I coming to get what am I coming to provide what do I know that I'm good at what experiences do I have and and what might I be looking for and when we talk about what might I be looking for not even specifically role by title um but I know I'm good in this Skillets and I know that these companies are present so in my mind I know that there has to be an attachment so so here's what I'm good at here's my elevator pitch how might that look within your organization and how might that be an opportunity to advance so really becomes a fun experience or a better experience because you're going with intention rather than going just to kind of figure it out on the spot definitely I wholeheartly agree I would also say um do your research on the companies uh beforehand once that list of corporate Partners is released uh for the hiring Summit uh make sure you know all of the opportunities that they have available in the summit what exactly are they promoting and like uh Adonis I hope you're pronouncing your name right um um like like he said um make sure that you know your skills and um and look at the opportunities read the descriptions and see where your skill sets match and then when you get in those text chats in the summit say hey I'm really interest interested in this role who can who can help me in this role who can connect me who um explain um the details of this role and how can I further pursue this opportunity and one last thing I'll add on that when you make a connection with the recruiter somebody that's there U be intentional about following up with that connection right and so can I add you on LinkedIn or is it possible I know we're having a small chat today but have a oneto one next week I would love to just take some time 30 minute call conversation and so it's okay to have initiative even if you're not 100% sure right it's okay to kind of put yourself out there have that connection and don't be afraid to ask questions or prepare questions that you actually want to know the answer to oftentimes we go and we ask general questions or we prepare a set of general questions which is fine but what is it that you really want to know is it about diversity initiatives is about the likelihood of getting hired is it about leadership representation is it about location compensation so when we talk about intentionality go with a plan and go with questions that you actually when you leave provide something to you and provide answers for you that you can then lean on to follow up yeah Adonis we met you talked about compensation you talked about being based on the west region I want to dive in a little bit deeper to see what a longterm career would look like so use that as a launching pad to sustain communication which will ultimately help you land a position either at that firm or somewhere within that firm or company's Network thank you all so much for such like invaluable Insight um and another question we have for you all is considering that the hiring Summit is completely virtual um how would you say that a virtual career fair uh compares to one that is in person you know what are some advantages of having a virtual event that attendees may not be aware of I enjoy both I come from my side of my recruiting career when everything was in person virtually wasn't even a thing and then Co hit and then we're in postco um the great thing about virtual connects is how quickly you can connect with a great amount of people and so casting your net extremely wide when you're in person you're kind of locked into some of those conversations and it's hard to maybe break the tie especially I remember my first time at a career fa I didn't know how to start or end a conversation so I sat there for 30 minutes uh virtually you cast a wider net you can connect with a lot more people and that connection lag so when we talk about that virtual space again leverage LinkedIn leverage setting up a followup call leverage being able to navigate leverage leaving the conversation right leverage having something trackable the thing about virtual 2 that I enjoy is that conversation is almost a trackable conversation so we are almost able to pull that data and pull that or have that track somewhere and so you don't lose touch after that first piece um you can contain that and continue that what I will say about virtual that we must not forget is your brand is still important in a virtual environment how you not just how you show up but what you ask and what you want to know and and your brand and what you know about your brand is equally important in a virtual environment as it is in an inperson environment and probably almost more important in a virtual environment um because you don't have all of the other kind of situations filling the space um so I go back to intentionality and I'll say it 50 more times uh be intentional about your approach but virtual was great right cast a wide net and stay connected uh versus in person yeah I think one of the things that I really like about having a virtual experience is that you can really um you can really get information that's storable information like okay which people You' have connected with you can I what I like to do personally is whenever I connect with somebody I make sure that I note down their information kind of immediately because there'll be a lot of people who are talking about their experiences not just you know corporate Partners or panelists just in general you you'll find a lot of people who you resonate with who sound like super interesting who you would like to collaborate with and they're sharing their LinkedIn profiles they're sharing their um contact information and I think um what I like to do is if I see somebody who I admire I always I can I can actually get that information very easily and then set up future conversations with them so it's not just um the hiring Summit it's just like building a better Network for yourself absolutely I would even also add as an attendee of the last season's hiring Summit um I also enjoy the flexibility as well like when I've gone to inperson conferences in the past it was so hard to choose between should I stay at the career fair all day or can I go to these panels or these other different events going on at the conference so what I like about the virtual setting is just having the flexibility of being able to sit in on a fireside chat or like one of these amazing panels and still cast your net like um into the network and still um connect with um recruiters at the booth or with other attendees as well so I so I enjoy just having like a 10 tabs going to different places in the event and making sure that I'm taking full advantage of it and also personally for myself I've Al I found iners conferences especially postco uh to be a little bit overwhelming um especially with the crowds of people that have gone in and especially at the career Expo um what I like about the virtual setting is that I'm able to close my computer after um an interview or an event or after a small conversation and say okay I need to take five minutes I need to um you know find my space and then go and then go back out there this is all such wonderful um I guess insights and do you all have some maybe best practices that you can share with our attendees this evening um for virtual meetings and interviews I would say for virtual me just have have I think we talked about it before and there's things in the chat your elevator pitch or that that initial introductory had that already planned out practice that a few times have it typed out that you can send it and in that elevator pitch it's it's not as daunting as it may sound but essentially who you are where you are what you're doing right what you're looking for what you're good at what skills you have and you put that into an elevator pitch very very quickly um and then attach that to whoever you're talking to so my name is is Adonis I'm based in downtown Austin Texas I'm a graduate of Kansas State University I'm really looking to leverage my skill sets in marketing and sales and communication I know that I'm good at leadership I know that I'm good at this um but I want to look for a role that leverages all of these skill sets I know at your firm you handle marketing I know at your firm you have consultants and you hire entry level I want to understand how these skill sets in this location align with what you're looking for right thinking on the spot very quick very concise you know where I am who I am what my skills are what my background is you know I know about your company let's then connect um and then ask questions so the biggest thing is gain a ton of insight um my last point that I'll make is you know you better than anybody else knows you right you know your skill sets and what you have to offer what you're not great at better than anyone else's so when you're going into an interview or going into a conversation be confident enough that you know what you're good at right you know you I have no idea who you are so come to the table and be excited to talk about the things that you know but also be excited to talk about the things that you you may not be so good at right and what you're doing to scale and leverage that these I this is a nervous and daunting environment when you're talking to corporations of course but it's exciting because it's fail proof because you know you better than than we do right so um just being being confident in that aspect and if you're not and don't have that confidence just fake it to you make it right um because you know you again better than we do yeah that's those are some great points um I wanted to add that uh because companies and just people will be talking to a lot of people if you have something that makes you stand out I think that's that really helps um if you have Clarity for what you're looking for if um if you have some value for the company that resonates with you and you highlight that I think um just people who are ready to help you will remember you more I think one part of being networking and virtual events is being memorable and that I would say oh Natalie would you have something to add go ahead sorry uh I just I just want to Echo that that sentiment um if there's something memorable definitely stand um that helps you stand out definitely say it one thing I want to add coming from sales and earlier of my career in training uh they used to always tell us do not leave that call without um closing the sale and so what the close of the sale means is don't end that interview don't end that conversation with the so next steps so from here or what the followup is so don't leave a conversation a connection a on to one without closing the sale and that doesn't mean that you get firm firm firm next steps but you say hey I'm excited I'm interested based on our conversation would you be open to having a one to one next week or when can I expect to hear from you if I don't hear from you by that date is it okay that I reach out or it depending on the process so in the back of your mind in any interaction don't leave without closing the sale and that doesn't always mean I'm getting something but it means that at least I know that this company that I'm interested and is also interested and I have to pretty much nod to go ahead and follow up with this particular individual following the event so it's creating right like we talked about intentionality but also a network in communication and something to look forward to rather than this is a great conversation and then you never you're not able to connect with that same person again or they're not the recruiting resource so they go back give your information to the recruiting resource and you get lost in the sauce right so um that piece and always ask to in that followup my last Point um is um are you the proper like is this the proper connection that I would have or would you recommend that I connect with recruiting what is going to be the most initial uh process typically a business rep will say I will take this but I will toss it over to recruiting so just make sure that in the followup that you're getting who and what next it may not be super concrete but don't leave without closing the sale I love that love all these points and you know we we started talking a little bit about it you know just making that impression and networking um so would would definitely love to hear from you all you know we understand the importance but like how important is it to network during a hiring fair and how can our candidates make those memorable Impressions when they are interacting with potential employers I'm happy to jump in um but uh networking is key uh I come from an industry in a space especially in Consulting where you will see other people again um wild enough the former company that I worked at is a now a client of the company that I work at now um and that relationship is so important to sustain what I always used to do going into Career Fairs especially virtual is if I know especially in this meeting oh there's somebody in Austin or there's somebody in my Market unit like I have their name like let me connect with them on LinkedIn or let me try to have these conversations and bounce ideas off of each other sharing tips and tricks where they want to go having intentional conversation camaraderie they may have somebody in their Network that they can share with you um just genuine conversation that you might have hey I'm I see you're based in Austin or hey I see you're based in LA or I see you at this University or this school would love to learn more connect so those oneto ones chats those 30 minute conversations those interviews of each other are not specific to company but set that time apart to visit with individuals that you may run across in roundtables or that you may run across just in passing or in a chat function like this right um and don't be afraid to put your LinkedIn out there put a call to action out there to say hey I'm open to connecting with anyone having conversations to help build your network that is going to be key especially now in in the shift of the industry and the shift of the nation and how we plan to be staying connected is going to be and is really the only way as you look to progress your career that that type of work will happen um and it's it's kind of fun to do if you think about all you do is talk about yourself like you know you better than anyone else right so so that should be super easy um yeah I think those are great points and just to add a little bit to it um I feel like when you're applying to a role or you know you're connecting with somebody on um a virtual career fair there are just so many people right um so if if you have a onetoone conversation that you think is gone well if you have like points that you are able to bring across your excitement that you get to the table um Everybody in the a career affir is going to want to help you succeed so I think it's important to um kind of Leverage those connections because they want to help you um you've left a good impression right um so I think it's very um important to follow up with those connections and uh because you stood out already ready you stood out from the hundreds and thousands of people who have applied um so you've done the work so just sustaining that is really important I I also want to highlight the importance of peertopeer networking as well um I mean we're all going into this hiring Summit together um you know we're all looking for very similar employment opportunities and I think it's so valuable to have a community right behind you you know when you're going through this process when you're making these connections um with recruiters and and and employers um I mean what helped me in the last hiring Summit actually was being on Discord and being able to talk to other people who are also attending the hiring Summit and saying I connected with this company with this person you need you need to go check this out um you know they're they're doing like all these different things um so I think it's just nice you know to have your community rally rally behind you you know as you're finding your path to success I do want to recognize too um and I should have addressed this before but in in my role I cover neurodiversity and I cover persons with disabilities and when we talk about events like this and we talk about these very robust pipelines and networks I often go back and I'm like this is way too much I'm overstimulated I don't know what to do where to go this is I I can barely pull my thoughts together in a regular day this is just me personally and so for for folks that may be on on the spe similarly right and have to have a very very concrete plan make it your intention again that word is so important your intention to just connect with one additional person right so if if my efforts are focused on I need to connect with one additional person right let me just that's my intention connect with that one additional person have a conversation and that may be virtual that may be in whatever way is conducive to you but when you set your intention on that one goal for me the way my mind works is I can execute against that goal and once I hit that goal I'm able to then move forward next so I met with one person who I'm calmed down what can I do more what more can I do or similar to what we had talked about before maybe I shut my computer for a little bit and take some time to recharge but this can be an overstimulating process this could be an over stimulating Network you're talking with a ton of people take your time breathe pace yourself especially in an interview think about what you're going going to say think about what you want to say and one tip that I always give my the folks that I interview and used to interview in my past life was it's okay to take a beat to say thank you for that question would you mind giving me a few seconds to pull my thoughts together nothing wrong it doesn't show that you're incapable and adequate it actually shows great strength and and mental ability um and so slow down take a second in that intentionality and if you need a second to think in that interview ask for it um and and that way you have that space But just want to recognize that this is an overstimulating process and that there are ways to navigate do your best um and just do one more right do your best and reach for one more and that's success as well thank you Adonis I think that was like really important to bring up um I also wanted to say that if you do feel overwhelmed um it's okay to not go to all of the boots and not talk to every single recruiter um it would be great if you could do that and if you can't um that's okay too um and if you feel like you're missing opportunities what I like to do is um kind of again just note down contact information for recruiters and then reach out to them in the next couple of days while they still actively looking at people from The Summit absolutely thank you all and we have one last question for our panelists before we turn over to Q&A um and that is as we speak about you know just really making the most of this experience um what information should job Seekers make note of when they're visiting booths um and engaging with recruiters and also a followup to that if you know you have any pointers on how can they use this information most effectively in the later stages of their job search I can jump in um first I'll give a a unique answer and then I'll give like a a cookie cutter kind of response that I still Ed to this day the first unique answer which is not a real road map what do you want to know and and what is important for you to know when I started my job search even later on in my career what was important to me was ways of working compensation not just diversity initiatives but what that looked like in real time so can I can we talk about your CSR Corporate social responsibility report can you yourself as a representative of the organization talk about your diversity initiatives across the board what might that look like right so those things were important to me when I was in college looking for roles it was kind of like what role what are you going to pay me like what is the role doing like what what is happen and so in terms of what you should leverage from a company's information standpoint is what you want to know and what you want to gain and what's beneficial for you so that's the unique answer and that can be anything that is important to you um that you would need in order to accept an offer later on down the line from this organization now the cookie cutter piece of it is to every company majority of companies have either a fact sheet or a like fact website or About Us website on about the company and because we're virtual you have access to Google like the whole day go to their about section and just read up on the company high level read up and then themes will start popping out of you okay you're a global organization you're promote from within strategy these are your clients okay what work do you do with those clients and and what might that look like or what's the average tenure in management and what's your recruitment strategy you know what I mean so it starts pulling out themes and the about that you can ask but what's incredibly important to you may not be incredibly important to me and so um go start think about your wants what do you want out of a career so make a list this is an exercise we do with my team all the time every quarter make a list of your wants what do I want out of a career make a list of your needs what do I need out of a career because then I need a company that gives me what I need and some of if not most of what I want and so that'll start crafting a little bit of the questions that you would want to ask and what you would really want to know and have fun with it right but don't waste your time because your time is valuable asking questions that don't matter to you yeah I think that's super important and I also think it's important to because you have access to all of these amazing people who are working in companies you really want to be at I think think it's important to kind of keep their information or connect with them um at a later Point nothing else to add here I think Adonis summed it up perfectly fantastic thank you all so much for your Insight so uh we do have a couple of questions from our audience so we'll move over to those remember uh for everyone joining us if you have questions uh you would like to ask just drop it in that uh Q&A box at the bottom of your screen uh so the first question for our panelists um how do you deal with the heaviness of job searching h i can jump in um it is daunting um as a person who works in Tech um it's doubly dating with the ups and downs and just the news um I think there are good days and there are bad days and I think um it's important to understand that uh there are a lot of factors that are in play here and you might get a lot of rejections and that's not a reflection on your abilities or your skills and your capabilities it's just the environment I think it's really important to um believe in yourself um right now and um take your time I would say that it is daunting you're not alone and it is heavy so just acknowledge that it is a hard thing that you're going through believe in yourself and realize that it's not a reflection of um your skill side always I agree with all of that 100% pace yourself right so um I'm a big strategy person so build out a strategy you're G to have rejection right it's going to be hard um it may be a long road for a lot of folks those are those are facts that we can't get around right um the thing about it and I my dad gave me this advice when I was younger you have enough time to do what you're put here to do right and so that right opportunity though it may take a little bit of fighting you may lose time you may lose sleep you may lose money the right opportunity will find its way to you in the right timing but there are things that you can do to supplement that process to make that finding in that matching piece easier such as connections that you make here it may not just be the connection that you make with the recruiter or the representative but tap into who the recruiter the posting recruiter is on that role on LinkedIn DM that recruiter on LinkedIn go through your network your your Collegiate Network go to your University figure out who's connected where so it becomes a little bit of a game because I was in this state I had quit my job had this big corporate career was great I was burnt out after Co I quit my job I traveled three months with my dog it was great but I was ready to hop back into an industry that wasn't ready right wasn't prepared um and so I went through the job search and and did all of that but I set intention as well and I leaned on the networks that I had built and the people that I had met to help supplement and sustain it becomes a game a little bit of a game right to see who in my network can Poss possibly help me don't be afraid to cold call don't cold call like cold message don't be afraid to uh send out don't be afraid to post on LinkedIn don't be afraid to Showcase your your skill sets the fact of the matter is is it's going to be a process and it's not always an easy process um nor is it always fun but in the back of your mind remember I've got enough time to do what I was put here to do and so in that methodology and mindset the right opportunity Finds Its way to you in the right timing but again there's things that you can do to supplement that and also be kind to yourself like be patient with yourself it's not a you problem it's it's really not a you problem 95% of the time that other 5% we can have a one to one about that because I I have I it's a me problem 5% of the time um but be kind with yourself and make sure that you're taking care of yourself in this process right and so shut it out don't don't be scrolling all day don't be doing all of that all day do something that's mentally stimulating for you physic go touch grass I learned that off of Tik Tok and it's been cracking me up like go outside and touch grass um go do that but the process it will be the process will engulf you if you let it um but just be kind to yourself be gentle to yourself it's the industry it's not you most of the time and I would say in that vein there was another question that came up um Natalie not sure if you have may have anything to add but in speaking of you know this being difficult um particularly for those that you know come from a nontraditional background like boot camp are there any ways in which you can you know any tips that you have on how they can combat impostor syndrome or you know maintaining that confidence um I'll jump in here I I've I'm still figuring out that myself um I'm still figuring out uh why um what I was put here to do um I myself come from a nontraditional background so for everyone out there who does not hold the typical computer science degree or does not hold a degree or comes from a boot camp I completely understand um I myself do not have a degree yet I entered the industry um through internships through networking uh through so many opportunities that people have presented to me um because I stepped outside of my comfort zone I struggled with a severe case of impostor syndrome when I left college and one of the hardest things for me to do was to go out to a conference and go to a recruiter and say I come from a nontraditional background and I would love to hear about your opportunities and what and and what you're able to offer somebody to my skill set so I would say that what's been helping me combat it in the last couple of years it's just to focus on my skills and what I can offer and honing in um you know on um on what what excuse me sorry uh losing my train of thought what I'm good at and what can I bring to the table and not and nothing else really mattered to me that story that's the story that's the like Natalie story that you told that makes you valuable and I think we often forget because we're reverse matching right if I don't come through traditionally there's no way but I'll tell you exent you're I work for the number one Tech consulting firm on the planet right one thing that we look for is life experience and that nontraditional background often times so we can supplement both what does that mean that I'm coming in with skill sets I'm coming in with resilience I'm coming in being able to navigate ambiguity I'm coming in knowing how to communicate I had a different path but you see I got from here to here right so that confidence in that story listen to all the skill sets I was resilient right I faced imposter syndrome but I knew that I had the skills I knew that I was good and so when you're talking to companies we often forget we as candidates forget that we're actually the prize like we are the asset companies cannot move without people we're a big gen AI company a big innovation ai ai can't exist without human Ingenuity right so we still need people we are actually the price like we are the priz here and so when you come to the table not cocky but understanding that I've got something to offer that may be different right but it's still Innovative it's still impactful that gets me excited and that should get you excited to talk about all of the things that you overcame and had to loop back around and learn to get where you are now also on the other end that story is still the same going through a traditional background right and having the same same experiences but that story itself is a value ad for any type of role right um and so just lean on being confident in what you know you have to offer and don't go to these events waiting for us to tell you who you are waiting for a company to tell you yep you're valuable or yep that that's accurate come to the table knowing that what you have is valuable and that just makes it fun because I'm not waiting for you to to to make me feel valuable I know that I'm valuable I'm waiting to see how our value can then match up together for something greater um I would like to add that sometimes you're not at the same level at other like as other people are like you might be starting out coding and you see a lot of people around you who have been coding for like 10 years and you get overwhelmed but you're not at the same level as them and that's okay it's completely fine if you're not at the same you're not in the same chapter as everybody else and what's more important than like things that you learn by actually doing them is that the things that you get to the table like your passion your creativity your the way you think I think those things are very important and just because you haven't written 500 lines of production code doesn't make you any less of an engineer than somebody who has I am so inspired um I have to say and we do have one last question before we move on to our closing for the night we've talked about it a lot um but our attendees want to know can they connect with all of you on LinkedIn so I will
