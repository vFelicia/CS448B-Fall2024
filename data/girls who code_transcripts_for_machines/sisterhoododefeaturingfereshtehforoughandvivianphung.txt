my name is fetish day from I'm the founder and executive director of coach inspire rarely opened the first computer coding school for girls in Afghanistan my name is a beautiful and I couldn't called nonrussian for all that finds genderneutral restrooms anywhere in America well anyway there's a whole entire story behind it and I can't wait to continue talking to you about it why you get it started with coding like how did you get excited about being a coder and what was that aha moment for you to think up you know I think I'd like I'd love coding and I found like the way that I want to pursue my career so I love math before and I took a bunch of math classes in high school but I never knew how like I could combine my love for activism and mathematics it just doesn't like click click but once I found computer science through the program I realized computer science mathematics activism you can play a huge role in them you can make so much you can make a huge difference in the lives of others through computer science of using mathematics and activism so there are a lot of tools I think that human beings if we use them in a proper way they can be very empowering to us and very supportive to particular problems that we may facing in a society so how do you think your personal experience coding newly empowered you and gave you this disability that you can do and you can be empowered not only yourself but you can empower others what was your feeling about that so I learned how to code nine weeks before I made the GNR so I could see I I know the difference I made something like I know that even in nine weeks computer science give me that much power and so like I don't know I try to tell people like it wasn't like complex or an algorithm or anything like that it was just simply using an API if I can do that in nine weeks you can do anything and like at a span of like 100 200 or however long you live so I wonder if through the coding projects you've done so far the programs we have done so far do you did it happen did it give you another perspective or a new perspective about what's going on outside of the world or it open your eyes of what's happening in the world around you so talking about GNR I went so we want the congressional app challenge for our congressional district and we went to the Capitol Hill and what happened was okay we were standing next to a bunch of Republicans and Republicans but let's say every district there's a bunch of districts and we were next to like Arkansas or something like that and they would look at our app and they would just like smile and nod and like not like not even like ask for like give us our your presentation oh it's self the meaning is all of us were all to be teachers and one of the reason why we created the app in the first place was because a simple thing my friend couldn't find a restroom to go to that was gender neutral in it they didn't feel comfortable going to the restroom and like and just fall into a restaurant it should not be a difficult thing to do so yeah just like going to see like the most of the country most of the world is not that accepting and I live in a place that is very something and I have to learn to like be able to like see sensor like not censor myself but like see see the eyes of other people for you like how did you get started with coding um so with the the school the code to inspire your patient yeah so definitely for me I think the main important reason and inspiration was being born as a refugee so I was born as a refugee in Iran during the Soviet invasion my parents fled Afghanistan and they moved to Iran and so growing up in as a refugee there are a lot of that you're fixing and one of the challenges that I was facing and a lot of refugees as well as accessing education so we have to show proper papers to the schools that they could enroll us if you wouldn't able to show that paper we weren't able to be at the school so that was a big challenge every year with the fear of going to school was with me and then when we moved to Afghanistan one year after the fall of Taliban I got into computer science I got my bachelor's and being a woman in tech and you're talking about Afghanistan after Taliban there's a lot of challenges social limitations and push backs so these reasons really made me to think about how I can improve the situation of women not only being studying in a safe space but also giving them resources that they can use that resources to learn a skill that they can make money and bring income to the families so that was the main motivation and inspiration for me to open first computer coding school for girls in Afghanistan I know you could do that or like what gave you like I don't know I guess what's your aha moment that brought you to like found this huge Berg I mean this organization that's amazing yeah well I think again like my wife story being born I think a woman from Afghanistan meaning a woman in technology and just experiencing how technology is very powerful because when I came to the US and I wasn't able to go back to Afghanistan because of my immigration situation I did everything online I used technology as a tool that empowered me to do everything online so I did the organization online I shifted equipments recruit the students finding mentors designing curriculum so for me it's fascinating to see as a refugee born who was deprived accessing education how a tool like technology can help me to give back to my community and to tackle that problem in a way that women would be able to pursue what they want in a safe space that's amazing so how would you say that do you use code to connect girls globally yes um that's a great question because when you talk about technology you're not talking about country's geographical boundaries you're talking about its digital world that everyone can be a part of it without considering any geographical boundaries so it can be a digital citizen of the world without considering all those limitations and that's the beauty of technology that can connect people around the world without asking you we have a passport but you can pass this border so you can pass orders without requiring any papers and for the girls in our school definitely not only to open their eyes what's happening outside Afghanistan and what the world looks like especially for women in technology and things that women accomplish so far but also like give them a platform that through the skills they can connected a global market and applying jobs as freelancers work and get paid so that they can be financially in a better position so to make that happen that was a long journey and gain talking about a girl coming through our school I've never touched a computer in Aberdeen online but now talking about the girl then create a website and we can get paid by making that happen and you inspire me I just wanted to say um would you say you always had this get the skill to do all of this what like what helped you build that like how can somebody become like like you what do you have any tips for them in well I think part of it is personal yeah what are your motivation factors and what motivates you to to drive you to do you love about and what you want to make a change but but also I think I always tell friends that I'm a risktaker so I'm not afraid of risks and challenges if I feel I want to do something I go for it and if you are with a good intention everything really comes together the most important thing that I would suggest is that um don't wait and sit on your ideas if you really feel about your idea and you want to make it happen make it happen and then don't want life sit down on it and just give you time and surround yourself with people who are the same passion as words this is very important to build a community around yourself especially when we talk about activism and technology and bring changes in the community when you have people around yourself that they have the same passion as you then you avoid so you hear it louder and you will have more support so that's definitely the rest to be honest it just like you have to reach as many as people you can and never be afraid of if they say no they're not interested or no they're not able to help just move on and believe in what you're doing and you make it happen I actually I surround myself I through the girls are code I love the organization just because the alumni network and like not even just the alumni network well what it cost a few it's like who you surround yourself with all these girls who are passionate about computing that's not very common I realized after like stepping outside of it would you say that or your lawyer girls in one location or like are they in separate locations and do they communicate in any way or how do they get to know each other right well we do have now one location right now it's Amelie in Herat it's the city in western Afghanistan and Liv educated about 150 girls so far in the school and they're all in same place what would we always try to do and I always try to push as the sister would make the girls eat together make the girls to communicate with each other if they have ideas sharing with their peers and that's the kind of warranty receiving and our students did an amazing job creating a lot of awesome games that were geared towards the issues that people were facing and in society and Afghanistan so so to me I think that providing that safe space for the girls to come together to not being afraid of raising their voice and to feel there's like a sisterhood here and there are others that they support was the force that they were able to actually do the things that they've never been able to do before and make that change in the community yeah I give some a lot of power I know the difference between a girl who I mean like me going through the program I change dramatically my whole class change dramatically coding it makes a huge difference would you say that I see you you've got you got into college for computer science you say did you face any challenges going in like were you the only female in the class or like how did you how did you face those obstacles or get over the feeling if you did yes um so when you move to Afghanistan in 2002 that was when one year after the fall of Salomon so the infrastructure wasn't really ready for a lot of weren't suspicions with education but the city that I'm from arrived was one of the safest city that time so when I got into computer science to have my bachelor or we had a big class of probably 80 students and out of that 80 probably 1011 were girls that not all of them make it again of the of the class so definitely for me to be a period was very active very vocal I was always interested to do a lot of social work and bring changes in the community with the work that I'm doing and not a lot of people like that and not a lot of people who like to see that time a girl to be that active I was against that traditions and the culture at that time the women supposed to be home and not working you know not being that active and I like that so I faced a lot of backlashes from the community from my classmates in this school but again the most important factor for me was sisterhood finding the girls who have the same passion and voices me and also my family was very supportive from the very first day my family invest on their girls education a lot and that's the two things that made me to be able to go through all the challenges and obstacles that I was raising well well I think in Afghanistan that situation must be a bit different because again we were talking about a country that went through war with the case and there's a lot of issues but I'm I'm more interested to know about you as a girl in coding and technology and living in the United States what were the other challenges what were the things that you faced when you wanted to learn and what was the perspective of the community around you about women so my actually you talk about your parents supporting you my parents were kind of like the opposite they were more about females either be a doctor like nurse and go into like the medical profession and they believe you can be smart they just think that computer science is reserved for males because you don't take a shower like that's what they told me they're like are you sure you want to do this this is not like and then the coding camp they didn't want me to do it because yeah it's just no no I feel like other issue that came up was like being at home and being like this stayathome mom was a very still relevant thing my family is like super conservative and there's and so I faced the challenge of being like oh I'm I'm like a queer woman and I I do all these like the extended neutral restroom app like benefits me as well but they didn't see has a very good app because they're like why is this needed and I think I guess that's my internal struggle but like externally I think the world I've been in classes like discrete mathematics I took in high school where was like one of the one of the three only females in the class and I would be afraid to talk to I'm the one who would normally speak out in class yes I agree that you think if you are the first in your family in your community about doing something that no one has done before you definitely face back legends because you're the one who is trying something that no one else has done and they're all like the thoughts and the ideas all of them have is that they they just afraid of it because they don't know it and I think again with the beauty of Technology is what you're doing and what you did you used your skills and you built an app because you saw that there is a challenge and there's a problem here your friends are facing and you were like well I have that skills and they can tackle that and anything again like that's how it will bring all of us together as a community together and globally connected when there is a problem and then we can come up with a solution of that perfect so I think well the things about connecting the girls globally which again based on my experience again like I think this is happening right now I'm talking to you so I think like globally like we are from different countries we grew up different but with using technology you and I are able now to have a conversation and get connected and shared thoughts so definitely using tech as a way that globally we can connect women and girls and everyone in the world will go back again to the idea of sister who it but in a modern way in a different way the moment and you and I now are talking together we both come from different backgrounds but we share the same passion we want to use technology we want to use coding to bring a change and awareness in the community and also to just create more role models or women in technology because they're not a lot of role models when a young girl is just like growing up and you ask them they can't name a lot of women and unfortunately that's the way that happens before so I'll move the technology again you don't need to have to grab for bad news and invitations computer to get online share your thoughts with people around the world and get connected and that's what we do create code to inspire and I think with your app and with the work you're doing that's the same message you wanna really send your message not to people in the US but to the world because the app that you created is not only community are facing in a lot of countries so not only you tackle the problem that useful new friends are thinking but you are addressing a problem so that's the answer could I ask you one more question yes okay um you're very good at speaking and like being able to articulate your words well do you have any recommendations for like like being able to do that better even I didn't notice not we're related to coding but why it was very afraid of public speaking and you'll you'll have to do that because of the work you're doing and to be honest I think there there are a lot of techniques out there people suggest you should go to public speaking classes people suggest like bring a crowd of your friends and family understand of and talk in front of them and talk in front of the mirror just as much as you can to practice so I think just like practice and time will improve that I wasn't very good as I mean I don't say that very good now but I think just if you go to more places talk more you did get through that and you're doing amazing and I'm pretty sure you'll do great so yeah just just do whatever makes you feel more comfortable about yourself and make that happen conversation thank you so much for having this conversation with me girls who code and the sisterhood is so happy to have you in it and I can't wait to get to know you better outside of this conversation all right it was a pleasure talking to you as well and I'm so grateful of knowing one more percent I'm still amazing and doing great work and coding and hopefully we'll continue our sister this together and we can come up with some other plans and plots thank you so much yeah thank you too
