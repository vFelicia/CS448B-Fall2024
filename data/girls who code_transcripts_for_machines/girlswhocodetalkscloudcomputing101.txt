hi everybody welcome to girls who code talks my name is emily moss i'm the director of alumni programs at girls who code and we are so excited that you're joining us this evening i'm here today with a really amazing panel of folks we're going to start to bring them on the screen and i'm looking forward to introducing you to these amazing cloud experts while we talk about cloud computing 101 oh man in this chat we have new jersey bay area worcester massachusetts virginia phoenix this is amazing we're so glad that you are here thank you for joining and thanks for those of you that brought friends as well all right let's start to bring our panelists in here and uh you're going to meet some amazing folks one of our panelists is deanna rowe deanna lee's technical programs at a top financial security firm she was previously a sales engineer at google managing one of the largest financial services clients and she has a degree in computer science and business management information systems deanna is also a stellar chef and her specialties include homemade ice cream and bread we're going to meet deanna in just a moment our second panelist today is dr issy e de mudia dr itzy is an aws solutions architect associate manager at accenture with over a decade of experience and she is also the bestselling author of out of africa and into the cloud inspiring girls to overcome their fears and get into tech izzy is also a mother of two beautiful daughters ivana and shalomi and our last and final panelist for the day is jessica pruitt a cloud architect for the audit and assurance practice at deloitte jessica's an expert in the microsoft technologies and has worked with the big four dod and run her own business she has a bachelor's in business and a master's degree in information tech and she volunteers with feeding tampa where she lives and enjoys gardening and being outdoors we're going to bring our panelists on to join us now folks that are just joining let us know where you are uh where you're listening in from we love to see this geographic diversity i see west palm beach i see augusta and there they are hi panelists let's make sure our mics are on hi everybody thank you for joining us um let's start with you deanna i would love for you to introduce yourself and tell folks a little bit about you and your work and specifically like what do you do all day what does it mean to work in this field and i'd also like you to answer our ice breaker which is what is the best advice you've received from a mentor or manager take it away all right hello everyone thank you guys so much for having me i didn't realize that we would have people from literally all over the place um so i'm actually in west palm beach right now as well for whoever had commented that i'm so nice to see that there are other people from here dialing in i'm i'm currently at a financial services company called citadel securities i for them i help roll out and manage technical programs across various elements of our business um so every day looks a little bit different depending on what types of projects are coming up as the most important for us to be working on this week um it's often kind of hard to tell what's going on next week or what i did last week um but recently you know i work quite a bit with our research group that uses cloud technology in order to scale out the different types of modeling that they do and which ties in well with what i did before i worked here so before that i was at google which emily had mentioned i'm working in their cloud cloud business as well i think for for my icebreaker when i was at google my manager at one point had told me and it really stuck with me in my head um was that every company will take as much as i can from you and it was an interesting comment to hear from a manager who would be in that position to benefit from me providing you know as much as i possibly could in that position i'm but i think it's a good a good thing to keep in mind because it's really up to you to set your own boundaries um and if you don't you know and if you continue working until 1am or whatnot the company will be more than happy to allow you to do that so it's just kind of a good piece of advice that i try to remind myself of occasionally i love that boundary setting starting us off strong deanna thank you for introducing yourself and thank you for being here um let's move on to issy would you mind introducing yourself and sharing some of your uh best advice you've received from a manager or mentor okay hello everyone i'm so excited to be here excited to meet all of you i'm dr ece um currently working at accenture as an aws cloud solutions architect and my daytoday is kind of similar um for a few months so like two three months i'm in one project it's kind of the same thing and then another three months is different um but what i really what i'm doing currently i'm building a vaccine management platform so all of you will be taking the vaccine in a few months of those we've taken uh we're building that platform on an aws cloud infrastructure so i'm really excited i'm able to do such great work that impacts all of us um and one great advice that i've received once i made a mistake i was doing something and there was an error and then i kept going over it playing over it over in my mind and over and over and my manager called me and said you need to stop it's happened it's in the past just move on so yes that's my advice that is such good advice for life and for work and our final panel is jessica would you introduce yourself and share some advice hi i'm jessica pruitt i work as an azure cloud architect i primarily focus on infrastructure architecture so i working for deloitte i support internal teams that develop applications there's application architects that work with that you know designing the front end of the application i worry about the nonfunctional requirements you know high availability disaster recovery performance you know trying to make sure that the application is uh is ready to do what the application architects needed to do so my day is very busy i also have a hard time figuring out what i did yesterday and what i do every day is putting out a lot of fires i'm good with notes i take a lot of screenshots um it's very important to be organized because uh there's a lot of information flying back and forth people information everywhere so uh that's that's a uh a secret weapon is getting really organized with the information that you have to manage when you're in technology just for yourself um one of the best uh some of the best advice that i've been given is to be a sponge um if to be successful in life and especially in technology you need to be a lifelong learner so having constant interest in new things and and figuring out what your next next thing is to learn is is really important and sometimes you just don't have all the answers so being a sponge allows you to absorb a lot of the the unknown in a new topic and then eventually answers start to come together so being a sponge is like a really important thing sometimes as you're as you're adventuring through technology i love that because i think when you're new to the industry you think that you learn one technology you become an expert and you never have to learn anything new again and unfortunately technology moves in all directions all the time and you're always learning new things even experts as we have here today absolutely thanks brittany we like this advice as well um uh for mine i mentioned i'm emily i work at girls who code i'm the director of alumni programs um the best advice i've received that i used in every job is to write a thank you note write a thank you note when somebody gives you good advice write a thank you know when someone helps you on a project write a thank you know when you attend an event with a bunch of experts and they give you something to think about so this is my advice to all of you i'm sure these three amazing women are on linkedin and if you go find them later and send them a thank you note tomorrow they will remember you so that's my advice i'd like to talk about cloud computing 101 which is what we named this session because i think it means lots of things to lots of people i think it's trendy and you see it in articles and job descriptions and linkedin posts um so what i'm going to ask is that each of you sort of in a short layman's terms way if you were talking to someone who's never heard of cloud computing before what does this mean and ec could we start with you here yeah good question so i would say cloud computing is here is my database here is my application here's my stuff hold it for me just hold it for me and and um money you know just manage it for me and while i just focus on my core business that's what cloud computing is so we have different cloud providers like we've heard from the panelists we have microsoft we have google we have amazon and a few other cloud providers those are the people who are holding your stuff i love that and for the attendees you missed before the event we were setting up with the panelists and there was almost a fight here over what is the best cloud club all three and this is really cool for you all to know all three of these folks work for different providers there's not a single one they may argue what you think is the best um but there's lots of ways to go here um deanna can you add anything to that sort of what is cloud computing in simple terms yeah i'm gonna take a little bit of a different approach so emily had mentioned that i like baking um cloud computing to me is like they're different levels so you can imagine ordering a pizza you just call up you know domino's or wherever you're going to get a pizza from and the pizza shows up that's like what we would call probably platform as a service where it's super easy and very plug and play you can say like i want pepperoni or actually i want mushrooms and everything's great or you can continue to kind of dive a little bit deeper and control more of your pizza so to say so you could go to trader joe's and pick up their pizza dough i've heard it's pretty good and then you can buy some tomato sauce and put some cheddar cheese on top or you can go all the way down to the bottom and mill your own grains and then make your own flour and make your own dough and then have this whole you know 25 hour pizza making experience which is getting much much closer to a traditional infrastructure setup and a little bit more away from the idea of leveraging somewhere someone else's expertise to make your pizza or hold your stuff or however you want to to phrase it there awesome i like it and now i'm hungry we did this before dinner so thank you for that jessica do you have another analogy or another way of thinking about it or describing it uh sure well i mean at the end of the day it's uh using somebody else's hardware and software so um the the pizza is a great analogy and and izzy says other people's stuff um the benefit is when in the traditional onpremise sense before the cloud was around companies had to invest a lot of money in those servers and infrastructure and have people to manage it and so you before you even get into coding and development you're spending all this time just trying to buy things and and set things up and so and then you have a lot of expense around that so the cloud kind of flipped the coin for um being able to innovate quicker because uh other people have done all that leg work and and you can plug in uh like like deanna said you can get to that fully prepared pizza if you want or you may want to customize it and just you know order the dough and figure out what goes on top or you may want to start from scratch and say just give me all the ingredients you know so it's it's a really wonderful way for people to get right into the business of developing instead of just uh instead of having to be in the business of buying still spending money but it's a it's a quicker way to get there i love this that's sort of three different ways of thinking about this and i hope that one of those at least clicked with all of you listening in um certainly helped me understand that this is something that's kind of new to me as well um so there's a lot of different ways to go into computer science to go into software to go into tech somehow all three of you have ended up in this expertise area that's why we asked you to join us on this panel um i would love to understand a little bit about that journey like what did you start studying what did you do at the beginning of your career and really what drew you into this field as a place to specialize over time um deanna i'm gonna kick it back to you to start this one off oh you're muted deanna oh man i know how to work zoom i'm not going to turn into a cat for everyone who saw the wonderful meme earlier i'm yeah when i went to college i really the main goal was to graduate and get a job and then looking at kind of the job market at the time and where things were trending computer science looked like a very you know realistic degree to to study and to get a job after school i'm my mom also is a computer scientist and so i thought if anything i could take a class and if i didn't like it we would have something to talk about and maybe i would understand her job a little bit better i'm but we're very similar and so i was not very surprising to me that i actually ended up loving it um so after i graduated i worked at ibm for a little bit and just kind of through the way that big companies work found myself eventually on a cloud team um and so it wasn't so much by my own seeking out that it happened but as soon as i landed there i really started to thrive and found it to be a fun and exciting environment i think partially jessica you had mentioned this before of like you end up being able to see so much more innovation happening in the cloud because so much of what takes a very long time is provided um that it was a really fast paced and fun environment to work in within a company um so once i found that then i just kind of stuck in that stream for for quite a while i love that and i think it's a realistic way that sometimes you fall into a career path um or big companies shuffle you around or you start in a rotational program or an apprenticeship and all of a sudden you have so much experience in one area that fingers crossed you like it because now you're an expert exactly um jessica tell us a little bit about your path here sure mine wasn't a traditional one so i i went to the school of hard knocks before i actually finished my college degree i grew up pretty poor my mom was a waitress and while i was in high school she was going to college and she was working on her engineering degree and it was environmental engineering so she was taking classes in concrete and i'm looking at that going yeah i'm not going to be an engineer i'm not interested in concrete but you know she she got me a job as a secretary in an environmental firm right out of college and i was good at organizing things so i i had a couple of jobs as a an office person and then i lived briefly out in colorado i came back to tampa and i ended up as a temporary employee for a major bank and this is an interesting story the um i was working on spreadsheets and there was a major problem with their writeoff process their you know their endofyear stuff and they had hired a female executive to come in had a lot of programming experience a master's degree in finance and because of politics and stuff the people that were there didn't want her advice so she was bored and i sat next to her so i got fulltime mentorship from this fabulously brilliant female who taught me all about databases talked to me about finance helped me figure out these spreadsheets so i basically threw her i was remote hands for her brain we developed a database and um my boss got promoted uh i trained people in new york everything was cool but they wouldn't hire me because i didn't have a degree i went from seven dollars an hour to ten dollars an hour awesome um they asked what they could do for me and i said can you send me to a database class a real class because i'd like an education so um i went to a computer training school and while i was there i thought you know if i teach this stuff i could probably learn it so i said how do you become a teacher because they were my age and um i went on to teach like 40 computer classes worked for them for five years had some kids uh started my own business and you know uh over the years worked for the dod lived in germany for a little while and then ended up back here in tampa and worked for the big four and uh i've learned to kind of chase the money over the years like i have to spend a lot of time learning and so i i make my career moves and i figure out what i'm going to do next by trying to kind of research where technology is going and what i'm interested in and i have kind of evolved that and then i also wasn't getting the jobs i wanted to without the degree the piece of paper so i did school remotely i finished my master's after the fact i ended up teaching some of the courses which was kind of fun um i had to pay for it but i taught them and so uh yeah here i am it's it's a weird path that i got here and it's pretty amazing that i'm i'm getting to do what i am today i really love my job and i love working with deloitte they uh they have you bring your genuine self and they really want you to be um your best and and there's a lot of opportunity so it's so i i feel really blessed i love that story jessica thank you so much for sharing that um i think it's a good illustration too that just because you start doing one thing doesn't mean that that's what you do forever careers are long and there's a lot of opportunity out there um let's hear a little bit from ec and um alyssa my colleague is going to drop a link in the chat here if you are wanting to hear more from e.c she has written a book about her story so we wanted to link to her book as well but let's hear directly from you yeah i mean jessica that was so inspiring thank you for sharing that wow awesome okay so my my story is a little um similar to jessica's because i've always been deliberate about chasing the money and um i started off i went to college i studied computer engineering i studied computer engineering in nigeria where girls weren't even allowed to go to school uh to go to college you just finish your high school and then you're married off but i decided to be different i went to college there was just one computer for 150 of us to share like we would form what would stay in the line until it gets to your turn when it gets your turn you just have five minutes to write your code execute your code and get out of there so that was how i learned um how to code well in the midst of all of those challenges i knew i wanted to be where i am today so i kept the focus by the time i graduated from college i was already an oracle certified professional and that's because i was taking external classes out of school i found this place where there were some indians who were doing computer classes and trainings so i was going there after school in the evenings i was taking oracle classes and then at the end but by five years when i finished my bachelor's i already had four oracle certifications so i got out of college and then immediately i was working as an oracle dba and i did that for a while you know working on databases and things like that and then i now started hearing a lot about okay i moved to the u.s when i moved to the u.s by the time i moved to the u.s i already had a phd in technology um so i did my master's information technology i did a phd in technology management all of that just chasing the money and then when i came here and then i heard everyone's talking about cloud cloud cloud i'm like what the heck is this cloud i did some research i found out i saw the trajectory i saw that that's where the money is i sat down i prepared for um certifications i i focused on aws got aws certified i taught myself aws in my room read it passed got certified and i started working at accenture so that's my story i i love it first i just love the candor around chasing the money it's not a bad thing to talk about money it's not a bad thing to talk about advocating for yourself looking for the next opportunity this is so important and it's so great to hear you all talk about that i want to do a brief digression um first thing alyssa we're going to do a quick poll so this is for you attendees i would love to know a little bit about how much you know about cloud so we're going to have a poll pop up on your screen attend a panelist if you see it you can answer it and then it'll go away but this is really helpful to us as we think about our programs um and yeah i know they are awesome folks in the comments are talking about how awesome you are and it's true you all are so awesome so um i'm gonna digress from our our scripted questions for a second because there's something i've heard a bunch of you say which is around certifications and i would love to understand you know there's degrees like a bachelor's degree a master's degree phd could maybe uh ec if you could just share a little bit about like what is a certification and how does that fit into this world of cloud computing absolutely so in the tech world we love certifications um certification is just that validation that you have the skill sets that you say you have you know and you cannot have too many certifications i probably have somewhere around 12 or 13 certifications because i don't joke like i i don't drink at all so the industry recognizes you if you say you're an oracle certified professional it means you have the skill set you're a google certified professional amazon web service professional as your microsoft azure certified professional so i'll encourage everyone if you're in college out of college get certified there's so many in my book i listed all the certifications and kind of give some guidance on based on your skill sets and what you love to do but just get certified thank you um deanna or jessica do you want to add anything about certifications in your experience i think especially like when you're coming out of school without the industry experience it's a very helpful way for you to benchmark with what the industry knows so they might not you know i went to a very small college they were most companies were not familiar with my curriculum but they then could look at things that i had been certified in as well and understand okay we know what you know what that network certification is for example so she must understand this when we can hire her or expect her to know that okay so real granular if i wanted to get a certification like what website do i go to what do i look up on the internet let me google it for you really i mean it's it's it's pretty easy you can search for any of these things you can search aws certification and they'll be multiple different kinds i i know that google one's a little bit better but there's usually like an intro or an associate kind of application developer type intro level and then after that you'll find more advanced ones in certain areas and that's partially just because cloud technology is so broad so then there'll be one in like networking specific technology there'll be one in databases one in analytics and things like that so that you can then you know select certain areas that you're more interested in um from my point of view i think like the the baseline ones that cover across all of the different types of technology is a good way to start and then as you find areas that you're interested in then diving in more there is probably a good approach awesome jessica you want to add anything uh yeah i the one thing about certifications is there's a lot of people looking to take your money for certifications and and one of the ways for you to think about certifications and your education frankly is your time is money and the investment you make in your certifications should give you a reward how do you figure that out if you go if linkedin is a gold mine when you're trying to figure out careers i recommend that you go to linkedin it's a it's a kind of a facebook for job searching and looking at companies and take a look at careers that you think you're interested in or maybe you're starting out in and look at jobs and people that are successful in the job that that are doing things that you think you might want to do look at their certifications and and then also search jobs in linkedin for example that are looking for people the job search engines actually key on your certifications so you can follow the money and you can invest in yourself in a way that um you know you're spending your money on the right things um you know when when i wasn't making a lot of money i i took some very hard tests that were very expensive they cost 500 to take they take months to study for and i'm not a good test taker i you know and so you have to be willing to pay twice sometimes for these tests and so you really want to be committed to the goal and make sure that the bang is worth the buck so yeah could i just add to what jessica said if you take the exam the first time and you feel it take it again i like that another thing another thing to note once you get your first job a lot of companies have professional development budgets so you know it's not a guarantee but you might have 500 or a thousand dollars that you're allowed to spend on a training during the year um and this is the kind of thing that you could take to your manager and say i would like to do the certification you know can i use my professional development money for this um because jessica's right it's expensive the other thing i want to add is when when i was making seven bucks an hour and i didn't have an education and i just needed a better job i had kids to feed i um linkedin does this too you can do certifications that are like these little badges they're not necessarily recognized by the industry but if you can get an interview you can say look i can't afford the certifications but i wanted to prove that i can do these certifications so these are examples i know they're not you know the the expensive ones but i want you to know that i'm capable of doing this good points yeah that's a great feature i love that linkedin learning is another improving yeah yeah you're proving yourself you've got to show some badges of proof and you do it within your means whatever they are absolutely causera also has some um free courses that you can take and they give you a coursera certificate you know well it's free and just just like jessica said you're showing that you have the skill sets yeah that's a good point so we did that poll about how comfortable people feel on a scale of one to ten with cloud computing like how knowledgeable they are and uh about 70 percent said only a one two or three and i'm saying that because i want you all to know that you're in the same boat here like nobody is an expert except the three women on the screen everybody there's no question that's too silly like everybody is learning about this the vast majority of you feel really new to this kind of content people have been posting some awesome links including ec thank you for that so uh grab those links and make sure you save those let's move on to another question um some of you alluded to this a little bit um jessica i'd like to start with you here so the question we got this a lot in our registration which is how do you anticipate cloud computing changing over time what trends have you noticed what do you think is on the horizon you mentioned like looking ahead like what if we're looking ahead what are we looking at uh well i you know i i thought this was an interesting question and i don't have a crystal ball so i i don't know what lies ahead but i think it's a pretty safe bet to say that you know ai um and uh you know quantum computing and and you know some of the some of these big buzzwords are the way of the future the reason their buzzwords what they're the way of the future is is the nut hasn't been cracked yet i mean ai uh there's a lot of fear about you know ai taking over jobs and things like that yes ai has a lot of potential it's not there yet but people are thinking that way so um i do think that you know a lot of people are excited about a lot of these new new areas and so the excitement the momentum and the possibilities usually lead to the innovation and the growth in that area um how cloud computing will change i think things are going to be more accessible i noticed that more layers keep getting added to make things easier for people so you know i mentioned i'm an infrastructure person so you know you start at the lower levels of ones and zeros and you plug things in and then you put software on top of things to make things easier and and with cloud computing there's a lot of layers on top of things when you get out here to a presentation you don't have to know all these things under the hood you don't have to know how your car runs or how to change your oil you just have to know how to use the things inside here um so so being a scientist for ai requires a lot of education and you know a lot of work there but they're starting to extrapolate those layers and and there's some software available now to where you can kind of do learning simply without having to be that you know super computer up here yourself you know they they're they're putting those layers in place so that it doesn't have to be that hard so i think that's going to continue to happen the challenge with that is that the more layers you put on things the more things can go wrong so something down here can fall out and cause problems up here and so there's a lot of busy work and there's a lot of opportunity so every time another layer occurs there's all these specializations and all this work and stuff that has to happen to make it happen so there's opportunity all over the place it's really what you what are you interested in thanks jessica issy do you want to add your predictions for what's coming down the pike yeah i was reading a forbes article i think last week and it says that we're just around 20 of cloud penetration so it means that there's still a whole lot of work to do um a lot of enterprises especially with covid what we've seen in the last one year people don't want to be around six feet of each other so that means that people do not want to be on premises like they don't want to be in a physical location working on servers and doing all of that what we used to do in the past people want to be a part so being a part means you want to go to the cloud so we've seen in the last one year a lot of rush you know we're doing quite a lot of migration you know public sector is moving to the cloud you know financial services healthcare agreed everybody's moving to the cloud and so the cloud is here to stay and i believe that just like jessica mentioned about ai and all of this fancy stuff will ride on top of cloud you know so i'm doing my second masters in in artificial intelligence it's just because i think the idea of not you know always wanting to learn um i i just want to learn i want to follow the trend i want to follow the money uh and that's you know that's what that's what i would say so between ai we're right on top of cloud but there's still a lot of penetration to do within cloud i love that and i love the second masters we do get a question in the chat here about uh do you need a master's degree and izzy said no and deanna pointed out she doesn't have a master's degree there's a lot of ways to grow in a field that is as new and vibrant as this um so deanna what do you think is on the horizon it's a little bit different now that i'm not in cloud technology um i don't you know i don't read all these articles all the time anymore and i'm not trying to sell cloud to financial services customers and so being on the other side and actually working at one of these companies i'm it's much more i don't know i feel like we're so much further behind that to me like the biggest hurdle to get things to the cloud is always the security conversation it's never an easy thing to say like oh is my data actually safe up there i'm or where is it right like what happens if it's deleted nobody wants to look at it logically and understand that your data is probably much much safer in the cloud than it is in any onprem data center that is resting away in some facility that that who knows has access to with their badge and whatnot i'm but it's more of a logical and a an emotional argument and i think the security technology that's out there today to a certain degree is is difficult to understand for a lot of people and so i think that that will continue to evolve and become i think jessica to your point like easier and easier over time so that it doesn't even become a conversation that's happening that much anymore and that people just default feel comfortable with moving stuff to the cloud um that's one where i think like and maybe not so much on the big time horizon of like you know 10 years from now when everything's super cool we have artificial intelligence and everything but more of like three years from now and a little bit smaller and then the other thing that we always get tripped up on is billing um the cloud is really complicated to understand with billing the typical um you know enterprise big company is very familiar with writing a big check to some kind of vendor for a ton of hardware that's going to be delivered and then they'll set it up and they can physically see it and understand it and track it in accounting it's very difficult for a company to understand that my costs are going to vary every month that i can't predict them and that i don't know what services we're going to use or how the different each surface service has like 100 different skus attached to it for every reason you skew i actually don't know what that stands for sku uh it's going to be it's a number to identify the item i was trying to think of the actual acronym there i'm so if you think of like yeah i won't think of a better example than that it's a sister google will know all of the different ways that we get charged um it's very hard to read those bills and understand exactly where our money went um and so that's that's kind of the second hurdle of being on the other side of a cloud relationship now and trying to figure out so that we can become comfortable with moving more things to the cloud by anticipating what it might cost um and being able to define that i mean i struggle sometimes to read my phone bill and understand why it has changed right and that's like a similar on a much smaller scale like i used more data but like doing what and how and at what rates doing different things um i want to do our second poll because it pertains to our last group of questions here alyssa could you put our second poll and if all of our attendees um we want to know how you prefer to learn new technologies do you study solo do you study in small groups do you like a classroom or do you like to do online tutorials um so take a moment and when you are ready just answer that question and the reason we're asking you this is because i'm going to ask our experts here what advice they have for college students and young professionals who want to learn these skills like how do we do this do you we talked about some certifications but we've also received a question in the chat about what should high school students be studying what should college students be studying and then what else could folks do on the side um jessica maybe we can start with you on this one sure um so how to build your skills in cloud computing you know i would actually step back a little bit and start with building some critical thinking skills um you know learning how to solve a problem and break it down is going to be a really good baseline for learning how to work with computers and get into cloud computing you know when you're when you're programming regardless of what program it is you're basically giving instructions to a computer and um depending on the complexity of what you need to program you have to learn how to take something fuzzy and complicated and break it down into a series of steps and instructions there we go sorry sorry i was drinking water i moved my mic um so learning how to break things down into a series of steps and instructions and and the reason critical thinking is really important is because it's messy it's always messy you're always dealing with messy problems you have a mess and you have to learn how to do something with the mess and turn it into something that's not messy anymore so if you spend some time and there's critical thinking courses and and just some theory around how to break things and organize things you're learning it in your biology class you know you learn how to classify things for biology and and and put things into different um slots that's the same kind of concept of what you end up doing with computers and in solving problems when you want to get into programming don't start really itty bitty like if you can give an instruction and it does something back you have programmed you know you don't need to program a robot to talk back to you um start with you know hello world you can google hello world there is a lot of languages that you can learn hello world you're basically giving the computer an instruction to talk back to you and say hello world and you can do this in lots of link programming languages and just doing that one simple thing in a lot of different mediums would give you a sense of accomplishment but also kind of an understanding of it's really the same it's just different tools to talk to the computer and so your your job is really learning how to talk to the computer so it knows how to receive your words thank you jessica i love that someone once explained to me that just like if you're learning a new language like a spoken language you know you start and you you're not you're just trying to be understood right you're trying to order a glass of soda in another country in another language it doesn't have to be fancy you're just trying to get yourself understood and you get smoother and more dynamic as you go but you got to start somewhere and i think that's true when you're learning to talk to a computer as well um deanna what do you think advice for folks on what they should study how they can prepare for this career yeah um that's such a big question i break it down choose a part it's up to you yeah i do like um like jessica what you said about a feeling of accomplishment i think it's really important that you can find um coursera and udacity and all these like online courses to really zero in on a certain area and figure out like how do i code in python how do i code in java how do i code all these different languages i'm but taking a moment to actually like recognize that you did something and that you got the computer to talk back to you or you know you hit a bug and figured it out eventually and got your program to work the way that you wanted to i think is a really important part of it because otherwise it can feel like you're not actually really achieving you know you're you're not hitting the milestones or anything like that i think if you take a moment to say i did right i programmed something and i can continue doing this you'll want to it's positive reinforcement within your own your own brain which will only help you thank you you see how about you i think i would say all right go to udemy casera linkedin and just start with the basics search for cloud foundation search for cloud computing 101 and and start there um learn learn learn and learn take notes so i still write like i still have a book on the pen i still write i know we're in technology age but yeah i see that yeah look at all three of you are not so that you can go back to it and when someone put in the chat that how do you struggle with selfpaced learning yeah i know that it can be a challenge but you really for you to survive in tech you have to be selfmotivated you have to you know and i think the other speakers have spoken about self reinforcement or appreciation so when you do a little bit if you finish one chapter you appreciate yourself uh if you can form groups two or three people come together let's finish this course in one month and just keep pushing yourself always remember to to push yourself uh if people come from situations where um there was one computer for 150 people to share and now i've taught over a thousand girls how to code in the last one year it was all that self motivation and self push so push yourself learn little bits appreciate yourself and keep on going thank you i think the account oh go ahead jessica oh i was just going to add that you know the other the other thing about you know giving yourself positive rewards and learning how to push past goals is it it translates everywhere in your life a funny little story i i have a farm now and i have some donkeys and a horse and it's expensive to get their hooves done and my daughter is the horse person but now i'm taking care of them because she's in college and i don't want to spend 200 a month to take care of hooves i taught myself i'm like you know if i can teach myself how to do computers i can figure out how to clip these hooves my daughter was really upset and then finally i took enough courses on how to do it that i can do it as good as a farrier so what i'm trying to say is you learn this girl and you will learn this for the rest of your life and everything you do you will be unstoppable it translates everywhere i love that so much and um i'm someone on this call who's not a software developer and i don't code right i work at grocery code on our programs um but i use excel all the time and i had to learn how to write formulas in excel which is in its own way telling a computer that you want it to do some math for you right and i had an issue the other day where i couldn't get my formula to work and i was about to throw my computer out the window and i was googling and i was googling and i was reading examples and i my partner who lives with me is a software developer and i was like i'm not asking him i'm gonna figure it out i'm gonna do it myself and i did figure it out and it was the best feeling i had all day when it finally worked so thank you very much it's the best it's the best yeah then you wanna tell your friends like when you ping people you're like hey deanna no joke i texted my best friend i saw my excel problem yeah um so we got the results of that poll which is really fascinating we're asking people how they like to learn and uh 40 said online tutorials and then another 27 said small groups and i think this is a great opportunity easy to your point make an accountability group with your friends like pick a course that you're going to do it can be free or it can be cheap or you can ask ask around and try to get some fundraising for it pick a course you're gonna do two or three other people and then make checkpoints every monday night we're gonna send each other our progress right like that's a way to help each other motivate um jessica did you have something you're muted oh yeah yeah i did so so i learned this early because i i taught computers if you can teach something that you learned you will remember it forever so if if you learn a little something bore your family to death and your friends and teach them and you will find that you will retain everything in life and it will be so valuable because you'll learn speaking skills you'll learn how to organize your thoughts and it'll build upon itself so if it's overwhelming find a way to teach it even if it's just a little bit and you'll find that you'll have more confidence that's such excellent advice um and then i i should plug girls who code college loops here so a college loop is a selfstarted group of women in college that you don't have to have been a girls who code alumni so if you didn't get to do one of our programs when you were younger it's not too late we're going to talk about that in a second um you it's not too late you find a couple of women at your college you make a college loop you go on our website to join us it's free it doesn't cost any money and we offer you some resources some ideas some activities tutorials we have a like how to get started with open source coding activity with you and your friends can do together so start a college loop oh thank you alyssa posted it in the chat that's awesome that's a great way to build and you can do whatever you want if you don't want to do our activities and you want to do the aws certification that's awesome too um i love our student who said i always talk to my dog talking to stuff out loud is so real all right we're going to do one final question here um i want to thank everyone in the audience who shared questions these have been so awesome the last one we have this came from you all when you registered is just stepping back more broadly a lot of folks are applying to internships right now first jobs how would you recommend preparing for these applications and one of the questions we got a lot is if you get asked something like are you familiar with xyz technology or have you ever done this before and the answer is no how do you respond to a question like that deanna you want to start us off yeah i am i used to interview a lot for my team so i feel like i've seen every which way of this and um hopefully have a good understanding of what companies might be looking for um so i think the first part is that you should always be honest right the first red flag in an interview is if someone falsely acclaims that they know something um because that then gives me the sign that i can ask you more questions on it right you're just all of a sudden digging a hole and that's not a position you want to be in you use that language analogy imagine someone says do you speak spanish and you say yes and then they ask you something in spanish like you're gonna get yourself in trouble exactly and then then you're off on kind of a wrong relationship with your interviewer they're not and really trusting of your your answers after that so instead i think it's much better to be straightforward so to your point emily of what happens when they ask you do you know xyz technology and you say no where does the conversation go then so i think the the next part to fall on is if you know something similar so you could say no i don't know that but i do know about this or in the event where you can't draw that parallel you could ask them to help you understand it better so that you might be able to provide more information on something that you do know so interviewers are are not trying to stump you or kick you out or anything like that they're looking for people to join their company that's why they're interviewing you right so they will try and help you through that um they just need to know that you need some help right so they won't be able to give you the cues of what that technology is if you don't ask so i think you know just kind of breaking down that it isn't this like endallbeall scary thing i remember going to interviews in college and being like just so sweaty the whole time and it was terrible and it doesn't have to be that way right it could be um a much more kind of engaging conversation between two people that are really trying to do something to help each other right you're looking for a job and they're looking for someone to join their team i love that um easy what's your advice yeah i think uh when you see all those buzz words or they actually all those buzz words now in text someone say cicd pipeline or jenkins they want to true all the supports what are you you say no i honestly i don't know it but i can learn it you know and then you quickly change the subjects to how you fixed a challenge that you didn't know anything about but you researched it you googled it you called a friend and so i think recruiters just want to see that desire and ability to learn and you know keep learning and solving the problem so i mean i i was coming from another country to to the us and i probably filled seven interviews before i got into accenture and so it took me a while to learn what the american recruiter was looking for and it's really just that honesty you know so i'll say no i don't know this but i can learn it if you give me some time i can learn it the other day you just quickly the other day i had this problem i didn't know it but this is how i solved it that's such good advice and i would just like to not to put a pin on this but did you hear her say that she had seven interviews that didn't go well before she got the job and this is a very impressive woman you've been hearing from so that's just a reminder that everybody doesn't get every job all the time it's okay sometime you know no matter how many credentials you have or how good you're feeling so thank you for sharing that that's a vulnerable thing to share and we appreciate it i was actually just going to jump in there really quick i do think like job fairs and career fairs are a great way to practice interviewing it is the skill that needs to be practiced right right right very true and jessica let's close out with your thoughts so interviewing is really tough i tend to get nervous and i stumble over my words and i can't remember acronyms to save my life i had a database interview and i couldn't describe a cluster and i'm walking out of the interview i cannot believe i couldn't answer the most fundamental thing in the interview i just couldn't answer it you know i'm like so try not to work yourself into a um into into a nervous bundle is first and foremost so find the things that you can do to relax yourself so that you're able to answer the questions if you need a tool i need a tool i have a tool right now this is just a necklace that broke and i sit here and mess with it because it allows me to think without getting nervous looking at my picture and analyzing things so um find things that you need to make yourself comfortable because um people want to be comfortable with you and if you're too nervous they start interpreting that so give yourself a chance to kind of work through the bundle of nerves and then i do the same thing as he does i don't know but this is how i solve things i don't know um and i will tell you that it's changed over the years but as a female they expected me not to know anything and i can't tell you how many times in my career it has been you always surprised me you know like i i really didn't expect that out of you you know so i i people don't expect what they get out of me i'm always underestimated and it's my superpower so um i don't worry about it too much i let people underestimate me and i don't try to be a champion of words and i'm just not super nimble with words a lot of people are that's not my superpower but i'm a really good troubleshooter and i'm a good researcher and so i know that and i find the places where i fit and i've i've not gotten more jobs than i've gotten and i've had jobs that i haven't liked and i've moved on and and so you you have to do that in your career you have to decide this is who i am and this is how i move through the world and you learn from every experience and then you find the next opportunity and and and you just find your place and you can do it thank you jessica that is such a great note to end on i also want to say ashley in the comments who has her first interview tomorrow for an internship and is a little nervous you are going to crush it take a few deep breaths find something to fidget with and be honest with them we're going to put up on the screen a survey for all of you attendees all you have to do is take out your phone and hold it up to the qr code with your camera and that's how you'll fill out a little survey for us this is really helpful this feedback you give us but i want to just say a huge shout out here to our panelists to jessica deanna and ec this has been a wonderful conversation for me i can tell in the chat that folks have been feeling really inspired as well and again with the advice i started out with if you feel inspired by any of these women i would go find them on linkedin i would send them a nice note about what inspired you and what advice you appreciated because you never know when you're going to be wanting an internship and it's going to be really nice to email jessica pruitt or dr easy like this is the time to make those connections so um we are done with our program for the evening panelists thank you for your time i hope everyone enjoys their dinner i hope everyone enjoys their fridays and hopefully a long weekend maybe for some of us knock on wood um but it has been a real delight to have you all here oh thank you alyssa up on your screen next up actually it's from deloitte jessica um we have a an event next tuesday at 4 pm eastern time about building a successful career path and this is with deloitte and toyota so if you like these kinds of conversations you want to learn more please come tuesday 4 p.m thank you all so much you're amazing and we will see you next time thank you thank you you
