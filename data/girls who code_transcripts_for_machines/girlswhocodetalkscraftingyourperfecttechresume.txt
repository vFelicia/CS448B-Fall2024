off tonight with an icebreaker followed by a question that will address the concerns of girls who code college alumni and students across the country who are either beginning matriculating or ending their college experience we'll end the conversation with a q a segment with some of the questions that have been submitted before today's session so panelists our ice breaker question is at what age did you draft your first resume and when you drafted who helped you so i want to give you some time to think about that question i'm going to ask you all to answer in the order that you were but before you do viewers i want you to get ready to answer icebreaker question using a whole feature open in the evenings stay alert because you'll only have 30 seconds to respond the boxes up now so you have 30 seconds to answer the question that's on the screen so um let's have someone go ahead and answer the question so anthony can you answer that question um for us the first question about your resume oh wait i thought it was the order in which we were introduced yeah but it's okay i switched the game up i switched the game yeah rachel when you said that um i love the question when i it made me think so i would say i did get my first job without my first resume my first actual resume i believe i was probably 21 22 because i had a lot of my jobs had been networking talking to people and you know kind of getting through the back door and tapping that network so yeah i was actually in college almost out of college when i drafted my first resume and google helped me google google is your friend love it love to hear it um so so really quick so really quickly before we go on to the other panelists for the icebreaker we did have the results of the poll so i want to share the results of the poll 71 response yes the question about the resume so that is a good that's a good population of people so proud girls who code love to see it and for those who who the answer isn't yes we're gonna be giving you some tools that we believe will be helpful for you okay so let's just go back through the order rachel do you mind answering that icebreaker question for us you're on mute rachel sorry double mute um so my guess is my guess is going to be 17 or 18 like senior year in high school i think is probably the earliest i can remember in preparation for college and probably my mom helped me [Laughter] love it love it i'm seeing in the chat a lot of people said my mom too me too a lot of cosigning thanks mom love it and jasmine will you share with us your your response to the icebreaker yeah i'm on the same board with rachel it was probably around 17 18 preparing um for college i am a graduate of north carolina a t state university so aggie pride there um but yeah it was i i built the resume around 17 and perfected it when i was in college for sure so no worries if you haven't created it just yet google is your friend mom is always your friend and um and college will certainly help you get them backing awesome awesome yeah i had the same response it was mom it was um in high school i was um preparing my freshman year for my first job uh working um at a beauty salon i was the greeter in the front of the salon and i had to have a resume for that um so i rem i remember those days as well so thank you so much panelists for the icebreaker um participants thank you so much for everything you're dropping into the chat i'm hearing some and seeing some really great things um and again to the poll question we are so um happy to hear that the first draft of your resume has already been complete that's a big deal that's the first step and we're excited to unpack that through the session so okay let's go ahead and prepare to go into our first question that's going to explore entering college most of the questions from viewers have been around formatting that's a a big question which sections are essential when applying for tech roles and in which orders should they be listed should candidates excuse me should candidates have a summary or objective line or not and designs and colored fonts for real dazzle basic template so my question i'm going to pose this to anthony and rachel is what are key components every technical resume should have and what are some guidelines that should be followed maybe we'll start with rachel this time oh man i love this question but i hate this question because it twofold right so one is a little bit of personal preference and then the other thing is every company has a different preference right so all three of us would give a completely different answer i'm sure right because all of our companies have different preferences um but for me a couple of things that you reference so definitely one page you're in college right keep it to one page you don't have that much experience that it should go beyond that um you know if you have technical skills some languages or some of the courses that you've taken is always good um i love especially if we're talking about like user experience or design type um work that i kind of want to see that creativity in your resume right so i'm okay with some of the colors not the neon green right but um you know i'm okay with it being a little more creative artistic um if that's the way that you're going in terms of the roles that you're looking for that's more fitting to the personality um so i think those are some of my key tips but some of it is you've really got to put your personality into the resume so you you've got to figure out what's your personality and how to best get your personality onto paper which isn't always the simplest thing so you also remember you're going to go through tons of iterations of resumes which is okay for the rest of your career i literally probably have like 832 versions of my resume since i created my first one at 17 or 18. right so um i would say just you know be open to looking at others googling as always you know google is always your best friend um and just iterating on it you know throughout your college career yeah i i everything that rachel said resonated with me what if you take nothing from this what i would say my general overarching guideline is your resume is a marketing tool not your life story so we've all been on youtube you can skip a youtube ad in five seconds that's you have to treat your resume as an advertisement and in order to do that you do things like rachel talked about highlight the key components in terms of technical skills whether it be you know javascript html css but also tailoring it to the jobs that you're looking for and then going along the lines of keeping your resume as this tool that's promoting and advertising you think about when you go on a website if you want to go girls who code website right now the screen has the most important things that you need to see right to navigate you know what girls who code is about same thing with your resume put those key skills put urls to projects that you've done that display your code people want to see examples of your work not that you just said that you did it um so yeah we can dive deeper into that more but i would say general guideline is treat it like a marketing tool and if you think about it that way then that'll help you go through those iterations that rachel spoke about yeah um great responses panelists and there was a question that came in in the chat that i'll just answer what if you have not had formal experience you haven't had a job yet how do you think about that as someone who's preparing to go into college and what i would say is think about the course the classes you've taken if there have been any projects that have really stretched your skills um even if you did something you created a project for yourself it wasn't through a class but you spent significant time exploring a new concept or diving into a concept all of that counts and all of that is helpful so so use that as well as a part of your early journey of exposure okay um so thank you thank you so much panelists um now we're going to move to matriculating students so students who are currently in college the description for this session we mentioned tips to successfully get past an applicant tracking system what is an ats that's the acronym for applicant tracking system topresume.com defines an ats as a type of software used during the hiring process to collect sort scan and rank the job applications they receive for open positions it's it's hard to weed out on or it's easy to weed out unqualified applicants so the recruiter can devote their time to evaluating candidates who are more likely to be a match for the position so it's a time saver before diving too deep into the conversation i want to make sure our viewers understand the function of an ats applicant tracking system so we want a poll another poll poll time um was that definition that i just shared helpful uh scholars on the line please respond accordingly was the definition of applicant tracking session system helpful all right let's see the results 90 said yes so awesome so now we can keep it moving that's good and you know what a lot of people don't fully know the function of ats so we're happy that everyone here has general understanding so now we can move forward with the question so this is going to be for rachel and jasmine understanding applicant tracking systems act as electronic gatekeepers for employers how should internship job seekers convey their skill set experiences and impact on their resumes to be identified as a qualified candidate so maybe we will start with jasmine for this question um okay hi everyone um so we we certainly or most companies all companies have some type of applicant tracking system especially when it comes to things like in summer internships where you have you know up to 2000 applicants bringing in the pipeline what it helps us to do is really bucketize uh the candidates into um you know who which skill set would match the best and then you know which candidate you know would be a stellar candidate but i say that um in a twofold type of concept it really requires or it should require the hiring manager recruiter to look hopefully at as many applicants as they can and what what we try to do at att certainly is to look at the most wellrounded candidate so i'll give you an example if you are a student um who is super active on campus i was very active when i was in school um you know i had a lot of fun in college too so um i wasn't um a 4.0 student i also wasn't a 3.5 student either so i teetered between that you know 2.9 3.125 um and so but i also did like community activities i had you know lots of leadership qualities and so even though there should be and oftentimes are um quali disqualifiers within the applicant tracking system because you can't hire everyone uh what we certainly try to do is make sure we're looking at the most wellrounded candidate so when i'm interviewing you know students i'm you know they mentioned before about what's on your resume i want to know about your projects i want to know about you know the things that you're doing on campus and even if you don't have excuse me a lot of that work experience you can you know tell me about maybe some things that you're doing in your community that you know are super innovative or have some type of tech background if you're teaching or you know um mentoring someone younger than you or things at your church so all that to say the applicant tracking system is um the the house so to speak and you know we bucketize the candidates into different rooms and it helps us to um navigate to the best candidate um that has the best skill set for the job i hope that answer question yeah no no no that's great and i think that in in the chat there's been a lot of conversations just about um what if i don't have enough experience even when you think about kind of key words how do you even think about keywords from an applicant tracking system this wasn't technically a part of it but is there anybody who wants to to respond to the importance of keywords um i can talk a little bit about that because the one comment i really wanted to make and this is going to sound really simple right but this is like we see it a lot in terms of if there is a job description and it has either like the basic qualifications or minimum requirements like either of those phrases listed right one of the simplest things you can do to get past even just that first screen is make sure that your resume includes those list them put them somewhere in there right if it says requires java or python make sure you list java or python if it says you know 3.0 minimum gpa make sure you write your gpa like literally the basic basic qualifications or minimum requirements if it's listed in the job description do everything you can to get all of those in your resume right because one of the things um that you know unfortunately kind of to jasmine's point of having you know 2 000 plus applicants potentially is you know recruiters don't want to have to go back and hunt you down and say hey you didn't put this on here so i'm just confirming do you have this right that's gonna already put you in the bucket of okay maybe i'll come back to them if i can't find it with all these people who already did list it right so that's one key thing for me just off the bat make sure whatever's in the minimum section that's in there yeah and i saw a question in the chat about and we do and we get this a lot and rachel you could probably agree with this as well um what about the student that doesn't have a gpa yet you know and recruitment seasons are you know really heavy in the fall you know they we certainly put our you know full court press so to speak you know in the fall and then um we're doing more of the um lowhanging fruit in the spring what i say to that is that you can always put your high school gpa um and that you know we understand that you are a freshman and that you haven't you know really gotten a gpa just yet um you speak to that you know speak to you know maybe some things that you've done in high school because listen i think and especially in this this time that we're living in we're really trying to humanize the recruitment process we were all there uh we we've all had you know the experience of applying for jobs and looking for jobs and things and so um again to answer that particular question uh put your high school gpa um and then also you know put some of the courses the core courses that you could be taking uh the first semester of your freshman year maybe some projects and things that you're working on those projects are important it shows what you're interested in i saw another question that i did want to touch on briefly i'll be really quick um do we look you up on social media yes yes we do um so and not like a gotcha type of moment but you know you always remember no company wants you to affect bottom line bottom line yeah yeah no i'm so happy jasmine jasmine and anthony both talk to you about mark about marketing your personal brand and i've heard i've heard the girls who code scholars have awesome brands but we have to remind you preparing to go into into the workforce so just keep that keep that in mind um the other thing that i want to give everyone is homework i know giving homework in the summer is um i want you to google go to google and just type in think about a role that you're interested in a programmer role if you're interested in data analysis type of role anything in that space just type that term in and a company that you're interested in google microsoft att raytheon like everyone who's here and just look at a job description of an analyst level role um in a career that you're interested in like it might seem intimidating but just look at it read what it says look at some of the key words that they're highlighting because i think that that's something i wish i had done earlier that'll give you some insight um as students who are just exploring what's for you okay so let's let's keep it moving because we have we want to get the panelists to speak um the next category is graduating students okay so in light of covet 19 the job market has been um sent into a frenzy that's a any employers receive several hundred applications for job openings although the tech job market is stable hiring managers and recruiters workloads only allow them to spend a couple of seconds reading before deciding whether to move forward or not so this question is for jasmine and anthony we'll start with anthony what elements can be added to perfect a good resume and me and make it stand out and then after you have answered that what should candidates completely avoid putting on their resume i have i got two tools that can help you perfect a good resume um and also help you build up your resume and it builds off what you said chelsea about reading some of these job descriptions like if you're stressed if you're facing imposter syndrome if you're nervous we understand that so i would say a good homework assignment 10 job descriptions you're interested in and don't do anything else like don't pressure yourself to write a resume because what will happen is you start to just get comfortable with like oh wow i've seen java 15 times i've seen the word crossfunctional team eight times and you just start to get more comfortable with it and then i start thinking about your resume because now you have context for how you can position and market yourself so that's one second is the tools so one is called jobscan.co and another one is called recruiting.net so jobscan which you can do is you can paste a version of your resume even if it's like v1 first drive and you can paste the job description and what it'll do it'll run an algorithm and show you the words in the job description that you're missing and that's a free tool they have a paid version but you get a few free fences and the second is recruiting.net so what you can do is say like you said you want to be an analyst at att right what you can do is you can look up uh people who work at a t that are already analysts and linkedin and see okay what are the words that they're using um uh and it's jobscan.co actually okay um so yeah two tools and then one thing to do is just as we said think about how you market and position yourself and using these tools and as chelsea said reading a lot of uh reading a lot of job postings especially at the companies you want to work with that'll not only give you confidence but also more context for how to position yourself um jasmine would you like to add yeah very good i mean um that's really great advice i would say um leadership skills if you have any type of leadership skills um programming languages you know look at the market you know that is becoming um the norm to have some type of programming proficiency in some area so i have that um and then any type of organizations you know community impact i think is really really important now companies are looking more at you know what what you're connected to what you're passionate about and because that ultimately leads to what you bring to work and so and then vice versa we have the candidates that we interact with they want to know you know what what are you doing in the community what how how do you feel about philanthropic philanthropic work um so that's important um but you know what i would say the don'ts um don't have misspelled words on your resume that's like no that's number one um and then two you know if it's if it's light you know if it's you don't have much to put on that that's okay you know don't beat yourself up you're gonna get there to anthony's point you gotta get more confident in creating a resume around the the content that that leads to the content so um i would say no misspell words no you know weird margins um so all that all that all that normal stuff that you would think of and then if you're in college i can't stress this enough um and i speak from experience because i didn't take advantage of it enough when i was in like i said i had a lot of fun um but definitely you need to be attached at the hip to your career services office they provide invaluable time and information you know as a recruiter and you know in college recruiting i'm talking to them probably three to four times a week and so they they have the pulse on the industry um and what i also like to tell candidates too is you know doing all of those things it ultimately leads to ensuring that your your juice is worth the squeeze which means you know you you can back up what you what you have on that resume um so yeah that's mine that's my um feedback good stuff just love this panelist team and the questions in the chat are awesome um panelists feel free at any point to answer some of these questions i'm trying to to help the the scholars as well now i did find a tool earlier in the or an article earlier in the week that i wanted to share that i think is helpful and the article i'm just going to highlight a few things talked about the hard skills um or the technical skills that necessary particular roles and so i just wanted 30 seconds share them with you for those of you who are interested in web development proficiency in html css and javascript are typically a must for those who are interested in cyber security knowledge of programming and scripting languages is desired by employers along with a track record of analyzing maybe malware or data sets so anytime you're working with data or excel that can be helpful if you're interested in data science candidates should prop their expertise into modeling so some modeling analysis which also typically will require excel machine learning you'll want some proficiency in python or experience with gpu which is a computer and data mining system and the final one is programmers you should be strong in sas and language is like sql okay and so we've we've talked about that before let's get into some of the other questions because we've got um what do we have about 30 minutes together a little bit less than that um so our first question is around linkedin and we've been seeing in the chat a lot of questions about linkedin so linkedin seems to be the new resume for recruiters and employers should i list the same information on my resume as i do on my linkedin page who wants to tackle that one i'll start i'll start um i love this area because i loop you know um linkedin and instagram and all that you know i i loop it in together and i laugh i was joking you know earlier not really um that we do look at your social because we do and not necessarily as a gotcha moment but also like in a positive way you know if you're doing really cool things on instagram like on campus or in your community or what have you like i want to see i think that's awesome and we also use those type of platforms to recruit you know lots of companies when you're scrolling through instagram or scrolling through linkedin you see these uh targeted ads that you might even you know for your interviews announcement popped up you know on your um instagram feed all of those things are um are you know essential in marketing um yourself and so uh i certainly use linkedin a lot i post on linkedin i look at articles on linkedin companies now are pushing more information through linkedin we can connect with candidates via chat the you know different postings so it's a really cool tool um to engage with potential hires um and also to get some of the questions that you have answered and to anthony's point earlier about looking at you know goals that other people have that you may interested in that's a great way to do that you can see their linkedin profile you can see what they like you can see who they're connected to you know your people connect with my people type of thing and so um i you know believe that it is your digital resume it gives um a good idea of what your vibe is like you know what you're interested in type of thing so i've i've seen a lot of questions around you know how old do you have to be to have a linkedin you know what you need to do just create one if you don't have a a professional profile picture my background right now in my apartment is why you can put on a nice you know outfit and do just a complete little headshot and put that up there definitely doesn't need to be any selfies or anything like that but um but i i really do feel like um linkedin has been super beneficial to lots of companies and at t being them fantastic is there anyone else who wants to add in on linkedin it's a very important topic oh anthony yeah please hop in yeah i would say to jasmine's point just like other platforms right you have instagram i'm sure there's people you follow on instagram there's communities whether it's about fashion whether it's different things that you're into whether it's different brands that you follow right and linkedin is that powerful but for jobs right so even just even if you created like a bare minimum linkedin and all you did was just like post and follow people and companies again you just that also starts to build your confidence you're like oh like i understand this linkedin thing so also don't feel as though it's you have to figure out everything at once it's like oh i gotta have my great resume and my linkedin and my experience no like first starts to understand these tools and how powerful they are and then start to build upon that and including you know everything else that jasmine said awesome awesome all right let's go to the next question um so someone said i do not have particularly strong transcripts and also lack formal work experiences came up earlier how can i craft a compelling resume and still present myself as a strong candidate so if we can give for this question if we can think about any specific examples you all can think about like that you've had on the job where a student has really showed you strong skills regardless of grades or or anything that would be helpful so whoever would like to take it rachel do you have a thought yes i'll start on that one um so i think and i think we've touched on this several times tonight but um i think this is where you can really um highlight your leadership skills your volunteer activities your campus you know organizations projects that you've done in class right it doesn't always have to be formal work experience right um anything that highlights your interest and your skill sets um is great right you can link to like your github page if you have projects on there you can put that on your resume there are different ways to still you know project yourself in a good light outside of just your gpa right i think jasmine mentioned it before we we're looking for wellrounded right and that's not always in a number right and people have different circumstances on why that their gpa is the way that it is so we want to see kind of that broad horizon of different experiences that you're participating in um and i think one thing that's um important is the skill sets area right a lot of people sometimes have skills listed there right so you can add on different skills and then also putting something maybe unique now this is something this is a very particular story that i had super random um but i was interviewing a candidate right and she you know had had tons of leadership and community um you know she did fairly well in school and then in her interest area right um she was you know volunteering did it and then it said uh mallard duck caller if anybody so a mallard it's literally it's like the the green it's like a green and black duck so she literally one of her skills was mallard caller right and i literally followed up with her because that made her stand out in the pool of this is a super random skill slash interest and i was like i kind of want to know more right so sometimes also putting something very unique or specific to you that again shows your personality like anthony anthony was talking about marketing yourself right it's not always about marketing yes i know c plus and i know java but also i'm a mallard duck caller really what does that mean what do you do right that is also very intriguing to recruiters so adding a little bit of your personality will go a long way as well awesome awesome awesome um any other thoughts on that question yeah i would just say um i feel like people are going to start learning i know i'm like i'm reading the comments thanks for talking to the dogs from their bosses um so but from the gpa standpoint i'll give you a very real you know example you know i had a candidate that had a 25 gpa and um they worked through school they were a part of um or president of some particular organization and they were uh they didn't live on campus so all of these different things and but they had you know project experience or they had um community experience and they you know did other things now the qualifier for our program was a 30 but there was another area you know for this candidate to funnel in so all was not lost and and i really encourage students to not get hung hung up so much on the gp i mean do well in school but i you know everybody's not a you know 4.0 student everyone's not a 35 student some people are not a 3.0 student but you have those you know really strong interpersonal skills you have strong technical skills you know you may learn a different way or absorb information a different way it's about telling that right story to anthony and rachel's point marketing yourself in the right way and doing those things to make you you know even more competitive so but you can like have a super low gpa and you don't do that in school and you don't you know that's not gonna work either so um but you know you have to be wellrounded in all areas absolutely go ahead 20 seconds my two cents is that another example i don't know the young woman personally but a few years ago i saw a woman um young black woman who at an internship at spotify now again i don't know how her grades were but again back to this theme of marketing how do you position yourself right your story as jasmine spoke about maybe this young um candidate's resume or gpa wasn't high but the story in terms of what they did and a few years ago and i can share this article but this woman she applied to spotify with a playlist so she actually added spotify on twitter and said hey here's a playlist that represents my love for other black artists and why i would be a good fit for your internship so it's not always about let me get the right keywords for my resume and let me get the ets it's like how are you going to stand out and touch somebody like rachel or jasmine so so when they get on a panel they're actually mentioning you because you were so memorable right yeah anthony that's powerful because i think sometimes to the point of rachel brock sometimes the things we think are are least important are the things that catch people's eyes so if you're trying to craft a perfect resume it may not be so perfect so just just do be authentic and let your personality come through that's really powerful rachel um shared in the chat rachel you've been adding some really powerful stuff but rachel said hackathons are really great opportunities right um and i was also thinking about um if if students go to like grace hopper or any major conferences that are giving them exposure they should be adding them to their resume yes so i guess my point here is um other than things like hackathon and conferences is there any other like really interesting things that you love to see on on resumes student works um you know definitely i was you know i i was in sga i you know in a sorority all that stuff i mean it's great to be involved right like it's great to be a a member but i would love to see how you lead you know how you partner um you know what you again what you do in the community um and then you know also you know things that interest you like just in general i mean if you are a you know electrical engineering major or maybe a marketing major but you like gaming on the side you know that's also those transferable skills i i love to see that because you know i was a marketing major but i started in network engineering and so to be able to pivot you know in certain areas to you know anthony's point about being bold and marketing yourself in the right way you know to rachel's point about the hackathons all those things are really really cool and you have to you know don't saturate your resume with all that stuff don't put everything but put the most impactful the most authentic the most intentional um things on your resume yep and in 10 seconds can someone tell us what a hackathon is 10 seconds is short but it's like does someone have an ability to tell us what is a hackathon it was asked in the chat do we are we able to give so so my 10 hackathon is it's a competition where you're generally put on teams and you have some type of coding challenge to achieve in a specific time frame that's kind of a quickest exact explanation that's exactly it that's exactly it perfect rachel perfect and all of the into saying wow thank you so good so really quickly we do have one one more question on networking that i i can't wait for to ask the group but there was a question that i saw that came in that was on um like if you should be listing courses like relevant courses um how do you feel like what kind of of student or graduate should be listing under their degree um the courses that they they took is that a waste of space or is it helpful i would say no more than four i you know and they have to be very specific to the role so if you are you know um looking at a technical like a data analyst and you've yes um in advance statistics and some type of you know mathematical course though that's important um but if you're listing out you know your course catalog that's not gonna work so don't do that and i would i would just add to that that i really look at the course list thing as a filler a lot of times so in replacement of if you don't have experiences you know that can help sometimes fill up space so if you're a freshman um you know your first year and you want to focus on some of the core courses or your first year in your major and you don't have internship or specific experience or project experience yet then sometimes those key core courses um are helpful to to list out there as well yeah the only other thing that i would add is um if you're not if you're a nontechnical major um for any reason and you're interested in the tech space and so if you're doing a social science if you're doing a humanities major for instance but you're interested in going into tech you'll want to show the recruiter that you've taken classes that are related to the job so so great thank you thank you team for answering that um final question um so someone said i'm currently completing my last internship and will be graduating in the fall although i haven't completed the internship is it okay okay um is it okay to um connect with other recruiters so if you are in an internship you're not finished with your internship yet but you're thinking about other opportunities can you reach out if so how do you reach out effectively i'm sorry chelsea so you you looked away and then that second that you looked away we had an a special guest run in the background rachel sorry my twoyearold son made a break away my husband had to come and get him thank you for all the great comments everywhere this is a real live i love [Laughter] you it he wants to get in too that was really cute so that's all the um that was all the chat uh okay so question one more time say it one more time okay okay that was great because i'm like what's going on i'm missing it but the question is someone's in an internship and um they are not done with their internship but they're wanting to connect with another employer um how do you do that in an effective way like what does it look like for you to make the update and basically it's a network i think it's a networking and exposure conversation to other opportunities like how do you think that through i'll i'll start um i think it's always great to network and expand your network cast the net broadly um as long as you're not losing focus on what you're currently doing so as long as it's like a stepping stone so let's say if you intern somewhere and you are meeting all the requirements and you're doing everything you're supposed to do but you just really don't feel like you're going to be connected um ultimately with that company just based on how you feel and that happens i mean um so making connection to another company where you have some interest that's okay um it's just you're building that experience now don't do it in a way where you're you know like ghosting the other company that's why don't do that but but always be professional and just say hey i want to expand my network i want to have an informational interview um i love that because if you're not making anyone commit to anything yet you are kind of interviewing for something that you have an interest in so nothing nothing wrong with that just do it in a very professional manner yeah yeah and i definitely think as you get so if we're talking about summer internships for example as you get to the end of the summer you should be actively updating your resume one of the great things about updating your resume is doing it when the information is fresh right so honestly the end of your summer internship is the perfect time to update your resume because what you've done is fresh in your mind so it's okay to go ahead and update that and start applying um as jasmine mentioned you know be open with the current coming your intern interning with to see if there are current opportunities um you know and let them know that you're you're you know looking for future opportunities as well elsewhere and within the company yes yes and so perfect the perfect responses a few things that i wanted to highlight since we're talking the first one was there was a question from someone that said you say we should be specific to the role in which we're applying but also to diversify ourselves and show our interest this is a contradiction how can we manage the two so can someone just share or i'm happy to in a few seconds how do you balance being specific in your resume with those keywords and showing your competence but also showing your personality because that's really what the person's trying to get at what do you think i think personality can come through in a couple of different ways so it can come through in resume format or design right it can also come through in your skills or leadership activity section but being specific about the role in your skill sets should come through in you know coursework in technical skills in projects in work experience but there's always a section on leadership and community involvement and that's where you can highlight some more of your personality yep um there was a question also that i see ashley posed how many sections should you have on your resume how many bullets we all have four different answers i just would say make them even you know like you know don't let it be an odd number of bullets that's just me you know i i would say you know your education your experience your you know interest three and then the bullets under each would should be even um you don't want to put the entire job description under the specific job you're just highlighting the major points of the job or of the work or of the project you know um that's yeah that's what i would say and i would also say i i like the question but i think a better question is how are you resonating with the audience or the job that you're trying to get right um versus the number of bullets and the margin and right it's it's really okay if i want to work at a t and i want to be an analyst okay okay what do those profiles look like who do the people who work there look like what do other job descriptions right and getting context um and then general rule of thumb like keep it to our page right if jasmine is reviewing you know hundreds of resumes or working with our hiring managers right we have a few minutes to look at each resume if that right i think industry average is like six to ten seconds right so just like a youtube ad you can get you know next and but in order to stay top of mind and and and show your worth as as rachel mentioned it's being in alignment with have exactly the skill sets that you need and if you look at my linkedin for example 80 of my summary is like what i do and then there's like two sentences that say i love 90s hip hop i love nature and i love food that's it like that's true i don't have to make that up it's not right but majority of it when somebody comes to my page is like oh okay this person is a talent expert or a recruiting leader yep yep and there was a question that came in um i'm gonna attempt to try to ask it about girls who code like should you be putting that on your resume where do you put it absolutely you put it what do you mean girls who codes a global amazing network of the future leaders well the leaders of this world right [Laughter] better put girls who code but also on linkedin you can put it as well you can put it um there's the at the linkedin has a um organizational affiliation category that's at the bottom it's not towards the top but you can put organizations that you belong to of course girls who code has a company page on linkedin so you can add it and then add alumni okay so so please add that on um so panelists we are getting towards the end and i want you all um first of all thank you what a brilliant dynamic group of leaders thank you so much can you give like a word of wisdom to close us out um we'll start um from jasmine and work our way to anthony can you just share one um powerful take away for today for our scholars um yeah so nobody knows you better than you right nobody can tell your story better than you can and so um the ability to um weave your authenticity and your impact and your knowledge is just a powerful story to tell and you know the time the future is female no shade all good i would say if i just if i had to like give advice that i wanted to hear years ago and that i'm still implementing is two things one is uh you can jay shetty uh he's a kind of like a spiritual teacher i followed and read some of his books and he had a quote and he said um you can only take the world as far as you've traveled internally which lauryn hill also said you know how you're going to win if you ain't right with it so it's like also all of what we don't don't expect to take everything we said today and just go apply it and it just work tomorrow right like this is a journey be kind to yourself um and then the the other thing i would say is be of service um the reason that i'm on this panel the reason i've gotten so many opportunities is because i've gone out of my way to help others so yes i know it's a global pandemic you know you're looking for internships or you're changing jobs or maybe even lost a job but always be thinking about how you can add value to someone else and i promise you like later down in your career like those things start to come back tenfold when you least expect them um yeah be of service and uh go within rachel uh oh you're on beauty yes oh i got it so and there's my son again which is also the be yourself which sometimes is with a kid um so sorry no you're fine um okay so my my really would be be yourself right is honestly number one be who you are right um and that's kind of an ode to everything that jasmine was saying be yourself but i think the bigger thing sometimes is don't overthink it um i know you guys are probably literally like trying to take notes and everything we're saying they're like okay you need this in this section this and this okay only one page like but don't don't overthink it and i think anthony mentioned at one point like you have time to learn all these things like to focus on one thing at a time um this these skills they come with time like i said you're going to iterate a million times on your resume so don't put so much pressure on yourself right um that it's stressing yourself out or you're feeling like you're not succeeding right i would say give yourself grace if anything um it's something that you have to continuously tell yourself throughout your career you know you'll continuously tell yourself is give yourself grace that's looking at that man so give yourself grace be yourself don't overthink it yes turning into churches and closing it down exactly it's so funny because rachel took every ever took the what i was going to say give yourself grace so we're all we're all this this panelist team is is connected and um we're preparing to close out with our five minutes that's left um everybody who came today made time in the summer um you know it's almost eight o'clock on the east coast uh to be here to get this information to connect we're
