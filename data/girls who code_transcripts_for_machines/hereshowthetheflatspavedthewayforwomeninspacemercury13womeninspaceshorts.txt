before Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldren landed on the moon 13 women known as the flats trained to become astronauts for America's first human space flight program only to have the group disbanded before they could even take off when the Space Race began in 1957 the US began the process of hiring astronauts to eventually fly to space how do you hire for a position that no one has ever held so NASA asked Dr William lovely to develop physical and mental tests to ensure that astronauts will be able to handle the rigors of space travel he decided to conduct his on test in secret but on female candidates the women who qualified were all seriously accomplished pilots and became known as the first lady astronaut trainees or flats and later as the Mercury 13 government would not allow lovely to use military equipment to test women NASA had zero intention on sending them to space without that Final Phase the flats program was cancelled but their legacy lives on in Sally Ride May Json and so many other women working at Nasa today
