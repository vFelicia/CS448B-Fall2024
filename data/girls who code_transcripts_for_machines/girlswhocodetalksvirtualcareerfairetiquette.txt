us and to warm things up we're going to do an icebreaker and so get ready for those of you that are dialed in and viewing with us we are going to send you a nice little icebreaker question and so just keep alert because you'll have about 30 seconds to um to get that answered and you'll see it pop up on your screen and just respond and we'll be able to keep you involved in our conversation okay so let's start with the ice breaker warm up and our ice creaker question for our panelists is how did you secure your first internship or job and i'd like to um have keisha get us started with that sure would love to so i started i actually started with ge straight out of college uh so when i started with ge i entered into their information management leadership program but they also had an internship program for those that were in college at that time i was not aware of it so when i was in high school i proactively was looking for different internship programs and i connected with inroads and rose is a nonforprofit um organization that's focused mainly on africanamericans brown and and uh and black students with high academic achievements connecting them with corporations so i actually did an internship program within rhodes where i interned with a telephone company at that time 9x out of new york and that helped prepared me for a career fair that i went to specifically where ge was there and allowed me to start the uh the leadership program with ge so i would say you know really just looking at various internship programs that most companies have like general electric as well as nonprofit organizations that's amazing keisha and what's most interesting is that my first in internship withdrew inroads and uh we must have been cut from the same cloth because my spirit was always kind of look for the things that are going to differentiate you and so it helps you get that early access to a corporate environment you know really develop your network early on and um i'm just i think it was a really good program that's still operational today so it's so great to see both you and i now where we are having both started off at inroads absolutely um and so amazing and uh such a small world all right so let's check in with our panelists did you hopefully you guys got your questions and we want to pull you to see if you've been part of any virtual career fairs so many of you have hopefully been there so have you attended a virtual career fair for the many of you that are out there you should have your question up go ahead and answer yes or no okay awesome well while we have our um esteemed viewers answering that question let's go ahead and um and get some more panelists so um magalie what about you so my first internship was a little bit different i was really involved in baja essays so baja is a offroad um you know allterrain vehicle right and i was just intrigued at you know how you know as a student right i could contribute to a project like that especially because i started as a freshman it was just you know one week you know right fresh in college right and i was exposed to the opportunity to join this team and i said you know why what why not right at the same time i was also very uh engaged with the society of hispanic professional engineers chip and they really motivated us right but particularly myself and really you know they provided some good resources on how to get you ready especially for that first job fair right um and you know just having that confidence and having that additional experience right and having some good examples of working with you know uh different teams you know working uh in in technology right application as well as you know with all the soft skills and the preparation from you know the student association i was able to go you know very confident and walk into that first job fair talk to a lot of recruiters right and as soon as i saw you know my current company actually gm i was like i need to talk to those recruiters right um so i had the opportunity to talk to a few of them ask questions you know i i can't prepare you know with uh already an understanding of the type of technology and product that they work on right uh so it was a really engaging uh you know conversation and after that you know i just went through the process of interviews and so on and i got my dream job so it was very very rewarding experience that sounds amazing um and i think that nowadays we have to continue to get that get the skills get that prework be so we can dive right into an environment and be ready to perform and so um really inspiring story i'm sure for everyone to hear okay so it looks like everybody showed up at this this presentation at the right time because 75 percent of you said that you have not joined a virtual career fair so um with the things that you guys are hearing from us so in terms of what types of organizations you should be looking at as well as the things you'll hear to learn about how to navigate will hopefully be very important for you and help you in your journey so now let's go over to jill what about you how you know what what did you do to secure your first internship or job and we may still be waiting on jill i mean we are in the beauty of technology so sometimes it will work sometimes it will not so even so jill may be on later and we can well let's go ahead and keep going so one of the things that's interesting in a virtual career fair so as you guys can see you will walk into a virtual environment and you have to show up ready right and you know you need to be professional so if there are video conferences you should dressed appropriately you should look appropriately one of the guiding principles that people often give inside of accenture is you almost have to elevate your energy level 50 percent more than what what you would because you're on camera right and so sometimes it cut even though you may feel like you're being energized you may come across as low energy so um so for all of our panelists we're going to stay high energy for you just like we're sitting in our career fair as we kind of go through the first set of our questions so a couple of things a number of the viewers keisha and magalie said that they have anxiety about career fairs especially when they've just entered college and have not really attended a career in person and you saw that 75 have not been part of a career fair or a virtual one so they have questions like what do you wear should you have your resume right even a virtual resume on hand to upload and what does the format need to be and most important what about body language because when you are in a physical career fair you can read the room you can navigate you can do eye contact and really get a feel for the environment so how do you navigate those things in a virtual setting so the first question of tonight that we we want to get out there is what should candidates expect when attending a virtual career fair and how best do they right now start preparing for the experience and so keisha let's um go to you first yeah you know i tell all candidates virtual or in person uh you dress for the role uh you dress as though you're going to be interviewed uh so specifically because you're on camera i say be fully dressed you never know when you have to stand up if you're bending over to pick up something you want to make sure you are fully dressed for for that for that interview i look at a career for you as an interview um and and that's what i would tell you to walk in expecting that at any given moment that employer on the other side of that camera could actually hire you for the job and i had situations like that while i was in college it wasn't virtual but it was the same in which you know i came dressed in my blue suits with my white shirt underneath uh in preparation for an interview and i actually got two job offers uh during that time i didn't take any of those roles it wasn't the right fit for me but you know you have to expect that you can you know be hired on the spot uh for sure and then i would say to you know be prepared in a virtual setting um as though you are you know meeting with that person face to face meaning you know keep make sure you stay focused with the camera so you're in the middle of of the screen make sure that you're you have the right body language uh you constantly have a smile on your face uh it just shows that you're pleasant upbeat i think that's important as much as your true self can come across your true personality of who you are absolutely bring that forward don't suppress who you are people eventually will see that can see if you're uh putting on a front or a falsehood of any nature so you know be your authentic self come true to who you are um as you are meeting someone virtually uh for sure and then i would say to uh understand who's on the other side of the camera right so in those virtual settings you're typically going to get one person at a time or one person in a square so get a good feeling of who's on the other side of the camera where they're located um how they represent the company in terms of their title and the role that they play in the organization as much as you're prepared with understanding who the interviewers are and who the the companies are on the other side i think that would help you as well that's really good advice and i think that at the end of the day this is you have one shot right and um even if it's a virtual shot you have to make it count and so that you would normally do that inroads helped us do um we we take those same steps right as we're entering into this fair and it's funny i can see some of the questions um popping up about at least my virtual background and it's funny because um it's not fake and it is a um a jpeg file right that you can just add into zoom and so i just wanted to bring up a point that if you are at home where you cannot be in a professional space it's a perfect opportunity to differentiate yourself right to find a background on the internet that's an office space that um is a nice professional bookcase or you know home office atmosphere and it will just help you you know stand out and keep the professional appearance alongside of everything else that you're doing so keep those comments going though it's really good to see and and we can respond to those things as well so magalie what about you what what um do you want to share with our audience about preparing for a virtual career fair what can they expect when they walk in the room what's going to be significantly different from a physical fare no that's that's that's great and you know great insight from you to you know keisha and tracy um so i want to talk more about you know when you're actually there ready to click that link right and and and join the conversation right so um many universities and many companies may utilize different systems right and platforms so some things may be applicable some things may be a little bit different from you know one session to the other but what's most important is you know once you click in you're gonna find you know a variety of rooms or different companies right with links that you can click access right sometimes you may be greeted by just one recruiter right that is completely dedicated to you but sometimes you may be expect to join a conversation that is already happening right um so um with that in mind uh something that i always you know advise and encourage you know all of the candidates to have ready is a good elevator pitch right and and now more important than ever right because we're trying to you know to create that first impression virtually right um and to me a good um you know elevator pitch includes you know who i am what what i'm doing right um and then um what what what i'm looking for right so with that you know i'm ali soto arsen i am the manager for the early career programs at general motors and let's say that at that time i'm looking for leadership roles in an area with controls integration within your company right another thing that um i'm also you know and and something that i cannot stress enough you know you don't have to go into creating something that is very long you know just you know keep it simple right um and just you know if you have a recruiter that greets you you know be prompt you know be confident right and engage in good conversation from there the conversation takes over right and you know come prepare with you know some questions regarding the company some good things that you can ask is about the company vision the mission the values the technology the products and even in this unprecedented times sometimes it's good to ask uh you know about you know the company's response to the you know present situation about covet right and the involvement with the community so just you know questions that will help you understand you know how your skill set and experience aligns to to to the company but at the same time you know will you be a good cultural fit right for for for that company and you know the conversation and the networking opportunities you know that you create um you know as part of participating in events like this can really you know continue throughout the years right and and i can tell you that i just crossed you know uh conversations in in an event at the university with you know people that i talk to them as recruiters now and here i am you know representing general motors right and and it was just you know a great experience so you know make the most of it come prepare you know do your research understand the company you know and even if you don't know the company that's good too right because this is the opportunity for you to get to know the type of opportunities that they you know are offering and learn more about what they do so yep that's fantastic advice okay so now that we know a little bit about the virtual career fair format we know that that unlike a physical fair attendees just have a finite amount of time right to get in get the information talk with a recruiter and then make an impression so um for viewers this is the time to really listen in to what keisha and magali are going to share about the hiring process right and what companies are looking for when they have that five minutes with you so um you know one of the things that i always struggled with when i was walking into a physical career fair was what what am i gonna say so to your point cause you're about elevator pitch you know what am i gonna say what two questions can i ask right and then how do i get the information i need to make sure that that company is a fit for me and that i'm a fit for the company right so that's the kind of prep that that you should be doing when whether you're in a virtual or a physical environment so we're going to get the audience involved again and do another polling question so for our viewers i want you to respond to whether you've ever prepared a list of questions to ask potential employers so give us a sense of whether you've done that or not so take a second to fill out that poll for us awesome and then while the poll is uh is going on ladies i will get your expertise on a different area so what questions should job seekers ask to help them stand out so again as they're doing that prep that one or two questions that they have to get out in that five minutes what questions should they steer to and then what questions are taboo that you really don't want to ask so um magali maybe we start with you um this time um share share your wisdom on this area for us sure so questions to ask to stand out uh will be you know just going back to what i've been mentioning about you know making your research questions that you first and foremost feel comfortable right because the recruiter may come back with another question right why are you asking about this or you know why why are you so interested in this topic so you know as part of your research you know we talk about you know learning about the company what do they do you know their mission their goal goals their behaviors their products and their technology especially if you have you know some particular skills right or a very unique skill set um you know questions that are related to that that will give you the opportunity to you know for you to continue the conversation oh yes i'm familiar with that technology um because you know i have the opportunity to implement it or yes i know that language right because it's something that i use in a daytoday basis in order to solve problems right so those will be the things that you know i highly encourage you you know to engage in conversation because you know the conversation keeps rolling and that's exactly what you want to do right or you're talking to a recruiter things to not ask you know as part of that you know first impression i will say salary and salary is one that you know we understand you know that this opportunity you know you're interested not only because of the experience that you're gonna gain but also you know let's be realistic right in this day and age these opportunities come with a salary that help you know the students you know throughout their um you know education right um but for this is not exactly the the best time to talk about that right please consider that you know um if you you know if the recruiter believes that you're a good fit for the company there's going to be many steps that you will have to follow whether those are you know some additional screening by other members of the company along with interviews right and you will have more than plenty of opportunity to talk about those things that's great advice so hopefully everybody's taking notes that is um those are some important things to consider what do you think keisha yeah i'll add to that i'll say that in addition you know always make sure you're asking questions around professional development you're coming new into an organization you always want to understand how can you grow how can you be able to to manage your career throughout this organization and this company so really getting a feel for you know what professional development what career paths exist today um it just gives you a sense as hey can you fit in does this have a path that you're comfortable with i would say some questions to avoid is absolutely compensation and benefit questions stay far far away from you know do they have tuition reimbursement you know would they allow you to go back to school you want to stay far away from that you absolutely want to keep your com your questions tied to really direct around the culture of the business uh specific to you know growth opportunity uh really tied to where the company's going to say hey do you believe in their vision do you believe in a growth strategy i think that's important to understand coming in but i think the development just just really focused on hey you're not where you exactly see yourself going you have aspiration to grow in your career you want to be with a company that's really focused on helping to grow and nurture their employees so as much as you can pull that out of an interview i think that that's the best focus that is awesome advice kisha thank you for sharing that and it looks like jill is joining us uh via the phone we pulled her in you've heard the question but we're talking about the questions you should ask and the questions you shouldn't ask when you have that that coveted five minutes with a recruiter on a virtual career fair any wisdom to i appreciate share patience as i try to get in um it's you know unprecedented times right now in this virtual channel and we're all dealing with technology challenges so um real life right now um in terms the obvious questions about the company the opportunity would have but really trying to focus on tying it into um asking about the company's culture asking about specific opportunities and how they relate to your interest um trying to make it as personal personable as possible that's that's awesome and i think jill you touched on an important point um definitely steer away from the obvious and then you know to add on to this quickly because we're unprecedented times companies are looking for people that are creative that are agile that are flexible right willing to do kind of whatever it takes and so framing questions to give insight into that part of your personality or that how that matches with that company's core values or the things that they're focused on doing over the next five to ten years um are also good kind of thoughtprovoking ways to to bring about a question that helps you bring about a good impression right to those recruiters so thanks joe and so since we have you we'll have you tap into the next question to give you some more air time so we not only have students that are entry level or coming out of college but we sometimes get students who are at the experience level so whether they're in a graduate school or they've got five years under their belt and so virtual career fairs can be a really good opportunity to learn about the skills for certain roles and the skills that are transferable right so one of the questions i want to get your insight on is what type of technical and nontechnical skills should recent graduates highlight during conversations to compete with those experienced candidates that are showing up for the same type of job so um so again you know we we've got people with maybe five ten years of experience competing for jobs with people that may just be coming out of school so what type of technical nontechnical skills will help our candidates out of college stand out yeah i mean right now on is um rapidly um the area that we focused just six months ago it's very different and right now we're really looking for a lot of companies are really focusing on individuals who can show that they have transformation skills that they're agile that they are creative and they work differently and you can show that in terms of how you leverage technology with platforms and what different skills you leverage but also in terms of just general business skills um it's the skills that are valued right now are are very different and it's a unique opportunity for us to showcase how we are being innovative how we're very transformative how we're disrupting and taking advantage of the time right now to demonstrate new things right now love that wisdom so for those of you that are on the the call and had was unable to hear jill she gave some very good wisdom on transformation skills innovation general business skills i mean we all have done things over the summer or you know within your your families that kind of bring about just general business acumen and then digital like everything is digital right so um so those are some good tips anything else keisha you want to add on to that that may be differentiators yeah i would say you know in this fast moving environment as much as you can share your ability to adapt to change and being very adaptable and flexible i think a lot of companies are looking for individuals that can move in a very fastpaced environment that can shift and be able to pivot um and change directions where they feel is needed i think as much as you can be able to demonstrate that in your communication skills um during those types of interviews i think that that kind of helps you you know stand above the rest for sure beautiful okay and so for our viewers thank you for filling out that poll question so it looks like 65 percent of you are type a you prepare the questions ahead of time so hopefully this segment has given you a chance to maybe put some things on your list and then take some things off your list that you normally would go into the career fair to do so now i want to take us into a really exciting q a and you know there were lots of you that that had questions and so we want to honor that by being able to answer them kind of live on the call so the first question that came up was as follows as an international student i'm concerned that it'll be harder to land an internship or job when i graduate because of the unemployment rate and of course the current political climate does it make sense for me to attend a virtual career fair and if so should i disclose that i need a visa during my conversations and so um i think that that's a very important question and of course with the political climate this is a hot topic so magali what what advice would you give to this international student on how to approach that no thank you and actually you know because i i managed you know uh the rotational program as well as the internship program for engineering in gm i get this question a lot of times in linking so uh any of you that would like to connect there feel free to find me but um yes uh my recommendation is to still participate you know there are many many many companies that will be there and you know different companies have different requirements as well even functions in the same company from one organization to the other may have different requirements so yes please participate you know do engage in those opportunities even if that company that you really want to work for doesn't have the opportunity now but you have the opportunity to network with a recruiter it can be a connection that can help you you know tremendously in the future if the opportunity do arise now um as part of that research very important piece of you know all of this process right some of the requisitions already include you know and those are the job postings in the career careers website already includes some language regarding that um but you know my to me integrity you know is number one behavior right and yeah and that's also you know what i'm expecting of the candidates right so you know as you're part of those conversations you know ask right if there's the opportunity uh or the different opportunities that your interests that do allow for students that still require sponsorship and you may be surprised you know there are companies there that you know do offer those opportunities agree and um transparency trust honesty you know those are things that are are deal breakers right out of the gate if um you're not upfront and honest um so thank you for um for sharing that perspective because it's important and i love your point around check the job description up front because it may give you those details without you even having to ask the question so keep in on this conversation too yeah i'll add one more thing i would say too to recognize that many of our companies are global right so even if you know total transparency you you are very clear up front in terms of what your mobility looks like recognize that if that job may not be the right job that these companies are extremely global and they may be an opportunity even in your current location and i think too given our current covet situation coming out of covet a lot of companies are understanding that employees can be even more productive working from home so not being able to be physically at a location is no longer a hinder or barrier in terms of being able to work in in many institutions these days and for many roles right so just keep that in mind and be very open to that at any given time awesome and joe feel free to jump into the conversation because i mean obviously h1b l1s like you know those are just hot topics and some company sponsors or some don't right so i can i feel for the person to ask this question because it's you know it's really do i show up and how competitive is it really you know so maybe you can give some wisdom um on one encouragement to show up and what that competition is really like i have seen too many instances where students haven't disposed it and you know they get an offer at the end of their college years or their junior year of college a year later when they're ready to start two days before they're ready to start all of a sudden they're no longer um the information comes out and they've wasted that time yeah and and that's an important point right because at the end of the day companies companies talk right and you want to kind of keep putting your foot forward because even if it's not a fit for this year it may be a fit for next year and so remember at the beginning we talked about first impression as your best impression first impression is your most important that transparency is key and then the second thing i would just add is a virtual career fair is an opera a great opportunity for you to spend your time so versus having to get in a car drive park you know you know go to a big ballroom right where you're spending five hours you have a chance to just log into your computer pop on and learn about different companies which may help you target where eventually you want to to be right so my my spirit is why not join and get all the information you can and then also ask those companies what programs they have in place to help with work payment permits visa and h1b sponsorships so much easier that's at least a benefit of cobit right much easier to do things virtually than physically and a good use of time so uh so hopefully that was helpful uh for for h1bs and we're all ex kind of experts in this area so if you want some additional followup we'd be happy to to talk with you offline as well so let's go to our the second question that we we heard from our audience members so it's really good one how should we manage our time in the fair should we wait to speak with companies that have roles that interest us most should we speak with multiple companies to explore or speak to companies that have shown interest in the past so this is really getting back to that i really have 10 minutes right to do my thing while i'm in the fair how do i balance my time and make the best use of it so keisha what are your thoughts on that i say be very targeted um especially if you have a clear understanding of where you want to go what company you want to be a part of and what job you want to do right i think if you have a very clear understanding be very targeted and where you want to spend your time so it's the most meaningful for you you get the most out of it as well as you'll be able to provide better insights to to the interviewer on the other side of the table right so on the other side of the camera for sure so i think be very targeted be very very prescriptive and where you want to spend your time now if you're very unclear on where you want to go what role you want if you want to stay very technical if you want to be kind of more closer to the business side of the house and i think then be a little bit more broad right really get an understanding for what's out there what companies are doing today what roles are available what direction they're heading but it's more of an information gathering for you um so that you can better help you know structure kind of what you're thinking about next right so i think it really just depends on the individual i don't think there's one that's better than the other it's really what you're trying to gain out of the experience as well as what what you want to put forth in front of uh in front of these individuals thank you wise and moggly what do you what do you have after that so my own experience what i used to do i used to have a lace you know because you can you know through your you know uh educational institution right your university or the high school you know they are able to provide you know what are the the least of the companies that are participating i used to divide the list in three buckets the ones that i know and those are my dream companies right and then the ones that are very close to that and then the ones that i'm just curious about right so i will prioritize those that i know that i that that i'm really you know looking for that opportunity to happen and then go down the list right and that's the best way that i was able to manage the time right because in reality is you know there's a limit of time you know we would love to stay there talking to all of you as long as we will like write but the reality is that you know we have we want to provide an uh a fair you know opportunity to all of the candidates that are there right uh so um you know just um come prepared you know like we have been mentioning you know and and and ask questions also be openminded um something that particularly another experience from gm itself right a lot of of students especially in the uh electrical software you know coding side they don't know that they can actually work on the product side right and it's not until they talk to the recruiters they talk to the company representatives that are there that they have the opportunity to learn about all of the technology transformation that is happening in the company right in terms of you know autonomous vehicles mobility connectivity that go far beyond just making you know cars which is what you know pretty much everybody knows general motors for so you know it is a great opportunity to engage in that type of conversation and really learn what other opportunities are out there that perhaps you don't even know about so yeah great opportunity awesome i like the list right this is the the b list the c list the other piece of wisdom i guess we'll put out there i mean and so you there are lots of virtual career fair platforms you know some there's virtual career days i think there's v fairs some companies like amazon have developed their own you know interface when you enter the job fair you actually sometimes have an opportunity to schedule your interview because remember instead of standing in line you actually schedule to have a chat with somebody so if you're if you have your a list up you know go and schedule those chats first right and then prioritize the rest but the the wisdom pieces don't over tax yourself right because you know just think about the companies the companies are probably talking to 50 to 100 plus people in a fair and so you want to save your energy your questions for those that you really want to go after hard so in terms of prioritization just keep that in mind like again it's not it's not a standing in line thing but a getting in line thing and using your calendaring to make sure that you um get the prioritization right jill did you have anything else to add around how to spend the time in the say fair um take advantage of as much time as available you know to really get to know other companies not you don't know about opportunities and i really liked your comment about not over taxing though your schedule um building time um assuming that some of your conversations are gonna run long um so that you're not running from recruiter to that's the perfect if you take nothing away from the career fair champ chat we've had today having meaningful conversations is most important right it's quality over quantity and so that kind of brings us into another great question which is how do you keep the conversation going after the fair is done without feeling like you're overly intrusive so this is an important this is like a dance right you want to be seen but but not be seen in a way that it it impedes upon your ability to get hired so keisha what what do you have for our audience members on how after the failure is over how do you stay connected so you know i i always say is especially during the time that you're in the virtual affair is make sure the individual's name you write their name down um sometimes uh most companies are likely to give you an email address for you to continue to follow up with them but take advantage of the network that we have out there which is linkedin and you go out and you connect with them on linkedin uh it'll be top of mind they would have known they would have just spoken to you in that college fair um and would be able to to accept the uh the invite right so take advantage of the social media platform that we have that helps you to maintain those relationships and and make sure you connect with them on linkedin and then don't you know you know sometimes you set up you you go and you connect on linkedin and then it becomes almost like you're you're constantly pinging and stalking and connecting with that individual you know i think just you know sharing the fact that you met them during this college fear and specifically a nugget that you took from the conversation that would kind of resonate with that person as we mentioned earlier they would have talked to 50 people that day right so what is that one thing that you can kind of bring up from the conversation that they will remember that will keep your name and your image top of mind to that individual for sure so i would encourage using you know our social media site for professional networks which is linkedin that's that's awesome yep and linkedin is it's great right and allows you to track the whole conversation and and stay in touch michaeli what's your best tip for it you know ge and i know someone typed what is what is general motors actually so gm is general motors for those who were wondering as a professional at general motors what is a candidate going to do to stand out with you after the fair what would they do to keep your attention yep perfect let me let me give you an example that just happened this week so um i was um you know facilitating uh a couple of um virtual you know webinar seminars right and uh it one of them was a student guide to virtual recruiting um and you know just sharing some tips and things to do right and i actually had uh one and this is just resonating to you know what keisha just shared one of the students actually reached out to me you know with uh through linking with um the um you know the request you know to add to the network and in his uh message he said uh you know um so and so we met here right he provided all of those details and he said one of the tips that you mentioned you know i will have never thought about that and it was just you know um to set up your voicemail right because if you're participating in that virtual career fair right or whatever the interaction that happens you know with those recruiters um you know it is very important that they have a way and the means to leave you you know a message if they cannot contact you so he put that as part of you know his message to me and i can tell you i will never forget that name because it was something that connected to me you know and also you know that uh him sharing how beneficial even though it was just that you know small tip that small advice right is something that will always make me remember his name right so little things like that you know just make sure that you know they are unique uh but they also you know uh highlight uh part of the conversation that you have with the recruiter and i think that's such an important point because remember you're virtual and so you know you you now have a chance to have a piece of paper and just write it down right so as you're talking to someone and you're making a connection you know whether it's the school that maybe you guys went to together an organization you're passionate about an area where you've given back those are great connectors when you're reaching back out in linkedin or an email so that that person remembers you right so um so remember to do that be very proactive and um it's not i mean it's about creating human connection right so um i i think that's an excellent point jill what about you something from your conversation um and really yes so they're you're standing out from one of the countless people they met during that um i'd say it's also important to connect with them as soon as possible after the event um memories are short um and sometimes you know somebody waits a couple of days at that point a lot of times um i know both for virtual conferences as well as personal conferences the people who stand out for people almost immediately and they build in time into their schedule during the day so they can actually reach out to people saying hey i had a great conversation we talked about xyz i would love to talk to you harder about abc awesome that's great okay so we have time we we're at seven
