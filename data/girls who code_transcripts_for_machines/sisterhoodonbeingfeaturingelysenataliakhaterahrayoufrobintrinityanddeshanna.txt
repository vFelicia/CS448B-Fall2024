i began using social media around sophomore year of high school and was elated to explore a new world full of possible friends myspace.com was my social media drug of choice i finally felt allowed to be my true weird self in 2010 i received a message from a girl who had great style and a colorful custom coded profile just like mine the message was simple in red hey i like your style i'm starting a group for cool girls and wanted to know if you wanted to be friends i thought to myself what a bold move and immediately responded with yes let's meet in soho next week we clicked instantly and walked around chatting and discussing life in brooklyn we both came from similar upbringings and we're the youngest of three children living in caribbean households throughout our friendship which is now approaching the 10year mark we've been each other support systems being open within our friendship has led to my work with mental health awareness and the creation of sad girls club a space for women to speak freely about their mental health having someone who you can share your darkest moments is therapeutic and the space to be open with myself through friendship has taught me the power of vulnerability i always knew that i wanted to make an impact and i thought i had it all figured out i would become a nurse and make a difference in people's lives after a few months i realized that focus wasn't making me happy and i began to explore other options when i discovered computer programming it was love at first sight i loved the infinite number of ways technology could change one person's life or even millions of lives i finally felt excited but when i got into the software engineering program in my school i was intimidated by the fact that most of my classmates were boys who seemed like they knew what they were doing i had to remind myself that i was just entering the field learning how to walk when the boys already learned how to run thankfully a teacher introduced me to girls who code suddenly i found myself learning new skills and more about myself than i ever thought i would i found my voice and how to finally use technology to make an impact on people's lives most importantly i found a family a sisterhood a bond that shared with all girls who love to code two years ago my cousin and i were waiting in the drivethrough of a shawarma restaurant in saudi arabia and while we were waiting for food began talking about our aspirations and what we wanted to do in the future i remember telling her i wanted to be the first female foreign minister of saudi arabia and she wanted to be an engineer both industries that were almost exclusively male dominated this was two years ago before any of the changes in saudi arabia had happened such as the driving ban being lifted and more women being encouraged to enter the work field our conversations were reflecting the obstacles that we'd have to face not because we would not be qualified but just because we were women she might not remember this moment but i will always remember what she said to support me she said you have to work twice as hard but reaching your goal will be twice as sweet at this moment sisterhood seemed to be the most present this simple dialogue strengthened our bond and made us feel both more empowered i now realize although it might not be as overt sisterhood is in every micro interaction i have with all the wonderful female figures in my life i was born a storyteller as an indigenous woman i was raised amongst the stars bright lights billions of years formed into oral histories stories about my past my present my future stories about my family our history on why we bead on why we fish why the sun shines why the birds sing so i take in knowledge more readily not in abstract presentations or during lectures of the right way but when it is woven into a tapestry of experiences and stories by the people around me my generation's experiences will be passed this way too we will talk about how we built entire cities by stacking zeros and ones how we use strings of letters to connect populations across land masses of how i became a member of a sisterhood so strong that distance and physical presence were of no matter and about how learning a simple skill and sharing that with others changed my own life so dramatically in my childhood my brother and i were always partnered in playing video game when we got older i followed my interested in video game and pursued a bachelor degree in computer science from university my brother he worked with us special force and afghan commandos when he come home he would tell me stories of how brave the afghan commandos were and about the dangers they face around the same time i discovered kotone spy which gives girls in afghanistan a chance to learn computer coding and game development for our efirst hackathon we were tasked to address a problem in our community and present the solution inspired by one of my brother's stories i decided to increase people's awareness of the bravery of our commandos together with my teammates as he knows that kia nargis samiro and me would create the game fight against opium in the game afghan soldiers destroy opium fields and grow saffron instead of opium with the game we hope to create cultural change in the attitudes behaviors and future of the region sisterhood in our team has enabled us to work together have an exchange of thoughts motivations and also make the greatest change in our communities by helping one another our goal as afghan gay school code is to create games that serve and help our homeland to help build afghanistan 2.0 by afghan girls court i wasn't sure i could be a mother then i found out i was pregnant and once trinity was born and i saw her tiny cute face i knew at that moment i'd always have her back by three trinity told me she wasn't a boy but a girl at first i wasn't sure what to do and there were no stories about young trans kids out there but when i saw her struggling to live with someone she never was i knew it was time to prove exactly what i promised when i first held her i promise to always have her back and love her no matter what i'd always be there trinity and i have been a teen which is our version of sisterhood but i have to say is trinity's mom she's my community and my heart it makes me laugh a lot and i work hard to be her community and advocate for us being a sisterhood means we can now uplift others with our story i can share what it has been like and continues to be like as mom to a trans child and i can share my story of being a happy and thriving black trans girl being a sisterhood means facing our fears together and living life with love affirmation and togetherness always a sisterhood we say this part together always a sisterhood
