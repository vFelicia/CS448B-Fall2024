women only make up 26% of the workforce in Tech which is crazy considering we make up half of the world's population hi I'm Lauren Wong I'm an alumni advisory council member at girls who code an employee at Enterprise Computing Solutions and it consultancy firm and the founder of nice for what a community organization dedicated to providing free resources to victims and survivors of sexual violence I'm surrounded by so many strong and beautiful women who have helped me find success remind me to remain confident and stay true to who I am at my first coding boot camp when I was 13 or 14 we did an icebreaker where the question for everyone else in my group was what's your favorite video game and the question I got was what's your favorite store to shop at at the mall no bad intentions behind the question switch but this is my first taste of seeing how important it was to have women represented within Tech girls can do whatever boys can do
