hi my name is Emily moss I'm the director of student recruitment for girls who code campus today we're going to talk a little bit about our newest summer program a series of twoweek courses for girls ages 10 to 18 we're going to talk a little bit about the organization girls who code we're gonna give an overview of campus we'll need some of our girls and we'll talk about how to apply so the mission and history of grosu code is pretty simple girls who code programs work to inspire educate and equip grows with the computing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities our vision is to reach gender parity in computing and technology sectors we're going to talk a little bit about what that means there are about 500,000 open jobs in computing right now but only 40,000 computer science graduates every year and what that means is that there's a whole host of opportunities for girls that are competitive and ambitious and creative and want to take those jobs and when we talk about jobs in this field yes there are software development jobs yes there are coding jobs but it's also broader 21st century skills around collaboration critical thinking computational thinking and all of the skills adjacent to computer science like product management and project management and user experience design so the real big issue that we try to tackle at gross with code is the percentage of women in the computing workforce and you might think that this is a number that goes up but actually historically over the last 20 years it's been going down in 1995 it was 37% but today it's only 24% why do you think that is there's a couple of really interesting reasons that we've seen that number go down one of them is sort of the rise of video games and the ways that kids get excited about coding when they're young which leads them to careers in computer science and studying computer science at school and since a lot of computer games are marketed and targeted at boys we've seen girls not starting quite as young but another piece of it is around role models and there's this great saying you can't be what you can't see and girls right now are looking up at leader in the tech industry and they're not seeing women that look like that and they're not seeing role models and inspiring figures so if you think about when that started you think about the tech leaders of today they were the the early the early leaders in the field and girls now don't have anyone to look up to so what are we trying to do we are trying to fill this pipeline when you think about why there are not very many girls in tech and women in tech there's a million different places on that pipeline that we start to go wrong it's early stuff about who gets which toys and how programs and toys are marketed to kids in stuff that happens in high school about girls not wanting to be the only girl in a computer science class or club it's things that happen in college about how courses are structured and who's recruited into what major it happened later on in life when girls who are working in the field women who are working in the field don't see themselves getting promoted or hired or trained and there's sort of a hostile work environment so this is called the pipeline and we look at a lot of different ways that we can adjust that and so where girls who code steps in is middle school and high school girls and we are trying to fill that early stage in the pipeline so that by the time cross gets of college there's lots of them in the classrooms they don't feel like the only one they have friends and peers and they have lots of role models so you can see here that over the last five years we've had forty thousand girls go through our programs so speaking of our programs what do we have to offer we have our clubs program that is during the school year it's nationwide it's a free program and school of libraries and community centers were organized after school and weekends sort of a low commitment once or twice a week dip your toe in get excited meet other girls and then at the bottom in the green you'll see our sort of intensive summer immersion program this is just for eleventh and twelfth grade it's about getting ready for college thinking about whether computer science could be a major or minor for you and it's seven weeks long so it fills up your whole summer in the middle this is our new program this is what we're talking about today it's gross will code campus this is for six to 12th grade so a nice big age range we're in select cities and it's only two weeks long some of the feedback we got about our summer immersion program is that lots of kids although they're excited about gross who code can't come to seven weeks so what we've done is created two week courses that dive deep on exciting new topics our stuff is working over the last five years in the history of grocery code we always ask our girls you know are you considering study in computer science you consider majoring or minoring in a closely related field and the numbers are really strong now our program is only five years old so our oldest students are in college now but we are seeing them in computer science courses picking this major and minor or even being involved in computer societies women in computing groups leading other girls into computer science and really growing that pipeline so what is campus this is our newest program it's in this summer 2018 here we go I'm going to play this little video from our tiny pilot program last year so you can see with the girls themselves so that's a little bit from our test pilot last year where we worked on our curriculum hired amazing instructors and made sure that campus was going to be a great program this summer of 2018 we've expanded here are the basics about campus campuses beginner and advanced coding courses for middle and high school girls in a condensed 2week timeline we really want this to be available to gross who also want to pursue music or sports or other exciting summer camps maybe travel with their family or work so the sort of four big things here is you are going to learn computer science fundamentals and dive deep on really exciting new topics we're going to talk about our courses in just a minute but all of our curriculum is grounded in computer science teaching fundamentals you're going to gain exposure to tech jobs so there's what's out there learn about the universe of jobs that are open and available and are waiting for girls like you build 21st century skills like bravery confidence and resilience joining a supportive sisterhood this is so important there are 40,000 other girls that have been through girls to quit programs you will bring your sisterhood with you when you leave the program you will have girls to ask questions of to get support from to participate in other programs with when you go to college you'll find other girls that did girls who code when you get to campus and lastly this is summer it's important that you're there to make friends and have fun our curriculum is designed to be fun and handson projectbased so you can bring your ideas and work with other girls to make projects come to life where is campus so we are in seven metro areas this summer and our programs are hosted on high school and college Campion excuse me on high school and college campuses we're in San Francisco in the South Bay we're in Los Angeles we're in a couple of different schools in the Denver Boulder area we're in the Twin Cities Chicago DC and Baltimore and New York City so what are we offering we have four different courses this year starting in the top left this green course this is our introduction to computer science it's for girls ages 10 to 14 we use scratch and making me to explore computer science basics this is great prep if you're new to coding or if you've done a grocery code club but you really want to cement those fundamentals then moving to the right in the red box website design and development so this is a little more advanced but it's still totally appropriate for someone who's new will move quick through concepts but there's lots of support this is using javascript HTML and CSS our bottom two courses are the newest courses they're specialized and they're more advanced we have wearable tech and fashion design so if you've ever think about things like fitbit's or other devices that are on your body healthcare devices medical devices but also fashion how do you incorporate tech and hardware things that will literally sit on your body this is going to be a really creative handson class if you like working with your hands and digging into robotics and using a lilypad arduino which is a circuit board kit this is the right course for you and then we have an iPhone app development course because everyone has ideas for how to make apps things that they want to see in the App Store so this course will be using Swift and Xcode and you'll be actually brainstorming and building apps throughout the class so who teaches these code these courses grocery code instructors and teaching assistants it's really important to distinguish that these are not camp counselors or babysitters we hire seasoned teachers and tech industry professionals people we hire have both technical experience and teaching experience so that you have a really amazing experience on campus now we also will have TAS on campus graduate and undergraduate students in computer science and they'll also be talking about their experience studying computer science in college all of our instructors will go through a grocery code training program so we're not just throwing people into the classroom we're making sure that they're equipped and ready to teach one other important note that a cross who code at least one instructor in every classroom will be a woman we think that's so important for girls avaible to see women in this profession studying this subject that they can look up to and ask questions of so here are two examples of our instructors Galen on the Left here is a professional software engineer at a telemedicine startup she's super excited about breaking down these stereotypes especially around that coding is quoteunquote dry and uncreate if she can't wait to show girls how exciting and creative coding can be Robin is a PhD student in mathematics right now and she is new to teaching campus but she's actually been a lead instructor with pros who code over summers past working in IBM and Microsoft she's just so excited to bring the sisterhood component to this course so what's a campus day like week one you're gonna spend time doing handson activities and tutorials using our platform HQ so this is sort of the platform you'll be using to get new activities to get help and guidance everything is created by us here at grows who code there's also stretch work for people who are a little more advanced there's more support if you need more help and you'll be mixing up solo work and group projects your instructors will also be on hand to make sure that you're getting these core computer science fundamentals so that we can build on that as the session goes on we have women and tech spotlights so you'll learn about different avenues for exploring technology the intersection with tech and your other interests maybe art music science sports healthcare and occasionally we will even bring in speakers for you to meet in the second week you'll work on capstone projects so after building all these fundamentals you'll brainstorm and create ideas for things that you want to make whether it's an app or a game or a website and then you'll actually put it into practice we've got a lot of questions about what kinds of projects students make here and it can be any number of things we really encourage growth to think about issues and how they can use tech to solve problems in their real lives whether it's cyber bullying or protecting the environment or drawing attention to international issues or maybe it's something fun maybe it's a game maybe it is a tribute to your favorite musician that involves sort of an amazing website we've seen all kinds of projects so what do you take with you after campus first and foremost your friends this sisterhood among other girls is one of the key components of campus and all of our girls who code programs it's to make that real and tangible you will get access to loop which is our alumni network and hire me which is our internship and job platform for older girls so these are ways you'll keep in touch with the girls in your program and other girls from gross who code you'll bring your projects with you if you are getting ready for more advanced courses or thinking about college applications you'll have some projects to speak to you'll also get to keep any of your materials so for example the Arduino kit that you'll use in the wearable project and lastly a certificate of completion that documents your work these are some of our amazing girls you have no idea how smart and creative and ambitious they are you will work with these kinds of girls across your projects in our pilot program last year we got some testimonials from girls that participated and helped us develop this program one of the things I want to call out from Sara who was in New York is that it was about the coding but it was also about confidence learning to try new things to make mistakes to share work to get feedback and that's something that everybody struggles with but if you want to learn to code it's one of the key skills you have to build I also want to call out Jocelyn who is part of our Boulder Colorado program we talked about how meeting her instructor and learning what she did things like hackathons competitions being part of coding communities was a big takeaway for her from the program so let's get into the details the campus classroom studentteacher ratio is going to be 10 to 1 or less we want to make sure you have a great experience with your instructors and TAS so about 20 kids per class at most each course is two weeks long runs Monday to Friday and keep in mind campus courses are like day camp they're from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. it's not an overnight program and we don't provide housing students will bring their own lunch and we are sensitive to allergies and we'll make sure that everybody has stuff that works for them tuition varies by market and course between $14.99 and $21.99 and then we also of course have full scholarships available so you can apply if your family qualifies for a full scholarship and take one of these amazing courses lastly if you're watching this video as a little bit of an incentive we've got a code for you to use virtual to save a hundred dollars dates and details so every city is a little bit different but each session is two week long and they these are sort of the typical dates from June through the middle of August you can find the full schedule of courses in your city at girls who code komm slash campus registration go to that same website girls who code comm slash campus to register and a few quick notes there are multi session and multi student discounts that are available so if you and a friend or you and a sister want to register together or you want to take two courses we have a small discount available there we've got this special code for you for watching this video virtual to add a little extra sweetener to the pot and I should mention that enrollment is limited this will be filled firstcome firstserve so if there's a particular course you want it's in your interest to register quickly scholarships are needbased and filled firstcome firstserved as well there will be a waitlist if we have additional interest for scholarships and I encourage you to apply quickly if you have any questions I'm available my name is Emily moss you can
