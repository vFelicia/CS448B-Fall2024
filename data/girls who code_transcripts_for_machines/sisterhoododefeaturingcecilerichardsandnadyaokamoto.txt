hi i'm cecile richards and i'm an activist and i'm the former president of planned parenthood i'm nadia komodo and i'm 20 years old and i'm supposed to be a junior at harvard college but i'm only to keep working on my organization period the menstrual movement so where am i seeing you actually nadia so i'm actually in times square great i see the french fries in the background so that looks really awesome yeah fun place to work so i'm i'm it was so great to meet you at team vogue and i'm really excited to just to learn more because what you started is amazing so can you talk a little bit about period and how you started it yeah of course so period the menstrual movement we are global youth for an ngo that provides and celebrates mental hygiene through service education and advocacy and we do this through a number of ways one through the global distribution of menstrual hygiene products um and then we also push for social and systemic change towards menstrual equity so we try to change the way people think and talk about periods to be more positive normalized and even celebratory and we're starting to work in policy on campuses and then from the local state and federal level to get period products to be free and accessible to all menstruators regardless of socioeconomic status in the last about three and a half years we've addressed over 360 000 periods through product distribution and registered over 220 campus chapters at universities and high schools around the us and abroad and because of that growth with our chapter network we're actually the largest youth financial women's health in the world amazing okay so but back up a little bit now that you've done all that amazing work how did you actually decide to start period what was it that that um drove you to this because most people don't start organizations when they're um not even out of college so i founded this organization when i was 16 years old and a junior in high school um and i was really inspired actually by my family's own personal experience with housing instability uh my family experienced living without a home of our own my freshman to a sophomore year of high school for several months and during that time my commute to school turned from about 12 minutes to over two hours long on public transportation and where i would change buses was in old town portland which is in the downtown area where there are like 10 homeless shelters and a two block radius and i would regularly see these homeless women who were in much worse living situations than i was at the time um and sort of became accidental friends with them at the bus stop because there were a lot of bus delays right he selected the synthology of their stories of using toilet paper socks brown paper grocery bags cardboard to absorb their menstrual blood and sort of became obsessed with periods i was obsessed with like the stigma and how it affected the way i whispered the word period because i thought it was a bad word inherently um i was looking it up online and learned that periods are the number one reason why girls have school in developing countries period related pain is a leading cause of absenteeism in the u.s for girls in school more than the common cold um and then then in 2014 40 states in the us have a sales tax on period products because they're considered luxury items um meanwhile products like rogaine and viagra are considered essential goods right and don't have a sales tax and now it's 36 days so it's better but at the time i think it was just like this wakeup call of being angry that um something so natural was holding back more than half of our population so significantly um and just sort of feeling fed up and feeling that maybe i could do something about it um and i think i was very personally driven because it was the first time that i had ever really felt called into action and i think i needed that at the age of 16 because i was coming out of my first like really abusive relationship um had experienced sexual assault for the first time um from someone outside of my family and i think like that had made me really confused about my selfworth and it was suddenly thinking about periods where i felt like i have something more to offer the world and i think it was a really big saving grace that i needed yeah i know it's like you obviously have a mission and a passion um so what have you learned from starting your own organization and obviously seeing it grow so quickly and obviously tapping into a need that is out that continues to be out there um what have you learned that other other uh young people that are watching this could take from from your experience so i think one of the biggest things i've learned is to be patient um to be resilient and also to learn how to delegate right i think that when i jumped into this um i was so passionate about it that i wanted everything to happen really fast right and i think one of the biggest things was learning that especially if i want to work very powerfully on an intergenerational level with you know mentors role models potential partners i had to learn how to just be patient with what i was doing and take it step by step and i was getting so many no's especially at the beginning we still get a lot of no's we still get a lot of hate for the work that we do but i think knowing that i i'm so passionate about this i really believe in what we're doing and i believe that the menstrual movement is a tangible way we can make progress towards gender equality but learning to have patience so that i can stay resilient and keep doing this work and keep um believing in the work that we're doing is really important also i think that because we're growing at such a large scale level i can't do it myself right and i think the biggest learning experiences was being able to take a step back and actually acknowledge okay this is what i'm not good at like here are the weaknesses that i have as a leader um like i'm not good at finances and i don't like doing it and so finding people who where those are their strengths and being very honest with myself on what i can delegate um to someone who can maybe do the job better than i can right and i mean i totally relate to the whole impatience thing i'm a really impatient person and i think when you're dealing with issues of social justice and things that you see there's an inequity and unfairness i think that it's hard to be patient and i think so i also just want to say not that you're asking for any advice but don't lose your impatience because that's it's only because of impatient people like you that that the world that the world changes um i'm interested because you obviously grew this thing so quickly it's been that most of the idea hasn't been to um to center this on campuses where folks can easily you know like how do you create a chapter so when you said you had almost 200 uh college campuses that actually have a chapter how did how does that work and is that is that the the growth model that you're really looking for in the next year or two ahead yeah so we have campus chapters um we have campus chapters at universities and high schools all around the us and abroad and what they do is they take the three pillars of our organization service education and advocacy and they bring them to their local communities right so on the service side they have volunteer events they collect period products we might send them period products and then they actually support shelters and nonprofits in the area that are distributing to people in need so they become sort of a service hub in their local area um and then on the education side they host workshops we have one program called cup and cloth about educating others on reusable options right like menstrual cups much like this reusable cloth pads and that's both for people in need or for other students and then ask me about periods which we cocreated with um a company called my advanced sciences and we're able to work on that level just to start conversations about period health um and sort of create safe spaces for people to talk about what is your period experience and how can you feel comfortable talking about period pain and like how can you identify if you really should get checked out for like endometriosis um and then the advocacy side really comes down to policy so working with school admission administrations or city councils and school boards um to get period products um in all school restrooms especially grades six through twelve um trying to pass policy to get paid products and homeless shelters um and then state by state people are starting to activate around the tampon tax right no it's been amazing to see how quickly this has become a topic among women of so many you know of obviously many generations and it isn't just an issue of fairness and equity so and what are you seeing in addition to all this great work that you're doing domestically i know there are movements globally and what are you finding out from and uh what's the connection you're making with young people uh around the world yeah so it's so interesting because we're actually in almost 20 countries with our presence right now um in terms of where products go or where chapters are right but none of that has been like on purpose right i think that it's the beauty of social media is like we've never done a huge national campaign or anything to recruit chapters or global campaign what happens is we're naturally posting on social media about what we're doing and people are hearing about it and just choosing to join right and i think that what um is amazing is that you see on an international scale it's it's not always about access to period products that's the focus right but it's first and foremost about just talking about periods and creating you know an environment where people can talk about it and ask for period products because the stigma around menstruation is so culturally embedded and that's actually something i touch on a lot in my book my first book comes out in about less than a month called period power a manifesto for the menstrual movement um and with my book coming out i think that one of the things we've been really thinking about is like how we as us activists can partner with people internationally without overstepping when we don't know the area and we don't know the demographic or the culture right wow that's really exciting um and what have you found as a startup and obviously an idea that is so um compelling how are you how are you working with other allies what do you feel like other allies can do to work and support your movement um anything that you would like folks to know about ways in which they can be supportive or um for partners yeah so i think this is one of the things that sets period apart and our way we engage in the menstrual movement is we try to like not have any competition with anyone else in the space right i think that with nonprofits it's very easy to to get competitive with each other when you have similar missions right because you're fighting for the same press visibility the same audiences the same sources of funding oftentimes but what we may do is a as a commitment to like the work that we're doing is we don't we try to view everyone who's in the space of women's health or reproductive rights it's not competition but potential allies and like right and so what we do is we partner with other nonprofits we partner with other brands um what's unique about period actually is we have the most diverse array of sponsors in terms of who's funding the organization and who's on making our events possible and our activations possible so we work with competitors like tampax ui kotex always diva cup lunette have um uh lena cup and i think being able to pull all of them in and say we're all here for the menstrual movement it's not about competition um it's not about fighting for visibility we're all here to talk about periods and support young people in this movement and i think that that's one of the ways we've been really able to you know embrace this idea of collaboration and so obviously um having these you know as you talk about the stigma and the shame that it's unfortunately been part of women's health and reproductive health forever um i assume that this also sort of begins to have conversations with folks about not just periods and menstrual um ending stigma but just the whole reproductive array of issues that young people in particular are dealing with um so how have you kind of bridged into that space and is there are there learnings that you've you've had for where you say okay well that's as far as we go and now someone else really is going to work on that or how open are the conversations that you have with young people about that this is just the beginning of a lifetime of dealing with reproductive health issues i mean i think it's really common like i think one of the biggest like and this is what i love about the menstrual movement too is that it i think menstruation inherently is such an intersectional thing right because it's you know how you identify where you're from or whatever what your race you are what religion you are if you're assigned female at birth you will most likely menstruate on a monthly basis for an average of 40 years of your life right and so it's inherently a very intersectional issue um and i think one of the biggest ways and one of the uh the biggest other sort of platforms that we work on is about gender exclusivity right so you'll hear that i don't say feminine hygiene or feminine products um or feminine health like we try to make it very gender inclusive so we i use the term menstruators menstrual hygiene menstrual products to acknowledge that not all women menstruate and not all menstruators are women right but also people who might identify as trans or nonbinary um also experience their periods as well um i think that and i think that that's something that we really embrace especially is an organization that's primarily gears toward here towards gen z right so um the genderless generation where over 50 of us don't identify as totally heterosexual and i think that that's a really important part of our organization of course we talk about periods and period pain especially there's a lot of conversation about birth control because birth control is like how many many menstruators get rid of their period or maybe can alleviate some of the pain or the hormonal changes that they feel um and i think that that's something that we are still always trying to figure out how to make statements and take a stance on that as an organization because we work on this idea of like fight for menstruators right and i think we have lost a lot of supporters or gained supporters from taking stances on things like um birth control and abortion and i think that i personally am very publicly prochoice and proaccess to birth control but as an organization we we're still figuring that out because we want everyone to be involved regardless of political views because your political views don't influence whether or not you get a period right and so i think that it's something that we can continue to struggle with and are very much learning from um and something that i've actually like really much looked up to you and your leadership with planned parenthood on you know how you can try to work in a postpartisan way um and engage people of all different backgrounds and try to support people of all different backgrounds while also being public and embracing the different views that i have yeah yeah no but i mean just as you say menstruation is a intersexual issue let's face it reproductive health is too it's like everyone no matter where they enter this space um have the need for access to um affordable and nonstigmatized nonjudgmental reproductive care and too many things get caught up in as you say either politics or um uh or shame and so we just don't have an honest conversation about how we actually break down those barriers which is why it's so exciting i love the thought that you started this um with your from your conversations with women at the bus stop in portland because i do think that these are issues that that maybe we're just going to need your generation to lead on but that women have been dealing with and all people have been dealing with as you say all menstruators have been dealing with their entire their entire life so what um what would you like folks to know about the ways in which they can support you um join you sign up with you be part of this movement i would want people to know first and foremost that this is not like a women's issue this is not like a menstruator on the issue i think i always try to say like no matter who you are or what your period experience is you know or love someone that has a period right right you're here because menstruation makes human life and reproduction possible right right so i think the biggest thing i always try to say is whether or not you get a period doesn't influence your your the path the potential of what you can offer to the menstrual movement so that's what i want to say first and foremost and i think that like getting involved in the menstrual movement can be as simple as turning to your neighbor or your friend and saying what is period poverty why does it still exist and you know how can we break the stigma around menstruation and just starting conversations about it is the first step right but i think that going going forward there are very easy ways that you can make shortterm and even longterm change in the measure movement shortterm being you know buy period products getting to collect period products donate them to a local shelter right because i think people don't always think of menstruation as something to support for homeless administrators specifically um on a longterm level i think that there are policy initiatives both on a local level and state level that are very tangible and happening right now um to get period products to be accessible for all people regardless of socioeconomic background and that's actually something period is very much working with with different brands um on the policy level um we're getting ready to launch a big national campaign with links later this month um but i think that there's whether it's getting involved at a small level certain conversations or wanting to do service and systemic change um if you're a young person on campus and you want to start a chapter or if you just want to help support a local chapter like if you reach out to info at period.org we'll find a place for you that's great um so um i know you've just written your first book which is great and uh it's coming out soon so tell us a little bit about that so that people could be sure to look out for it yeah so my first book comes out on october 16th with simon schuster it's called period power a manifesto for the menstrual movement and i was really excited by like the riot girl manifesto red stopping manifesto of like the 1960s a little bit and this was sort of inspired by like the idea of writing a manifesto for fourth wave feminism which is all about like intersectional feminism youth engagement and youth leadership um and it's sort of like what's the stigma why does it exist what are the different avenues we can fight it and how young people can get involved um and so that comes out soon and i'm honestly terrified but i'm also very excited for it so it'll be great yeah so i finished audio book recording this morning and so it's feeling starting to feel very real yeah that's great that's great so you recorded the book yourself for your audio yeah so i just finished my like 15th hour of it this morning at the at their studios today that's so great and i hope you'll tell people about that because i know um a lot of folks obviously listen now to books on audio and then and the fact that you read it yourself means so much um i'm hoping so we'll see um and i actually i gave your assistant a copy of it like one of the great um because it would be like a dream if you could blurb it but it's like so i know like you're very busy so if you're great that would be oh fantastic okay i'll look for it and um yeah so good luck good luck on the book sales and we'll definitely like tweet it out and all that and i guess the last question i'll ask before um we sign off here is uh at the question i'm sure you'll get asked by everyone which is do you want to run for office because we need more people like you in office so um i actually ran for office uh last year so i ran for cambridge city council when i was a harvard freshman um and i was really passionate about housing affordability and you know we ran in with like as one candidate in a field of 26 progressive candidates right nine spots and it was running for office was one of the most exhausting terrifying most meaningful experiences of my life like it was the first time that i had sort of been hated on for like my identity on a really really vicious level um but also had to like stand up for myself on like why i thought young people should have a voice in politics um and i think that it was a huge learning experience i don't have any regrets about it and i'm especially since we made history with student and youth turnout in the city um and i'm excited like right now i don't have any plans to run for office but i'm really excited to keep supporting other young women especially with women of color who are running for office um and i think that we need that going forward especially yeah now and there's been some exciting wins including in massachusetts obviously of uh you know women of color running this time so well great so we'll just kind of keep that on hold but know that uh that's maybe you will all have a chance to vote for you for some really high office vote for you well nadia you're like it's just you're infectious in the sense of like your enthusiasm and i think evangelism for menstruators for talking about menstruation making sure that i think that you're exactly right this is an economic it's a poverty issue um so but i can't end this without just saying on behalf of you know after my 12 years of planned parenthood it just what a welcome development this is and i in whatever way that planned parenthood is a healthcare provider an advocate can be an ally and learn from you uh and work with you and support you i i know that uh there's an enormous amount of excitement enthusiasts for what you've built and what you're building and uh and i love the fact that it is really focused on building grassroots power advocacy and access to me that change happens thank you so much that literally means the world to me you're a huge role model for me and so many young activists especially in this space so thank you for all you've done and what you continue to do as well you
