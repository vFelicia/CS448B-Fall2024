hi I'm Lily Madigan I was the first trans person to be a woman's officer in the Labor Party in the United Kingdom hi I am Ashley kiddo I'm a singersongwriter from billion activist the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and 400 of the best interpolation so I was just wondering what lessons you've learned as an activist who's been in the game a lot longer than I have that you could pass them to me as someone who's just getting started out really um I've been political for about a year right and the thing that is important for you to understand is ask yourself the reason why you want to be an activist first of all that's the most important thing and ask yourself am i strong enough that's question you have to answer mine in my case being a woman a little girl in Africa when you're born a girl in Africa I don't have an intensity you just belong to your father that you're the daughter of your path and in my home where I grew up my brother was against that kind of thinking in that kind of practices so he raised boys and girls equally and saying there's no difference in what the capacity of what you have to do and my challenge I faced was jealousy and nastiness of people basically because I was not fitting in to the picture that make everybody feel comfortable about what a girl then your girl she look like it should be doing and I'll remember coming back from school when people have been throwing stones and spitting on me calling me or all kind of horrible name and I can't home that day I'm never gonna forget I feel so hopeless so work less I mean it's just you feel like you you don't you know you in ro body a micro mother said to me what's doing was running at to know what happened I said anyway I don't wanna sing anymore because I don't wanna go through this abuse anymore and my grandmother said okay even I let people tell you who you are and what you gonna do as they know but I don't want to be contrasted I said what do you care that are they your family are they're your friends do you respond to tell me anything you do to anyone in this hotel you got to sing the answer was no she said then I have an eye back so you let anyone define who you are you cannot love everybody anybody can't love you as long as what you're doing help you be happy empowers you to be the human being that do you see yourself to be just go for a head and do it no mind anybody that's such a powerful story thank you the bet that stuck out for me was when you said that people that you felt that society had a problem with you because you were acting differently to the other girls and that really struck a chord with me because it reminded me of when I was at school and and when I came out with trans and I wanted to be treated like the other girls and they wouldn't they wouldn't use my new legal name or pronouns all that means the girls dress code or spaces and that's a really a lien eating thing so I I can sort of on some level imaginable but it must have felt like for you I won't you saying really well do with me and that's why my father always used to say it to us as long as you can speak up and trying to present in front of you then you can go anywhere in the world and he said something also that really those two things defines the person that I am today he said if you are afraid you would never achieve anything and fear is a very powerful weapons it makes it in three hours or is enslave us people that don't want to call you the name that you are now it because they are afraid of accepting you or because we're the fear that is deep inside of them about themselves because if you know who you by you stand and you know who you are what you stand for no one should be afraid to you you should see any other human being as a great team but unfortunately we live in a society where fear it is embedded in everything from politics all the way down to the mark okay so therefore when you become an advocate and activist you have to know that those things are powerful as long as you can talk to people for them not to be afraid you mean everybody because once telling people racism is something that I need everyday everywhere I go and I grew up in a family where my mom and dad said a human being is not a matter of color don't judge anyone based off the skin color speak to people you will realize you may not have the same opinion but you can discuss as long as you can talk to each other everything's gonna be all right so for me everything start with that first conversation there are some people that never gonna win on your side and if you realized that after three times just move on because you cannot spend your time trying to get people on board or something that they never can understand there are some people that are willing to understand all that they are already understanding but they are afraid of fact they wanna be perceived by their family or their friends and what you said about fair I think is quite relevant in detail at the moment around trans rights where a lot of the argument is is people who are scared or saying that they're scared and fearful of trans people and trans women being treated like other women and when you break down that argument and have a conversation with most people they realized quite quickly that those fears are unfounded and not evidence based and and there are those few people who just won't come around but largely I think you're right just having a conversation but people might world people and just want the best thing and a conversation can really bring around people because we have been tuned like that the norm is being a woman a man period we are beings on this planet if you accept that infinite in nature why can't you accept the fact that as long as I'm happy no one can tell me that I'm making the wrong choice so if you're a phrase means you're not happy too because if you're happy you live happy within yourself I always said nothing come from the outside come from within your capacity of joy of resilience of love compassion empathy is embedded in you or not you gotta know you don't get I always think like when I was younger if I just picked one or two things and I wanted to change in society and focused on them and read about them when she has to be people when to hear people speak about them and then eventually when I was comfortable I should speak up about those things and if I like I really learned from that when I when I've struggled with stuff like coming out at school and being a transwoman in politics that yep I have to be passionate about these things and after understand as much about as I can and speak up about it and that's how I bring people around and that's how I make changed so that's that's a little lesson from my family but I've always been fond of that because when you love somebody you don't judge the person and that's wrong we have we are all being manipulated by the power in place it's all this is political and that's what I say when you instrumentalize people's pain for me it's not politics anymore is just abused and we have to redefine what being a politician means what does it mean what do we need and what we want from the politician we the people have to force them to be the leader that we want to I think politics at the moment it's quite disillusioning to so many people especially in the u.s. at the moment it's quiet down why do we go around and vote for people that are despicable what does it say about the society that we are if you have to be powerful you have to be the most nastiest human being on the planet you have to be you have to be a fun you have to be a psychopath when we change our view of what will go rondalee then we develop error well then we've only having this composition anymore we don't have any conversation about how do we make our education system better how do we make our help system better how do we create the society where everybody comes everybody can dream and everybody can live a decent life how do we give you how do we get there I think like things I I think it almost feels a lot like time a lot of times like we have our rights very fragile II held like examples for me a trump coming in and not letting me trans people serve in his military and taking away trans protections for students in schools and it seems like that's something those are things that we took for granted um so I take stuff like that for granted in the UK yeah yeah yeah well from this wake up call we're gonna treat each other better fair and never let the bullies come back to town I don't know how serve all the future generation of every kind of walk of life to be part of is wrong I agree and like in the UK we just said we're not just last year we saw Theresa May sign a coalition agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party quite an GOG BT and just quite horrific so that goes back to those thing about rights feeling quite freshly held and thing personally like all of my activism has been realizing that it isn't great but also that I can change up and fast I was I was sort of like I'm just changing this like I assumed my school because I wanted to make my school better for me but now I'm getting involved because I want to make society better for everyone and I think might be a very rewarding and unintended outcome for that people like um we're by younger and more marginalized activists will rise up and sort of take back the political ground and I think if if our politicians at the moment can't sort out one of these problems that we've been talking about and I think young people definitely well and I love a lot of young people yeah because the young people add the future is the one that did or you wake up and you grab your future bag and you are in total control of it oh you're gonna have so much mess to deal with later you're gonna go how do we get there but even then you move I said well when I was supposed to speak up I didn't hmm when I was supposed to turn up forthright I didn't and if you waved at one fraction of the second we'll come back to square one yeah and I think I think that's why I love most about I feel so supported by that the young section of my political party in this country and just a university I feel so accepted as a trans woman I think it's just in our minds it isn't even the debate anymore it's just when you look to older people I mean there are a few exceptions in okay so obviously they I'm very positive about the future me too I'm always positive otherwise I won't be doing what I've been doing for the last 40 years because you give up on blah right let give up on youth and what what happens to me can happen to anybody therefore when I'm thinking in my activism into five people I fight for every people it's not only for black people it's not only for poor people is everybody because if my freedom is in danger if I will stand against somebody I witnessed an injustice against somebody and I keep quiet then I accept that I can be abused they are not voted for a category of people they are voted in office to fight for every single citizen's right and we have power we have more power than we think people that companies I don't like transgender or minority don't spend your money buying their stuff I won't and like in the u.s. with them black community screen elections and I think that's such a powerful thing in the UK I know definitely but we've reached a point where if people are racists or LGBT payback or xenophobic I like to think we've reached a point where we were to reward them but I think especially with things like brexit yeah there is a fear that it can still be targeted and and you for so against and it's such a it's such a contrast between older people who wants to leave and young people who very much want to remain I think it all kind of links together yeah we have the power to bring people to realize their own potential that's where your success lie as much as you can mobilize muted young people around you we are all here for one goal to make this this planet of ours liveable within the value accepted everybody's differences no matter what who they are where they come yeah oh I gotta go I gotta go if you go to the airport oh very caring I'm going back to Paris then I'm going to Armenia amazing has an amazing time and it was so lovely to talk to you October 20th I've been learned on this even in a lifetime a word from some lines incredible so if you're around you want to come let me know I definitely well erupt it was so nice to talk to you we're gonna change this oh yeah we've you here yet
