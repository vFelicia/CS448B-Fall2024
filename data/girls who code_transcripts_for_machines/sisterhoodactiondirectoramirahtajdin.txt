to roam the world with pearls and throw roses at the moon for happy birthday to you happy birthday tuesday night happy birthday to you santa and yeah is i've never been religious daddy said i could be anything so i looked to the stars found an acoustic teenagers we think we have to blend in but if you want to be great if you could have one wish for every candle you blow out tomorrow what would they all be listen babes that's loaded we've been here all day well we're not getting out of here anytime soon we have time plus even the back door is like super locked come on girls it's not every day you get to say we're locked in a ship well we were supposed to be in and out epic sweet 16 adventure if there ever was one hey nothing lasts forever you all need to calm down i wish we could live in a place where girls don't feel uncomfortable walking into a grocery store or just walking down the street i wish we can see money and power going to the right places enhance i wish black women were treated more like human beings rather than sexual objects and below average i wish girls would not need to build themselves knowing the end goal is always marriage i would like for all women to support each other no matter the way they think they look or the act i would also like for all animals to have rights and for zoos and circuses to close down i want to live to see the day where young muslim girls would have muslim women and as inspirational speakers for them and role models the day there is no longer tension between races because of their history i mean the suppressor mentality comes by nurture not nature so i want to see the day when the new generation just acts upon their pure instinct like children in 16 years from now i would like women to be treated better by each other men and society as a whole i would hope that we don't revert to war but rather have more peaceful solutions and when it comes to solving issues and i would hope that we deal with it in a more gentle compassionate and understanding approach how do you think we're gonna do that i just feel like i mean so cliche but like man in the mirror situation like just start with yourself you know like when you get on a plane and they tell you where your um oxygen mask first yeah so if you want success for yourself want that for someone else as well growing up i feel like i don't really have someone to look up to when i grow up 16 years from now i'll be that woman like everything that happens to us is based on how we were raised and how we were taught from a very young age i see a lot of parents like when their kids are still young they go like no you're a man you shouldn't cry you know you're yeah you know how do you have men know that they have to be more sensible that they can be more so tell them change comes with time like some people started going to sanctuaries instead of zoos which are way better they actually treat animals right and suggest it to schools that they start switching their field trips exactly starting from the ground up with almost everything that we've talked to exactly always comes down to us being kids or someone teaching us when we were younger what's our pact yeah what are what's our impact can we promise each other that every single day we'll do something small or big just something that'll contribute to making this change happen okay can we promise each other when we are mothers to treat our daughters and our sons as well in such a manner and just to be again very gentle but also try to you know say that sort of thing just and and continue on doing so i also think we should promise that we're loving people no matter what and we do everything with love in our hearts and happiness and joy and leave all the negativity and the bad vibes behind i don't know thank i think it's one by one we'll have to one by one here just okay before dawn and to be a girl means you rise changes its tune my name is naomi and i'm 11 years old i am here today to acknowledge and represent the africanamerican girls whose stories don't make the front page of every national newspaper it is my privilege to be here today i am indeed full of privilege my voice has been heard i am here to acknowledge their stories to say they matter to say their names i am here to say that everyone should value those girls too i am here today to honor the words of toni morrison if there is a book that you want to read but it hasn't been written yet you must be the one to write it you
