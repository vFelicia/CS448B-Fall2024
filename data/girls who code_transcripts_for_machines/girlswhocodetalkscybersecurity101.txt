learn languages walk through new york city watch korean dramas and cook for friends and family welcome mary next is abby willis abby is a system engineer too at walmart um her responsibilities including pkis hsms i'm sure i'm reading certificate management and other encryption solutions avi has a bachelor's degree in management information systems degree from harding university and next is kelly lenko um kelly joins us from uh 30 years of prudential uh firm experience um she's a business information security officer at prudential financial welcome y'all great can you all yes hi everyone this is great so i'm very excited to meet y'all um and i'm very excited to share some stories and uh uh get to know each other more and hopefully we can share more um fun and exciting stories uh for our audience as well um so let's as part of the icebreaker and intros and i think i have something here that um we can do some icebreaker let's just introduce yourself your name title who you work for and then um what's a piece of media that you found really influential like a book a podcast a ted talk you know um who would like to go first i'll go ahead great um so i'm kelly lanco i do work for prudential financial i've been there for 30 years i did not start in it i actually started on the business side and kind of moved over to it about 22 years ago i'm in information security so i actually grew up with the field um so i have i can tell you how it's really evolved i can tell you actually it's moving so quickly that we're seeing such change in the last two years that we've seen over time in 10 years so that's quick that's how quickly things are evolving um and i will say so given as much time that we put into work and being moms and everything else it is very difficult to actually sit down with a book and read i do try to do ted talks during my lunch break just to have that break from the computer and the conference calls so the ted talks i kind of listen to any more motivational kind of ted talks but i do um found that rollout actually was a really good book that i found very interesting is a really good read it talks about leadership but it really talks about safe agile which is really where the industry is going with their development um and then how and i can talk a little bit about how we actually embed information security into that um but it's really 12week sprints and it's kind of like if you develop you test you go to production and it's just like you know quickly um you have a whole team of all your testers your planning everything at the table doing all the planning including information security which is awesome um and it's kind of like a team of folks they're doing the planning they're doing the programming and they're going right straight to production so um the safe rollout actually because it was such a change from what we're used to from a waterfall methodology to this new agile approach it i found it very inspiring and actually i find the whole approach very motivating so i'm great thank you the agile approach sounds really interesting maybe later we can hear a little bit more about that great um abby would you like to go next sure yeah thanks guys so much for having us i'm excited to be here tonight um but yeah my name name's abby willis i'm an engineer on our cryptography team at walmart um i've been here for about three years and it is an exciting field to be in information security but um not but and to kelly's point it's constantly changing which means it's never boring which means it's a lot of fun um as far as the media there's one ted talk that i really do enjoy too it isn't even infosec specific but it's more talking about getting outside of your comfort zone because i think that's so important and it's such a challenge so um i think i can't pronounce her name so i'm sorry i'll butcher it but her name's you being zhang and it's called life begins at the end of your comfort zone that's one of my favorite ones i'm excited to be here thanks for having us again thank you abby mary sure hi my name is marid angela gutierrez i work at accenture i've been there for four and a half years almost five i work as a security analyst a security consultant cyber security consultant whichever use you prefer uh i love to to be able to challenge uh to tackle many challenges for different clients so that is the part of the work that i love it's always changing depending in the industry depending on compliance which are the rules or regulations that the government or a certain institution provides them it's very exciting to see how each culture adapts to it and we have this approach as an accenture of security by design so nowadays we add a security person to up to any project to provide the information the feedback that is needed in order to have the security length from the very beginning and a piece of media that i love is a podcast how i build this i'm a fan of that podcast uh i've heard it from the very first episode and besides that i love hidden brain i love to learn a little bit more of how the brain works and how how we have all these biases so i love that that's wonderful i actually took some notes hidden brain i'm going to look that up thank you for sharing um you know i think maybe i think we can start off with learning more about ourselves um how about we start with some basics um what does your job title mean at your company and how do you spend your days who wants to go first how about we start yeah um so i'm actually i love this question because i remember when i was first kind of interested in security i was like okay but what do you actually do and i was so confused so i appreciate getting to know or you know people asking about that um i know it can vary a lot so i work in security engineering so there's a lot of different types of roles within security and you even see them represented here today but um so think of my role as more of a proactive defense type role um so i work every day on different products that have to do with encryption of different information um so that could mean you know engineering certain applications that could mean scripting that could mean automation but i also do a lot of work working with the other developers in our organization to help them understand how to actually put these things into use so we may offer these services but we help them understand how to use it so there's a lot of of different items that it could be and you kind of wear multiple hats in any role but that's that's kind of what i do thank you i'm actually taking notes abby this is exciting um uh mary sure so uh excuse me can you repeat the question sure the question is um what does your job title mean at your company and how do you spend your day or days perfect so uh my job uh title means i'm independent i'm more independent than an analyst or a senior analyst meaning um i i need to be proactive on to understand what are the needs of the team uh what are the next step in the project the managers overseas the project but as a consultant and the person who does the work more with the other consultants and analysts we we see it's like a team lead because as a consulta i already oversee uh two or three analysts or senior analysts to do the work that we are supposed to do um another thing is that as a consultant i need to think the needs of my manager before my manager thinks about them so uh to become like a mind reader but that comes with experience uh comes with a lot of uh being exposed to a lot of situations a lot of projects and in my day to day i start my day with a standup depending on the client some clients are steering waterfall like kelly mentioned or they are agile then i'll be in a standup i'll be part of the conversations of what needs to be done what the client needs for us what are the pending items that we need from the client in order to get our work done uh that is the main meet and greet of a consultant and understanding what is the problem and if we are focusing on the project from the right lens besides that as a consultant i also participate at in accenture activities so i have my plus one in my case is i run workshops for graduate code and accenture i think some of you have been there so i interact with the community and so on and finally at the end of the day uh we have um we talk with the client we make them understand where the their actual needs and to have clear estimates of how long will the project take that's great you know i'm i i came up with more some questions if you don't mind so essentially as a consultant it sounds like you're a subject matter expertise and as well as an advisory role it seems like exactly i i get multiple hats i have a little bit of project management as me a business analyst and advisor so all of them within one person oh wow but there are multiple people that do the same because we as ana during our analysis periods we were acquiring more of the technical knowledge uh a specific knowledge right and as we move up we should be able to provide more of the business background understand the pro the problem uh from from the business side as well as the technical side which are two different things oh wow so you opened up a lot of com the subject that actually raised even further more curiosities right i think all of us at some point have worked with consultants and mike i'm really curious as to um how much of your time is actually spent on like onsite with clients right and then prepping for the sessions so uh uh on clients prepping for the sessions is before the pandemic we used to go to the client from monday to thursday and uh start as early as eight in the morning and until five uh we usually use 25 of our time with the client in actual meetings and then the rest is doing the actual work in the other case as a manager you do more of more clients more meetings but in my case um i'm a person who wears a lot of hats also i i cannot be just focus on one thing i love to be involved in many things so i'm a big picture person so i'm always involved in different things within the fight wonderful thank you thank you um kelly yeah so oops can you hear me yeah okay yeah so it's interesting because actually accenture is one of our strategic partners i've been working very closely with our accenture partners um they are actually performing a lot so a lot of demand service a lot of our technology as well as operations um and part of that work is ensuring that we're setting them up with the right security controls but anyway just to back up so i'm a business information security officer which is great i think i get involved with everything or all aspects of information security i'm not an engineer i'm not an architect i'm not a propeller head um but i'm kind of right in between the business and our corporate you know information security office and i work with all of those um control partners or all of those expertise so um i have developed a lot of relationships i get to work with again our hightech investigations units i work with our architects our engineers i work with all the the business so the product developers um and i'm i work very closely with the leadership teams on both technology and business and i kind of bring their strategies together and ensure that we're doing things in a secure fashion um so with that um i definitely get involved with a lot of the systems development life cycle um or sdlc um because in security has to be embedded right we're developing things security by design you hear privacy by design security by design um i also get involved again with all of the vendor relationships um companies today they have multiple thirdparty relationships so we have to ensure that when we're looking to engage in those um relationships that they have secure controls right if we're sending them data that they have the right security in place um so part and i'm gonna just kind of like kind of connect the dots here so what we're doing with accenture they want to bring in some of their own applications into prudential in order to support the engagement that they're performing for us so we're assessing the security of those applications um making sure that the right fit for prudential because we also have similar applications so if they're saying that they need something for time management we already have a time management tool so it's a lot of begin sitting with the enterprise architecture review board making sure their applications are the right fit making sure that they're coming in and um and not saying that they're in compliance with our security controls but that we're comfortable with the right controls based on the risk a lot of again what we do is risk management um so i'm i actually report directly to our chief information security officer so i'm embedded into the information security team but i work very closely with a lot of those partners um the other thing i do is i work with a lot of clients believe it or not so because i support institutional businesses we're a financial company and we support uh institutional business meaning the products that we offer that i'm supporting you're getting through your employer your 401k benefits your retirement benefits your insurance benefits from your employer so we call them institutional clients we deal with a lot of data but it's financial at the end of the day because again a 401k account is financial and related so our clients that we actually um that you know our clients also want to make sure that their data that they're sending to us is secure so um as much as winning a business a client wants to know that you're going to support their business needs they are so interested in cyber security and it really has exploded in the last couple of years so even to win a sale um a business sale you have to have a very strong um security program so i i find myself meeting um a lot with clients so i support that side as well um so there's very there's a lot of different aspects of a business information security officer and what we get involved with great thank you kelly now you use some several words that i like you know i actually put a question mark do you mind if i ask you some clarity right you use control partners right yes control partners is often referred to as your legal team your cyber law your privacy your compliance your risk management teams so they want to make sure you have the right controls based on their expertise embedded into either the product development the technology that you're building but it's really to support the business strategy um so i work very closely with those areas okay that's great and would you say um those control partners are also good entry into uh cyber security or information security i absolutely do so um if you even think about even since i've joined or i've started infinite security 22 years ago um there was no such thing as privacy officers right so we all kind of grew so even throughout that my time in my career privacy has now become a really big thing um so even if you started in privacy and as closely as you're working with your information security partners um you're learning right so it's a good segue into information security so risk management again is a big part of what we what i do you wouldn't put a um 100 lock on a 10 bicycle right it's how you balance that risk when you're securing certain things wonderful and i think you touched on something that um i'm actually you know very intimate with not from technical expertise so big is something that we're sponsoring in our company as well which is sdlc and you use the word embedded and i think this is something that abby can also help us um understand what does that really mean so i mentioned um the same agile methodology that we're now using right 12week sprints so what we have moved from and i'm going to try not to be too long so waterfall you wrote your requirements right you pro you then developed based on those requirements you tested those what you what you developed you have to get approvals before you know then you quality test then you went to production so it was very and that took a long time before any code got to your production today companies are trying to get there quicker very quickly they have to transform and they have to move to production very quickly they have to evolve especially if they're going to compete with startup companies and fintech companies um the large companies right now are going through a huge transformation so they've moved to this agile approach um so 12week sprints so you have everyone at the table your developers your um whoever's writing your requirements your testers everyone at the table to do the planning so that they know what they have to do within that 12 weeks and they're part of that planning process information security is also there right so and you have several different teams that may be part of what we call a program increment so you have teams because you're developing capabilities are like little pockets of code um and it really allows information security then to go from team to team and be there be present during the planning stages and during um those execution in those deep dive meetings so that we're helping them to solution right there and not have to wait till you get to production and then now you found you have a gap and you have to go back so it's kind of so when i say we're embedded right there we are definitely embedded now into the methodology of you know code development understood that's great thanks for expanding on that i'm sorry can i ask a question yeah absolutely i always wanted to meet someone like you because of the type of your job uh work i do so my biggest question is what is the biggest challenge in your day to day the biggest challenge is um trying to keep up with everything right um and because there's i guess so much work that is happening to so much transformation work you want you can't be in all places at the same time you can't be involved with every single project so what are those significant initiatives you have to make sure that you are networking that people know who you are that the proactive reaching out to you that is really key um so what we and so another thing that we've done obviously we're building automation into the devops pipeline so that you're kind of kept capturing those vulnerabilities and wherever you have you know code gaps before it even moves to production which helps and saves a lot of time um but you want to you want to make sure that again that the people still know that to come to you so we developed like almost like this really small little checklist say hey if you answer yesterday these questions make sure you're engaging us but my biggest fear is that we miss something right because again you can't be in all places at the same time absolutely absolutely awesome um i think that gets me thinking oh sorry go ahead um one of the things that i found most interesting when i started kind of getting interested in information security was um you'll hear the saying we have to be right every time and an adversary would only have to be right once and so it is kind of that pressure of are we missing things that absolutely you feel that at times especially in in technical role azure where you're really focused on prevention as well right um and i think there's that there's a lot of uh i don't know sort of uh trust and faith that that that the preventions that you recommend and and hopefully the other other others actually follow those recommendations as well right um yeah i think uh i think in my organization we have very similar challenges too as well um but like all of you all say it's ever evolving it's it's just it changes so fast and i think that's where the excitement about this industry is that whoever comes into this industry um there are many facets of this industry right like i think um when i first heard about cyber security and or information security many many moons ago i had a very narrow structure idea of what that is and when i look at the industry now my mind just goes oh my gosh you know there's so many different methods in which a talent can join an organization and actually function information security many ways right um and then i think that leads to like our next discussion i think that um i think uh a lot of our audience will be interested in it's really and i'd be i'm curious about this too right how did you get involved in this field right um and then um was your path through computer science um specific major you know so how did you get start and how did you land where you are oh sure i'll start since um so the path for me was more of mario flock as a student um i went to school to rochester institute of technology for computer science and there we have one year of coops so i interned at tons of reuters credit suisse uh another insurance company and after i i had these experiences i said i want to be in a place where where i have different projects where i don't need to be in the same project for five years or ten years which is what i saw among my colleagues in those places so i decided okay what is a place where i can learn more about technology and and still do software but still i want to learn more and i learned about consulting and i said but i don't want to be a business consultant i want to be a technical consultant and that's when i learn more about accenture and that they had that possibility and i because of my background doing research in mathematics in my school years my type of personality i fed i fit into the into the security practice so that was my luck and then that's how all this started that's great no i think um uh kelly i think you were saying something you're i think you're mute yeah i was telling my daughter to take their dog for a walk oh i'm sorry it's not good i gave my son a quick evil eye no not right now because he opened the door he's sort of here's your dinner mom like no not right now um all right um i forgot what i was going to say um well yeah so you know whenever i hear um a new story about how do you get involved in this field i'm really curious as to like um you mentioned the word intern mary right um how did you know like like when you interned um did you know that this was the sort of the want to get to no no as i said it was more i knew that i didn't want to stay in those companies and that i wanted a place where i could do different things but going into cyber security was more a matter of luck for me it turned out that was the practice i was assigned to and i started there at the beginning i didn't find my place and then everything connected and i and now i've been here for four years and a half that's a really good luck he ran into um avia i'm really curious to hear about your story yeah honestly i feel like there was luck playing in mine too so that's interesting um so i was a management information systems major which is a lot of times pretty well split of like business and technology but mine was definitely more business focused um but i got a couple internships with walmart um and they were fulltime coding internships which in college i loved coding like thought it was super fun really enjoyed it and please don't hate me but when i got into the internship i realized i hated coding um and that was not for me so we all have different gifts and that's not mine but i know a lot of people love it and that's awesome um but when that happened i was like okay well if i don't want to be doing coding full time what are some of my other options and so during my internships i just kind of like met some other people within the organization which if you have internships i strongly encourage you to do that you know look around and see what other options are there um because it's the best opportunity for you to be able to do that so i ended up in information security and i was like y'all i know nothing about this my uh university at the time had no cyber security classes so i had no background at all um but i interviewed and i got a job and it was i mean it's been incredible so i started literally knowing nothing um but i found it super fascinating there are a lot of things i really enjoy about it but i think one thing that's unique about the industry in general is that we all really do want to work together i mean we all have the same goal we don't want to see each other fail um and i think that's a really unique field to be in and it's kind of fun um i loved i remembered when i was getting into it again kind of that like what do you guys actually do what are the options within cyber security because as you see here there's so much that you could even join and one of my favorite analogies which we probably don't have time for but if you're interested in it a lot of people talk about it is the castle analogy if you're kind of curious of what types of jobs there are i know when i talk to a lot of college students they think cyber security is pen testing and red team and that's all they really know about um which i completely understand um but there's so many different roles within information security there is coding if you enjoy that you can do fulltime coding within infosec that's just not for me um but there are so many different roles and so many different um just job functions if you're interested and that's what i really enjoyed about it so um for me obviously i'm in um crypto it's something that i didn't know i was going to love but i ended up loving it um but it's just for me i stay in it because it's ever evolving and i didn't want to be bored and you will certainly never be bored in this industry um because of so much change and so much happening so um i kind of like got into it a weird way and um but i'm oh it will always be grateful for the people that gave me a job when i told them i know nothing but i can learn um so it's been a great few years that's great um cali yeah so i started i actually went to catherine gibbs school um and at a katherine gibbs school i got a job with prudential and i started in the accounting department um so from accounting i i grew up into other areas of the business retirement was one of the businesses that i worked for but i was in the business i didn't do any technology work at all i um then moved into that i was very interested in technology actually actually um mentorship was huge and i paid attention and i worked i worked a lot of hours so i actually had a lot of my leaders take me under their wing and they knew that i had a huge interest in computers so um i had certain leaders and i had what actually really drove me to technology is as they were developing um back way in the day our workflow system they took me into a room and there was white boards all over the place and it was a design of that application um so i was so junior but yet they had you know they they really saw something in me and from there i went from the help desk and i kind of um again was a top performer there and then information security and i started informing security 22 years ago and at the time i joined i really thought that i was going to be doing security provisioning like something like granting and removing security access from applications but it wasn't i was placed into more of a project management role and in that role i got involved with every single project that there was in infamy security and again i just had leaders that took me under their wing and taught me everything um so i was able to really grow i will say that the the biggest um success is is soft skills right you can learn you can google you can read white papers you can get your certifications um understanding the base concepts um but the soft skills the networking the communication how to talk to leadership that really is really important and i kind of emphasize that just because the young generation with the social media um you know sometimes you don't stop with the acronyms when you're you're texting it's really really important to develop those strong communication skills we've had um individuals come in from college very very highly intelligent was really great in their field but we had to send them to classes to to learn how to basically write because of the young generation and being on their phones and everything's um really quick so that is um but that's if you can if you have those core skills and you're able um and you're able to you know obviously read technical papers you'll grow in the field sorry i have my daughter hold on one moment um you know talk about communications because i think that is really important to um share some experiences too and that is although this is this seems like a technical field that i find that especially in information security or cyber security being able to articulate the actual concepts and application takes a whole different level of command of the language and this as a foreigner that's something i get to really i'm sure they're married you get to also experience that right and to this day i still get my feedback improve your communication skills but i make up for that in other ways i present better i i try to be informed all the time i i'm always reading different things and i think that you hit a great point it's that communications and business skills are very important just because as a software engineer you are creating a piece of software that will be sale right but security is not monetized right you're not selling that product unless your software is a security product for another company so it's a matter of 100 of providing okay so in the case let's say of target when there was the hack how much money did that company lose because they didn't provide the right security uh environment right so we need to sell any any decision any security decision based on what are the needs and anticipate the constraints also of that and the budgets that security the security offices are given and i will lead leave the rest to kelly and av yeah that's a tough one um actually talking to leadership about the cost benefits of information security it's really hard to articulate because you can't you you don't know the financial loss that will happen you can only estimate right and you're not really um you're not bringing a business it's not sales so anything information security related that you're actually bringing in it's costing the business they don't want to spend money on anything that's going to other than a capability that's going to bring in business so it's really difficult and it's really challenging obviously i think the leadership teams across you know the industry now realize the importance of information security or cyber security um but it's definitely some tough conversations that you need to have to really articulate when you want to bring in a new tool application software um even um just uh you know hire even a new resource sometimes you know try to understand the work that's involved just because um it's not an area that leadership wants to put money towards right and now that you're bringing our leadership a thought comes to my mind about communication articulation is that i find that um the more senior we are in our um our positions the communication articulation becomes a lot more critical in lending that message even in our technologies i'm sure that abby you've experienced this too if you want to share some experiences i think that's really important to share with our audience who is um uh who would like to understand what it is that um they they they would like to focus more on or be able to look into and honing some of their skills right yeah i'll just add um it's another common term you'll hear if you're in the area or in the division um security is everyone's responsibility it isn't just an infosec so you not only have to get your leadership buyin to support your organization but you also have to continue to get that buyin of the rest of the people in the organization that have no connection to information security but it is for everyone so you do have to be able to communicate okay these are the reasons why um you know we have these policies in place and um here's how you know this impacts you and so having those skills is really important yeah and a thought comes from until like maybe that's why all of us sort of fell into it um you know and i i certainly have fell into it accidentally as well um as part of more of an audit team um and and uh just very interesting but then i did realize that it does take um that level of articulation skills that i had to develop as well but it comes naturally because you're surrounded by folks who are very articulate in this industry right so this is great i think that listen to um next set of really interesting questions um and this is something i think we all said in our introductions evolving ever changing etc so um how do you anticipate the field of cyber security information security changing over time perhaps you can expand upon some of your observations that's taking now and share with everyone um abby would you like to sure um that's difficult because there's so many things um it it constantly changes as you know different things happen and different technologies advance there's constant change i will i will mention one technology that you see a lot of discussion around right now is iot there is a lot of discussion in the industry about okay what this is and how do we protect this and um i clear i'm referencing a lot of um phrases but one of the funny jokes people say is the s in iot stands for security um and so um it's a challenge about how we approach this you if you google it you will see a number of different companies that have gotten bitten gotten bit by um you know having some iot devices that ended up being an access point for an adversary um like i think there was a fish tank monitor that someone used one time and that's how they got entrance to their network so um iot is a big discussion right now if you're just thinking about one technology in specific that um you know people really have their eyes on and will be a focus point i think for a lot of the industry right mary or kelly would you like to also contribute to that question about how do you anticipate this field um changing over time in my case i believe that it is changing by the day it's not changing by the month it's changing by the day this pandemic has really precipitated all those changes and technologies that where as we were expecting in 10 years or five years from now those are coming now because of the need for different companies to stay afloat or to to innovate and to help other people even in terms of um creating the vaccine they had to use super computers to to come up with all the algorithms and all the data create all of that so understanding that the only uh the only thing that will stay there it's you and your instincts to create a more secure world world is is the only thing that will stay with you but technologies will change everything will change so your ability to problem solve is the thing that will stay actually yeah i think from a pure technology standpoint to where where i think see things changing again the transformation um you have so many of these startup companies and they're able to build their technology right from the start you don't need the overhead right so they don't have the overhead of people um it's truly in a lot of it's automation you know putting whatever they can put into the devops environment to automate the um you know the code movement looking at the code for quality um and security vulnerabilities even before it even gets to production um development is like in almost like cubes it's almost like building blocks instead of you know programming um you know you know doing tons like all the programming and then you just add on to the program then it's a bandaid here and a bandaid there and that's kind of just how it was in the past um you really truly have you know you're moving really quickly to the cloud you are using services um that the cloud providers are offering so it's very coding has become very simplistic um but the movement is so quick right so how do you ensure that you as quickly as things are moving that you don't have security vulnerabilities also go in there from an industry standpoint i could tell you that there's a lot of regulations that are popping up and i work with a lot of the regulators um so we had a lot of the privacy from state to state now you're starting to see the cyber security ranks um new york department of financial services you had the dol that was just issued in the last two weeks um and you have to certify like these cios um csos of these companies have to certify to these federal regulators the strength of their cyber security programs so and again to comply cost money um and then balancing it with the business need and and the business strategy and as quickly as their as we're moving right um it's just it is a huge um challenge to keep up with all of that uh movement um so tons of regulations popping up um speed to market um you know agility um and so that's kind of that's where i'm starting to see a lot of change sounds like it's just constantly changing if you enjoy change and challenges this is it yeah i mean even from you know moving to a zero trust network right you always you always manage the external threats now you have to manage it from internal because you're doing so much business with um you know strategic partners that you don't really have that base of employees anymore you have a lot of consultants that are helping so it's um and moving away from data centers so that you're now that somebody can just log in and um and access a business application without it actually being within your own data center it's either on a cloud or you're putting security firewalls in place so they can access it from any device so again very quick movement in these areas wow um you mentioned data centers right could you expand on why you use that you know to help us explain data center security versus cloud security i'm more thinking from how can our audience um and relate to that versus cloud yes right um because like i i could i could understand that but when i think about more of our audience um you know how would they be applying this information to find more more data to see how they could be searching for these type of opportunities right and and companies are moving away from data centers because they're very costly so um so certainly you have your your network and everything was contained within your network and you were able to monitor that network now it's extended um to cloud right so your cloud your it's like a private cloud is an extension of your network so you're you're monitoring all of that traffic certainly your cloud provider might be you know responsible for the core infrastructure but as you're putting data and applications out there you have to be responsible for monitoring that traffic you have to be responsible for monitoring to make sure you're still not imp you're not um implementing code with vulnerabilities so the same controls that we had actually on we've moved into the cloud and we utilize the services that the the cloud providers um do offer to simplify that monitoring so it's really builtin services that cloud already offers versus the um pretty much customized services a lot of these uh onprem services provide i think that's probably the expected differences maybe you know it provides more data than how our audience can do more research yeah and it's a lot and it's very um cost it's more cost effective for companies to purchase what they call software as a service right so those those software programs are also built on their cloud provider so you have different apps and that's why i said you're moving away from your core data centers because it's just cheaper to purchase an application that's already out there supported by somebody else obviously you have your data you have to make sure it's secure you're monitoring that your your associates need to access it but there so now you have to apply security on um being able to from again or um you know move again working from home because of covid right so how can how can they be able to access a business application from any device a personal business device in a secure fashion yeah wonderful a lot going on yes yes um another thought came to my mind is you know with a focus on um bring more awareness and how how to find more opportunities in this in this industry what kind of experience do you expect or hope to see from uh folks who's looking for this type of opportunity whether it be college grads or someone who's switching from another you know job to cyber security what would be the type of um experience would you expect or hope to see i'll add really quickly to this one i know we have just like a minute or two left but um what we tend to look for isn't necessarily tons of experience because to what's been discussed already we can teach you the technology um but do you have those skills to be able to go learn it and apply it and communicate it when you need it so any type of project that you have that you can speak to you know intelligently like this is what i did i built this application and they have nothing to do with security but if you can speak to it and the choices that you made that's really what we tend to look for um i will also say i'll let them add something if they want but feel free to reach out to me if you want um i'm happy to talk to you about some entrylevel jobs or different types of um jobs within the field because i know there's it's kind of weird when you talk about it like okay what does it mean to be in network security and what does it mean to do all these types of things and where do you start um i'm more than happy to help but yeah wonderful thank you i think it's important to understand what because there are so many different niches of infamous security um there is even cyber psychologists right so there's just so many different aspects of the field is being understanding where you want to narrow that down and then where do you focus your education or those requirements from my standpoint and working like within the biso team um if you understand at a high level of different security domains access controls logging and and so forth the rest is teachable right it's really those soft skills that we really do look for being able to communicate between your technology partners and your business partners being able to listen to what your business partners are looking for and then how do you solve for that um and how do you articulate you know risk up to your to your leadership teams or even to your manager right if you see something at risk how do you how do you bring that to their attention in a timely fashion thank you mary so uh i said that what the cyber security world needs right now it's a different different perspective uh so an english mayor a biology major are qualified just because they have the analytical skills or the communication skills to succeed in different areas so it's not it's not it's not that only computer scientists can go into this field but there is a need for different type of thinking and approaching problems so that we can actually solve the problems that exist because a hacker doesn't necessarily have a degree for anyone that's a great point great well thank you um thank you all for joining i think that was our very last session thank you thank you for inviting me thank you guys so much for joining us we're so um it was so interesting and it was so much information um i know i really enjoyed it um i want to thank our panelists you are fantastic i want to thank our alumni for joining us this evening if you guys want to take your camera camera phone out and take a a quick screen grab of the of our qr code tonight and there's a quick survey it takes less than a minute to complete if you don't mind i'm filling that out for us it'll help us determine what our upcoming topics might be thank you so much and have a wonderful evening i think we're done what do you think i think we just log off mary i think that's what's happening i didn't ask how we end this session thank you guys so much that was fantastic oh my god i i wish we could do a lot more deep dive but that was really fun that was fun it was meeting you all likewise bye
