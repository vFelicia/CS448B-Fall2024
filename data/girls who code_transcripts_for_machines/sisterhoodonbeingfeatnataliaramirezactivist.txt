I always knew that I wanted to make an impact and I thought I had it all figured out I would become a nurse and make a difference in people's lives after a few months I realized that focus wasn't making me happy and I began to explore other options when I discovered computer programming it was love at first sight I loved the infinite number of ways technology could change one person's life or even millions of lives I finally felt excited but when I got into the software engineering program in my school I was intimidated by the fact that most of my classmates were boys who seemed like they knew what they were doing I had to remind myself that I was just entering the field learning how to walk when the boys already learned how to run thankfully a teacher introduced me to girls who code suddenly I found myself learning new skills and more about myself than I ever thought I would I found my voice and how to finally use technology to make an impact on people's lives most importantly I found a family a sisterhood a bond that shared with all girls who loved to code you
