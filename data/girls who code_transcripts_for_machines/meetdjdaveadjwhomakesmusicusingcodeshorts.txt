what's up everyone happy pride month i'm dj dave i am a new york based musician and dj and i'm a live code musician which means i use code to produce and perform my music i use a live coding environment called sonic pi which uses a language based on ruby i decided to integrate live coding with traditional djing normally with dj you are limited to the music that you have on your hard drive but with live coding you can genuinely read a dance floor and create a song that you think would fit well in the moment and play it the live coding environment i use is completely free it was created as a learning tool and i highly suggest anyone who has any interest in learning live coding to start there there aren't enough women in stem and there's definitely not enough women in electronic music so i hope this can inspire somebody to give sonic pie a try or give any other live coding environment a try and join me up on these stages that are very eager to see more nonmale musicians up there too
