haven't been sleeping as well as I would like to and I'm a big advocate for sleep we can talk more about that the importance of sleep but I am also a student of hope and the power of the hope of hope the healing power of hope you mentioned that I was breast cancer survivor so you know that's something that that I discovered during my treatment for for cancer the power of hope and so you know I think it's a it's an interesting emotion because sometimes it laid dormant until we really need it but it's so powerful when when we do find hope and that's going to leads me into the next question which is you know what has been a career or personal moment of yours that required the most amount of bravery I think for some of us we thought we experience it all until the past couple of months you know someone once said to me you won't you almost get to really know yourself when you're actually in the valley and I think so many of us are in the valley right now um so if you could share kind of again a personal moment of yours that require the most amount of bravery and how it turned out that would be great and viewers get ready to answer your icebreaker question with the poll features this is gonna be the first poll question of the evening so stay alert because you got 30 seconds to respond after that box pops up so join us and share your answer yeah I don't mind brush my going first I so my I think my most brave moment happened for me probably about five years ago and so I will just share with most of you because similar to you I'm a technologist at heart and with training you know my undergrad is computer science and I have an MBA from Kellogg but really I I really enjoy solving business problems using technology and innovation and right when I hit a stride in my career in 2015 I really felt like my career I had become a stalemate right like that I'd stopped growing so I did something I was truly uncomfortable with which is to take a big risk in talking with one of my sponsors and advocates they told me you know I needed to leave an area that I was very comfortable in learn something brand new and really get out there and offer and for those of you that are used to operating in your comfort zone not only this time has probably shook in you to your core but when you're in your company you will have moments that will shake you to your core and this was one of those moments for me where I took a calculated risk to move out of IT into our business operations I had to learn HR from scratch and I really fell in love with it and ended up doing something amazing for myself in this space and so um I I think the one phrase that I'll kind of share is that through fear comes courage mmhmm I love that and I wanted to share this kind of corporate message with you because you'll find yourself in lots of situations like that where through fear you can get courage and courage will be the thing that really helps you transcend into new areas that's powerful thank you for sharing that Tracy yeah yes sir I do yeah the moment for me was about six years ago and I have been at Deloitte for 21 years in various roles and this moment that that I'm getting ready to describe is what actually led me to my role as chief all being officer and so about 60 years ago I found myself completely burned out I woke up one morning I could open my eyes but I really couldn't actually kind of even get out of bed and engage in life and work in any meaningful way and so I was forced to take time off because I because I had to for my own health and at my own physical and mental health and in doing that and kind of coming back from turn burnout and defining what wellbeing meant in my life defining what boundaries meant in my life and really looking at what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be as opposed to just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next you know I had always um I'd been successful because I always prided myself on you know being the hardest worker working the longest hours and you know letting my work speak for itself and that was what would get me the next role or the next promotion without really being intentional about what I wanted to do and you know what was important to me in my life and clearly I ended up burned out so I don't recommend that as your strategy but you know coming back from burnout I became very passionate about the topic of holistic health and wellbeing and really wanted to share what I had learned with others so that they didn't you know they didn't end up where I ended up and I was going to resign from Deloitte and I went to talk to my leader and mentor who is still a dear friend and tell her that this is what I wanted to do this is what I wanted to focus on and you know and that that I was going to you know resign from her and she said to her and she said if you need this you know why doesn't everybody else need it so go back and you know put together a business case and so that's what I did if it together in this case for why wellbeing matters and why we needed a role and in programs and tools and resources for our people and I called up other leaders and you know ask them to give me a chance and let me try this but I really believed in it and if it didn't work that I would leave the firm and so there is no risk to them and that was about five and a half years ago and I'm still at Deloitte and it's still going strong so it has worked out well so far but it was you know really brave moments to say hey I'm gonna I'm gonna dive in and try something that I really believe in and if it doesn't work out I believe in it so much that I'm willing to leave and go make it you know make it work somewhere else that's powerful well thank you so much for sharing I know we've done a poll to see where people are at um and well how many people said it was their professional life versus their personal life so I'm looking to see um what viewers have to say um in the meantime you know I think if I had to answer um I don't even know what I would say I feel like it's both right it's almost like at times for me I would think that I feel like me you know we both about all what both of you talked about it's almost like your body tells you that you gotta rest like your body tells you that it's enough like your body tells you to make this professional change and that's certainly what happened to me at 33 when I was in this job that I didn't want to be in in the life that I felt like I was stuck and that was that was really a change for me to start kind of living my life more bravely and you know taking the rest because you can never be brave if you're tired and you know I mean doing the things that I needed but that we needed to do to basically take care of ourselves um I am still looking for the answers I know it just popped up okay yeah yeah so 84% said their personal life and 16% said their professional experience which makes sense because you know we're talking to like I just said like I got my mind made my bravery in my professional experience when I was 33 years old when I ran for office and up until then it was like moments in my personal life and I'm sure for both of you or you were to really push yourself thank you guys and thank you for the for our participants for participating in the poll before we dive into conversation I want to let folks know that today is going to flow a little differently than it has in the past three sessions we had almost 500 of you submit questions around ways to maintain your mental health well just incredible during this time and it was really eyeopening for a lot of us who were able to kind of see your questions and I'm not going to say that I didn't get emotional a lot for that reason I really to make sure that girls are protein wanted to make sure that we took this entire session to answer your questions and to focus on many themes that we saw being repeated over and over again I want everyone to know that girls our code would respect everybody's privacy and we will not be sheets of sharing who submitted questions but we want to thank all of you for your thoughtfulness and for being motivated to help heal the world not to put any pressure on you but it is on you right now to save us and to save this country because we have given you a broken broken nation that I know that you will help fix and part of getting you there is to make sure that your mental health is in check and hopefully this conversation will help you on that journey I want to move tonight into into tonight's discussion and I do again want to say one more time I want to thank you guys for your honesty and for your candor and for your rawness and for your authenticity there's a lot of emotion in these questions and I know it takes a lot of courage to submit them so again from behalf of all three of us Tracie Jennifer and I we want to say thank you so the first questions we're going to talk about are some of the coab and related questions you know in the media we're hearing conflicting information about what's happening you know some states have lifted their or stayathome orders others are saying the numbers of cases are going up some people are saying in the number of cases are going down I mean I have two young children I do not know what I should be doing at this moment at all and I'm sure all of us feel that way so I can't imagine what some of the folks on this call of you feel because you're depending on leaders to give you answers and they're not right now and it's very confusing so you know the first set of questions kind of going to address how Buuren affected and the ways to manage your health and wellness at this time so I want to start with question one here we go I feel blessed to have been offered a virtual internship but I am struggling with anxiety depression and being productive when feels like life has just and then exploded I want to show up as my best self this summer but feel that if I share this with my internship manager my offer will be rescinded do companies support interns and employees who suffer from mental health conditions or do they fire them Jennifer can we start with you yeah absolutely and so to start and companies absolutely support employees that struggle with a mental health condition as a matter of fact it you cannot be fired based on you know this simple fact that you you struggle with your mental health or you are diagnosed with mental illness and it's actually not even something that you are required to disclose in any way shape or form to to your employer unless you choose to and if you choose to it cannot be held against you grounds for firing you know that would be solely based on performance or some other reason why you would need to get me or separated from the organization but it would not be based on the fact that you struggle with your mental health or you were diagnosed with a mental illness and I think I'm starting there because I think that that's really really important for people to know and to understand the laws that are actually associated with that and but beyond that you know and within Deloitte and my role at Deloitte so first of all I am I struggle with anxiety I've lived with anxiety for many years and we prior to coltd and I'm very open about it I've actually been published and has a Business Review talking about my my struggles with mental illness and what organizations and leaders can do to support their employees and so at Deloitte we have a lot of programs a lot of tools and resources or a program called mental health at work we deliver mental health first aid training so that everybody understands what mental health and mental illness is and how they can support one another have compassionate conversations with one another about their mental health but I would say also to whomever submitted this question and just anybody the feeling heightens levels of anxiety depression worry whatever it is you're feeling right now first of all like know that it's totally normal every single person on the planet is having their mental health impacted right now and if they're not I want to talk to them and study them because the rest of us have something to learn and so I think that that's really important just to know that it's okay not to be okay all the time and give yourself some grace some compassion some self empathy and if you do need help you know reach out and get the help you need whether that's you through a friend family you know in the community or you know through through your employer but do not you know do not let it fit persist do not struggle alone you don't have to and it is absolutely nothing to be ashamed as we really need to do everything we can to to normalize the conversation around mental health in much in the same way we do as our physical home Thank You Jennifer I appreciate you saying that it sure there's a study out I think 86% of people right now are experiencing anxiety depression from some mental health issues yeah yes you're not alone you know it's literally you're not alone yeah I think that that was before it was one in one in five I would struggle with their mental health and in a year and now it's four and five given coated and then all of the racial injustice so it's it's literally all of us yeah it's all of us um Tracy I am I just want it first of all I'm just so humbled by that question because it just shows how courageous right you are you all to just ask for something that's that's gonna help you and I just want to start by saying you have to be willing to give yourself some grace between kovat and the systemic racism and inequality that's literally on the display for the world to see we're living in unprecedented times we aren't we navigating normally would be would be interesting navigating through this is a new reality and so there's a couple of things I want to share first your question around how can you set yourself up for success right with your virtual internship I want to encourage you to advocate for yourself you you really should speak to your internship manager and understand what's expected of you also what you really need to be successful you know as you head into the summer and so try to think about ways that you could balance you know your work commitments with things that you need to do to just get personal relief from stress and use it as a time to advocate and negotiate the schedule that works for you so this is a time for selfadvocacy and it's a time that everyone would understand and you don't have to feel like you're alone secondly I think you know Jennifer hit it right on the head it's not acceptable to discriminate against anyone with a mental illness in corporate America in the nonprofit space we all don't believe in that and we have built a structure to support you and so at Accenture we have this philosophy and I'm sure you've heard of it right about truly human we we believe that people bring their whole self to work which means your mind your body your heart your soul right your your all of that you your mental wellbeing is as important as your physical wellbeing and so there are lots of things that we have tried to put in place to help others and I'm sure other companies have have done the same so we we do have an Employee Assistance Program so it's for interns as well as employees and it's confidential right you can call 24 by 7 and get the resources you need everything from face to face or virtual consultants with a zero tolerance right against any type of retaliation and there's mental health employee resource groups so you you there are communities of people you know that will wrap their arms around you that are also feeling this so that you have a comfortable space to be able to talk through issues so as you're going into your companies kind of seek out those gr G's and use it as a place to really share and feel comfortable and then there are you know lots of mental health allies like we we have about 600 people across our company who you know through a peg or a phone call as an ally but you can reach out to you and get help and so I just I really encourage you as you start your internships to to seek out the things that are there for you and know that you're not alone and it's okay not to be okay I love that phrase and we for sure need to honor that today I think this next question goes nice into where you as sort of what are some record recommendations for prioritizing mental health and selfcare while struggling with technology fits fatigue and getting used to the new normal working from home so the two things I do is I turn off video I know in my video but like you know a very wise engineer told me that the reason why we're so exhausted after video is because of the delay time right between when somebody's actually talking things your brain is actually doing more work than if you were just on the phone so in the beginning we all wanted to see each other now I'm like I just want my leg it was Danity backs I'm free on video the second thing for me is I've tried to maintain my routine so I like to I workout and you know at 730 in the morning even though the baby's waking up and the dog wants to go out I just I'm out the door and I'm running and so doing doing something that has that I do at a time it's inconvenient for everybody else is the key because it's made me keep prioritizing myself so those are the two things I've been love to hear what you guys are doing for me I agree it's really been about setting a routine because just to give context prior to kovat I spent a lot of time on the road so I you know is in I'm in multiple countries several times a month and it's it's been different being physically in front of a computer all day every day I have as you saw to two young daughters who were homeschooling and a husband who's a lawyer that's on calls ten hours a day as well and it's it becomes difficult to separate kind of work from family right and you also separate you being on versus off and so one of the things that I did was really set a routine where you know I agree to kind of work 900 to 400 and at 400 I turn everything off we go for a walk as a family we've actually discovered the park across the street that we really never had time to visit and we sit out there and read and just enjoy each other and you have to kind of put those boundaries in place for yourself so that you can physically turn off the other thing that I'm really passionate about asleep you know sleep is an essential part of recovery that your brain your body needs to be able to to be at its best every day and so a lot of people don't realize that not getting enough sleep is is just detrimental to your overall health and so I although I fail at it most times I try to get at least eight hours my downside is seven hours but I don't really go past that because it's so critical and then I would say the third thing is and hopefully this will help you is practicing an attitude of gratitude particularly right now as I start to think about you know other people's situations what's going on broader in the world I truly appreciate one having a job being able to contribute and being able to help others and that has been uplifting for me there's actually a great book that I'll see if I can quickly find the link it's called the book of joy it's cowritten by the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu and it really gets to the simple things in life that we should we should appreciate right and sometimes that gets us out of our focus on just getting deliverables done and checking off the checklist and really enjoying life for what it is and so that's been also helpful for me thank you that's a wisdom they're permitted Jennifer would you share yeah absolutely and I think some of mine will be repetitive and but certainly is like I call them my selfcare nonnegotiables and they involve eating sleeping moving is myself similar to to the two of you and and you know in terms of technology and you know I put I put my technology to work for me and so if you look at my calendar it has time in my calendar for breakfast lunch dinner movement and bedtime and those are blocks in my calendar and I stick to them just like any other meeting or actually the most important meetings at a point but I have and that doesn't mean that I can't be flexible and they don't move around here and they're a little bit but it means that if it's in my calendar and you know it's I will stick to it and then it's important and that I don't let you I I hold my boundaries and the other important thing is is you know communicating what your boundaries are and what your needs are to others whether they're in your home whether you work with them on you and creating that that culture and authenticity and trust and letting people know what you need and asking them what they need you know in you know supporting one another and so if I've found that to be really powerful I think you power over routine routine is so important right now to help us and maintain some sense of normalcy those of you you know echoed that so I think you know all of those things are important and then one final strategy that I will share I mentioned before that you know I live with anxiety and struggle with anxiety and prior to kovat I used to wake up in the morning and do a little gratitude journal or write five things that I was grateful for and with all of the anxiety that I've been having to connect of it and said I switch to my gratitude list too and out of my control list and so I wake up in the morning and I write down all the things that I'm worried about that are completely out of my control that I can do nothing about and just getting them out getting them on paper and then moving on with my day but also a couple times a week and you know it's in the beginning I did it every day I have a 20minute worry appointment my calendar and for 20 minutes I fit and worry about all the things that are on out of my control list and it honestly has become like torture like by the time the 20 minutes is up I'm so tired of worrying you know that you know I put it down and if those worries come up again later on when I'm trying to engage with my husband or my family or if I'm trying to sleep because that's one of the times when my worries seem to creep in I just remind myself that I have a worry appointment tomorrow and that I can get to those worries then and they'll be plenty of time and space for them and that's been a strategy that's been really really helpful for me during this time Thank You Jennifer so our last question for this segment is just starting out in the workforce it's exhausting straddling the line of expressing our thoughts to make an impact being unprofessional and being successful how have you identified reasonable goals stay productive juggled worklife balance and ferment to burnout throughout your career whoo Jennifer do you want to start yeah so a great question and I think based on and my introductory comments clearly and I did not survive I didn't avoid this burnout and and so it was not something that I did really well in my early days and I think many of the things that we have already been talking about are really really relevant but you know getting clear with yourself by using finding finding strong mentors creating a community for yourself of people that will talk through your goals and your problems and you know help you you know find a path forward is really really important and I mean it's people that you know from all walks of life you know different ages different races so you make sure that you're you're getting all kinds of different points of view I found that to be just really really valuable to me in my life and you want people in your that aren't just yes people that aren't going to just say oh yeah that's a great idea every time you you know you you bring them an idea or you discuss something with them you want people that actually are going to say hey you know maybe that's not such a good idea right now or I don't see you you're loving that or maybe you have you know too much help scoring your plate right now and you know you can hold off on that for for for the time being and so I call it my own personal board of directors and I and I think that that's something that has been really powerful for me post burnout and you know just just put the whole conversation around boundaries that we have I mean eight you know boundaries doesn't mean always saying no I think boundaries get a bad rap because boundaries just you know sound rough and tough and but I've always been fascinated by the fact that you know we we we have you we have boundaries for our home you know we we lock our homes to make sure that that people don't come in we lock our cars but we don't pet Balinese for our own personal health and wellbeing or we have a hard time doing that right and so we protect our we protect our things but we don't protect ourselves and I think you know when you when you put when you put it in those words that you're kind of like oh yeah you know I really need to have these boundaries and so boundaries aren't always about saying no but sometimes it's about saying no not right now or no how can I engage in a different way or no how can I find someone else to help you and I think that that's a really important skill for everybody to learn because early in my career I said yes to everything and it doesn't work and it doesn't get you to where you want to go all the time right I mean just saying yes does not does not get you you know to to your endgame a lot of times it takes you off track no traces you're going to add a floor in the next segment yeah I think you know I did just one quick thing so I really feel strongly about this area and I know why you're you're asking the question and I'll just share something personal no one will really remember that I was a managing director in Accenture what they will remember is how many people that I helped how many walls did I take down really what how did I Drive some systemic change and the way to be purposeful is to not take on too much and so I will just share a personal strategy that I have I really have come up with three things that are important for me the first one is I want to be present with my family my second one is I want to be an authentic leader right my I want to live my core values through my leadership my third one is I want to make an impact in my community and so what I do is as opportunities come up as people you know bet for my time I compare that to my three right and if they're not part of my three I use my voice to say no right and so so using your voice to say no gives you the space to truly live a life that's purposeful and impactful and so just keep that in mind it it's it's worked for me for the last twenty years and I truly feel that you know I'm gonna be able to create the legacy that I'm looking for I love that it's very clear Thank You Tracy now we want to move towards another set of questions that's gonna address the injustice against black and minority communities and again these questions were incredibly thoughtprovoking they were raw they were honest people shared their fears and their thoughts and again I want to thank everybody all the folks that are on this call for doing that I know it's hard and as Tracy said so many of you are just we're exhausted and so taking the time to write those questions I am expressing gratitude and I'm on behalf of all of us for that before we get begin I'd like to pull the audience and ask how are you feeling at this time so while people are answering this question it has been I'm not feeling great not to date myself but you know I remember Rodney King you know I was out on the streets when Trayvon Martin died and Eric Gardner and whether I was organizing your protest or marching in a protest I feel like my son Shawn grew up making protest signs you know asking for people to be able to breathe asking for our black brothers and sisters to be was free and so to watch but we watched and mr. Floyd's murder was was just you can't unsee that and to see how many of our our black brothers and sisters and how much of a toll it's taking on them is hard and and painful and so I've been doing the work and of course as always I always see girls we are an organization that's fighting structural racism everyday and so we have been double downing on on our girls we've been having really powerful conversations with our staff last week was really emotionally hard because we had a lot of hard conversations I thought I spent the entire week just crying with them I like all the leadership lessons of like not crying with your team we're just like out the door and I learned a lot from them and so I am grateful for that reflection in this moment sometimes again you have to be in the valley right to take a good look so that's all I'm feeling I know see if I'm learning how to do this holy most of the audience is feeling doubtful and confused which are tied at 26 percent thank you my hope though is that you leave this conversation and you feel prepared to fight another day ah we need you like some of us in this room where I think we're all kind of in the same age group we've tried and we failed like our generation our leadership has failed you and so you know I earn that through Roy has this great thing about how we're in this portal between the past and the present right and these past leaders are just need to make room for the future in the future is you and so I hope part of this conversation tonight leaves you feeling exhausted but hopeful so our first question is is this as a young black woman from an urban community I've been told countless times that I have to work ten times harder than my suburban white in Asian peers to be seen which has proven to be true what are some of the methods I can use to remain steadfast and assertive in my goals in to invite impostor syndrome when faced with immense negative pressures from others in society Tracy I'd like to call on you as a black woman as a black leader with your background in de and I how would you answer this question yes absolutely and I you know thank you first of all thank you for the bravery of asking us question because it's something that we often in the africanamerican community talk about with each other but it's important to bring it into this conversation right to talk about it with our advocates and allies so I I just want to share some truth first right the reality we as africanamerican and black women we must work harder as we are still living in a world or unconscious bias exists and we're underestimated these were the facts and my suggestion is that you practice selfcare along the way so that you don't burn out but delivering at your hundredpercent is a must and if you can tie that hundred percent to your passion right and really get clear with the mark that you want to leave in the world based on that hundred percent what you will find is that that's gonna bring you inner peace it's gonna bring you focus it's gonna bring you dry and that is going to sustain you and I'll just share my story as I mentioned Reshma I am you know I'm a technologist at heart and I I Drive innovation for Accenture every day but many times when I walk into the room people think I'm part of the team instead of leading the team mmmhmm realtime and my my purpose but my purpose as an africanamerican woman at Accenture is to run a core part of our business one day it's to be part of our C suite as a P&L leader right and my purpose is I want to show that that can be done while being married for 20 years raising two beautiful children and without a massive support system around me and really staying active in the community my purpose is to show that that can be the new normal just like The Cosby Show and I'm definitely dating myself with that but just like The Cosby Show was something that everybody aspired to be I want this to be something that is inspirational for you and so although I'm tired and the whole idea of worklife balance honestly doesn't exist I practice selfcare because it's really about fulfilling that higher purpose thank you for that Jennifer's you have anything to add how you've assisted colleagues with certain situations okay I mean first of all Thank You JC that that was very powerful and inspiring for me and I'm sure so many people listening so yeah I appreciate that and I think it's really important for me as a human being it supported for me in my role to support our colleagues be you know an ally but a huge advocate for africanamerican and black colleagues and women in particular and and should truly and help empower them to make sure that they are taking care of themselves because that is so critical along this journey especially now I mean just the amount of emotional fatigue the trauma and the grief which is really a very misunderstood emotion and it's not linear and it's something that in some ways probably all of us are experiencing just from the loss of life as we knew it and I think that's where the doubtful and confused comes in but you know my passion and my purpose is really to empower people so that they understand that if selfcare isn't selfish self care is essential if you are going to change the world and in those that we're talking to you today are truly gonna change the world and so you have to prioritize that and don't ever let anybody tell you not to it is the number one thing that you that you must do in order to you know to persist to be brave and to be successful thank you so our next question how would you suggest navigating a workplace where you're seen as a token minority how do I relieve the pressure of feeling like I have to represent every woman of color in every conversation Wow right so I'll start with the first one because I skip this question all the time when I'm speaking uh at companies in like women when little clever ghetto come to me and be like I don't feel like I belong here and I look at them as like you belong here and then some because you had to work ten times harder to get here right and so part of and it's almost like the secret that like I know but it's a secret like they really don't believe that they are that like the guy over there like he's the one who snuck in not you and so part of it is like this journey of like how do you tell how you teach women women of color to tell that voice in their head that tells them that they're not good enough that they're not strong enough to just be quiet you know and so that is one of the things that I am like on a journey to teach our young women Traci I'd love to hear from you and you to Jennifer I just think that that's so powerful I really do you know so first let me just be clear and talked to all of you as a woman of color you have been selected to join the organizations you are in because of the skill that you have because of the unique value that you bring I just I need you to just take a minute and digest that and once you've digested that I want you to understand that you you're never going to be in control of other people's perceptions of you so don't apologize don't overcompensate you lay faith in the fact that you were meant to be there and then what you do is advocate for yourself again I think one of the first things that you have to do is deliver and perform deliver and perform if you don't leave this call with anything that you know to help Rashmi get get past this inner voice that we said is inside of our head delivery and performance yield results right and in companies results speak for themselves their unrefuted so regardless of the perceptions that people may have or the unconscious bias when you get to the results that becomes your ability to continue moving forward the second thing you do is what you know I think Jennifer spoke so nicely about is really build a group of Board of actors around you write your personal board is your sponsor right like having a group there's nothing like a group of powerful sponsors who can tell your story and help advocate for you to get into new roles and and do things and you'll you'll quickly tell that I love to read because there's another book that one a person on my personal board of directors gave me to read it's I think from Harvey Coleman and it's really about the unwritten rules inside of of companies and you want people whispering that wisdom to you along the way so as you're delivering right you're not bumping into things that persist because of cultural and systemic issues that you don't need to and then I would say the last thing you need to do is really realize that there's if you think about a circle and I talked to my mentors about this mentees about this all the time in the circle is a hundred percent ten percent really represents your skills it's what you bring in the door thirty percent represents your image how are you showing up and so that bringing that confidence being willing to to kind of come to the table and lead the entire rest of that circle is about exposure and so sometimes we get so focused on heads down doing the skills doing the work and we forget to look up and think about the exposure that we need to can I keep going so leaning on your personal board of directors owning the things that are in your control not out of your control will help you be successful I gotta go to the last question and Jennifer all you start answering this one so although I am NOT black I don't want to support the black lives matter movement movement but I don't want to be arrested beaten or seen as not employable for speaking out on the Internet how can I safely make sure I let people know I want to help those in need and to help sustain real change once the outrage is over yeah so that's a question that many of us that are better than black right now and you're trying to figure out and for me you know that looks like learning listening researching reading and you know one of my passions is mental health and reducing the stigma around mental health and you know creating a system that is fair and equitable for everyone to get the mental health care that they need and so I have spent a lot of time in the last several days learning about the history of mental health in the black community and so that that that I understand where they're coming from and what will be helpful for them and just letting that want my colleagues and my friends know that that I'm there for them and you know oneonone through encouraging text messages you know I I have been speaking out on the Internet I think that that is a very personal choice that you have to make and if it's something you want to do and I feel very passionately about it and I think that it is something that it needs it needs to be said and needs to be heard over and over again and it's not something that we can you know you know get get you all outraged about and put down you know three weeks or no that's not what we're being asked to do that's not what we need to do and so I think that the Internet is is a personal choice I I don't know you know whether you would be you I don't know if you would be judged or not remote from a work perspective on that I think many great organizations are actually speaking out on this issue directly on the internet as well so I think that's a personal choice but I think there's a lot of other things that you can do to support your black friends and probably right now and you donating money as well but for me it's really learning listening and in doing my research and figuring out where I can truly help in focusing they're focusing on what I can control yeah so I'm not gonna tell you go get arrested but I kind of want to UM but I think this is the moment to be an ally and to be an active vocal ally that's what we need like that's what we need right now you know black people have been in the streets fighting for justice for all of us not just for them it's for all of us and so you need to have you need to almost put yourself out of your comfort zone a little bit and go there um thank you everyone for your
