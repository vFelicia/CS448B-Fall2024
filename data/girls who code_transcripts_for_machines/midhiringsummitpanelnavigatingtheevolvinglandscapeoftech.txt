good afternoon everyone thank you so much for joining us for our panel on navigating the evolving landscape of tech my name is mar marcoo I use she her pronouns and I'm the manager of content and instructional design at girls who code today we have an incredible lineup of speakers who will discuss how current trends in Tech are shaping the industry in just a moment I'll introduce you to our panelists if you have a question for them you can drop it in the Q&A box at the bottom of your window as we will have some time for audience Q&A also please note that close captioning is enabled if you would like subtitles you can click on the live transcript show subtitle button at the bottom of your window to turn them on okay now that Logistics are out of the way I'm excited to introduce you to our panelists first up we have Patrice Drake Patrice is a distinguished cyber security expert with 15 plus years of experience in technology cyber security and business Consulting as a proactive leader Patrice has been instrumental in innovating cyber security strategies executing security operations and contributing to significant industry reports such as combating ransomware a comprehensive framework for Action Patrice a proud resident of the Washington DC area combines the energy of the city with the Quiet worlds of video games and fictional books welcome Patrice thank you next we have Kira Masters Kira received her BS in mathematics with minors in mechanical engineering and chemistry from the University of Denver she has been with Accenture for almost nine years where she is currently a data science manager Kira has worked on multiple projects mainly in the health care space involving machine learning Predictive Analytics propensity modeling optimization demand forecasting cross Channel analytics and customer segmentation when not at work Kira loves taking her three kids to explore the City of Austin welcome Kira thanks everyone our third panelist is Amanda Robinson Amanda began her career as a software engineer in 2010 she has previous experience with big Tech as well as startup work and has been in the public interest technology space since 2015 when she joined 18f she is currently a fellow experienced supervisor at us digital Corps where she helps early career software nav and software Engineers navigate their work in the federal technology space welcome Amanda thank you so much good to be here and thank you all for being here so let's let's go ahead and jump right into our discussion first set of questions is going to be a little bit about merging Technologies so how would you describe the current landscape of tech and how are emerging emerging Technologies impacting job opportunities okay sorry goad I didn't know if it was to someone specifically you can go ahead Patrice yeah so my focus on on cyber security really gives me a unique perspective of how this emerging Technologies such as Ai and machine learning things within cyber security itself that affected like ransomware and of course I think there is another one such as Cloud which has been there but is really making a um a big impact on the way that businesses like mine deoe um shifts and does its strategy so I really do see that things things that are business focus or these companies that you're partnering with or thinking about as you move into your career um these emerging Technologies are what we're looking at too and these three at least are big for for us here over deoe there was a second part of the question and I need to also adjust my camera it's getting fuzzy for some reason everybody I apologize was there a second part of that as well uh how do you how would you C and how are emerging Technologies impacting job opportunities ah yes so we see a huge demand for technical skills here um starts all the way down at the participants level right we definitely like to partner with those that are early in their career um seeking out like Talent that's um either on campuses or like I said shifting into Tech so we're at a bit of an underemployment for Tech the technical industry at large um so we do see a rise in the demand for those skill sets a need for that skill set and really competition for you know those that are here on the webinar absolutely thanks so much Patrice K I know you you had something I mean it's pretty similar to Patrice because deoy and Accenture are both consulting firms um I know when when I graduated like data science wasn't really big and so just getting into that you know growing your skills you can start from anywhere really and just build up your skill set as you go like I didn't take any python or R coding the only thing that was offered at my college was Java at the time so that was not great for what I do now you know and so it just kind of shows you the ever evolving landscape you know I've been with Accenture nine years and it's changed so much I have to know you know I've learned six different programming languages on my own just to keep up and that's really kind of what you want to focus on is just keep building building your skill set you know and um technical skills are so valuable so useful to um inside and outside of wherever you work you know it's just analytical thinking critical thinking um strategizing honestly and I think kind of navigating those Waters is is great tool for for anybody um the jobs we've definitely seen gone up generative AI with Chad GPT coming out like you're going to see t tons of spaces now opening up job markets to anyone with generative AI prompt engineering um learning how to do foundational models and building up from there uh definitely has changed the market we're investing so much money just in generative Ai and in our employees who know that kind of um technology so definitely change changes all the time so definitely be keeping on your toes uh I would definitely Echo that as well I think the the biggest constant in this field is change there's always new languages always new Frameworks and Technologies um so yeah being able to go with that flow to learn those languages um I see the comment that it's amazing to teach oneself six languages on your own which it is but also I think like probably all of us have learned a new language for a new job or a new project at some point in our careers um and that just becomes one of the skills is just knowing enough about um what the overall differences and similarities are to be able to learn those things and I think the creative problem solving stays the same throughout and that's what I think is the fun part um and what is like really the heart of what I would say is uh software engineering at the very least I think data science does get very analytical as well oh thank you all so much and am and I really appreciate that phrase uh the biggest constant is change right those two things don't sound like they belong in the same sentence but they most certainly do especially in this industry uh let's move on to our next question and again anyone can jump into answer um what emerging Technologies do you think will have the biggest impact on job opportunities in the tech industry in the next few years so AI was a good example we've definitely already touched upon that um other things like cyber security machine learning what are some of the technologies that are going to have that big impact uh so I would definitely say AI is a huge one it's also very much in the news right now so a lot of people are thinking about it talking about it um so it's very of the moment um there's just an executive order on AI uh that mentions digital core as a way to hire um Ai and AI enabling um Talent into the federal space but also uh similar to other previous changes I think that it'll shift the shape of work but not fundamentally change it um some things will get automated in the way some things have previously been automated at by all of our uh idees and everything um some of the work will become standing up these uh large language models and other sorts of um AI tools and but there will still be I think that creative problem solving is not something that AI has solved or I would guess is close to solving um others may have better information on that than I do I'm not following that closely that field but um but yeah I think it's it's just a different um a slightly different Focus but a lot of the same fundamental work yeah that's a fantastic answer um I I want to also kind of add to that I know we talked about AI but it is massive right um I I made I think a comment on LinkedIn where I said a lot of people are afraid in our industry in Tech of being replaced by Ai and what I really see is a more credible threat of I don't think you'll be replaced by AI so much as you'll be replaced by someone that's using AI to do the same work you do um so right I mean embracing artificial intelligence adopting it and really augmenting it where it makes sense is crucial coming in to Tech and realizing that most people are um not as well versed as some of the data scientists that are out there that have been dealing with this for a while put you on a pretty Level Playing Field and I want to make one more comment too that I wanted to add or add for the emerging um uh Tech landscape so I'm here in Washington DC deoy one of the three hubs where we do cyber security you'll see behind me there aren't a lot of people because remote work is also having a huge impact on the tech industry so you better believe we're working and we're delivering services in Tech but we're not necessarily doing it from offices anymore so that's that's a huge impact on the landscape as well um but yeah fantastic answers yeah and I want to like just Echo Amanda and Patrice like excellent answers and uh AI just is a huge range range of employment like it is not just one specific thing like there are multiple different positions multiple different uses so when we say AI it's not like pigeon holding you to any one specific task and like we always get those fears of new emerging technology like when cars were invented they were like oh my gosh it's taking away jobs from Carriage people you know like it's so silly you know that we think we still think like that even though over like we have such a record over time of how technology innovation has actually improved our job opportunities our landscape our economy like all of that and it has just created new jobs like when I was in college data science wasn't a job and now it's a degree you can get in college in MERS you know like there's tons of opportunities and there will be tons of new opportunities so even though we will use Ai and it might replace some jobs jobs it will create new jobs so I wouldn't be too worried about it like erasing jobs you'll just have to change with the technology absolutely we definitely just have to lean in instead of shying away when we know that this is something that's not going to go away anytime soon um all right we're going to shift gears a little bit and talk a little bit about upskilling and transferable skills so something that we've kind of touched upon a couple of times and gone around um how do you all think that individuals prepare for the opportunities and adapt their skill sets accordingly so you've talked about how things are constantly changing what are some things that people can do to prepare themselves for change I would just get wellversed you know like on what you want to do you know um study up on it talk to people in those Industries networking is your main thing that you need to do is network network network like reach out to people don't be afraid to go on LinkedIn reach out and say hey I'm really interested in what you do can we can we talk about it how did you get started because everyone's story is so different you know you can see people that didn't get Tech degrees are now in tech jobs or vice versa you know like how did that happen how can you make that transition what kind of courses can you take to upscale kind of thing so that's what I I would say yeah I'm a big fan too of um getting involved with organizations communities I mean you found your way to girls who code webinars I like following certain content creators too um both on Tik Tok LinkedIn um there's a lot of good PL people in the space again I specialize in cyber security so really staying in touch with your cohorts and peers is huge because you get to see what they care about and a lot of times especially content creators will um we'll talk about the things that the industry cares about right they'll be in Cutting Edge conversations or playing with that new tech or seeing how people are thinking about that so if that's what I did at the beginning of my career it was a little bit different because of course content creation wasn't as huge and content creator wasn't as huge but still like just staying involved in certain groups associations was was a really good thing as well too to keep up with everything yeah that's those were um great answers I definitely want to Echo like keep on learning new things don't be afraid of trying something new when you change projects or jobs just because a team is um is using a language that you haven't used before that is often expected um in the industry you will start a new job and have to pick up Python and people will help you with it and they'll be patient about that because that's just the way it actually works um so like go and try those new languages try to learn new things all the time take advantage of those programs if your job has them where they'll cover the cost of going to a conference or of taking a class or something um and I think um I think that like one of those things you do see with that like automation of pieces of a job um that we're see starting to see AI contribute to is that it gets rid of a lot of the like sort of mindless boilerplate part of the work and that means you can focus more on the like more deep thinking pieces of software engineering and I would say like between that and the Very remote um heavy job uh cultures and Landscapes that we have now try to be very mindful of your mental health as well and of how you are taking breaks and how you are getting a mix of like that really deep thinking that you will be doing a lot of and something else because I think um doing 40 hours a week of coding when sometimes what you're doing is you know creating all that like boilerplate you need to do for new Java class or writing out the unit tests now your IDE can just write some of your unit tests for you and you need to know what mistakes it might make and what to look for but um yeah like 40 hours of just deep thinking is a lot for a week so figure out how to find that New Balance now that like some of the old balance is going away absolutely and throughout this piece of the conversation we've mentioned a lot of different transferable skills so before we dive into um some audience questions I'd love to ask you all one more question to think about and I'll ask each one of you to answer so if in thinking about those transferable skills if you had to narrow it down to one specific transferable skill that you think job Seekers should leverage the most for longterm Career Success in this industry what do you think it would be so one big transferable skill that you think is like the most important and I'm gonna ask each one of you honestly it's it's not Teck it's communication honestly like for me uh just being able to communicate what you're doing like how you're doing it everything communicating with people uh I think that is the biggest skill to have you know because you could be Tech savy all day but if you can't explain your work or have an understanding um of how to like visualize it for someone else to understand who's not tech savvy like you're not going to just hand someone an Excel spreadsheet and be like here are the results like no like you have to be able to communicate and so that's what I would say is communication yeah I I I almost I'm almost reluctant to give my answer too but coming from consulting which deoe is a huge consulting firm um it's networking so to my introverts I know I know I know right I'm an extrovert so I get it um but being able maybe under that communication umbrella too to meet other people who may not know what you specialize in to show up to that thing to reach out um networking is actually very very beneficial people tend to like people or excuse me people tend to gravitate towards people like them and getting Beyond just those that do your day in and day out it's really really beneficial to get you know your name out there to understand what's going on I think networking is it's a very very good skill there's a great book too I'll drop it in the chat um it's Captivate but I need to find the entire book and I've recommended it to more than a few of my Ms um great answers I hadn't thought of either of those uh I'm going to cheat a little bit and say like learning new skills is a big skill but to do that I would say that like the fundamentals of computer science can be really really helpful so that's kind of understanding the algorithms and data structures that are being used Underneath It All and like you don't have to reimplement anymore but knowing how they're going to work is still going to be really helpful knowing the sort of fundamentals of how programming languages work and what are some of the differences you see between them so that then you can learn new ones more quickly how code is executed because that stuff is not changing and that's like how you're going to understand how to do the work well in addition to just doing it all right thank you all so much for going on that Journey with me I know it's hard to narrow it down to just one and I don't think that answer is cheating at all amand I think that definitely represents a lot of what we've talked about so far in this panel um all right so thank you all so much for sharing those insights we're going to move on to some questions from the audience so remember audience if you have a question for our panelist you can drop it in the Q&A box at the bottom of your screen uh so first question do you think it's better to have a degree in Tech with the changing landscape as opposed to having nontraditional experience I think so honestly um Tech degrees are just so versatile and like if again like communication can be learn or or you kind of naturally have that uh technical skills it shows you can think critically you can think analytically you can work in groups do group projects you know I I still think personally um I know Amanda and Patrice might have other ideas but personally for me I think Tech degrees are still very advantageous I'm shaking my head because I'm like wow this is a good question we in the industry ask all the time it's not just degrees people also ask about CTS do like and you'll see people say that certifications don't necessarily you know equate to someone's skills and so I will tell you that Tech degrees and certifications make it easy easier for Fortune 500 companies to quickly identify what you're capable of same thing with like your portfolio of work I often will ask somebody to give me you point me to their repo because it just cuts down on me understanding and like quickly seeing what you do and don't know um the whole industry is still kind of young compared to something like legal and medical where they're stringent uh requirements so you will see a path to success even without a degree but each year that we continue to grow I I do see that tightening and gravitating more towards something more substantial especially for these big companies um I think maybe a little bit differently about this I think it depends a lot on what your goals are um there are definitely a lot of companies a lot of those like big tech companies the Fang companies if you know what that means um are very much looking for some kind of computer science degree um or something specific to the work um a lot of startups uh and just other places are less concerned with that formal background um so depending on what your goals are it might really be easier for you be a better strategy to learn some of the basics get a bit of that like GitHub built up or something like have enough to show that you can do the work and then go do the work for those like two to four years instead of doing the the education and then getting into it there are certain skills that are used on many uh software engineering jobs that are not taught at many academic programs and that then people start working and need to learn on the job anyway um that's not 100% um but it's things like doing code reviews and um writing unit tests writing code so that it is communicating what it's doing back to uh K's Point earlier um so it's going to be different for different people and I think that it's certainly like maybe not having um the resources to go to fancy for your program should not prevent anybody from getting into the field there's many ways to do it without that formal training even though I did just say like those fundamentals are important and finding ways to learn them is still a good idea great thank you so much and that actually leads into our next question which is a little bit more about how someone can stand out so that they're not just written off when they're when they don't have a lot of experience or they come from a different nontraditional background ground or they're a career changer so you mentioned Amanda a lot of different things that someone could do to kind of build their experience is there any way someone can kind of showcase that so that they're showing yes I do have some experience or I do have these transferable skills that would apply in this situation how can they stand out if they maybe on paper don't have the background somebody might be looking for I think like Patrice said like she looks at kind of repos stuff like that so reos not won't always have what you've done for like a job in the past but they could be your academic work as well so you could do something like that where you say Hey you know even though I don't have professional experience I have done these types of projects on my own time while also working as I don't know a project manager or something so then I have the organizational skills as well as the coding skills to do that so definitely play up your past experience for professionally like whatever you've done will be transferable like it doesn't matter retail you have to deal with customer service you know working in a restaurant same thing but you know if you want a technical job you do have to show that you know how to be technical so definitely having a repo having some kind of example they can see that you you've done the work work but you're looking for a change so that that's what I would say um I think that um somewhat it's like based on your interests try to get involved in some kind of opportunties while you're still building your skills too so maybe that's volunteering um showing that like you have done this work in different contexts can help in some cases um definitely having some work for somebody to look at can be very helpful um extra bonus if you can find a job where you get to write code in open source so that like that all just happens automatically um but I know that's difficult um and then networking does really help so again you know while you're maybe if you are in an academic program if you're doing internships like try to get one or two new mentors at each internship and keep those relationship as you continue your degree so that by the time you're graduating you have a few people to talk to about it who might be able to connect you with opportunities um and um and then yeah like the volunteering kind of shows your interests and like helps you maybe show relevant um contextual experience to the jobs you might want to be applying for after great thank you all so much now we've talked a lot about networking and communication and the scary things that are also things that are not going away in any industry um and we did give a call out to some of our uh some of our introverts out there who maybe don't love the idea of having to network so we're going to close with this question do you all have any advice for anyone who has impostor syndrome and are apprehensive when trying to network how can someone work around that I would I would say treat it as like an acting role like it's not you it's someone else at least that's how I've seen it sometimes because I definitely I get very nervous on interviews I talk and ramble and use my hands and put my hair so I try to like go into it as like I'm an act it's not myself but I'm portraying someone who's you know really composed and really so smart and so just put together you know even if you're not feeling that if you can just pretend for the 30 minute interview that at least that helps me get through it like put your mindset in a in in that kind of situation where you're like this is not me this is someone who's cool and calm and collected you know like I would that's that's what's helped me I don't know if it works for everyone but that's what's helped me in the past with interviews yeah impostor syndrome is there even for the most experienced right again another good conversation that happens for those that are 10 15 20 plus years wondering if hey is this or or is someone going to find out that I don't know everything about this um industry it's Tech you don't know everything about this industry neither does the person next to you but in your own right you're smart you're learning you're hungry you are engaged so I I would say that you know don't be surprised if others feel the same way have that empathy but keep going keep going yeah I think one of the best um remedies for impostor syndrome is just talking about it and asking questions um especially early in your career nobody expects you to know everything to start so um and asking questions is a great way to build your knowledge and build your skills on the job it's also fundamentally what mentorship is all about so having a mentor like building Mentor relationships it actually works best if you can come to that like the C call the email whatever it is you're doing to try to me people come to it with a couple of like questions in mind with some things that you want to learn from them um and that's really that is what it's all about right so and it's it's constant learning anyway so always be willing to just push through that fear and just ask the question and you'll see sometimes they don't know either and they'll help you find an answer and that can be really like validating right to show none of us know everything um and sometimes they'll know and they'll be happy to share right love it another great quote none of us know everything definitely something to keep in mind always we're going to go ahead and wrap up our discussion but espe conversation with two girls who Cod alumni will take place later this afternoon at 245 p.m. you can find the link in the auditorium now please join me in thanking our panelists for dedicating their time and expertise to our conversation Patrice Kira Amanda thank you all so much and have a wonderful day thank you thanks for having us thank you so much
