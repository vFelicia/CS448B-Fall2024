hello I am Rebecca Wang I am 16 years old and my dream job is to work on autonomous vehicles since my childhood I had a passion for watching Formula One racing and my passion evolved into real life when I learned how to code through growth to code summer immersion program through the program I gained a supportive Sisterhood and the confidence to apply to local research internships at universities currently as an 11th grade student I am building upon my research experience to physically construct and program an autonomous car from scratch I am forever grateful to grow to code for giving me the first opportunity to explore computer science and engineering
