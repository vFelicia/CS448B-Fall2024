everyone for participating in that poll will have a couple more as we go tonight but now that we are all acquainted let's move on to our panel discussion much like the last session we've designed tonight's questions to address the concerns of our college aged alumni and students across the country who are either at the very beginning in the middle of or ending their college experience and we're gonna start with the effects of covin 19 for those earliest in their college experience are rising or firstyear students I'm sure that we've all read and our panelists have certain written have certainly written about and covered the impact of Kovan 19 on a number of different industries our inbox is full of questions from students who are just beginning their college journeys and are concerned about what this means for them long term so our first question is this is the tech industry recessionproof or will the pandemic impact tech companies and tech hiring Claire this question is right up your alley so let's start with you yes so I think this is a really interesting question right now because there's the question of is tech recessionproof and then the coalbed related recession I think is is sort of a different ballgame you know on one hand I think that all companies you know at some point will be touched by the economic downturn you know tech companies in particular might lose the sorts of business deals you know they're providing tech services to other businesses businesses we're experiencing a cash crunch might rethink whether they're spending that money but I think that you know something that koban 19 has really sort of created is an acceleration of sort of the digital transformation that we're seeing I mean we're experiencing that right now that we're all talking on the student call and businesses are working remotely people are going to school remotely and it's been sort of a scramble to figure out how do we do that how do we do that better and so I think that it's actually a really excite an opportunity for the tech space right now to start to think about how you know how can the industry drive that transformation improve the way that we're working right now although I think things will start to sort of go back to normal we're also gonna see more and more businesses figuring out like Oh can I be more flexible with my workforce can I let more people work from home you know what's up what kinds of automation do we need in order to you know work more effectively in this new environment and so I think that there'll be a lot of opportunities both for so if the big tech companies to drive that kind of change but also potentially in the startup space you know new idea it's coming for it forward how to address the kinds of problems that we're in and so I think that you know even if the tech space is touched in this moment that we may see it you know come out of the sort of economic downturn more quickly and jump on those kinds of opportunities that makes sense tonight I know that resonates with me at least as a consumer of tech and all the tech that I'm using now that we're working from home Courtney is are you seeing something similar does that resonate with you yeah so just to piggyback off of what Claire said um I don't know if we can really say that tech is recessionproof I think we're seeing covet 19 impact all industries and all companies in some way shape or form but I do think as Claire said it is causing a lot of companies to rethink how they go about hiring to rethink how they go about operating their workforce I mean we heard I can't remember if it was earlier this week or last week where Twitter you know the CEO Jack Dorsey now said that employees will be able to work from home forever I read something we know Google will allow employees that work from home you know at least to the end of the year and so I do think a lot of companies if they haven't already before the pandemic they will start to think about the value of having more flexibility and how they can work that into their workforce in Courtney as a follow up do you think hiring will stay steady as a result or are you expecting it to kind of dip in the short term um I think it depends on what type of company in with industry I mean I know even in my own recording I've spoken to a lot of economists and they speak a lot about how even though we've seen you know cuts or you know layoffs in a lot of different industries but we're also seeing like an increase in telehealth and so what does that mean for people who work in technology so I do think that this is a time period where I think sometimes when you think of tech jobs you do only think of like the Google's the Facebook's the Twitter's but I think that's the time for it you know especially college students and those who are graduating to really open their eyes up to what other companies may have positions open so is that a telehealth company how can I be a benefit is it a finance company that's looking for somebody in their tech department I mean literally every industry has a tech department so I think this is really a time to just kind of like maybe open up your eyes to see what other industries my skillsets and experience to be useful for that's such a great point thank you is what we see a girls who code that Tech is transforming every industry and so it's not just tackett's financial services its consumer packaged goods companies its healthcare companies that are all becoming tech companies and doing tech hiring all right and thank you for sharing our next question is going to be geared towards assisting current college students whose academic experience has been completely redesigned in the last couple weeks and then as we know next year as well so the question is Scott Galloway who is a marketing professor who predicted both Amazon's Whole Foods purchase and spoke about weworks IPO a month before it's actually decline it actually declined is now projecting that big tech companies will take over the higher education space and we've seen this model before in the past where tech giants have teamed up with elite universities like MIT and Google Microsoft Berkeley Harvard and Facebook so our poll question for audience members we're gonna ask you would you be interested in attending a college or university that partners with tech companies and like last time you'll have 30 seconds to respond and while we wait for responses Claire and Courtney a question for you is going to be are you seeing a rise in industry and university partnerships and what opportunities do these collaborations present for current students or matriculating students I'm just going to wait a minute to see the poll responses Wow so an overwhelming 96% of you said yes you would be interested thanks so much for your candor that's a really interesting place to start our conversation I'm so corny I'd like to start with you this time what are your thoughts on whether we're gonna see a rise in these types of partnerships and what they mean for students yeah so um I do hope that we see a rise in these type of partnerships I won't be surprised if we do especially considering the time here that we're in I do I have seen like a lot of companies are now looking for virtual interns and so I do feel like if they already had that relationship with different universities and they may not you know if there isn't this big college forever they already have relationship let's say for instance you know the technology department at Yale or the technology department at Georgia State University this will really help them to stream that pipeline of hey we're looking for interns and we're looking for entrylevel employees let's partner with this University and see who they have in the pipeline I think programs like that are super important because I think a lot of times sometimes in the tech industry you hear about people from the same University is getting the same opportunities and so I do think that these type of partnerships allow companies to broaden their horizon where they're looking at talent and it allows students who are graduating is I had access to mentorship to have access to sponsorship which is super important from the start of your career to the end of your career and so I do hope that we do see an influx of these partnerships between universities and big companies and I think your your point about how do we make sure that we're bringing those opportunities not just to our very elite schools but to community colleges to HBCUs to state colleges where the vast majority of our students are going is so important and hopefully something that that tech companies will be interested in Claire what are your thoughts gee is this something that you see that could kind of further democratize access to education is it something that's gonna remain among the elite schools and and what does it mean for students yeah I think sort of along the lines of what Courtney was saying I also hope that we see more of these kinds of partnerships I think something that this moment in time has against would have accelerated is or brought to light as how valuable Sciences and whether it's computer science whether it's other types of science you know how important it is to be able to move quickly when problems arise to address those things and I think a lot of times computer science is a valuable way of doing that tech is a valuable way of doing that you know I think of IBM and the cloud computing sorry excuse me the supercomputing consortium that they've created to help develop vaccines and treatments for coronavirus I think that you know another way great way of accelerating the science that we do is Department with these universities whether it be those you know top universities that we think of ORS you know big state universities community colleges like you said I think that those that those partnerships can be really valuable in sort of moving science forward and addressing the kinds of problems that we're seeing today and I would agree with you I think that it's important that that again we see these kinds of partnerships of all kinds of universities and I would encourage students to look at you know is it not just the big you know as does Google have a partnership with my University but what kinds of companies in my local area are wanting to be involved with my university and whether you know you take the class that gets you into that lab or not and if if a company is on campus and wanting to be involved with students that's not proper tunity to reach our say you know you know what kinds of opportunities are available at your company or can I sit down and have an informational interview with you especially while everybody is sitting at home right now I think it's a good time to try and you know ask for networking ask for advice and so yeah I do hope we see more of those kinds of partnerships Claire you mentioned some really kind of practical things that could benefit students as a result of these partnerships can you expand on that a little bit more both what could potentially be available available on campus and as well offcampus at the companies themselves yeah I mean I think you know again like you may be able to get into a lab and do some research or work with an executive maybe there's an executive from a company that's running a lab or partnering with a professor I think a lot of times and you know professors that work at universities are a good place to start a lot of times those folks are still really connected within the industry and so I think it's a good you know it's a good place to start with networking and that can be a really scary word sometimes you know like sounds sounds a little I don't know it to me it always this is a little scary and so I think that I think that that's a really good place to start in terms of making connections with people in the industry it can feel a little less scary if you already have that connection of oh we're both connected to this University and so you know can I take you with it right now you can't take anybody for coffee but can I sit down and have an informational interview or you know can I ask your advice on what books by industry leaders I should be reading right now as I'm as I'm hoping to get in industry I think those are really really cool opportunities that having a company connected to a university can provide great thank you for that I think that practical advice is really useful to is we think about these bigger questions so now we are gonna turn to what next steps are student to be graduates it should be thinking about in taking and as we see companies restructure in response to covet and invest more in things like AI and automation it seems like technology is more vital than ever and we know this impacts the job market and it will lead to a shift in the type of candidates that employers will be looking for so what roles and skill sets are currently in highest demand and TAC and kind of the adjacent industry is like FinTech or healthTap Courtney is you're our careers expert I would love to start with you what have you seen since the onset of koban 19 um so yeah so just in some of my reporting and interviewing and interviewing and talking to different people like I mentioned earlier especially considering the time period that we're in the telehealth industry is definitely hiring a lot but beyond that I think just in terms of the skills that employers are looking for especially now where for the time being there isn't a lot of facetoface interaction so they really are looking for people who have like amazing verbal and written communication skills and I think that's across any industry because a lot of times especially during this time period you're reaching out to people over email you're having a virtual phone interview with that internship if you are doing a virtual internship you're speaking to your boss or your mentor whoever over Skype or over zoom and so people are really want to make sure that we have young people come in who can communicate effectively as well as like I'm seeing a lot of employers talking about emotional intelligence and being able to like really be able to manage certain issues as they arise and might be able to like emotionally communicate how you're getting through it how you're managing it I think this is a crazy time for you for all of us but I do think that written in verbal communication is just super important I think that those are two skills that regardless of the time period they're going to always be needed I think regardless of the industry or go is of what level employers are always looking for that and yeah and like I said telehealth is like the number one industry that comes to mind right now and and also you know like I said in in finance I was looking online the other day and I see how like Bank of America they have open positions in various different departments and even with that with their internship program they're still saying they're going to pay their interns for the full 10 weeks of the internship program and so I think that's that's a bright spot in the midst of what's going on when you do hear that some companies are taking back their internships I think now it's a good time to look at what companies aren't and to see how you can fit your foot in the door there and what departments are looking for interns or entrylevel positions thank you for that Courtney are you seeing that companies want specific majors or minors or they move more focused on skills like writing and communication like you said I think the good thing is they're more focused on skills I think we hear all the time about how some people may have a degree in a certain career field and then when they graduate they go in and pursue a career and it's completely different field and so I think the good thing is like a lot of companies are open to saying like okay even though we might you might be a finance company but we aren't only looking at people with an accounting degree we are only looking at people who majored in economics like we're open to people who majored in whatever it's subject but as long as they had the skills that we're looking for as long as they have like the determination that we're looking for and they can prove that like they can actually get the job done they can help us to solve problems they can prove that they can be a value to our company I think really is more so about the skills that you bring to the table and how you communicate those skills is super important that's great to hear Claire have you seen something similar yeah I think I think that Courtney made a lot of good points about those soft skills that are really important I think that right now companies are looking for people who are flexible and adaptable because of this really weird situation and so I think that right now could be a really good time to demonstrate that you're able to do that you know whether it's that you have a virtual internship and so you need to be even better about sort of keeping track of still connecting with people who you're working with or you know maybe maybe the internship situation is more challenging and so you do some freelance work you know that sort of thing I think that that being able to prove that you you know don't only need to work in in one way and sitting in to ask adieu your work there I think that right now is obviously more important than ever I think you know maybe kind of an exciting thing about the time that we're in is that companies of all kinds like we've talked about are looking for to be able to transform and are looking for solutions and nobody really knows what the right answer is and I think that means that the right answer could come from anybody it doesn't need to be the leadership in the company who says you know I have an idea about how we can do things I think that you know everybody here everybody in this program has been willing to step out and put themselves maybe in a in a situation that's slightly less comfortable than they might like and so I think you know if you have an idea if you're willing to be a little bit creative and speak up about that it's a good time to kind of be brave and raise your hand and be willing to try things or put yourself out there a little bit I think I think that you know is hopefully sort of a hopeful thing about this moment that we're in and then again I think as far as sort of specific industry trends again in the sort of AI automation telehealth obviously is a great example of that you know all companies will be looking to make this digital transformation so maybe being creative in thinking about your career path and not just thinking about the big tech giants but what are some other smaller companies that might be looking to make this transition and need that the skills and the help that you could provide in doing that I think that's a good place to look that's great thank you and I love that you use the word bravery which is one of our core values of girls who code in something that we talk a lot about and teach in our programs we see that girls are going to need to be open to raising their hands even when they're not sure because that's what boys are doing and it's interesting to hear that particularly in this time of a lot of uncertainty that you think that applies EE in the workforce as well so thank you clear and Courtney for an amazing panel discussion we are going to now transition into the Q&A portion of our evening we've selected questions from our girls who code alumni and community who are viewing this conversation and would like further guidance about navigating the tech industry during this pandemic we've selected three we I heard before the call that we got 150 and so hopefully we address some of those already and please keep asking questions and the chat our team is there to answer them as well the first question comes from Michelle Jay her question is globally most industries are implementing work from home policies due to this epidemic well companies be more susceptible to accepting applications from international candidates Courtney this was something that you mentioned and your response I think to our first question about work from home and more flexibility can you expand on what you think companies are gonna be open to in terms of where they're willing to hire from yes I do think that will be one of the beauties of greater flexibility and the option to work from home is that not only will companies be able to tap into a greater network of talent but employees will also be able to tap into companies who may not be per se located in their particular City I know right now even if you look just within the US you you know especially when you're looking at tech you automatically think of like the New York and the San Francisco and maybe like Austin but those are places where everyone can't live whether it's you know it's for various reasons but those are also like expensive cities and so I do think the benefit of if more companies are open to a remote workforce is that they will be looking to hire people regardless of location as long as you have the skill sets they were looking for then we're looking to talk to you I think also one benefit is if companies do already have an international presence which a lot of big companies do I think they may be open to like I said even expanding that internationally in terms of you know when they're looking for different positions well hey if we already have a small team in London I don't see any harm in hiring an issue of a person remotely there or in turn remotely there to work there and communicate with all of us so I do think that is the benefit and I think it'll be beneficial for both employers and employees it just expands the network of the talent that's coming in and providing you know people who are looking for jobs with more opportunities to look for jobs outside of their one particular area thanks for that intro Courtney Clare I'm curious how you would respond to this question yeah I think I think again this is gonna be something that you know hopefully will be a benefit coming out of this is this increased flexibility and I also think it's sort of an opportunity maybe to to differentiate yourself if you live in a place that's not you know like Courtney mentioned one of the big tech hubs San Francisco the New York and you know the the customers that tech companies serve are not just on the coasts and so being able to say you know I'm someone who understands a different place and what the people in a different place need and how they interact with technology in a way that that maybe it's different I think that that being able to bring that outside perspective that you know those places those tech hubs can be kind of insular kind of a bubble and so I think that yeah being able to say I have a different perspective and that's really an asset and now it's easy for you to hire me because you figured out your work remote situation I think hopefully that will be something positive that comes out of this whole situation Thank You Claire and I guess a followup question to both of you are there things that you think international candidates could do to differentiate themselves from US candidates i Claire you offered the kind of perspective of being outside the US are there other types of things that you think would be beneficial for international candidates applying for what what used to be usbased jobs yeah I mean I think a trend that we're seeing in the tech industry is you know the attempt to move into international markets emerging markets and so many of the ways that that again those people in different markets interact with ecology is different and so having that you know I think you know the way that people use money and a lot of the tech companies are trying to get in to get into ecommerce get into the FinTech space so saying I have an understanding of how people in my country in my community use money would use digital technology in that way telehealth I think is another example just you know being able to think about and really sort of explain that that outside perspective that you bring being from a different place that's certainly something that tech companies are looking to do so I think that that could be really valuable Courtney I see you not did you have anything to add um no yeah I just completely agree with Claire I think as she said you know with when a lot of tech companies that they're looking to go to tap into international marketplaces it's always good if you know you can come to this table and you're willing to be vocal about hey I know what our consumers want in this particular area I know in a lot of times su there's different workplace cultures and so companies want to be able to smoothly transition into that with someone who's right there and who's on the ground and so I think if you can bring that to a company I think that really sets you apart and to be honest it also helps saves a company money because then they don't have to worry about someone in state that they're having to travel and worry about relocation and you're right there and you can tell them firsthand hey this is what consumers want here hey this is what may work here and may not work where you are but this is what works here and I think that could be really valuable to a company thanks Courtney and yes I was just reading an article this morning about what all what work from home means for commercial real estate and companies that have invested in these massive office towers or campuses that may no longer need them anymore so it is really interesting to see these big systemic shifts that are going to be happening we're already happening our next question is from rod Etha a as the hiring environment changes due to coded are there any emerging or niche fields that will satisfy needs for technology employers Courtney Clare up to you who who wants to take this first um so yeah I think as we both mentioned earlier I know we've said it multiple times but telehealth because that isn't going anywhere anytime soon Claire mentioned a lot about AI and automation and I think just in general this has really this time period for a lot of companies if they didn't already have a digital presence if they did it already take the need for them to be digital seriously I think this time area is forcing them to which means I think what that is going to come at increasing them realize I'm like oh hey actually we do need a software engineer actually we do need more people in our tech program to help us with these tech issues that we're having and so I do think that this will force a lot of companies to really invest in like their digital presence which in turn will lead them to needing to hire more people to help them make that transition to tech Claire I've been wondering if since we've talked a lot about these industries that are rising in the wake of Cova that we'll need digital skills even more I'm wondering if you have some practical tips about where you can find these jobs and places to look for people who are searching for some in these more particular niches yeah I think I was thinking a little bit about this and and you know it's almost like being a college senior being somebody who's hunting for a job you're kind of newsgathering about your industry and so I was thinking about how I sort of look for trends and you know try to follow these kinds of things I think you know following industry leaders on linkedin or on twitter a lot of times you know maybe they're not saying hey i need somebody who could do X because we're trying to take our company in this direction but maybe they're saying well I'm really excited about this new opportunity for our company or this new direction or we're trying something new and and that's sort of a hinge like oh you know they're gonna need people who know how to do that kind of thing then that kind of direction so I think that's one really a great way again I think you know going to going to mentor is going to professor ism saying what are you most excited about about you know where where tech is going right now what what this whole thing is going to change I think that you know getting the getting the discussion started that way you know what are you excited about what what you know is the most important thing for your company right now I think that's sort of a good way to get into having those kinds of conversations with people that might lead to an internship or a job or you know just a you know in a new way of thinking about your career path that's a great point about using your professors as a resource and even former professors if your school has already ended I'm sure they kind of have their fingers on the pulse of what's happening right now in their industries and are wanting to point graduates in the right direction Courtney are there any tips that you would provide for how to find these jobs um yes I still would say rely on your Career Resource Center send them an email and ask them where certain alumni are working at and if they're willing to connect with you I would also say there are various different platforms out there like I know handshake is one platform where they spotlight a lot of career opportunities and I was just looking at this like the other day and they have positions on there of companies like Amazon and Facebook and Apple that who are looking for entrylevel positions as well as internships there's also a new platform that I just found out about this living called hiring 2020 and that's also their twitter name and they're also specifically spotlighting companies that are looking for interns as well as entrylevel positions for the class of 2020 and on there like I said that's where I found out about the Bank of America position and how they're still looking for interns and they're looking to still pay them for the 10week ten weeks if they're completing their internship and so there are a couple of different platforms out there I think this is a time period where social media is really your friend and so I think because right now you know we aren't able to have that face to face interaction at career fairs or Career Center so I think it's super important to have like a list of the top people in your industry or even if you have a particular company that's maybe like your goal company figure out some of the people who work there add them or LinkedIn maybe even follow them on social media a lot of events down there were supposed to take place in person and now happening virtually and I think that's a benefit because now if say for instance it was supposed to take place in New York and you're not based in New York if it's a virtual event then you can attend it now and then that could be another way to connect with someone who otherwise you know you may not have been able to connect with unless you were in their city that's a great point the silver lining of this and some great resources for our viewers to check out Claire is one other thought yeah that sort of came up while I was listening to Courtney and I hate so I've read this in one of my CNN colleagues and had a piece in the last week or so about you know internship hunting right now and I hope this hasn't happened to anyone but one of the things that was suggested there was if your internship has been cancelled and or you know postponed or something weird has happened there to reach out to the person who you were talking with who you got hired by and say uh sir you know a lot of times companies that hire interns have specific projects they want interns to work on so so asking like is there any project that still needs to get done is there any work that still needs to get done that might get to a freelance gig or you know some sort of some sort of project that you could put on the resume down the line I think I just you know being creative in that way about you know it's it might be more challenging this summer in the coming months but who can you ask to get a project to get an informational interview it's just something that that you can talk about then later down the road you know there was this challenging time in my career but here's what I did with it that's a great point thank you for sharing that alright our last question comes from our former girls who could alumni team intern Camille Dee she asked landing a job or internship at a huge tech company is going to be more competitive than ever with hiring freezes offers being rescinded Claire as you just mentioned and inperson recruitment events being canceled how likely is it that companies will roll out new career opportunities at the end of the summer like they've done in the past Claire do you want to start sure yeah so again I think it's you know obviously it's such an uncertain and tricky time so it's kind of hard to know I think um again especially by the end of the summer maybe this you know this opportunity that we've talked about the tech companies really kind of jumping on this digital transformation the moment that we were seeing I think that you know hopefully a couple of months down the line those opportunities start to open up that companies start to you know they have a little bit more of a sense of at least where the world is going where the market is going that kind of thing so I'm hopeful that we'll see those opportunities start to pop up a bit more again I think that that you know looking for you know looking beyond those big tech companies and thinking you know maybe about being creative about the career path that you saw yourself taking you know maybe there's an opportunity to volunteer with a nonprofit that that needs help with that digital transformation again I think like looking at freelancing opportunity this is like they thought I need in a lot of cases especially the big tech companies might take the opportunity to scoop up some talent that you know maybe startups are having a smaller harder time you know certainly we've seen layoffs and hiring freezes and so so it could also be that the big tech companies take the opportunity to hire more they have the resources to do that and so yeah I would say don't don't lose hope that's great to hear and that makes a lot of sense Courtney I love tasks as a followup question how or to what extent our company is proactively addressing diversity in their hiring particularly as they think about having rescinded offers or delaying some of their hiring later in the summer or a year um well I can really only speak to what I hope companies are doing because like I said I know this is uncertain time for everyone but I do hope that companies during this time period that are being mindful of especially if they did already have a group of interns where they were hoping to onboard if they did have to resend those offers I hope when they do pick back up I hope they are keeping in mind who they're looking to onboard what schools are they coming from so they're making sure that these aren't students who are coming from the same schools these aren't students who are coming from the same regions these are students who are racially diverse gender diverse I hope those are at top of mine when they are looking to pick back up with hiring I'm just kind of a piggyback off of Claire I do think that a lot of the big tech companies because of the money that they do have I do think they have more resources to pivot quickly and so I do hope that you know I won't be surprised if you know some of these internships may become virtual internships I think be open to that and what that will look like but I do hope that companies keep diversity and inclusion at top of mind so you can't just bring on diverse candidates and then you you know and that's done you have to also make sure that you have programs in place for them to feel included that they don't get on board and feel isolated so I do hope that companies will if they have had to put a halt on hiring or a halt on internships that when they do pick back up they will keep in mind who are we bringing on board what backgrounds are they coming from what schools are they coming from what experiences are they bringing to the table so that way they know that they're getting that best group of incoming talent to foster and to be the next generation of leaders thanks for that Courtney and girls could we very much believe in hope for that as well Claire are you seeing any trends when it comes to companies proactively addressing diversity and they're hiring right now um yeah so I think this is this is perhaps a little bit outside of my you know realm of coverage but I do think like Courtney said that that just becomes even more important as we think about solving new kinds of problems thinking about you know how different kinds of people interact with technology differently having a range of perspectives in your workplace and and making a workplace that is open to hearing all of those different voices and taking suggestions from all of those different voices I think that tech companies in particular trying to serve everybody can only benefit from from having a range of types of people ages of people in the room and and really listening to all of those people yes we really agree and I think particularly in times of crisis we need a diverse range of voices around the table or we're not going to solve these really tough problems in front of us so that is the end of our discussion I hope you all enjoyed our time together tonight as much as I did and if you did please let us know right now by completing a 1minute survey to give us feedback on tonight's conversation you'll all you have to just pull out your phone go to the camera hover your camera over the QR code that's now on the screen and complete the survey we really appreciate it and take any and all feedback very seriously so thank you for contributing and on behalf of girls to code I want to thank our panelists Claire and Courtney for joining us and sharing your wisdom this evening and please be sure to follow us at girls who code on social media for more girls who code talks and we hope to see you again soon buh bye everyone thank you you
