hanging out with friends and family thanks Celeste hey everyone thank you all for joining us this evening let's go ahead and jump into our discussion um so the first thing I'm going to ask is um well it's generally considered good advice to research the company and requirements of the job you're inter interviewing for in advance but what specific information should candidates focus on um and Dave I think I'll go to you first with that yeah um so from my perspective obviously I run recruiting at bit site um so there's a couple different things that can kind of pile up on top of each other when it comes to like later on in the interview process that you can kind of pull from in the actual kind of research of the company but I would say some of the biggest important factors would be like understanding kind of what the values of the company are um so at bitsight for instance um about a year ago now we rolled out structured interviewing um to try our best to kind of pull out on unconscious bias um and part of that is we've kind of tailored questions around our core values um and our core values are actually on our website um so that's something candidates can see um and then um just understanding also kind of the value proposition of of the company and and the product itself because as a recruiter when I talk to candidates I give a 10,000 foot view um but at the same time I want to go into the conversation with an understanding the candidates have done at least at least look to the website um just because at the end of the day a lot of candidates uh right now are applying to jobs and there are a lot of people I talk to on a regular basis so what sets candidates apart are showing that they actually kind of care about the job and um aren't just kind of applying to jobs just for um just for a job great answer and Dave actually touched on um something that I'd like to follow up with um for the rest of you um where do you find the information um that candidates should focus on and Dave mentioned like the core values on the website and just exploring the job but if you guys could all touch on that too a little bit that'd be great yeah so um glass door is another big one as well um you can tell a lot about a company based on um kind of reviews um obviously take with the grant of salt um I I think a lot of times glass door it can be the two extremes can be people that love their company or people that absolutely hate something and a lot of times it's not the middle ground but I think it still gives you some insight I can add to that really quickly um for everyone on the call is some sort of a technologist right or aiming to be one and not all companies have the best website right and maybe they you know from a design or branding standpoint it's a great place to start in terms of research but I also think that you know looking at employees of the companies on LinkedIn their Pages the posts that they choose um to post about whatever the content is that they're posting or the company page on LinkedIn itself um again it's about gaining Traction in the market with candidates and um making sure that your brand is reputable and I mean I have some feedback about our own website so I'm not here to knock anyone else except for uh put myself at the Forefront of that but um you know we try to do a good job as a company of saying hey our values are X on our website and the posts uh that we have on LinkedIn showcase those values either through engagement initiatives or how we recognize and highlight employees so that's just another place that you can um capture some of that information as you're prepping for interviews and just a piggyback really quick um because you made a really good point I think PNC also is very active in their corporate uh LinkedIn that's a really good way to also see the company culture what you expect kind of out of how it works in the workplace um if they have a large Market presence um if you're in person or you're virtual um if they have fun events if they're in the community um so yeah I think like she said like what everyone said so far the website your the company's website is probably your first stop and then social media um is a is really big now regardless of the kind of companies um just to kind of piggyback off of what everyone else has said definitely start off at the company website um you really want to focus in on the mission and the values but also look at like what are some of the cool things that the company is doing right now often times um the company highlights some of those things maybe there will be links to blog posts um news articles anything like that kind of highlighting like these are the trends that the company is investing and these are the things the company is passionate about right now and see if there's a way that you can kind of tie in your own personal interests or experience into that and that would be a really strong way to show that like you've done your research you're interested and um there is a possible match there great um before we move on to the the next question I just want to remind all of our um attendees that if you have any questions about anything that our panelists um have brought up while they're answering the questions feel free to drop those in the chat or the Q&A um just a reminder um that way you don't forget and you have to hold on till the end of the the webinar to to get your answer all right so let's move on um what do you think about researching your interviewer what is important um to know about the interviewer before you go into the interview and what do you think about connecting on LinkedIn with the interviewer before the interview um halai uh do you want to take this one first I'm so glad you called on me because I really wanted to answer this question and the reason was is because you really want a job whether that's just to ensure you have a steady income or because you really want to be a part of that company the interviewer and their role in the job process or the role that they have at the company that you're trying to join can tell you the most about um you know whether that job is even a fit for you and I think when you're researching the interviewer you want to know potentially if you can ask the recruiter this why that person is involved in the interview process like are they the hiring manager are they going to be your colleague and appear on your team that would like knowing those Basics about who the interviewer is and what role they play in the process is going to tell you a lot about what type of questions to ask them and give you Insight right because you're also there interviewing the company as much as they're interviewing you so um get to know who that interviewer is and like honestly how you can leverage them as giving you Intel for That interview or for future interviews so I honestly emphasize like researching the interviewer more than in researching the company because that person is also going to be your Advocate potentially down the line and so building Rapport and knowing them and asking them good questions is really helpful um to piggyback off that um I think another piece that's important is um evaluating the interviewers because seeing kind of where they came from so let's say you're interviewing for a job and it might not be one to one the same job you're um applying for that the person is in the seat of um but you can see their career progression um how long have they've been with the company that's a good sign for your career progression as well I know everyone here um is a little bit earlier in your career um so you can understand if the company does promote from within um and then um something I also do um or something I've done in the past when I've interviewed for jobs is um I've always asked to speak with peers um in the interview process um so a lot of the times if you're interviewing for like an engineering job or like a product management job you might meet with a lot of leadership folks uh but sometimes you want to meet someone that is in your seat today because you want to get their perspective as well I think that that's honestly all really great advice and um I I totally stand by you know doing a research on the interviewer prior to the interview I think it definitely helps in terms of um guiding the conversation as well um if you have some insight into who your interviewer is ahead of time um you might be able to kind of preplan some questions that um would be beneficial to kind of guiding the conversation and really showcasing your interest so for example if the interviewer is on a specific team that might be of interest to you within the company um it's a really good way to kind of get some nuggets of knowledge in terms of um what that team does and and really show your passion and interest in that and even if it's not it's also a cool opportunity to be like what other options or opportunities are there so um maybe if you aren't the right fit for that team it doesn't mean you aren't a fit for the company and you might be able to like explore other opportunities in that way um so that's always something super um super um important to do and also thinking about um your questions ahead of time is is super helpful as well um you don't want to kind of go all in being like Oh I stocked your page and I know all of this about you um but if the interviewer you know is is bringing up things about like their experience and their background it would help if you have some questions that align with um what you're hoping to get out of the conversation maybe your interviewer has had a similar career path to you and you can get some um Insight or advice in terms of how you could kind of guide your own career path as well so I'll say my experience with this question is very different um I've only been at PNC and I came in through a development program so I didn't know my interviewer um they didn't tell us and I have interviews like next week and they I don't think they know who I am um so if that does happen to you I think it's still a safe assumption to go into the interview that the person that's interviewing you is was probably in your foot in your in your shoes at one point so I went through our development program I'm interviewing for a development program um so if they come to me and ask questions of like what did you think of the program how did it go what was your experience like that at least has like some um background questions that you can think of in your mind even if you don't know who your interviewer is um in case that situation happens because I know it's gonna happen for someone that interviews at PNC um so yeah that was just basically like you might not know who they are but don't let that PSY you out there's still some like basic questions that you can ask them um because they probably were in your shoes at one point um and I think I forgot to answer the question about LinkedIn as well um so as far as kind of connecting with me on LinkedIn um so I don't know everyone's um kind of experien with this but as a recruiter I get a lot of connection requests um and it's hard to like really stick out when you just send a request a request um so I was thinking about it today actually and I was talking to my fiance about it um and what really sticks out is meeting someone in person and sending them a followup note about your interaction with them because that sticks out it's someone that you've met in person whether it's a phone call or at an event um and you can kind of leave a nice note and that'll kind of stick in my mind more um and that's my perspective as someone that has a lot of connections on LinkedIn just based on my profession but I'd love to get um someone in more in the technical Fields uh advice as well for me personally I I resonate with that as well um whenever I've had an interview I always send some sort of followup to um to my interviewers but I like to do that after the interview as well that's kind of my way of following up um showing that I am still interested um that I want to keep the conversation going and um and and I think that that's like something a lot of times is overlooked is like after you're done with the interview um you still can kind of um show that effort that you are interested and kind of put yourself on the radar um a little more all right those are great advice um coming from multiple perspectives and um it it is um quite awesome to to hear this advice I feel like I'm learning to um so a lot of interviews kick off with the dreaded tell me a little about yourself question um what role do you think that storytelling plays and interviews and how can candidates effectively communicate their experiences and accomplishments through like an elevator pitch without sounding like a robot or like they're running lines that they've rehearsed um Morgan uh do you want to take this one first sure um so the one thing that I think is a really good thing the reason why this is a question is we really want to hear how you talk about your experiences what you've done um we're listening to your like communication skills we're also trying to pick up um things that you've done um and kind of trying to get like your personality um because this uh this elevator pitch can be as personal or professional as you want it to be um so I know like a lot of Prof or a lot of students now have personal projects so this is a great time to show off that personal project um if your school work isn't as exciting that shows that you're passionate that you care um and that you have like a strong ambition which is what we're looking for um and so I think the way to not sound like a robot practice practice with your friends um practice with someone who doesn't know you so they can give you some honest feedback of like I don't I still don't know what you said or I don't know what you're talking about um so don't just practice with friends friends will be easiest but try and get an outside perspective as well and I'll add to that like when you say practice right I've I've actually done this with like I'm going to use the example of like all my little cousins see me as the head of HR and they come to me for every HR question right and um they would come to me like if they're I'm actually updating one of their resumés right now I'm not a big person on like one resumé template is gold there there's different resumé templates that work for everyone but but people that typically are having trouble verbalizing an elevator pitch do better when there's like an objective or a summary that they feel good about summary statement on their resume and that I mean you're not going to write like a long essay as as your objective on your resume it's like probably two to three lines so if you feel if you're a better writer and you feel better as a writer um and you nail that statement on your resume then you can use vocalize that like on a call obviously your resume would also be in front of that recruiter so you're not reading from it but at least you feel comfortable with how you present yourself in writing and then you could start to get comfortable with it verbally so you're not just like regurgitating everything that's on your resume or every internship that you've had um so yeah like that that's my feedback back to people is like if you don't feel comfortable with it part of the practicing element to Morgan's Point is like some people are just better writers so focus on that and then get comfortable with it and start to say how you would start to practice how you would say it verbally I agree with that um and then as far as um kind of why the questions asked a lot of times it's there's no there's no right or wrong answer um it's all about your communication like can you tell me kind of concisely what the important parts of your career are or school or or internship um and it's similar to a resume um a lot of people ask me how long does a resume need to be um there's no right or wrong answer necessarily but I say between like usually one to two pages um as long as you're not like just beating the resume down with every little thing that's happened in your life I would say keep it concise um if it's something that you're proud of a proud project write it down and and similar similarly when you're having that conversation with your elevator pitch um kind of touch upon what your most of um a lot of the times as a recruiter I want to see what you're passionate about um that's what that's what I want to hear about um this is really great advice just um I'll kind of split this into sort of two um subtopics here so for the first one in terms of an elevator pitch I like to think of that as it's sort of a long enough time to get your point across but short enough to leave it open um for followup and so when I think of an elevator pitch um I always want to like try to practice ahead of time whether it be like for an interview um or if I'm going to any networking stuff like I'm always practicing it just so it comes off more natural um and I'm really just being um effective in the time that I have and so I kind of like to have like some sort of structure um behind it as well so really kind of going into who are you um what do you do what is your background what is your intent like kind of what you hope to get out of this conversation and where do you want to be and then end it with with like a call to action so maybe that being um maybe I can set some time for us to connect or or something like that and so um really the goal there is that the elevator pitch leads to something else whether that be a longer conversation just for some insights um an interview um whatever it is that you're looking for and then in terms of Storytelling in an interview specifically um that is so important um you want to be able to communicate your experience and your accomplish um effectively and articulate that clearly the interviewer doesn't have the same um context that you do they weren't there with you during the time that you were working on all of those things and so you want to practice um really highlighting um kind of the brief overview of whatever it is that you've worked on and then highlighting the impact that you had and and that's also something I feel like um a lot of times gets lost is you're super excited talking about the project that you worked on that you're not necessarily emphasizing um the impact that you had and that's really really powerful in demonstrating your capabilities and what you could bring to the team love that answer all right um so what are some other common interview questions that candidates should always be prepared to answer and how can they respond effectively um kin you want to take this one first yeah of course so I think this definitely varies depending on the type of interview that it is as well so maybe it's like a phone screen or an initial interview versus like um a behavioral interview or or technical interview so depending on the kind of interview that it is um and also for the type of role that it is you want to do your research accordingly for example like if you're interviewing for a Consulting role you might want to spend some time doing case studies or something like that whereas if you're interviewing for a Dev role you want to really make sure you understand like technical Concepts and all of that but in general if we're talking behavioral here um a lot of times like I've run into um situational questions like tell me about a time where you ran into this situation and um how did you successfully navigate it so for example tell me about a time where you let a project um or where you had a successful outcome um what was a challenge that you faced and how did you resolve that challenge was there anything that you could have improved on and so a lot of times this is again where story storytelling kind of comes to play I've noticed that like um the first question leads to smaller uh questions afterwards as followup so if it is like um about a project or something that you've worked on there's going to be like smaller um followups afterwards so definitely think about kind of like what went well what would you improve on um some challenges that you faced and um and really kind of highlighting like not just your technical skills necessarily but also how you work in a team and and I think that's a great way to kind of showcase like you as an individual um you're more than just like the work that you do but it's also how do you communicate with others and um and work in a team um yeah so a lot of the questions we use a bit site um are around um just s similar to what um Canan just just mentioned but it's all about situations it's about conflict it's about if there is a hiccup like how do you how do you deal with the hiccup um and a lot of it is just seeing if you're a team player or or a problem solver um another good question that I I personally always ask people is um this is not applicable if it's your first job but if it's your second job um why are you looking and I always ask that question because um anyone can be looking for any reason um but you can also tell kind of the characteristics of an individual based on how they answer that question so if a lot of times people aren't happy where they are but you don't want to bash your employer um and that comes off to the interviewer um so that's my biggest tip to anyone that is looking for their second job or third job whatever it might be um always spin things to be positive and it's all about growth and um and and trying your best to be positive spinning like to the positive is interesting because to conin point earlier like behavioral based interviewing or behavioral based questions are going to ask you situational things and a recruiter may say tell me about a time that you had to lead X type of project um and how you successfully LED it or they may just say tell me about a time when you were bored on the job without saying and how did you make it more interesting because especially from a storytelling standpoint a recruiter doesn't want to lead you to the positive they just want to say tell me about a a situation time where you were dealt with this type of situation and see to Dave's point if you're going to take like a growth perspective or a positive mindset and how you answered it or how you are a problem solver so they'll like leave it openended and if you take it down the negative route that says a lot about how you deal with conflict or whatever it may be so be cognizant of the storytelling component that we were speaking about earlier is that the story is saying I was dealt with this situation or this is how I handled it and these are the positive implications of the measures that I took I mean I can't I really can't follow I can't beat anyone that everyone anything that everyone said because this was really good advice so kind of like to again picky back um especially if you get any of the questions that are like tell me about a weakness again spin it to that positive um perspective like you're not perfect but don't um don't downplay or don't um I don't know expand on a weakness that you think is a weakness that really could just be an opportunity instead um so yeah I I think I love how everyone has said it but like spinning it to a positive light um instead of a negative all right um Morgan I'll just come back to you with this next one at the end of an interview interviewers typically ask do you have any questions for me how can candidates use their preinterview research to formulate thoughtful questions for the interviewer yeah so I think this goes back really well to our first and second questions of researching the company researching the person um this is your time if you haven't asked the question already um to interview the company that you're interviewing for so ask them about the company culture ask them about what other things that they do that's outside of their day job um ask them about any um opportunities for stretch assignments or other um skill like um availability to expand your skills um ask about is the internal Mobility because those are the questions that are really important that you don't want to forget once you're already in the company um because then it just makes it harder for either you to want to stay or continue to be motivated um so again this is your time to interview the company and find out if you will also be a very good fit for them um and I think it's important to always ask questions um it shows your interest as well um and obviously as Morgan mentioned it's your opportunity opportunity to interview the company it's not onesided um so that's what I always tell candidates where it when you get past the recruiter and you talk to hiring manager or other members of the team understand kind of why they're in the seat why why did they choose bitsight um in my situation um I've been with bitsight for 5 years and my favorite questions are why people ask me I've been why I've been with bitsight for five years and why I haven't left um and I always give people people an interesting perspective I don't have this on my LinkedIn but I left bit site for a job to join a seed round company and then five months later I regretted that choice and texted my boss and she brought me back so that's my like number one story I tell people of why I joined bitsight and why I stayed site so that's the type of question that um like I like to ask people is why you chose your job and and how you've moved up as well um I just want to say that to Dave Dave's point that is one of the questions that I always try to ask as well um I always like to connect my questions at the end of an interview to something that the interviewer had mentioned um during the interview to just show that I was listening and trying to make it a little more conversational as well and so typically in the beginning of the interview the interviewer kind of gives like an overview of how long they've been at the company or something like that and so um maybe they they'll say like oh I've been um at X company for five years and then at the end you could be like okay well I remember you know you had mentioned you've been here at five years um why did you choose to be here and um what's kind of LED you to stay being here for for that long and that kind of stuff and and it just kind of shows that you paying attention and that you are interested and also you you get some into um the company culture there um and also if it is like something that you are interested in again like um I I kind of mentioned this in in the first question or second question as well but if there is um a connection to like a particular industry that you're interested in particular products or services that the company offers um anything specific to like teams that you know of anything like that um that you are interested in like this is the perfect time to bring it up if it hasn't has been brought up in the interview really highlighting that you're passionate about this space um and that you've taken the time to like you know do your research that you're interested that you're a good bit for this um for this company and also um think about like role specific questions as well maybe um what are some of the challenges um that people in the role are currently facing um and uh what are um what are the current challenges in that area today um or maybe what's a day in the life of this role look like at at the company stuff like that just to get a little more insight and show that you're interested um interested in that area um for early and career folks like I think this is a really cool opportunity because you don't have a lot of insight and so this is like a great way to show that you are interested and that you have um the interest in growing and and learning and I think that that's like one of the biggest things um recruiters would look for and I'm not a recruiter but I am early in career and so um that's something that has um brought me a lot of success in my interviews and so I'm definitely try to keep that in mind one thing that I wanted to add because I think this this is all great I I want to know how interested people are and building their career and learning about the company and all those questions if you reach it gets tough right when you're like in the third or fourth stage of an interview when you're in those final stages you're down to the wire so you're probably one of five candidates one of three or one of two candidates right in the final stages and so I always like to hear people ask me uh if I'm in that final round as an interviewer is there anything that I haven't shared or is there anything else that I can add details on um or give you more insight into that'll allow you to determine if I'm the right fit for the job so basically like this is your last ditch effort to say what else do you need from me to show to you that like you want to hire me right so like and it's it's not coming from a place of arrogance it's really like this may be your last chance so give the give yourself that opportunity um to close it out strong um and be prepared for whatever it is that they're going to ask you right like they may need Clarity on something and I wouldn't say this to a room recruiters or other HR folks but you also as a candidate have every right to ask about salary ranges and if it's not posted on the job at a certain point you also need to self select out or self select in based on what you need um to pay your bills so um and that's why like there are pay transparency laws not in every state it's not a federal law yet but certain states do need to post about um their salary ranges with jobs um so you're entitled to at a certain point in the it's probably not that tactful if you do it first thing right out the gate but um you can ask is there a salary range budgeted for this position and that's a very fair question that is a great way to ask that all right so um last question before we move on to audience Q&A um can you share some examples of questions or behaviors of candidates that impressed you during your interviews with them um Hai I'll come back to you first with that one um honestly I think um one of the and this goes back to my example about the website earlier I actually had someone um ask me a question about what we want our what we want the story of our culture to be on our website and um the reason why that resonated with me is because they were a designer and they were like a uxer and I answered the question and the person told me pointedly I hear that loud and clear in every interview I want to join this company because I love every single person that I met with and I think the culture really resonated with me by these conversations that I've had but as a candidate I did not see that on your website so that was like such it was like okay they're a designer they're looking at our website but they're also having that like ux research type of lens and it really sat with me and stuck with me because it was like they also gave me some feedback like I was like oh I don't want candidates to be deterred by our website so um that's something that was truly memorable for me Dave Morgan Canin anybody impress you lately with an interview question it wasn't a question or maybe it was a response to a question um I haven't interviewed a ton and a lot of people that I have interviewed have been early career um for like internships or development programs and honestly I I love when students come and talk about personal passion projects um so I'm an analytics and data's everywhere um so if you come in to an interview and you're just like I have always played the um played an instrument and I really wanted to get into see if there's some correlation between playing an instrument and something else I'm like huh I like why why like I want to know more about like why you chose that as a project um and then that helps to like highlight your skills your passion um and things like that so I would just say like my my favorite is when they come in with personal projects you do not have to have a personal project um it is just a thing that I've started to see more often um that I feel like does help candidates stand out um something had recently um that a candidate did was we were talking about one of the wrecks I was hiring for and we talked about a few points that um were important for the role that the candidate um was trying to remember from their past experience um and wasn't able to articulate articulate it fully in that phone call in that 20 minute phone call we had um so she actually sent me a followup email with some of those bullet points um which is super helpful because it showed that obviously she was passionate she cared she at the moment was blanking on it but the followup was obviously nice and thoughtful and and we were able to push the candidate through because they had all the skills that we were looking for um so I thought that was nice and I saw someone asked a question if um followup emails or if you should send followup emails and I do recommend them um so ask the recruiter just ask the recruiter what all the interviewers emails are um and they can and you can just send them emails um some companies might be weird about it bitsight bits sit's totally fine with it but if a company's being weird about sharing email addresses um just share a note with the recruiter and they can share it with the interview team as well um and that is a nice touch um I've gotten a lot of feedback from from hiring teams about candidates that obviously enjoyed the process and were positive about it after the fact um there are sort of two points here that I wanted to make the first is um especially for like technical roles um I think there's a lot of emphasis on highlighting um your technical accomplishments and the work that you've done on various projects um so if you have like other um experiences maybe you're um in in executive position for a club on campus or something like that that kind of highlights um a different skill set um I think adding that extra sort of flavor can really make you stand out as a candidate as well um and then the second point is depending on the kind of role that it is and um and how much time you have and also how interested you are in that um company or the role um spend some extra time digging into it for example I'm a product manager so um I really focus on like products and Diving deeper into that and so um if I was interviewing for a product manager role I definitely want to know like what the product is that I would probably be talking about or working on and and kind of have like um some sort of ideas in terms of these are problem areas things that could be better and and kind of get some of those points across to show like that you are creative that you have new ideas you can offer um some cool insights and and perspectives all right thank you all so much for sharing your Insight um we're going to move on now to a couple questions from our audience um remember if you do have a question for the panelist you can drop it in the Q&A box at the bottom of the screen um but the first one that has come in is as an early professional a piece of advice I often hear is to apply everywhere and not to limit yourself in terms of industry is it okay to apply and continue in the interview process if you're not particularly interested in the company itself but more so the role that they're offering um I'll let anybody jump in on that line I'll I'll start because I work at a bank and I never thought I would work at a bank um I think it's still a good idea to interview um and try out different companies and different Industries um I might work at a bank but like I I know like almost nothing about banking I know more about like the technical aspect like how we built our online banking and how like our security and architecture and things like that work behind the scenes but I mean if you start asking me about balance sheets and stuff I don't know I don't know um so I don't think it hurts to apply for other Industries um because honestly like I I wouldn't have known that like this type of job was available at a bank um so that's again where like during the interview you can ask those questions of like what are the types of projects they might not be able to tell you specifically um but they can still give you like a good idea to see if it would be a good fit um for you even though you're not as familiar or excited about the industry yeah to piggyback off that um so bitsight we're a cyber security company and um I work with a lot of software Engineers I hire a lot of software engineers and a lot of them don't really care about cyber security um they really are more passionate about the projects are working on um so that's why they work at bit site um similarly I'm I'm a recruiter um I'm not the most technical person in the world I I'm not a cyber security expert but um I I enjoy kind of the value bits I provides the world but also the people and the culture of the company so I think um the projects culture people are all different aspects you can take into account when you're um kind of choosing your your home when it comes to your next career just to add really quickly on that one as well um especially for early in career like um I think it's a really great opportunity to just expand um your knowledge we might not know like too much about an industry if if we haven't had experience in it so um if you have made it to the interview especially if it's a role that you care about like have that conversation with like the interviewer um and kind of go through the process and see like maybe this is something something that is actually interested to you uh interesting to you and something that you might be able to pursue and and for me like when I've gone through interviews um and had conversations with like um interviewers and and explored like projects that are being done and things that are being worked on I'm like okay wow like this is pretty cool I wouldn't have imagined this as like a possibility and so um it's possible that you find yourself in that category and that's great and on the flip side if you end up like in the situation where you're just like okay this is not for me like that's also great insight to have so you know like you don't need to spend your energy and your resources going after those kinds of roles all right um another audience question that we got um was um I was let go for my previous company a year ago and took some time off from applying to jobs to focus on family do you have any suggestions on how to explain this in a positive way when asked either why I left or about the Gap so you oh no go ahead I was gonna say that it's it's fairly like in today's economic World um the it's pretty common that people are being affected negatively um through layoffs U Mass layoffs um so I think it's pretty normal um but as far as spinning it I don't think you need to do like a ton of spinning work um it's more of just explaining hey we I was affected negatively by um a layoff but um I decided to kind of set some side some time aside for myself and kind of focus on family um and you don't even have to go into details or anything I just keep it simple um let them know you're negatively affected and um I think most people understand and like companies tenure people interviews are so much less Rob otic in today's world so like we're all humans we all have lives like things happen and Dave made a great point about like the state of the market right now and there's so many layoffs and that sort of thing but then also the human element of like if you need to say that you took care you don't have to go into detail but if you say took some time to tend to my family great like and if a company judges you for that remember that's probably not the company for you right so you're also interviewing them so again no need to spin it to the positive or try to figure like say that you accomplished X Y or Z during your time off like no it's just you're human with life circumstances and it's happen so just speak to it and not everyone's working at not saying this is bad but it's not like the General Motors time or era where you're at a company for 25 years and retiring from said company which if you do great but there's also people that are moving around a lot or taking breaks or taking sabatical and that's becoming more of the norm great answers we have a couple more minutes for just one more audience question um so I will go with this one on our resume should we include technical skills that we are not proficient in for example I know SQL programming but I'm not that great at it what do we think about that I was just going to say you guys are early career especially because your early career put it on your resume um even if you've only just had a class on it that at least shows that like you're not starting from nothing um a lot of these entry level positions they'll teach you um what I learned in school for python is not what I do at work um our systems are different the syntax is the same but like our systems are different So like um put it on your resume um and definitely be honest about your um competency in it don't don't lie great advice I'll just one quick thing too is that especially for developers um there are technical assessments and usually ones that are geared towards Junior to midlevel develop veler roles are more academic in their assessment so it's going to probably be like what you learned in a book on SQL in your class versus like actually doing something in a live coding environment so I have seen more like academic questions on technical assessments which should make you feel more comfortable as someone who potentially is right out of a program Boot Camp or school right so Rapidfire last question for all of our panels lists um what resources such as online platforms or mock interviews do you recommend for candidates to simulate real interview scenarios and improve their performance so we can just go around and give some quick answers on that um so something that helped me when I was interviewing was I went to Providence for for college and um they did a lot of programs with mock interviewing there um so if you are still like earlier in your career and you have good relationships with your your College University I would recommend kind of using some of those resources because typically it it is free yeah definitely um I would piggy back off of that and stay tap into your network um if you are active on LinkedIn for example like you could reach out to folks and um see if someone is willing to to do a mock interview with you um if they have the time um or even just like together with some of your friends um classmates um who might have like similar um background and kind of also be preparing for interviews and might be able to help you out there also on campus like there's probably a lot of clubs that um sometimes host like um workshops and stuff like that so um stay plugged in and and kind of create your support system there and also YouTube videos YouTube videos are super helpful and and kind of thinking about how um seeing how others think about problems and how you might be able to solve it um in real time so ironically that was going to be my answer um YouTube videos because a lot of companies either the questions are very similar or there's just a lot of people who have gone through interviews for some major companies um so they have all the questions and they don't change often so 100% YouTube videos um and then Googling because you can also Google the same thing of like what is the uh analytics interview at Google like you you can just Google that um and a lot of times a lot of resources will come up but don't don't sleep on um your school and resources they provide you for free free because you're paying for it um with your tuition so and honestly like you have your phone so like a lot of interviews are virtual now so record yourself answering questions that you either we gave you some questions in this like behavioral based questions or you Google like what may come up in a technical interview and just record yourself and listen back I I can't tell you the number of times I've watched a zoom recording of myself for a training I've LED at the company and I can't I'm like oh I I butchered that you know or I really truly didn't understand what that was because you can hear it with all my ums right so just record yourself answer it that's where you can practice your elevator pitch and see how it sounds so um get comfortable in the uncomfortable a little bit and to pigy back off that I think going to networking events and just different situations out there just put yourself out there and just talk to people um I think a lot of it is just get getting comfortable talking to strangers and kind of getting out of your own comfort zone um and that'll translate to interviews well we are wrapping up tonight's conversation but don't go just yet we have our final prehiring Summit Workshop next Wednesday January 24th from 600 to 700 p.m. Eastern and after next
