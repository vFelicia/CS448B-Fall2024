just a year and a half I went from making tick tocks to walking down marble red carpets hi my name is Daphne or Daphne detailey on Tick Tock and I'm actually supposed to be in medical school right now but I work full time as a content creator so this is how that happened in January 2021 I actually got accepted into medical school and I decided with some of my free time before going to medical school why not pick up some of my old Hobbies so I started making bfx videos on Tick Tock and they started blowing up and then in May of 2021 Marvel actually reached out to me to make a video for the new Black Widow movie and they invited me to the red carpet working in the entertainment industry was always one of my secret dreams so I decided I would defer my medical school acceptance for a year to just see where this road takes me since then I actually relearned calculus to help with my 3D modeling and I've done Partnerships with Brands like Dell marble PlayStation and even epic games now I have over 900 000 followers on Tick Tock and I get to do 3D modeling in bfx fulltime while exploring my passion for cinematography acting and writing
