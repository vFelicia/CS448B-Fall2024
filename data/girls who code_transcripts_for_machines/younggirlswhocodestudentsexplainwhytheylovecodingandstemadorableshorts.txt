when I was in the fourth grade I saw this paper and it said girls who code and I wanted to try it out so I thought I would try it out and see how it goes and now I think I really like it and so now I wanted and now I want to do it again because it seemed interesting and also cuz most of my friends were going to be there well after I heard Nelly joined coding um I got very interested and once I actually got to the club um ever since I learned about scratch um it's just kind of been one of my cup of teas my favorite part about coding is the games we create and they are so interesting and they have lots of fun stuff you can do that once you create it you get to choose whatever you like and then you get to play the game that is yours
