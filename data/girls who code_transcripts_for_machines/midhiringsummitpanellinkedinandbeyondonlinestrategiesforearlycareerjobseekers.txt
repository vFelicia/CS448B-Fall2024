discussion question that we have is regarding building a strong profile in today's digital age an online presence is in increasingly crucial for job Seekers how can early Career Tech professionals tailor their LinkedIn profiles to align with the expectations of recruiters and hiring managers take a stab at that first uh good afternoon everyone um one of the things that job Seekers can do to increase the visibility from recruiters uh specifically on LinkedIn is to make sure that your digital footprint is already out there and positive by way of when someone looks you up online those positive Publications appropriate social media handles and also your LinkedIn page will be one of the first things that um prospective employers will see I'd also add that with regard to LinkedIn connecting and growing your recruiter Network you want to ensure that your LinkedIn photo is intact with a professional head shot as well as your LinkedIn taglines there will always be about one or two lines after your name and those tag lines is what captivates the attention for people to want to see a little bit more about your digital resume online in just a followup Are there specific keywords projects or achievements that job Seekers should include on their profiles to make them a little bit more attractive to potential employers I can um shared as as a recruiter early career recruiter when I look at somebody's profile um link profile it is important for me to be able to do that fast and quick so how do you as a potential candidate want to be perceive what what is your personal brand because sometimes I look at early career profession professional LinkedIn and I see so much in there that I'm not sure if they are a software developer or maybe they want to be in server security I cannot figure it out so you have to be the owner of your own story you have to tell the recruiter how who you are how you're View and Linkedin and your resume add a tool to say that you have to decide how you want to be perceived you can you should not allow the recruiter to guess how you are a good thing so the key wordss okay if you want to work in cyber security then you're going to use that lingo if you want to working software development then that is what it should be there you know you don't um as a recruiter I really have 20 seconds maybe a minute to look at your link profile and make a decision if I should reach out to you or not so you need to make sure that you know you catch that attention using those words so you are the only your story you decide how we should perceive you don't leave any room for us to guess right you are the one who have to tell the story I can also take another stab at both of the original question and the followup question I'm not obviously coming from the recruiter side I'm way closer to the jobseeker side considering that I'm still in college but I actually got my very first interview for an internship as a freshman I didn't apply for it the the recruiter had actually reached out to me and the way that I kind of gone about my LinkedIn profile is first of all I filled out every section which is a lot of people find hard to do when you're young because you feel like you haven't done a lot but if you're here in this webinar you've probably done a girl to code program that counts for something that was actually probably what got me helped get me most of my interviews freshman year since I had no other relevant experience otherwise but that's the key word right it's relevant experience not everyone is going to leave high school with four internships even though I do know people that have but likely like I said if you're here you've probably done a girl who code program and that counts for something so make sure your profile is like complete like try not to leave like sections blank and I would say like a really important thing and maybe the the people who work in recruitment here can speak to this I've talked to a couple of recruiters and the way that they use like LinkedIn Search keywords are a really big part of it and so I was recruiting for software engineering internships and those words and those keywords were splashed all over my profile so I think it made it a lot easier for the recruiter just to find me in general like you obviously want to make a good impression when they see it but you also have to get them to see it to begin with when you're starting out with very little visibility you have to make sure that they can just find you to begin with thank you so much and I kind of oh I'm sorry um I also want to say sorry I was gonna say because I have another question that you might be able to Loop in your answer too um but the question was what are some of the common mistakes that people make in their profiles and how can these be avoided yeah I think my thing does kind of tie into that so one thing that I see a lot of college students doing is they're just like oh like experience I don't have a job and they just stop right there um and just kind of like go a little bit farther on the thing like Morgan's talking about like clubs and things like that especially if you've helped organize events or you're involved more than just like a simple meeting honestly even if you do just like show up to the meetings include that like what does it hurt if it's not relevant they'll ignore it but don't don't reject yourself before they have a chance to reject you your job as you know a person is to always advocate for yourself you need to be putting your best foot forward and have all the confidence you can so that way when someone else sees you they're like oh my goodness of course this person is the best fit they have all these things that they just told me and I don't have to like go poke at it and go even further because chances are they don't know to do that and they don't have the time to do that and oh go ahead sarra sorry I'm sorry I just wanted to add on to what Mara said don't sell yourself short um and like she said with clubs like even even um what's it called oh Lord I'm getting a brain fart even volunteer work any volunteer work that you do put put that on your profile because you never know whose eye that may catch okay and then the next question I have are around networking um LinkedIn is a powerful networking tool can you provide some examples of successful online networking strategies and how candidates can connect with tech recruiters I also would like to um wrap in an audience question that was what is the best way to approach a recruiter over a position that's posted on LinkedIn if they're not tagged in the job so feel free to answer both I can take a couple stabs at that so as far as like answering the audience question first about like how do you approach recruiter when their name isn't necessarily mentioned so it can be a little tough because like I'm friends with a lot of recruiters and they get a lot of messages every single day it's really difficult for them to see everything so to catch their attention number one you have to be short right first of all if you're sending like an inmail so like you're not if it's not like a you only get like a certain number of characters when you're connecting with a recruiter so you're limited in what you can say so you have to be concise that's first second you have to be very specific the one of the biggest pet peeves that I know that recruiters have is saying like something very vague like can I pick your brain or can I hear your thoughts or things like that because it doesn't actually give them an idea of what you're approaching them for and it's also very frustrating to them because they don't know how they can help you so be concise be specific be respectful and polite and don't take it personally if they can't get back to you because again recruiters you get a lot of messages just in general networking on LinkedIn it's kind of good to employ the same strategy of remember when you're connecting with people that seem to have a lot of connections or followers they may not see it so be considerate of them in their time but also just be polite and be nice I think that goes a lot further than people think it does and also approach networking with the idea not the idea like oh how can I get a referral from this person and what can they do for me networking is all about forming quality like relationships that have depth not shallow relationships where you have a transaction one time and that's the end of the relationship that's not the point of networking the point of networking is to have colleagues and coworkers and friends and I've actually met some of my friends on LinkedIn um and the way to do that is again don't go straight for the referral don't go straight for the how can you help me get a job and instead think how can you you provide value to them how can you be of help and support to them that to me has been a super successful networking strategy because most people are not expecting me to say how can I help support or do any any anything that you need from me of value how can I provide it most people aren't expecting that so do the unexpected thing and you'll probably get a response and I love that you just said all of that Morgan that is a shared sentiment um with LinkedIn often times if you are not the first or second generation connection to a prospective um person online then you have to send that email in mail which means you have to pay to even communicate with them the best LinkedIn strategy to connect with prospective recruiters hiring managers is really to grow your personal and professional Network on there the second you send an invite to someone and become a at LinkedIn connection that means that all of their first and second generation connections now are in your network which means there's a higher likelihood for you to make that connection with them and make sure that it's one of deeper deeper quality that Morgan just spoke about I will also say that a missed opportunity is using a digital business card when you are meeting people in person somewhere we're in the digital age and the technology age if you can just flash your cell phone and there's a link or a QR code that directly links your body of work right to that LinkedIn profile it makes it so much easier thank you and then our last question is how can job Seekers leverage online communities to gain insights and potential job opportunities and as someone who's been involved in like a lot of different organizations and kind of ties in the last thing with LinkedIn is if you are in an organization and you see someone else is in that same organization like for me personally if someone's like oh I did code with Classy I did girls who code I'm like much more likely to want to connect with them because I do feel some kind of personal connection some kind of shared experience um and so being in those communities and then connecting with people on LinkedIn you can kind of go a little bit further but also often times those organizations tend to have you know their own kind of community spaces so girls who code they have their High School clubs their college Loops events like these where you can just kind of meet people see you know who who fits your Vibe the most who do you think like would be a really valuable resource to and like Morgan was talking about who could you be a really valuable resource to as well I think some of my favorite organizations that are pretty like Broad definitely girls who code as I'm sure we all love um and then also I was recently a coach for three years at Major League hacking and that's a global Community it's not you know it's not girls who like girls who code is open to like um their Target demographic is just beginner hackers um and the community there is super super supportive so and it's a lot of it's online and virtual which is perfect in this day and age I to piggy back on to what Mara said I'm also girls who code in a kwk Alum so I am really big fans of those communities as well and I think she actually made a really good point as far as online communities they're definitely out there I'm part of several I'm part of two product management communities one's called Product buds one's called Product Haven and they have some great information in them but they can be a little hard to find unless you're like consistently prowling those communities actively looking for it so one of the best ways in my opinion to start kind of like edging into the online community space is through inperson groups organizations and activities that take the interaction online so other than girls who code and cod with Classy I have met so many friends and so many of my colleagues from the great offer celebration which takes place in person but then we all connect afterward online and also Harvard we code same thing in person conference we all connect afterward online so I mean just be actively searching for communities that resonate with you whether that's women in Tac women in stem product management project management software development cyber security they're out there a good start is to start going to inperson events and believe me people want to help you so people will start telling you about these communities and then once you've kind of mastered like inperson events and inperson communities you'll find yourself in a lot of those is communities thank you and then so now we're going to switch over to some of the q&as that came in um we have about 10 minutes left um for these questions so the first question I want want to ask us kind of back back to building our profiles what would you advise um that the work experience description be is should it be exactly the same on the resume as on the LinkedIn um should it match the job description verbatim What are some of your advice on that topic I can I can share that um from an RTS perspective so I saw this question coming too what I how do we know what are the the keywords right and so when you look at a at an internship posting or a early career job you want to make sure that you read at the first and I again this applies to RTX I don't know if applies to other companies but in RTX you have to look at the first three bullets those in the job disc of responsibilities primary responsibilities and those are going to be the most important ones that we going to be paying attention to now when you see prefer right there um it is preferred so if you have it or or is something you did something similar you want to use those words on your resum so it doesn't have to be the exact job description but it have to be very close you want to use the words in the prefer if you have it if it's not in the first three bullets and then if you at the at the beginning of your resume a lot of um early career cands I see they include at summary this big don't do that add something that is like career highlights or highlights and then you have three or four bullets with those keywords so whatever you notice in those like first three bullets then you want to add those in those keyword in those highlights at the top of your resume under your name because if I'm looking for somebody in data analytics and then the first bullet says you know know excellent or experience in data analytics and your first highlight bullet on your resume says that then I'm going to take a look at what what is coming next right again don't let the recruiter to figure it out it doesn't have to be very vitim but by reading the job description you're going to see where's the repit and then you're going to be able to see to understand what they really looking for one of the major pet Pips as as a recruiters at RTX is that early career professionals don't really read the job description they just read the job title so make sure that you're reading the job description and if you don't have the years of experience for example or the required degree or the required GPA uh then you most likely go get a call if you have that those minimum requirements and then you make sure that your resume match what they we're looking for in the job description then there is a high probability that you might get a call and should your resume match your LinkedIn profile yes we do check and then if your LinkedIn profile is included in your resume you know we click on it and sometimes it says you know grad graduating May 2024 and I checked LinkedIn it said May 2027 I'm like what is going on here or they might telling me you know they are a girls who called alumni and know where in LinkedIn profile it says that then that's a red flag they should it should they should align really well and Rola if can I just give them a hack because I learned this later in my professional career and I think entrylevel job Seekers you will be three steps ahead of the game if you have this hack there is a website entitled job scan it is an ATS if you will and it allows you to actually plug in your resume and the URL to a specific job and it provides you with a result of your compatibility and it's just a great way on a scale one to 100 and you know if you are 75 to 85% um compatible with that job then you have a lot of those key words that are on there so look that up it's not the endall be all but certainly a strong hack that some of our Empower career placement managers use inside the classroom to ensure that our information technology students are Workforce ready I think all of that being said though your LinkedIn like specifically like the descriptions under your LinkedIn which I think which was when was in the question it doesn't have to match your resume exactly because also when you think about if you've done several internships volunteer work projects in your undergrad graduate career you probably don't have room to fit it all on your resume and that's the point that I've gotten to and when you're for example when I went through fulltime recruitment this last application season I had three different resumés for three different types of jobs I was recruiting for I was recruiting for consulting jobs product management jobs and BC jobs not a single one of those resumes look the same because I wanted to tailor the experience that I had that I did have but I wanted them to focus on certain things um because you know me being an IT service management intern wasn't super to doing VC so I wanted to change that and again make it more tailored and on top of it you kind of want your LinkedIn first of all to be more comprehensive than a resume because I've heard the rule of thumb is like one page your resume should be one page per 10 years of experience so I'm staying at the one page for now and you want to you you don't want to go past that whereas your LinkedIn you can have everything on there that's your portfolio of work that's everything that you've ever done I have everything I've ever done on my LinkedIn but I don't of everything I've ever done on my resume so they don't always have to match to a te I mean like Priscilla said make sure that things are checking out but you don't have to make your resume match your LinkedIn perfectly depending on what point you are in your career and depending on what kind of jobs you're recruiting for and what experience you feel is relevant to that job thank you so much can I hop in real quick and and so I just wanted to throw out there so I'm in the federal government with says so your federal resume if you're looking to get on the in the federal side your federal resume will differ from private sector resume so we get resumés anywhere between two to five pages because we really want you to explain your experience um so our resumés can get pretty long for example if you're laying out if you have a bullet for you know a line of experience you're going to say what you did did how you did it and what's the impact so that can be a a three sentence bullet for that line of experience so don't limit yourself if you're trying to get a federal job job don't limit yourself to one page because you might not be selling yourself the way you think you are Mara I know you had something to add I but we are running short on time and I wanted to jump into one last question that they had um it's actually two questions in one um the the first one was like how what are some good questions to ask when networking but then the second one was how do you provide value or offer help to recruiters as a new graduate um possibly with limited experience and that was in reference to building a connection with the recruiters and not just asking what they can do for you I'll take a stop at the uh the second question because I think that might have been directed at something that I said it's a really good question because a lot of people feel like you don't have any value to add when your early career when you haven't done really done a lot yet the answer is it's intrinsic I think we are in a world now where we are so conditioned to think that the only value we have to offer comes from list items off of our resume as a person who's lived your life with your background and your experiences you are unique and you have a unique perspective that perspective is valuable so as far as providing value to a recruiter this is things that I've done to provide value to a recruiter first of all just saying like okay if there's any way that you think that I can help kind of putting the ball in their court so if they think that there's something that you can help with then you can help them with that and something that I've done for a recruiter I actually didn't she was um she was my recruiter for a job I was applying for I made it all the way to the final round didn't get the job but I had a really good experience with her and I knew I wanted to cultivate a relationship moving forward with her and I asked her I said how can I help how can I support provide value please let me know and she told me she said you can leave a recommendation for me on my link I'm really trying to get better at that so I did and I still have a standing relationship with her so you know you you don't necessarily have to know how you can provide value because it depends on the situation but just put put the ball in their court and if they see any way fit that you could help or provide value make yourself open to that and make sure they know that you're open to helping I'd be remissed if I didn't um add on to what Morgan just shared and the other panelists um the best practice that the best practices that we're sharing are just starts and it is always helpful if you do a skillsbased training um if you're not in school um I saw something in the chat about nontraditional talent and employers are looking to diversify their talent pipelines and so I would encourage um all candidates but especially the nontraditional talent to put their resumés out there make sure you share your value drivers what transferable skill sets you have and apply for the opportunity make sure you quantify your success outcomes inside the classroom if you're a college student and then also in some of your job opportunities if you've already had some and lastly I'd say if you are still wanting a little bit more help ower um girls who Cod organiz ations that provide these skillsbased Talent um tuition free training for Empower is just a great way uh we have a path to Tech um software development and coding program as well as the other it opportunities so it's already built in for career coaching built in connections to recruiters and employers so it's also just a FasTrack to get into the technical Workforce in the case that you need that thank you so much and thank you so much to for tuning in to our conversation and thank you to our panelists for dedicating your time and expertise this will conclude our hant Summit panels but if you return to the auditorium for closing remarks thank you all so much for being with us and have a great evening for
