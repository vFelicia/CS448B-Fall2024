I am very pleased to introduce Derek Brinkley Derek is the assistant vice president of undergraduate admissions at Columbia College and he helped launch this amazing twoyear program designed for lowincome firstgeneration college students at Loyola University in Chicago and in terms of what Derek enjoys doing outside of his work he likes spending time with friends scuba diving and doing Crossfit I'm also very very pleased to introduce Mariela regalado and Mariela is a college access consultant and receives the Daily News hometown hero an education award for the work she has accomplished in college access and in terms of free time Mariela enjoys writing about her multidimensional experience through poetry and prose traveling abroad and spending time with her Yorkie Lola another fun fact about Mariela is that she's actually 38 weeks pregnant so thank you Mary Alice so much for doing this with us and certainly send up a flare if you have to excuse your stuff during this time and another fun fact about our panelists they are both firstgeneration college graduates who elected to go into academia to make the college transition and experience smoother for future students so we're really really grateful to have their perspectives but Before we jump in I want to be sure to manage expectations we know that you all have urgent personal specific questions about your situations heading into college internships or the job market we cannot answer each of your individual questions tonight and we wouldn't presume to know what's best for you or your family but we do hope to give you some perspectives from experts some questions to think about and a reminder that you are not alone in making these decisions there are hundreds of other young women like you on this call and so with that we're gonna start the evening off with an icebreaker that will require you to reminisce on the best days of your undergraduate career so our question is what may your college experience worth while for those of you who are loved we will be asking you to participate in polls throughout this webinar so for now join us and share your answer to the Icebreaker if you're currently in college what is making your experience worthwhile okay Marielle are actually going to start with you what made your college experience worthwhile hello everyone and thank you for the introduction and the fun facts so I broke down community when you mention the icebreaker because I think everyone puts like such a huge emphasis on like what your dreams are gonna be when you go to college but I think what made it worthwhile for me were all the different communities that I was able to be a part of right and it wasn't just like okay I love you know creating TV episodes so I'm gonna stick with the TV Club it was also like no I'm gonna study abroad I'm gonna join this club I'm gonna join a sorority I'm gonna try this and different things so I think what made it worthwhile was being able to broaden kind of this social interaction and allow myself the opportunity to interact with different communities that I wouldn't have thought of in high school but College gave me the opportunity to so branch out thank you so much Mariela and then difficult for me Derrick when you think back and reminisce what comes to mind oh goodness what comes to mind first off thank you all for having me today I'm very excited to be here um what comes to mind about my college experience I guess really kind of stems from really the experience as a whole right I think that there's so much learning that happens inside of the classroom which is awesome but there's also so much learning that occurs outside of the classroom it's really I think kind of the combination of those two things that really made my college experience amazing I learned you know just as much outside of the classroom and in some cases even more about life about how to go along with people about how to really be a person for others during my college experience and so I look back very fondly on my college days and partially that's why I still work because I like you know being around students kind of development process I love that thank you so much and for sure I can say that what I learned outside of classes was probably even more valuable than what I learned in classes and you're not supposed to say that but in fact you learned how to actually interact with people and frankly people from different cultures and you know just so much I think that you know I was a Poli Sci major and actually running for student government I learned more political science that I did in class so that totally resonates all right with that I think I want to take a peek at our poll and see what folks said so most viewers selected personal development as their main answer'd followed by social gathering and then coursework and subject matter that's what's up you pretty much agreed with us in terms of what you thought was really valuable about the undergraduate experience okay thank you so much viewers for participating in the poll so now that we've broken the ice and are a little bit more acquainted we're gonna jump right into tonight's panel discussion so the questions that we're gonna ask are gonna address the concerns of girls who code college staged alumni and students across the country who are either beginning matriculating or ending their college experience let's start with the college admissions process so students entering into the collegiate space in the next two years or so will be venturing into the unknown a lot is going to change about the college application process making it very different from what students have actually prepared years for with schools converting to pass or fail grading systems and suspending standardized test requirements for incoming students what other selection criteria and data points do you think are important for students to share Derrick this is like right in your wheelhouse I'd love to start with you can you tell us what you think yeah absolutely so you know for me I think it's so and for folks to understand and recognize that the college admissions process really is a process right you know there is not a right or a wrong way really to go through the college admissions process and and you know I think so many folks get so kind of just caught up in you know the excitement of it which is exciting obviously they get caught up in in the fear of the unknown they don't know you know that there are real people on the other side of the desk that are actually reading those applications and really getting to know you as in the joint as a student and so I think the biggest thing that I can really give advice in terms of the college admissions process is to first off stay true to yourself make sure that you are really presenting yourself in such a way where the college can really get to know you as an individual outside of what's actually going to be listening on the transcript your high school transcript outside of any test scores that you might have you know really make sure that you are providing a great writing sample you are allowing us as admissions professionals to really get to know you in what it is that you are looking for and what you would actually bring to our college campus you know when you really think about kind of the pass/fail situation you think about standardized test scores knowing kind of the environment in which that we are in right now due to the coronavirus I think that it's important to know that all of us even s on the college side are also in the same boat as you are as well and so you know I think there's really going to be a lot of grace from a lot of colleges in terms of kind of the pass/fail situation and you know what your grades might look like during certain times of your transcript just because of the nature of where we are you know at this very moment in time I think the other thing to kind of keep in mind especially when it comes to test scores is that there really is a growing movement across the country for a different colleges and universities to go test optional so you know I work at Columbia College Chicago where in arts and media focus institution in Chicago and we've been test optional for as long as I can remember and there are now over 1,000 colleges and universities in the country that are test optional as well there's a really great website that I usually encourage you to look at in it's fair test org and fair test org you can actually see a list of different test optional colleges and really learn a little bit more about the test optional movement I think it's just so important to note that when it comes to testing obviously um you know it's something that you should do you should make sure that you're taking your a CPA or an SAT if you can but know that I think many colleges out there are really starting to understand that you know three hours of testing that you're doing on a Saturday does not negate four years of preparation and hard work that you've really put it into your high school career right and so it's just really important to know that testing is not the end all and be all you know I have a lot of challenges with text testing in my own way engines biases that are kind of located within testing in white mannequins so I think it's just really important to know that anything else that you can provide with your personal statement with a portfolio with whatever that might be can really be helpful in the college admissions process Derrick thank you so much that answer I know is probably causing a lot of our viewers right now to breathe a sigh of relief in that there is a movement where it's a much bigger picture than just a test score also what really resonated for me is what you said about grace the fact that we're all in this together right now and that everything looks really different and so this seems like the right time for a student also test you said to tell their story and their particular predicament and also what kind of defines them as they're trying to think about that opportunity so that is really hopeful Mariela I would love to hear from you and just get your thoughts on this topic yeah I was nodding throughout Derrick's entire answer because it's so true and I loved how he picked grace as the word to describe it because I think that we keep talking about like when's everything gonna go back to normal you know when's New York City off pause when such and such country like you know open again and I think that there's this tremendous opportunity for us to think about what comes next for us right because colleges right now are figuring out okay well you know before they would cap an online class at 40 students but then now certain colleges had to create online classes from 4,000 students right so I think it's forcing all of us to figure out different ways to get the information and to get to our next step so I think my biggest tip for college admissions right now whether you're high school you know freshman or a high school senior or let's say you're at a community college right now and you were thinking of transferring I think the best thing you can do right now is just research right so if you keep a college list I love Google Docs and Google sheets for this cuz I would always ask my students to share it with me so we can kind of correspond that way but keep a list what are the schools that you are thinking of applying for monitor their deadlines are they waving their fees so they have virtual you know like right now we're doing a great virtual exchange do they have one coming up join their mailing list right and make an account there are so many different things that we can do right now virtually and I think if we get organized and we research and we kind of you know pace ourselves through it we have this tremendous opportunity to figure out you know what comes next because the colleges are also figuring it out also right so I think I would definitely suggest so that all my high school students or even current college students that were thinking of transferring do your research right now you know don't be afraid to call the college and see if maybe they have an admissions rep that's working from home who's going to be willing to answer your questions right and I think Derek mentioned and he said real people and I think that's one thing that the kids excuse me I always see kids that students always forget is that there are real people reading your apps and if you give yourself the opportunity now to figure out like what Columbia College expects from you then we can plan that out you know you can have a conversation with a college counselor you can have a conversation with a somebody that you know that already went to college and figure out what story can I add to my application right what doesn't my application say yes got all seven DS my freshman year but then during this pandemic XY and Z happened and now like this is my focus right so don't be afraid to tell your journey to colleges about what happened during this pandemic so I think that's I absolutely agree with Derek and I think that would be the two things that I would add just research absolutely and pace yourself but we have plenty of time to plan out what we're gonna do so I think that's a that's what I would okay Mariela thank you so much what I loved about your answer so many things but I love it because it's about student agency and empowerment and that there is a way for students even in the midst of such a difficult time so I advocate for them exactly that's why I really really love about that answer and I hope that the folks that are listening feel a sense of that because it's very very inspiring so again thank you both for sharing our next question speaks to matriculating students who are confused and looking to make educated decisions around moving forward with their college careers so we did some digging and we found a survey by the ed tech company circled in where we saw about 70% of over a thousand student respondents said Colvin 19 will likely affect their financial situation and more than 25% said it'll affect their ultimate college choice related the Department of Education announced that Dhaka and international students would not be eligible for emergency aid from the cares Act so before we get more info from our panelists viewers we want to ask you will you be completing your FAFSA form for the fall this is gonna we're gonna give you about 30 seconds to respond while folks are kind of responding to that question Mariela and Derrick the next question we have for you is how will Colvin affect financial aid packages and should students still complete their FAFSA forms you know what would your thinking through your answers Mary Ellen Derrick I'll let you know how our viewers responded taking a quick look based on the foal the pole rather 75% of viewers said yes they would be completing their FAFSA forms and 24% of them saying no they won't so Mariela I want to start with you and viewers of course thank you so much for your candor it's really helpful when you give us a sense of where you're at with your thinking Mariela give us your thoughts on this this question yes so this question makes like my brain explode because financial aid is something that we've been trying to figure out from my students that are currently in college figuring out like okay well I'm no longer on campus does that mean I get you know my room and board reimbursed because I'm not physically there right and we all know that online classes have a set price and then room and board is a set price right and then for my high school seniors figuring out okay well my mom had XY and Z job and she was willing to give me XML so I can go to school but now we don't have that money anymore right or I had my job throughout high school and I would pay for my own MetroCard so I was going to commute to school so there are so many different factors and then even with the FAFSA one of the things that I've noticed is that financial aid is definitely going to be an even more extensive process because specifically with FAFSA it lets you use your taught your parents taxes or your guardians taxes from the previous year right so fast for house what they call the prior prior rule and so now I'm thinking about okay well a lot of people what are we up to now 22 million people are currently unemployed so it's one of those things where you're gonna fill out your FAFSA with your parent or guardians you know taxes but that income isn't reflective of what you're in current you know economic situation is and so one of the things that my colleagues and I have been trying to do is figure out well what do students need to do now with their parents in order to demonstrate this change in income right because for a lot of our students your financial aid is directly tied to your expected Family Contribution right and again a lot of these questions we have no idea what the answer is because FAFSA as an institution hasn't really said a lot about what's happening and even with like the IRS right we're supposed to file taxes and that got pushed back so we're wondering okay well does that mean that fastball will no longer open in October someone just asked what happens if you have a sibling in college so usually when you have a sibling in college it's I don't like saying easier but it is more kind of streamlined to fill out your FAFSA because you already have someone in college they're usually mirrors that but I think what it comes down to is we have to talk about money right and we have to ask questions and we can't be shameful about what happened to our parents employment to our employment or to our economic situation in general because then we're not gonna get it we're not gonna get anywhere that we keep talking about advocacy for financial aid we need to advocate even more and especially I have to throw a plug in there if you're 18 and up please register to vote because FAFSA is directly tied to our federal government and so we literally have politicians that are people who make decisions for you so please sign up register to vote but yes definitely start off by having a conversation with your parents if you're a high school if you're in high school and then if you're a college student right now I would say reach out to your financial aid counselor at your campus and see what their guidelines are because everything is rapidly changing right now and I think that unfortunately you might have to make a decision based on what's best for you and your family financially whereas before you know we were probably gonna go with what your dream school is and we might have to pause or find like another route to get there in the future Mariella thank you so much there's so much that you had in your answer and the thing that I think it really underscores too is that not only is it like changing on the financial aid front but it could be that from the time you even apply to the when you know your family situation could radically change and we've never seen the likes of this kind of uncertainty across so many people that I think a lot of you know the women on this call are probably thinking to themselves oh wow I need act with my counselor I just threw out what's going on how do I tell my story and Derek I think what you were literally about to climb into the screen mean with everything Mary Ellis said can you please add anything that you think Mariela didn't share or echo some of what resonated for you yeah Mary love herself is spoton right I think one of the biggest things that resonated with me so much is to ask questions one of the things and I'm gonna speak as a firstgeneration college student I didn't know that I could go back to a college and see if I could get more money in order to help me College forward right right the people that have money tend to be the ones to know that they can go back and ask for money right and so if you're a student who is a firstgeneration college you haven't gone through the process before make sure that you are asking your questions and someone likes how I talk with my hands thank you thank you so so that's number one I I want to do maybe if you don't mind just a little bit of education about kind of the FAFSA so just so everyone on the call knows asked us the Free Application for Federal Student Aid it is a form that you fill out to the federal government and the federal government comes up with what they call an EFC is your expected Family Contribution and that is what the government says that your family should be able to contribute to your education as a student and I always encourage every single student that I work with to file the FAFSA FAFSA FAFSA part of that is obviously there's federal aid and potentially some state aid that you might qualify for just by filing the FAFSA right federal loans as an example is something that you can qualify for it just by calling the FAFSA I'm the second thing that I want to say about that is that there are some colleges and universities out there that provide scholarships for you just by filing the FAFSA and this is where I have to do my little plug about Columbia College Chicago but we provide scholarships for students just by filing the FAFSA doesn't matter what your family's financial background is right so make sure that you take the time to go through that process because you never know if you're gonna be missing out on free money or again federal loans if you don't follow passes so that's thing number one second thing I want to mention is make sure if you are currently enrolled in college that you are talking to the college or the university that you're currently enrolled at again many colleges are giving out again refunds maybe for a room & board that was unused for the rest of the time so you want to make sure that you're getting that information you want to make sure that you are asking questions about the cares actually mentioned that earlier that's Mack the Congress pass to provide colleges with funding to be able to give some of that funding back to students for all of the challenges that you've kind of been dealing with right now so make sure that you are going through that process as well and working with the colleges that you're going to the third thing that I'm going to say is if you are a new student coming in make sure that you are also working with the colleges that you are looking to enroll in for the Fall there are many colleges that have a reevaluation of financial aid process so it kind of gets back to what Mariela was really saying about you know your taxes from two years ago it's what's influencing your financial aid package today which is kind of weird but it's it's the situation that we're in and so a lot of colleges have these reevaluation of financial aid or processes to allow you to say you know what I my parent lost a job or my guardian is really struggling right now how can we really kind of make this work and they're typically again as some sort of process that you can go through in order to appeal for additional financial aid so you know if you file the FAFSA if you ask questions if you talk to your especially if you're coming in to college talk to your admissions representatives we are here to really make sure that this process goes smoothly for you Derrick thank you so much so much education there in terms of what you shared and really really valuable for the folks that we're viewing right now so you know I think our last question before we get into the Q&A section we want to talk about next steps could potentially look like for soontobe graduates some conversations with our alumni show that there's a heightened sense of anxiety for graduating college students students who are once looking to enter the workforce or move into a postgraduate education opportunities are now thinking of taking a gap year using your experience as academic professionals how would you advise students in this predicament to proceed and Derek we can have you start that's a really really really great question I you know I I I can say that I relate in some ways to to that so I graduated from college in 2008 and if anyone knows anything what happened in 2008 we had a big stock market crash and you know it was hard it was hard for folks who graduated in 2007 2008 2009 in order to find fulltime employment and go through that process and so um you know I think that one of the things that I encouraged you to do is really to be open to any and all opportunities that might be available for you after you graduate from college right you know there are opportunities for internships there should still be some job opportunities out there I'm really interested you know obviously how the tech industry kind of changes you know knowing that we're relying a lot more on technology nowadays and so there may be some really interesting cool opportunities for many of you who are enrolled in a program that's more on the computer science side or you know at Columbia College Chicago we have a great game design program that's really tech heavy you're programming a program that's really tech heavy and so I think just keeping an open mind in terms of location you know where is it right that you might want to move once you graduate from college are there opportunities and some bigger tech hubs around the country that might be really great for you to kind of think about how can you maybe take some time off and maybe travel a little bit I think that you know I I believe that this time is really interesting because I think it's forcing this as a not just as a country here I know there's many viewers who are living in different parts of the world as well but I think it's a really interesting time for us to kind slow down a little bit and really kind of take some time to reflect on really how we want to build our lives as we move forward and so you know I think that you know as best as you can stay focus on whatever that ultimate goal is for you again whether that is entering that workforce whether that is going to grad school once you graduate you know a lot of colleges and universities are going to be looking I think for more students to enroll in grad school at this point in time and so that could be an option for you to really think about so you know just I think it's a perfect time just to kind of reflect and to really think about what's important for you as a human being in your life and how you really want to move forward kind of through this and you know for me it was I was an education major in ecology so I ended up going into education once I graduated I was a substitute teacher on for a year after I graduated and you know it really allowed me to use the skill set that I learned in college obviously for my education program but I also went to a liberal arts college where they teach me critical thinking skills communication skills writing skills those things that are so important for you regardless of what industry it is that you go into after you graduate and so you know if you've got a really great solid wellrounded skillset I think that you're going to be successful and you're gonna find your way Derek thank you so much Mariela I would love to get your take on that question for the soontobe graduates okay yeah so what I wrote down on my notes as soon as you said that question was Glenn right I think that a gap year is an amazing opportunity if you planned it out right and if you have the resources that you're going to need if it's it's kind of this wellthoughtout plan and some of them someone said does a gap year make it easier or harder and I want to mention that because you don't choose to go on a gap year because it's easier right if you're choosing to go on a gap year it's because you've already thought of okay I'm gonna try this to see if you know I want to study international policy in school so I'm gonna go on this guy year so I can travel to another country and you know use my skills learn new ones and see if this is something that I really want to do right because then that gap your experience I can bring it into now my grad school application my college application etc so I don't want you to look at things as okay well is it easier if I do it this way where it's gonna be harder don't make decisions like that we have to make decisions that are going to align with what your goals are and like the person that you want to be once you're done with that and I'm taking advantage of those things like I didn't have this kind of four year college path it actually took me six years to graduate from a bachelor's because I kept taking breaks inbetween right and mainly one of the reasons was because I was financially supporting my family but the other reason was I got to travel with my school so I've been to Australia I've been to my native Dominican Republic I've traveled all over the United States literally doing education workshops and things like that and all of that continuously led me towards a career in education right it wasn't kind of this easy way but it taught me a lot about myself and you know it aligned with what my future goals were going to be so please don't make decision based on if it's gonna be easier if it's gonna be hard I think you should plan it out and then base your decision on is this plan going to work it does this plan aligned with what I want for my future and Derek mentioned the technology aspect there are people working from home right now that a year ago would have never thought that they can be sitting in their living room still producing the same outcomes that they were having in the office right so when we talk about opportunity and advocacy again a remote internship that's like unheard of but companies and colleges made it happen because they needed to adapt to the times right and that's the same thing that you have to do kind of adapt to it but I think you also get to reinvent it and figure things out for yourself and then the last thing I think is the mental health part I saw this meme going around on Instagram that talked about you know if you're not productive during this time you lack discipline and I'm like okay we're gonna put a sticky note on that because one don't let anyone shame you if you're not being productive reach and to you know like don't don't do that don't believe everything you see on the Internet's because that'll just make you feel inadequate every single time I think that one of the things you can do during this time is pay attention to your mental health there are a lot of apps right now then they're not paying me to advertise but headspace isn't giving 30 to like 60 days free there's another one called breath work and it's just like very like simple kind of entry level like meditation things for you to do because it's a really you know roller coaster of a time for our emotions so I think definitely pay attention to your mental health cuz it'll give you the clarity for you to figure everything else out so can I have like one more thing what you're saying I think there are two two other things I want to add I think one is there I think there's a really awesome opportunity to freelance I know that sounds really weird but I think that there's I think we office our skill sets right that we can't really provide to the world and so thinking about how can you okay maybe I can't find a job at a particular organization that I really want to work for how can I make that opportunity for myself right so thinking about freelance how you can do that second thing I would say is really hone in on your creativity skills right I think one of the things that is so important for folks to understand and for folks to know I'm LinkedIn did a study probably about a month ago and what they did is they went through all of the different job descriptions that are listed out on LinkedIn right in the number one skill set that companies and organizations are looking for nowadays is creativity okay and so as much as you can really make sure that you are honing in on your creativity you know how to think critically again the writing skills the communication skills those things are going to be so crucial for you as you navigate the workforce throughout the rest of your career right you know we are trying to prepare you for careers that don't even exist nowadays yeah that creativity piece is just so incredibly important for you all and you know I think tech schools obviously I think can provide a lot of that creativity but you know III personally am so biased towards liberal arts institutions because that's where I went that's what I know and so like that liberal arts core really teaching you how to think critically and being creative I think are so important for folks think about you and now I will stop talking no that was great no thank you both I'm glad you kind of naturally got there because my question you gave such wonderful answers just sort of you know soontobe graduates what's happening what does a gap year look like we're at a time where like what gap here what does that mean when you can't get on a plane when you can't go anywhere and when you're not sure what you can do so I love that you talked about potentially virtual internships you talked about freelancing you talked about honing your skills even in the in your home because I think we kind of have to think outside the box because so many of us are in the same spot and everyone is scrambling and thinking so thank you for sharing both what I would call traditional concrete ways to plan and sync that never gets stale that are always applicable but also kind of making note of the time we're in and how we have to ask our students to act differently so really really appreciate that and with that we're gonna move over actually to take some questions from our viewers and so that's the end of the panel part of it we've selected questions from our girls of quote alumni who are viewing this conversation and we'd like to further would like further guidance around navigating the college experience during this pandemic we're gonna ask our panelists to answer two questions individually and one together okay the first question comes from Juliet Shepherd and is for Mariela what are the best ways for high school students to effectively move forward and not lose ground over the months to come as they look to prepare for college do you have any specific tools practices resources or just milestones that students should be thinking about yes so I love using the word milestones when it comes to this like the college application process because there is literally something that you can do down the road whether you're in 9th 10th 11th middle school etc so one of the things that I love is on college board people well the majority of students will know it because they apply for to take the SAT there but College Board has an incredible amount of like checklists and different resources so I always point my students towards college board has a college access checklist but I grade so if you go onto the College Board website college board and you go into resources they actually have a checklist where it's like a ninthgrade checklist a tenthgrade checklist and it basically gives you like different things that you should be doing during that time so what I would suggest is kind of right now you have to counsel yourself right because it's very easy to walk into your counselors you know office and have this facetoface conversation but now like I have to ask if it's okay for me to like Skype or write or make an appointment right so I think one of the best things you can do again going back to advocacy going back to planning going back to research is to look at what are things you can do on your own for the process and I think one of the best things you can do is look at the checklist research what you want to do and start making a list so that's what I would suggest that you do because even if you do have a question as a counselor it'll be a lot easier for me to advise you if you already have an idea if you come to me and you're like MS I don't know what to do okay but you don't know what to do about what like you know is there like you don't know what to do about the fact that like you can't go outside you don't know what to do about the fact that you wanted to apply to Columbia College and now you know you missed their deadline let's call them and see if they you know you're still taking a half with patience we are still taking applications true lady a college in Chicago is accepting apps quite quick question about that cuz I do that right now do you have you noticed that colleges have reopened or their time lines have changed 20% across the board so if you miss that opportunity to get your app in that you should actually check on whether or not they're taking you yes absolutely and they are waiving fees so there isn't like a universal list and unfortunately even though it would be awesome if we just had like this Google Doc of you know all the colleges but you just have to go directly on their website and they've been a couple of colleges that we've called ourselves and they've given us the information over the phone so I think it's as simple as you looking up you know Columbia College Admissions Office and then they either are gonna have their contact info or they'll have a banner at the top that'll say do to covet like here's our process now yeah and I mean one of them one of the lists that's coming out just so you all do you know there is a list through the National Association for college admission counseling it's not AK in a CAC their website is not AK net dot org which is kind of a rear website but shortly after May 1 they will be putting out a list where they collect information from different colleges in terms of theirs if they're still taking applications and going through that process so so that is at least a 1 list that I know of that will be coming up because I just filled out that information earlier this week so yeah so so that is something that you all can hashtag rolling admissions Mariola thank you so much and Derek thank you for just providing that little bit of tidbit about extra information there so our next question is for derek from katie couric with the new grading systems and lack of knowledge around how grades will be integrated do you have any recommendations for students who were strongly considering going to college internationally that's a really good question so um so here is my biggest recommendation and honestly it kind of goes back to one of the things that I said earlier is because we are all in the same boat I think you're gonna really again see some grace and see some flexibility with grades and with that process kind of as we move forward I'm probably over the course of the next several years when it comes to college admissions the biggest thing again the Mariella really said is get to know and call your admissions representative and I I typed that out as well again you know these colleges these universities there are people like me who are there to help you navigate the process right and so if you are someone who's really looking at going to college abroad you really want to check with those colleges about their processes their procedures I'm get a sense of how they might evaluate your transcript Helmuth how they might evaluate your application I think the second thing though that really makes International Admissions really interesting is typically in at least you know when students are coming from other countries into the United States you have to get a student visa in order to study here in the United States and many colleges you're gonna have something or excuse me many countries are going to have something similar to that and so it really also believes you to really check with the State Department in the particular countries in which that you are looking at to see what that visa process really looks like you know that's one of the things that you know with today's political climate that we are in who knows what kind of visas the US government is going to be granting to international students to actually be able to study here in the States and so you really want to you know if you're looking to go to England or you know you want to go to Nigeria you want to go to Japan whatever that might be you really want to check with those countries in their State Department's and really try to get a sense of how that process works and how that process might have shifted here over the course of the last month and a half since we well month and a half obviously here in Chicago but you know around the world you know since as early as November you really want to check with countries and in really get a sense of what those processes and procedures look like Derrick thank you so much we are down to I believe what is our last question and it's for both of you and we can start with Mariela working at home is harder than if I was on campus are there any supports or resources that all schools are providing to help students in similar situations I'm sorry can you say that one more time I caught the last bit of it I'm sorry oh no worries working at home is harder than if I was on campus are there any supports or resources that all schools are providing to help students in similar situations yes so particularly for me I know that for New York City the Department of Education one of the things that I talking about the interactions I've had with my colleagues is we've done a lot of like tutorials and a lot of like virtual oneonone meetings and virtual checkins but I want to put a sticky note on that really quick I want to remind all of the students that are on to this that the majority of you group up with the internet and you know how to do things on it that myself and Derrick and anyone else I don't know what talk is right I don't know I downloaded the tictock app and I just watch the videos cuz I don't even know where to start right now if you want me to make you a PowerPoint um on it a thousand percent right but you ladies and gentlemen you're not looking at powerpoints right you're literally sharing information on a video app right so I think it's it's always interesting when I've been asked this question before and I'm like you guys should be teaching us because I'm over here trying to figure out how I can do a college office tiktok about you know what rolling admissions and what the FAFSA means so I think it's interesting because as working professionals and working from home and people that consistently have like this direct student service we're always trying to figure out ways to connect with you and that usually means no me technology and being up to date with Ted and I used to think I was pretty hip but then I'm like okay I'm I don't even think they use the word shape anymore so one of the things that we started doing is actually hosting circles and asking the students what's the best way for that they think is is um for them to receive information and I think what that's creating is again this creative way for students to pitch how they can learn right cuz one of the things I was telling them is like I need you to learn this stuff anyways I just have to figure out how you're going to learn it so for example one of the students asked me if I can whatsapp them instead for me in my head I'm used to okay let me send you a Zune link let's do a google hangout and they're like oh can I whatsapp you I was like oh I guess that would be easier right because we always have our phone and I'm already home because we're quarantine so it's very odd because I would I would flip that question on its head and just say like as did this kind of generation Z population you have the ability to transform so many things for us like I'm pretty sure that you know Tariq I don't know how old your daughter is but I'm pretty sure she could teach you something about technology that would probably take Derek and I a couple Google searches they like make all manner of videos they're like a YouTube channel and like what are you saying right and people get paid to do this like Derek mentioned freelancing like people will literally pay you to set up a YouTube account for their brand or their organization like schools will literally like pay you to do these things companies will literally pay to do these things so I would ask everyone that's logged on right now to think about their unique skill set and so think about all the people that are working from home right now and how like what a big part technology is playing and what can you add to the conversation how you and reinvent or upgrade or make it more effective how we're currently communicating right there's like a hundred and something of us on this chat someone had to send out all the invitations to coordinate this right and someone got paid to do it and look how fantastic she did because it worked we're here we have the polls going we have the questions going so it's like one of those things that it's like the sky is really the limit like absolutely we're in a pandemic and it has so many emotions but there are so many resources in so many different ways that this can go about but going back to the question one of the things that we've done is community circles but we try to pick a different topic every day that doesn't necessarily relate to our productivity so for example last week we did in essential oils like community circle where the students and the staff and everyone that was working from home and chiming in learned about how you can use lavender oil to destress and there was one it was one of those things that it was beautiful because it's like we're not just logging on to take attendance and for someone to micromanage us that we are not done but now that like we actually care about other aspects holistically from ourselves but yeah man it's a have that conversation with your friends on with each other because it's such a beautiful silver lining right now like it's just amazing like look at us right now it's about to be a p.m. ya know isn't that amazing it is and I love what you're saying because again similar to how you in question earlier the empowerment the idea that you know the way the question was posed is that it's harder for students and we don't want to negate that we know that this is turning our typical learning on its head but what I liked about how you inserted is that there is empowerment to be found even when we feel like the resources aren't in front of us or something is not happening I think you're again sort of saying wait let's be strengths and situation how do I turn it around or think about it differently during almost that time do you want to jump in with a quick thing before we wrap up yeah um the one thing that I just wanted to mention is that most colleges and universities do have a career center of some sort and that is a great resource for you all to really use as you're navigating again going into the workforce you're starting to navigate how do you work from home how does this process really work what technology is good to use you know how do i structure my day in such a way that I can still stay focused and get what I need to get done I'm so utilize the Career Services centers that you have at your colleges universities because they provide some really great I think resources for you all and they're learning right now as we kind of navigate I'm kind of this this situation and then the second thing I would say is find a really great mentor you know if you have people older cousins friends other folks who are in the workforce and you know there they are also navigating this time right now reach out to those folks and you know make sure that you're staying in communication with them I'm the one thing that I am going to do in the chat box is I'm gonna put both my Twitter account a my eat because I am young enough to use Twitter's I do know how to do that one put my Twitter account in my email address in the chat box and I am literally I really am like available and happy to be a resource for folks as you navigate the process and if I don't have answers for you I have a lot of friends in college admissions all across the country and so like you know I can easily connect you with some other folks I don't get back to you you know too too soon please be patient I supervise a team of 40 and things are kind of crazy right now but you know I am also Mariela and Derick honestly I'm thinking to myself okay why didn't I have folks like you in my life when I was in college you have given so much science so much wisdom and frankly just so much empathy in terms of what you've shared for all of our viewers we want you to know that not only do you have obviously these amazing experts who have been so kind and share their time but you also have our sisterhood you have our community so thank you so much for connecting with us don't get off yet I just have one more thing for folks to do you know if you did please let us strike let me just make sure I'm saying this correctly please let us know right now by completing our one minute survey to give us feedback on tonight's conversation please take out your phone and go to the camera hover your camera over the QR code on the screen and
