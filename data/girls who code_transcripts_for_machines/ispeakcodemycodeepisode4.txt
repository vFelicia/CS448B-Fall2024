hi Audrey here Mikey Oh Janice here written here and welcome to our I speak code episode of my code this week we'll be talking about programming languages so let's dive right in a programming language is the method of using text to communicate to your computer exactly what you wanted to do the computer doesn't understand human language so use a computer language to tell it what to do it's kind of like a translation between two people who speak different languages just how French people communicate to each other in French and others can learn how to speak and write in French in order to communicate with them a programming language is a languages rules just like a spoken language each programming language has its own grammar or syntax that differs from all other programming languages although we're not computers we can learn how to communicate with them there are different programming languages because you need different tools to do different things like for example if you like video games you might want to try C++ because they're designed things specifically in C++ to help aid video game making it often doesn't matter which coding language you choose sometimes there are technical reasons for choosing one over the other but it's often just personal preference does have a pencil marker and color pencil are all used to draw in color but we obviously use them for different tasks there isn't always a reason to choose one language over another sometimes it's a technical reason but most times is just personal preference right now I'm pretty new in the coding scene so I've just finished my first web development class which was HTML and CSS and now I'm learning JavaScript I know how to code in Java HTML CSS JavaScript and a couple of JavaScript libraries that go with it like jQuery and processing.js and then also at any tiny bit of Python I learned dropper first because that's what the AP test is on and so my high school taught Java then I learned HTML because I wanted to make my own website then I learned sweats because I want to make my own app I know how to code in over eight languages I know how to code in Java HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery Ruby Python Adobe Flash CSX processing j/s and a few more a beginner could start out by learning HTML and CSS because they are super simple and super easy to learn HTML is the language that you use to make webpages and CSS is the language that goes along with it to make the webpages all pretty there are over 200 programming languages and I started in Adobe pricey a sec I think a beginner to choose Java because it's the standardized language some most high schools use and the AP test is in Java I think pythons the easiest language because you can write a lot more with a lot less code thanks for tuning in next week we'll be covering what we've created with code be sure to let us know what you want to learn in the comment section down below see you next week you
