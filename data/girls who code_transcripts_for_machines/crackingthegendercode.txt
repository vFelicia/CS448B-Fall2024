today computing skills are the most sought after in United States that women's share of the computing workforce is falling new research from Accenture and girls who code shows us that if nothing is done to close the gender gap only one in five computing jobs will be held by women in years time in 2015 there were half a million new computing jobs and less than 40,000 new computer science grads so the gender gap will have severe consequences for the US economy the theis decline can be reversed we can triple the number of women in computing by 2025 but 3.9 million pushing their share of the work force to 39 percent but we must act now we need to spark the interest of girls in junior high by informing parents and teachers better about the wider importance of computing we need to sustain their engagement in high school where girls initial interest often competes with social factors in college we need to inspire young women toward a career and computing the role models summer immersion programs and mentoring it's time to take action because we need more women in computing it's time to crack the code together
