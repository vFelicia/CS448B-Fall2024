two years ago my cousin and I were reading in the drivethrough of a shawarma restaurant in satiric and while we were waiting for our food began talking about our aspirations and what we wanted to do in the future I remember telling her I wanted to be the first female foreign minister of Saudi Arabia and she wanted to be an engineer both industries that were almost exclusively maledominated this was two years ago before any of the changes in Saudi Arabia had happened such as the driving ban being lifted and more women being encouraged to enter the work field our conversations were reflecting the obstacles that would have to face not because we would not be qualified but just because we were women she might not remember this moment but I will always remember what she said to support me she said we have to work twice as hard but reaching your goal will be twice as sweet at this moment sister would seem to be the most presence the simple dialogue strengthened our bond and made us feel both more empowered I now realize although it might not be as overt sisterhood is in every micro interaction I have with all the wonderful female figures in my life you
