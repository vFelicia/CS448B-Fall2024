howdy welcome my name is emily heist moss i'm the director of alumni programs at girls who code thank you so much for joining us tonight for a gwc talk i'm really excited to welcome back our moderator derek brinkley derek joined us for our very first gwc talk a few months ago and we enjoyed his advice and suggestions and attitude so much we invited him back he'll be moderating our panel tonight and derek is the assistant vice president of undergraduate admissions at columbia college chicago he is a true expert he also helped launch the aruba college of loyola university chicago a twoyear program designed for lowincome firstgeneration college students in his free time derek enjoys spending time with friends scuba diving and doing crossfit which i'm sure is outdoors right now derek when you're ready take it away excellent thank you emily i appreciate it welcome welcome welcome um my name is derek brinkley as emily said and i'm so excited to be here with you all again uh this evening um to discuss the computer science class experiences and any tips and tactics that helped our panelists succeed and we're going to introduce our panelists here in just a second so thank you again for taking time out of everyone's busy schedule um to be here with us this evening um for all of our viewers we ask that you use the chat box that we have to share any thoughts that you have and questions that you have throughout the entire evening's conversation um and a member of the girls who code staff will respond to any questions um comments and concerns that you may have so um those are just some ground rules we want to set early um in this process so that we have a really great event tonight so um so i'm going to take the time to introduce our analysts so first off we have kelsey rodriguez say hello kelsey wave to the fine people um kelsey kelsey is the senior application engineer at cadence design systems um which supports ke and she supports key customers by enhancing their design flows for cutting edge technology um she holds a bachelor's of science in electrical engineering from cal poly uh san luis obispo and a masters of science in electrical engineering from uc san diego so we're glad that you're with us this evening kelsey thanks for being here and then our second panelist is christine marette she is a software engineer at prudential financial um and a full stack developer who uses traditional and modern technologies to design solutions and she holds a bachelor's of science in computer engineering from the university of maryland college park and so we are super excited to have these two wonderful panelists if you didn't wave hello to the people christine wherever the people i'm super excited to have folks here tonight so um what we are going to do is we're going to start off tonight with an icebreaker um and then um we are going to uh follow that with some questions that will be addressed um by uh that will address the concerns of the girls who code college age alumni um in various students across the country who are beginning matriculating or ending their college experience so we're going to really take some time to really address some of the questions that you all have and then at the end of the conversation we'll have a q a segment that i'll lead um with questions that we gathered in advance specifically from our users and from our viewers so we're super excited about that so um so here's what we're going to do i'm going to start this question off with our panelists um kelsey i'm going to have you answer this one first um what was your favorite computer science or noncomputer science class when you were in undergrad okay so i actually aren't a computer science major i'm an electrical engineering major but i did take some cs courses so i would have to say that my favorite was just the introduction to fundamentals of computer science it was just basic c programming because a lot of the key aspects that i learned there i applied it to other languages and other problems it's a great way of conquering problems it really helps with problem solving but for my nonfavorites or my favorite noncs class it's definitely more of a physics class it was electromagnetics so i'll leave that you know just there awesome awesome christine what about you what were your favorite cs and noncs courses um let's see cs i think it was the same so it was my first cs class um and not so much like the material but just how it was presented so i had a really cool professor like biker dude and i was just like okay this is relatable like it's not you don't have to be like a certain kind of way um to be a programmer so it was just how the material was presented to me i was so it was so relatable um so yeah he made the class epic and i was like okay this is i'm doing this um yeah and then noncs i'd have to say um psychology like psychology was super interesting for me um it was just like another using another part of your brain so yeah for sure excellent excellent so viewers we want to hear from you right um we want you to answer the poll question that should have just popped up on your screen um is your favorite class computer science related or is it a noncomputer science related class we're going to give you about 30 seconds to respond and then we'll get that little piece of feedback and then we'll move forward what about you derek do you have any favorite class you know um so i was a education major in college and so um for me all of my favorite classes in college um in general either were an education class anything that allowed me to be in front of students in front of people getting a chance to teach getting a chance to impart knowledge helping students and seeing that light bulb that would go off with students when they learned a new concept when they really understood how to multiply numbers or whatever that concept might have been so i really really really enjoyed that course or those classes i also had a really cool class at my undergrad called marriage and family and it was taught it was teen taught by a theology professor a psychology professor and a sociology professor and so it talked about kind of the construct of marriage within societies and within different cultures and it was really really really interesting um to hear the perspective especially from those different areas those different fields and how that really um influenced i guess how different cultures and different areas looked at marriage so that was my favorite course in college yeah it was very different very cool though um very very cool so um thanks to everyone for for answering the poll so about 53 of our um attendees here said that a computer science course was their most favorite class um in college in about 48 set a noncomputer science course so really split that down the middle and you know i think it really goes to the point that um whatever field you go into after you graduate from college there really is the mix of the skill set that you're going to learn within your program right and i think the ability to think critically the ability to speak properly the ability to write properly to problem solve all of those things really i think go into a lot of us and our daily jobs and what it is that we do and so i think that that really speaks to having to use both your left brain and your right brain um as we really go throughout our career so i think that that's a really um awesome thing so what we're going to do is we're going to going to go on and um kind of move into our discussion questions so we do have some questions that we want to ask our panelists um this evening and you know we know that the computer science space is really dominated by a majority um white men um and asian men right and it's one of the reasons why this organization girls who code was really birthed and and why it really came to be um and we also recognize that uh being a woman in the technical world um has its barriers um and particularly as women of color there are certainly i would imagine another set of challenges even on top of uh of just being a woman um that you have to deal with so really with that being said i'm gonna direct this really and have christine maybe answer this first but what's one piece of advice you wish someone would have told you as an incoming student looking to major in computer sciences oregon kind of the sciences in general um let's see one piece of advice i think perseverance is key like um just anything like worth having like it'll just take hours and time um but also people surrounding yourself with good people um and that's i mean as much as there is you know conflict and people will see you differently there are also just so much there's a lot of good as well so there are people you can align yourself with um people like you people not like you um but you know if you both have the same end goal you can work together um so yeah i'd say like one perseverance and to aligning yourself with the right people awesome kelsey what about you what what's that one piece of advice that you're like man someone should have told me this at the beginning of my program uh definitely in the beginning do not compare yourself to other people you're going in and it's about you and your own development so i think that was one thing i probably should have you know took into consideration when i joined because i went to a predominantly you know white school and especially in my courses they were mostly men so going in you're already like the one out of 10 women that are in the in the the class so definitely leave that at the door you know you're in there to learn uh that would be my best advice yeah and i and i think those are both really great pieces of advice and i think it really kind of gets to the notion that um you know you got admitted into these colleges um and in these programs for a specific reason right those colleges as someone who works in college admissions and this is what i do right we don't admit students that we don't think you're going to be successful in the program and so really being able to um be confident in yourself and know that you belong even if it doesn't always look like you belong right and you know i think about um not to compare my experience to the experience of our panelists but um being a black man and being one of the only black males in a lot of my classes in an education program early childhood education program a field that's dominated by women in really i'm having to know that i'm there for a reason um and i was chosen to be there for a reason so that confidence is i think really really important um when you think about kind of moving into the next question um transitioning from high school to college is a very hectic process i think especially given where we are right now in the world with covid um you know with a lot of the the different challenges that we're having i think as as a community um and so you know you're transitioning from high school to college it's hectic um you feel like you're getting the hang of things um and then you really have to make that decision of is this the major that i really want to do is this the the the piece the the program that i really want to move um forward with and so um you know from our audience we really want to know at this point in time um have you declared your major i'm really curious if you have declared your major so far so hopefully that poll question is popping up here if it's not popping up now should be popping up shortly um there we go we want to get an idea if you have already um declared your major so um while the audience is doing our poll and i'll report those results here um in just a few um kelsey can you tell us how and when you determined which computer science specialization you wanted to major in can you really kind of give us an insight into your process of deciding how you how you chose that sure um so when i went into my undergrad i already decided that i was going to do electrical engineering i didn't go undecided i already chose that major and what really made me choose that was from courses and clubs that i did in high school so i was in a robotics club and i did a physics and those kind of both helped me understand what i kind of wanted to do in the next four years or what more information i wanted out of that area so definitely if you really like coursework that you've done in your last year of high school um and you want to do that going forward that that's always a leading way to decide uh whether the major is right for you and did you happen to change your major at all kelsey did you like once you entered college did you stick with your major did you go and maybe switch concentrations or areas so for my master's i did photonics which is kind of a subdivision of uh electrical engineering so for that one i liked the way the field was underdeveloped meaning there was a lot of research to be done so i wanted to do my master's studies and that and and that's kind of the main specialization that i picked it kind of incorporated uh electrical engineering and physics together and so that's why i picked it great awesome um we've got the poll results before i asked christine to kind of jump in with with her answers but um it looks like 41 of students have not dick or have declared their major excuse me and then 59 of students have not declared their major um and so just a really interesting piece of advice and i don't think that that's a bad thing it's not an outlier in any way shape or form many students do enter into their college career um without a major um they go in undecided that is the most popular major if you will at the college i work for and at most colleges that i've worked for um in the past and so totally okay if you don't know but christine for you how how did you go through that process of picking what specialization you wanted to major in um i'd have to say for me it was more elimination of what i didn't want to do which was i don't know it worked for me but i mean a lot of my family members are in like medicine and health and i was like i can't do that um but then i did like in high school i did enjoy like the math and the physics and sciences so i was like i'll probably will stick to engineering and entering college i thought i was going to do civil engineering um but once i took that first computer science class i was like forget that this is so i would say just in your first year like just take as many it's the time that you have to really explore um you might not know what's out there um so it's in a way it's good to be undecided it's like a lot more things are open to you um so yeah that's how i got into computer engineering made the right choice i am very happy i did and i think that that spot on christine in terms of um coming in as an undecided student uh you know i think sometimes students feel this pressure that i've got to enter in um to college knowing exactly what it is that i want to do um for the rest of my life and i just i don't think that that's always possible i'm 34 years old and there are still days that i'm like yeah maybe i'll switch careers here you know and so it's it's okay to take classes across campus um and really get a sense of what you like and what you don't like um and using the resources that your campus has to offer you know many campuses have career centers and they have assessments that you can take to help you understand what your skill sets are and how your skill sets might be best used um as you move forward too so really great great stories that you all really kind of share with us about that um so you know now that both of you are working in the workforce um you're out you're you're in your career you're doing really awesome work i'm sure you've had some time to reflect on your college experience and probably have realized that you've learned a lot from college and from what you went through there of all the lessons that you learned in the classes that you took what skills coding languages and information helped you best prepare for your role as a fulltime employee and christine maybe if you want to take that one first for us sure um one thing i do think college like really helped me and was um kelsey had mentioned earlier like learning the basic principles that will just take you because with technology especially things are always changing um so you those basic principles a lot of the newer technologies are all built on that foundational layer so i will say like a lot of the languages we had i had some classes where we did like five programming languages in a semester and it wasn't necessarily that they wanted us to master all those languages it was just learning how to learn um so i think it's just you need to like be i think like realize you're always going to be learning it's not like you finish college and you stop learning um so keep learning like you're forever a student that's what i'm learning i still like learn new things like classes you know so definitely i just keep on the like the learning attitude yeah that's so spot on being a lifelong learner i think is just something that all of us should strive to be and should be um and we do continue to learn constantly throughout our careers and throughout our lives and so that's a really really great lesson um that you learned kelsey what about you what what do you think that you really learned on what skills what informations what experiences really helped best prepare you to be a fulltime employee so a lot of my coursework uh was designed on problem solving so a lot of assessing the issue and figuring out the best way to solve it so i definitely apply that in my career right now what i do is i take issues from customers and i find the best way to make to solve them to you know find their pain points and minimize them definitely you're always learning just like what christine said uh i didn't know python going into my job but currently i do a lot of scripting to make things more efficient so if i'm trying to test something i will design a python script in order to test it i didn't know that but having the fundamentals from that c class definitely helped me you know graphs the language better than if i didn't have anything so even though i'm not really using what i learned in school having the background in it really helped me uh progress into my career right now yeah i think those solid foundations those solid foundational courses and skills that people learn really can kind of help um kind of through that process as well and you know i think for me when i think about kind of going into the workforce and kind of what that really meant and and and how that really was going to manifest itself it really you know i think i used a lot of um the skills that i actually learned outside of the classroom right i mean i think that there's so much that we learn in the classroom right um which is awesome and it's it's a really great thing to be able to do that and at the same time i think there's so much that you're going to learn through your clubs through your organizations um through having leadership roles um in some of these organizations there's so much there um in terms of learning how to speak learning how to communicate learning how to think critically those problems solving skills that you really spoke of um those kind of things can really help i think when you go into the workforce as well so some really really really really great points there so what we're going to do we're going to move into some q a um and this is q a that we have gathered from um you um our panelists are not our panelists our attendees if you will um in advance to this particular panel um and we are going to pose these questions um to each of our panelists and see what insight they can share with us so our first question is from mary m um and the question is what if anything has ever made you want to stop pursuing or drop out of the stem field or computer science um and what made you decide to stay with it um so have there ever been anything that's you've been like you know what maybe this is not for me like i'm gonna go and do something else or what is it that actually keeps you keeps you in it kelsey uh for me definitely seeing like a low grade on a a final exam or something getting a bad score in a class like i remember even though the fundamentals that i say is one of my favorite cs classes i didn't do exactly that the greatest in that class i think i ended up with a b or something in the class one i'm coming from a high school you know all a's b's you know i'm used to usually at that level of performing and and when you get a letter grade that you didn't feel like you need or would like uh that could definitely you know dimmer or put a dimmer on what you want to do in the future so definitely getting that the first quarter uh for me uh made me question like is this really actually kind of what i want to be doing but uh i continued the coursework to see if there was anything else you know maybe if there was another pitfall in the future then i would reconsider and i didn't have it so i definitely think even though you get a low grade in one class just try keep try it one more time you know keep keep going with the flow and uh if you you may find that actually is is great and it comes back to be a positive experience yeah yeah and i i can so relate to that experience kelsey i tell this story all the time with students that i work with but um you know i was a student in high school 3.8 gpa student i had a 28 a.c.t like i did well got into a great school and at the end of my first semester i had a 1.8 gpa right and you start really thinking about and i think having that imposter syndrome should i be here do i belong here at the this institution do i belong in this program that i've decided to go into and i think to continue to kelsey's point to continue to push yourself forward and say this is just a roadblock this is just one blip in my entire journey that i'm really going to have over the course of my years in college and after college and know that you can get through that you can certainly go through that process and come out of it on the other side and end up doing well you know i graduate with a 3.0 gpa which i was very excited about to have that into my four years in college and so i think that persistence piece is really um important um for you christine what was it that might have made you stop pursuing um a stem field or computer science and what was that that thing that maybe turned it around for you to say you know what i'm going gonna keep going with it yeah i mean i went through this like with every project i did i was it was a lot of sleepless nights and i was like what am i doing my friends are out having normal college experiences and i'm here in the library um for hours on end and this thing isn't compiling um so i think for me was like the long nights and i had some like mental breakdowns um but at the end of the day like things did compile i like would have you know like however long it took it was so rewarding though like to see something that you i can't come out of your head onto a computer um so yeah a lot of moments of doubt um but i will say was rewarding to see something from my head in a screen um i'm gonna go off script for a second because that's what i like to do sometimes and i'm really curious kind of to your point christine how do you deal with that selfcare piece of it right i mean what are the things between the two of you that you really um do in order to stay motivated in order to make sure that you can um kind of take care of yourself because i think there you know in college there are a lot of those sleepless nights and really tough exams and you know moments that you think man how am i actually going to get through through this and so for you both of you i'm really really curious how you really dealt with the selfcare part of it as you went through college um let's see my sister will tell you that she was my crying shoulder um but i think it's like i having a support system um really knowing like having people you can really turn to and be like listen i really had a hard day like i just need to have ice cream and just binge watch something um and yeah so like a support system um and if not that also just being kind to yourself um realizing okay you know what this saturday i'm gonna close my laptop close my books go for a run do what i need to do to relax um yeah being like just kind with yourself but also accountable you know be like okay saturday i took a day off sunday i'm going to get back to it um so yeah yeah kelsey what do you what did you do in college to selfcare so a lot of my friends were kind of in the same course so whenever we had exams wherever we had projects that were just so mindboggling that once it was done we'd all get together and just be like oh it's done like yeah we're free and just have you know just to talk to each other and express like what we're the like the really hard things and how did they come and and compare and so it's kind of a way to destress after you've been ramping this dress the whole you know quarter basically um so that's kind of one thing that i did in in college is definitely finding people that can sympathize with what you're going to you don't want to express your you know stress to someone who's partying all the time like that's not going to help you need to you know find someone that also is kind of around the same point you are and maybe build off each other and say hey look i think you you you should try focusing on this next time and work from there um but i also agree that taking like a day off is is really good but be accountable you know make sure that just because you took a day off doesn't mean that you you should continue it uh it's just a good time to take care of yourself uh maybe watch shows go hang with friends so you can ignore the stress but uh definitely get back on it because it's a slippery slope when you stop wearing it things build up really quickly yeah yeah that thing don't go away exactly it's going to be there tomorrow it certainly is going to be there tomorrow so take your moment take a day to yourself but get back on that horse and make sure that you stay focused yeah i i baked cookies for my floor just what i do so that was my selfcare was baking cookies and eating them [Laughter] probably not the best decision but it was okay the next question is from maria m um the question is with computer science core uh classes becoming more intense every year um how do you balance taking several challenging classes each semester at once without confusing the information during exams that's a really great question um and maybe christine if you want to maybe uh jump in on that one first okay that's an interesting question i've never even thought about like um i think once you get into the classes um you do see differences so like some things will be more algorithms other things um i think it's like a per class basis it might not happen as frequently as you think to confuse information um but let's see yeah so i yeah that's what i'd say i like it no i and i think that you're spot on i think that i think that people think that it's going to be one of those things where you confuse things more than you maybe do in a way um kelsey what's your insight on that question how might have you uh kind of kept some of that information separate yeah i'm trying to think of a time where i was in an exam and i wrote down another exam and i don't think i've had something like that i may have spent more time studying one topic over the other that i can see i definitely probably have done um but i think to that extent if for some reason you have exams on the same day let's say final exams and they're like back to back sometimes you can talk to the professor and ask them like look i have these two exams right next to each other and they're very hard like can i push one forward uh usually they're they're pretty lenient on that if you really explain um that they're tough classes and you need a break in between because three hour final exams are kill your brain slowly yeah i think i think that's spot on as well you know i think one of the things that i always recommend to students um just in general and it's a good habit to get into is just continue as you are if you're in high school um and you're working towards college or maybe you're in college and you're working kind of towards graduation you know i think the the continued focus on organization and how you structure your day and structure um you know what it is that you're doing on a regular basis you know i um always tell folks and this was the lesson that i learned after my 1.8 gpa semester that i had um but i learned that your education should be a fulltime job that is what you are in college to do right you're there um to get that degree and so from nine to five you should be working on or whatever that eight hour time slot is during the day you really should be focusing on um your academics and so that structure i think sometimes can help folks when it comes to um balancing maybe material in different classes too yeah um we have another question and it's from christina y um and the question is in many of my major classes i have noticed people are either already extremely familiar with the material or they're quick learners which makes me nervous about my career choice how much prior coding experience is needed to successfully land an internship or a job and so kelsey i don't know if you have any insight on that piece of it so i think it kind of goes along with uh don't compare yourself i know there i have many classes where people have come in knowing pretty much the whole content of the class or having the previous exams and using that as a reference so you know there's no point in comparing with them they have already have a leg up you just need to focus on understanding the material because professors design the class for you know entry people to understand it so if it says you require a specific knowledge beforehand then maybe you should but if it doesn't say any knowledge is required then i think uh going into it without any prior knowledge is totally fine as long as you you know put in the effort for it um for prior coding experience um since i didn't really have that much other than coursework i really can't comment too much on this but i definitely think that having any sort of coding language in your you know back pocket is a plus because everywhere every company wants to be efficient and they can always do that by scripting so that's what i learned in my current job that you know having some fundamentals of understanding how to write a code read someone else's code um is really important uh and you know if it says only job description no coding then maybe you should take you know a couple hours to refresh but that's that's all i can say that's great what about you christine any advice one um on that yeah i mean i think like some coding experiences needed necessary just to like be able to like have a conversation and really understand but a lot of times like i've just seen in like the real world you learn on the job like you learn and people are there like i was in my first job i remember i was like so scared like my first task like not to ask questions and my um my manager was like if you have any questions ask me and then i was like wait do you really mean that like i don't get like i thought like i was going to be punished you know because i didn't know something and he was like no we're a teen so i think like post college um you get more into like we're just it's not they're not necessarily out looking at you they're just trying to finish a task so and the more that you can communicate the more um the better you could communicate like what you know and what you don't know that's also really important because a you learn and b do whatever you're doing better um so yeah so a lot of the real world you learn on the job so yeah it's it's true um you know i think internships obviously are important to have some sort of skill set to offer for you know whatever that that internship is um but that's supposed to be a learning experience internships are designed to help you learn um about a particular industry or better about a particular field and so you're right i mean there is a lot of that that really occurs um kind of on the fly on the job um i'm gonna add in a question here um do you have any advice this was a really interesting one through our q a um do you have any advice for someone who might be getting uh bullied or picked on for being a girl in computer science and is that something that either of you have really dealt with i i don't maybe they said it behind my back but i just wasn't paying attention but uh no one has ever verbally said it to me um but you definitely get looks you know that that's you go into a room with mainly men like you're gonna get looks and uh unfortunate that you know things like this do happen but i would have to say you know they're just jealous you know you're a female you know you you're in and you're threatening almost in a way so just remember that you know and uh try to find people to support you have your back uh it may be hard in the beginning but you'll find them you'll find your crew that's true love that christine any additions to that yeah i mean you have to for us to like really like make a difference we have to be present you know so i remember one time i was i was at a tech talk and this is like the my first and only experience but it shook me um i was at a tech talk and i was standing in the back so i just come from work and i remember a guy came up to me and he was like hey do you know where i can get more napkins and he thought i was like there to assist with the program and it just shook me because i hadn't experienced that in my life and i was like okay okay well um no i was like well i'm attending it too but you can ask you know like i'm sure you can find them there um so i think just being present is like lesson enough you know so i would just like it's more yeah it's more impactful just being there than even saying anything and like let these men know that girls run the world like i just it just really bothers me i i'm not gonna go on a soapbox about my feelings about all of this but like we need to let women run the world that that's like just what needs to happen and so um hold your head up high keep moving forward like do you is what i say like do you be in that room and i and again i i you know it's definitely different but similarly being a black man being a gay man um being um you know someone young relatively young in my position like you just have to go in and know that people are going to talk and at the end of the day you're there for a reason you were hired for your job for a reason you got admitted into your school for a reason and like go and just do you like live your life um i had to say that out loud okay we have about three ish minutes left for questions so i'm gonna at least pull um at least one more um aren't there any resources or materials or tools that you would recommend for college students who are in tech that you have seen that's maybe been a lifesaver for you um maybe through your college years or after you graduated from college in terms of tools resources materials books anything like that uh for me personally i it seems strange but youtube uh if you definitely need help like a math problem and a you know physics problem or anything like that or coding problem if you go on youtube and type kind of similar you know something similar to what the problem is you'll find a stepbystep by someone usually on a whiteboard kind of going over it so you know it's free uh i mean there's some ads but you you don't get around those but uh yeah definitely youtube anyone can use it so yeah um for coding i really like udemy um i i know a lot of schools might have like can get you through a discount or something but that if you want like just like to learn something really quickly they their classes are organized really well um if you have maybe like a day like some classes can be like a python class javascript react it can be like a week of just make making an intense schedule for yourself they're really helpful they go through the basics really well so it's udemy udemy love it love resources like that and again i think continuing to check with your i'm gonna plug career centers again because they're one of my favorites a lot of resources there a lot of resources through college libraries a lot of free resources that they really have to offer for students always something to think about your professors in their office hours go to your professor's office hours go talk to your professors like yeah how often did you all do office hours with your professors would you say that was a pretty frequent occurrence or usually when you just needed something or how did that work for you so definitely oh go ahead christine go um no i remember i found out about office hours a little too late until like my end of like second semester junior year and i was like what um so i wish i learned knew sooner that my professors were just there literally as questions um so yes do office hours go ahead kelsey um yeah definitely same thing i didn't really use it during my undergrad i really regret it now because i used it a lot during my master's because i just needed that extra help and they were willing and there were tas that also were helpful so definitely don't be afraid like even if you come in and you think that you're gonna ask some silly questions and they're gonna look down on you like they won't they'll walk you through it i mean they're there to help um and definitely if at the end of the you know quarter or semester you finally decide to go see the professor and you ask for help they're gonna wonder where were you during the whole semester so definitely try to show face you know a little bit of the time uh just so at the end you can be like i've been there i need help please so just and just to clarify office hours for anyone who doesn't know who's not quite yet in college a lot of professors will hold times during the week that students can walk in um and ask questions or chat or get help on homework or on the readings so definitely take advantage of office hours we're going to ask one more question i think this is kind of a fun one to end on um and the question is if you had to pick another professional field what would it be and let's start with kelsey if you had to pick another field to be in what do you think that might might be for you um i think maybe going towards like either i have two two different like in my mind so one would be medicine because i was always fascinated with it but i just i can't grasp my head around chemistry it's just too i don't know why that one just bothered me um but then also business because i didn't realize how comfortable i am more or less kind of talking to people and i think business has a lot of that aspect as an engineer you may not get that much experience you know presenting or or talking to groups or projects so uh definitely maybe marketing kind of that sort of concept uh it's kind of interesting to me right now but uh definitely those two but it's very very different i love that though christine what about you what would you do um well probably i'd want to do something related with english and like poetry so like being a writer um yeah i find that i mean i'm interested in psychology and like reading that kind of stuff so i'd ha very different very different but total the other side but i'd probably do like poetry be a writer yeah yeah those are awesome fields i like that i would go i've always wanted to do urban planning which is so weird um but like i'm so interested in how cities um you know thinking about coding and buildings and um you know how do you how do you really structure cities in such a way to really serve um the population in a really effective way and so i've always wanted to go back to school for urban planning and never have and probably never will but uh it would be fun you never know you never know right it might happen one day yeah for sure it's so intriguing to me so uh well awesome well thank you all so much those were really really really great um insights that both of you really had um about your experiences you had some great great uh stories to share um with our um with our attendees and you're so
