hi my name is Ashanti Boone and I'm 20 years old and I hope to be a software engineer at a company like apple I'm really interested in software engineering because I love art and coding and I think that this field is a good mixture of the two and I look forward to integrating my love of art with my coding skills in the future to create interesting designs and solve problems
