hello thank you so much for taking the time to hear more about girls who code let's start by introducing ourselves my name is Jackson Thomas and I'm a community partner manager at girls who code my name is ko and Wesson and I'm also a community partner manager at girls who code we're excited to tell you more about our programs and discuss how we can work together to bring computer science to girls in your community or build upon what you're already doing here's our agenda for this session we'll start by providing a brief overview of girls who code including our mission and the national problem we are working to address we will then transition into a more indepth discussion of our clubs program including the program model and information about how to launch clubs in your community well then discuss the process for starting a formal partnership with girls who code over the next 20 minutes we'll cover everything you need to launch a club in your community we wanted to start off with a video that shows just how much a girls who code club can do to provide skills opportunity and a better future for girls in your community wake up work and it's got me pretty stressed out to the point where I don't don't really eat like I should I'm a fueler for a rental company in the wintertime it's a lot more strenuous he works you know anywhere from 700 in the morning until 400 in the morning the next day seven days a week straight my work is dangerous I'm basically driving a bomb around the truck full of fuel my dad works a lot he wakes up early and comes home late at night I wouldn't want a Courtney to do what I do I wanted to go to college I want her to have more opportunities in life that's why I put Courtney encoding the goal was really just trying to get them comfortable not being afraid to make mistakes okay company has taught me that nothing comes easy girl see code is a lot more than just coding we cover a lot of life skills asking questions working together teamwork coding makes you like be able to create stuff I get to see my what I create come to life I put her in these extracurricular activities so she can advance and have a career that's less laborintensive I think coding will give them you know more opportunity for not only employment but it's also sort of the next craft kortnee is the center of my world I have had full custody ever since I was in the military she's kept me strong and focused my goal before I die is to just make sure that her life is comfortable this can be and I'm here as much as I can be for her I like to make stories which means I would like that they could have coming to life my dream is to probably work at Cartoon Network what she always wanted she puts her mind to it she can do anything she wants Courtney's smart she's kind and she's a coder we hope that gave you a better sense of exactly how important the club might turn out to be two girls in your community now that you've seen what a club looks like we'd like to take a step back and provide more context around girls you cloak code and the problem we are working to solve girls who code is a nonprofit dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology and preparing girls for the future of work we do this by providing free and flexible Cs programs for middle and high school students our programs educate equip and inspire girls with the computing skills they'll need to pursue 21st century opportunities let's talk more about the gender gap in technology although computing skills are the most sought after in the u.s. job market with demand growing at three times the national average girls across the u.s. are being left on the sidelines today less than a quarter of computing jobs are held by women and that number is declining making this a national concern research has found that to address the gender gap in technology we must introduce girls to tech at an earlier age girls who code programs are designed to get girls excited about computer science while girls interest in computer science declines over time the greatest drop off happens in middle and high school research has shown that a middle and high school girls interest in computer science declines dramatically at the same time that boys interest grows as a result girls are unlikely to major in computer science or in college or go into a career in tech if we can engage girls in computer science and middle high school we can begin to address that gender gap in tech and to fight against the gender gap in tech we created our summer immersion and clubs programs during this presentation will focus on our clubs program but for reference our summer immersion program is a free seven week summer program for current tenth and eleventh grade girls to learn coding and get exposure to tech jobs summer merchant programs are hosted by major tech companies and select cities across the country our largest program is our clubs program which is a free afterschool program for middle and high school students through the club's program girls learn to use computer science to impact their community and join a supportive sisterhood of peers and role models across the u.s. our clubs are designed with three primary goals in mind the first is impact our curriculum is designed to teach girls that they can become problem solvers in their community girls work to solve realworld problems that they care about through code resulting in a computer science impact project which is the center of our curriculum the second is sisterhood it's important that girls and clubs learn that they don't need to address issues in their community alone that's why our clubs are designed to provide girls with a safe and supportive environment of peers and role models where girls can learn to see themselves as computer scientists the third is coding while they are brainstorming designing and building their CS impact project club girls learn key computer science concepts that form the foundation of all programming languages beyond hard coding skills girls gain exposure to realworld project management and problemsolving techniques girls who code clubs are easy to start in your community these are all of the things you need to host a club computer is an internet space to host the club and a volunteer to facilitate the club for one to two hours each week girls who code provides everything else ideally clubs for meet for a minimum of 15 to 20 sessions with some meeting first semester and others for an entire academic year we also have an option for a condensed Club that means for 10 weeks so the curriculum is flexible let's talk more about the volunteer facilitators who lead clubs clubs are led by volunteer facilitators from the community facilitators can be teachers after school educators college students librarians parents or volunteers from any background or field and that's because our curriculum is designed so that anyone can facilitate a club there's no computer science experience needed our clubs facilitators guide Club girls through the curriculum help them become better problem solvers and build their confidence we know that clubs need effective facilitators so we make facilitator support a priority girl Zuko provides facilitators with free training and support materials to ensure that each facilitator can successfully run their club here are some of the training and supports that we provide each facilitator now that we've covered logistics let's talk about the impact that clubs can have on girls and their communities clubs have a tremendous impact both in how to encourage girls to see computer science as a part of their future and in how they've created a movement to address the gender gap in tech according to our last survey 75% of our club students say they are more likely to take a computer science class after participating in a club 65% of clubs graduates said that they intend to major or minor in computer science girls who participate in clubs become passionate about computer science and come to see it as a key component of their college and career plans in 2016 we launched a thousand clubs in all 50 states reaching a total of 40,000 girls across the u.s. to put that number in perspective only 10,000 girls graduate with a degree in computer science every year but as fantastic as that is we see this as just the beginning as we hope to reach many more girls and many more communities this year to help reach girls in your community consider a partnership with us to launch multiple clubs and reach more girls in your community girls do code is excited to explore a formal partnership with any organization committed to launching five or more clubs in their community our partners work more with girls eco to enhance the experience for the girls in their clubs partnerships come with a number of advantages girls who code provides its partners with a number of supplemental supports and benefits including priority consideration for field trips regional events and the club's fund a fund that distributes needs based grants to individual quests a summary impact report that highlights the impact of your clubs and the girls they serve and eligibility for reserve spots for our summer immersion program based on availability and location if a partnership is not feasible at this time you can still start clubs in your community we realize that not every organization is positioned to launch five clubs your organization can also work toward expanding clubs or apply to start individual clubs feel free to apply to start individual clubs at your school library community center college or other nonprofit by visiting our website and filling out a brief application once you have applied we will send you all the materials you need to get started if you do plan to start more than one club within your network let us know is the week so that we can track the club applications coming in from your network once we confirm your intention to launch multiple clubs we'll add your organization to our clubs application and share email templates and flyers to send to your network to support your outreach efforts even if you can't launch a club you can still help support the cause know someone who would make a great facilitator recruit them and send them to our website even spreading the word to your networks can make a huge difference you never know who might be ready and able to start a club we really appreciate any and all support that you're able to provide and hope that you can join our movement our clubs application for the 201718 school year is open the application takes just 5 to 10 minutes to complete if you're ready to launch a single club please use the page listed to get started after your application is approved they'll have access to everything you need including our learning platform curriculum and facilitator training if you'd like to launch multiple clubs please email the girls who code staff member who manages clubs expansion in your state as indicated in the table on this slide once we receive your email we'll reach to set up a call as soon as possible thank you so much for taking the time to view this presentation and we hope that you will join our movement to address the gender gap in technology and provide girls in your community with the skills they need for the jobs of the future
