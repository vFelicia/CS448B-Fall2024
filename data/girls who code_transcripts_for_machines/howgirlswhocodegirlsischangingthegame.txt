almost half of all gamers are women yet 77 percent of game developers are men yikes that's why female characters in games look like this mostly white CIS hypersexualized women with unrealistic body types but if gaming companies can't make this change who can girls who code that's right with girls who code girls we band together and change the future of gaming you use code to create 624 billion character combinations that look like you across skin tones body types skin specificities outfits and even identities hijabi character I think younger me would have loved to see a character with a similar body type and while you learn to code we learned that 45.7 percent of you coded smaller chest sizes in direct contrast to the current characters you see in the world 49.3 percent of you coded skin specifications like acne or Vitiligo and 62 percent of you coated brown and black skin tones proving a deep desire for better representation so we took the data from the experience and shared it with all the major gaming companies but before they could even catch up you hacked your characters into your favorite games don't quote your character and then mod your character into the game that you're playing just like that you took the coding industry from thousands of female characters designed by men to thousands designed by girls and your efforts were a total game changer gosh is there anything girls can't fix
