welcome to another day in the lab today we are going to be using the kaijin D and easy power soil kit to extract DNA for my soil samples I always start off by rewriting down the protocol that comes with a kit but in a way that I can understand and I set up all of my reagents in the order that I'm going to need them in throughout the protocol before getting started I always prelabel all of my tubes on the top and on the side and I set up my tubes from left to right top to bottom after setting up my tubes and reagents I go ahead and I grab the pipette tips that I'm going to need as well as the pipettes setting everything up ahead of time just lowers the chances of me messing up and then I just continue with the protocol always checking off each step as I go along so that I don't lose my spot which is actually really easy to do rest me I can't tell you how many times I've messed up before sometimes working with kids can be a little bit intimidating but little things like rewriting the protocol setting up ahead of time and prelabeling can really make a difference and look at that we're done that wasn't that bad was it
