really really works on how we can bring the girls who code magic to anybody regardless of where they live and what they have access to so the books are just another tool for girls to find computer science and fall in love with it we decided to do something that might seem a little oldschool decided to write a book because far too many kids in our country don't have access to WiFi in their schools or their homes shot at learning how to computer program and so we are so excited than thrilled dentist told me that every Queens resident lives within a mile of a Queens public library I look around and see these amazing kids and I want all of them to be horrible coats you know it's really powerful to see those here at the library to see the kids and to know that there's no these people who walk into here and that's they're gonna get a chance to be a part of our movement so I moved not only of this country but what its future looks like I didn't feel proud because of the girls in our program and what it means to own your selfworth so I think that my point is that you don't have to look a certain way to be software engineer and I'm very about this cause I've been speaking for like four years about it I guess I just fooled myself into thinking that that was the norm you know there will always be more men in tech and I will always be that girl who has to prove herself has to even at times blend and as a result I've been invited to many tech events and many hackathons to speak I have won many competitions including more he kinda had like two months ago and I know that it's the responsibility of all of us not just women to ensure that they do whenever there is an attempt to remove your voice complain take the skills that you use to make sure that it improves the lives of the authors in the country and the world because that's what technology really suppose it's just a very feelgood rally and it just made me more confident more curious and more passionate person especially when it keeps coding so we are in a dangerous time I think in terms of the what the economic potential is for our girls and Hills are changing our messages the attentional general stupid is so proud he's just finished a year after school and I've just seen our you know working for projects and it's just been wonderful
