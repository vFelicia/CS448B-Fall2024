i think it's important for more women to be involved in tech fields because having that representation a different perspective is something important in the world in any career i thought i was interested in tech field but i wasn't so sure in high school we didn't have a lot of tech courses so i was looking for outside resources we know that jobs in tech are the highest paying fastest growing in our country and frankly around the world if women are left behind then that's a world of economic opportunity that they're being denied for themselves and for their families and we know that that has to change at girls who code we're on a mission to close a gender gap in tech and to change the image of what a computer programmer looks like and does we work with girls across the country and now internationally who have come from communities that are historically underrepresented girls of color black and latina and from lowincome households and girls who code absolutely gives them that confidence and pride and convinces them that they can do anything you're learning computer science every day you get to see how people work you have guest speakers who are these powerful women in tech who come in and talk to you you get to go on field trips and see how tech changes lives i cannot think of a better experience and that's what we give girls through girls who code programming it's also about the sisterhood the confidence the bravery a lot of what people call soft skills that are critical to them persisting in the field we're definitely going in a really positive direction for women in tech fields especially with programs that do form camaraderie between women it's really great to have that kind of teamwork so that they can pursue those aspirations without feeling like they're alone girls who code is making a tremendous impact in the communities that we serve girls get a chance to see themselves as technologists and they can bring those resources back to their communities and make a change yeah you're going to encounter difficult problems and it's okay to even fail sometimes as long as you did stick through it you have succeeded you
