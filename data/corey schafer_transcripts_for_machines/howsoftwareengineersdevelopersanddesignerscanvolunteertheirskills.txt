hey how's it going everybody uh this video is going to be a little different from the tutorial videos that I usually do um in this video I want to talk about volunteering and ways for software Engineers uh computer programmers web developers and web designers to give back to their Community there's a great line from the book Tuesdays with Mory when the main character was talking about giving back to your community and he talks about not just giving back with money but giving back with your skill set and uh here's the line from that book he says I don't mean money I mean your time it's not so hard there's a senior center that opened near here dozens of elderly people come there every day if you're a young man or a young woman and you have a skill you're asked to come and teach it say you know computers you come there and you teach computers you're very welcome there and they are very grateful this is how you start to get respect by offering something that you have now I couldn't agree with this more um you know it's a winwin situation too because when you share a skill that you have not not only are you helping other people but it also helps you hone your own skills so this got me thinking um what are some different ways in which software engineers and programmers and developers and designers um what are some ways that they can volunteer their skills and give back to the community and you know overall have a positive impact on the world well first of all you could uh take the advice directly from the book you could volunteer at a senior center or you could volunteer at an assisted living home uh I took this approach a few years ago I volunteered at an Assisting Living assisted living home for one night a week uh for two or three hours depending on the number of people who needed help um now I'm not mentioning this for a pat on the back or anything like that I'm only telling you this because there's this misconception out there that uh elderly people aren't interested in technology and uh from doing this I know firsthand that uh that's just not true um they want to be connected just as much as anybody else does and uh but sometimes they simply have the means or have the knowledge uh to get things up and running themselves and not only that but um perhaps maybe the staff or other volunteers there might not have that ability to help them out either um so you know on a typical night of this type of volunteering uh you might help someone do something as simple as uh setting up a free Google email account so that they can start emailing their family uh receiving pictures of their grandchildren and when they do start receiving the those family pictures and staying in closer contact with the family it really does make their day now the great thing about this type of volunteer work is that you don't have to be a software engineer or an expert programmer to help with these kind of issues um the things that you would do uh in a situation like that are very simple tasks so um you know there's young kids out there who can get in there and set up email accounts and do basic computer troubleshooting like uh you know uh connecting computers to the internet and things like that now if you're looking for uh something that involves a more indepth skill set then maybe you want to look into making a website for a local business free of charge um so perhaps there's a local farmers market or a pet shelter um you know it's easy to get the impression that every business in in your city has a website already but there's a lot of businesses out there that don't especially the local businesses um also I see a lot of developers and designers online uh that are always asking for advice and trying to come up with different projects that they can use to build up their portfolio so if you're wanting to learn how to build a website or get into something like WordPress development uh maybe you can build up your portfolio and help someone out at the same time so if you have a favorite local business in town that doesn't have a website or has a bad website then this could be a great project to take on one thing that might be consider it though is that if you do decide to do this and it's one of your first websites that you've that one of your first websites that you've ever made uh you might want to be sure to let the people know that it that your website might not be top quality uh but most likely if these people don't have a website already or if they have a really bad website uh then they're going to enjoy whatever additional exposure that you can provide them anyways um even if that's just a quick and easy website that displays you know their business address business hours contact information um if it's a restaurant maybe their menu and things like that now something else that you might want to look into is becoming a tutor um there's always opportunities to tutor people at just about any age that you're comfortable with and you know as engineers and programmers most of you have a lot of training in math and problem solving and coding and among other things um so to check out what tutoring opportunities are available in your area I would just recommend getting online and doing a quick Google search um and if that doesn't turn anything up uh you can usually ask people at your local public library if they have anything like that available uh I don't know if that's the norm or not but personally every town that I've ever lived in has had tutoring opportunities through their public libraries uh so if that's something that interest you then I would definitely check that out and speaking of tutoring I would definitely check uh with the maybe the schools in your area and see if there's a youth first robotics program uh first stands for for inspiration and recognition of Science and Technology it's a terrific program it gets uh kids of all different ages involved in science and technology um if you check the first robotics volunteer website uh that I'm at now this is USF first.org community/ volunteers uh you can find pretty much any information that you would need um how to get involved what to expect uh as a volunteer volunteer training and how to become a a mentor and a coach also if you look down here at the bottom it says that they have close to 27,000 teams worldwide so most likely you're going to be able to find a program like this in your area now if you are a female then one organization that you might want to look into getting involved with is called girls who code um so software and programming and coding is an industry that unfortunately has been pretty maledominated throughout the years and girl who code from what I hear is uh is a great organization that's getting more females interested in the field of computer science um if you go to their website here they have this tab that is get involved um so if you click on that then you can see that they have a volunteering section here and if you look down through um the volunteering opportunities here U they've got a few listed as well as becoming an instructor at a girls who club or a girls who code Club so that would be a great one to check out now everything that I've mentioned so far has involved personal interaction in order to volunteer uh but if tutoring or helping uh in person isn't something that you're comfortable with then perhaps you could you know you could always try answering people's questions online at websites like stack Overflow or Reddit or some other online forums now I'm sure this wouldn't be considered official public service and any court of law or anything like that uh but I personally consider it a form of volunteering for sure um you and this is also something that I've been wanting to do more of myself um and for any of those people who answer questions on these sites who might be watching this video I would just like to give a big thank you because you know at this point I definitely receive a much larger benefit from these uh sites than the amount that I contribute to them um you know some people put in a a ton of time uh answering questions on these sites um some of these detailed answers could be entire articles themselves and the people who answer those questions uh they don't get anything from the time that they put in other than a thank you and maybe some reputation points or something like that there is an added bonus uh to being active in these communities um you know it's something that you can uh point a potential future employer to uh you can point them to the answers that you've given on these websites and prove how well that you know your stuff and you know there's not absolutely nothing wrong with putting your volunteer efforts on a resume or anything like that now somewhat similar to answering questions online you can also start your own blog or your own YouTube channel and start writing and making videos about problems that you've run into and how you solve them uh you can share your knowledge that way now this is kind of cheating because if there was one thing on the list of things that I'm going to show you in this video that I don't don't necessarily consider volunteer work uh it would be your own blog or your own YouTube channel because you can always put ads on your blog articles and on your videos and if those become popular enough then uh you'll get a little bit of money kicked back your way for that but I would still recommend uh that people do this if they can and if they have the time to do it because not only will it help you learn more about the topics that you write about uh but you never know how many people will run into those exact same problems that you have and then Find Your solution online now another thing you that you can do is contribute to open Source projects there's a lot of Open Source projects out there uh that help people in need um I would recommend checking out github's showcases uh page here and see if there's something there that interests you you can see here that they have this made in Africa section um if you click on here uh you'll most likely be able to find some great projects to work on and you're going to see a common theme some of these projects you have uh interactive messaging messaging engine SMS gateway um pretty much keeping people uh ways of connecting people it's extremely important to get people connected um so that's one option uh if we go back here to the showcases page if you scroll down you also see this uh government app section and within this government app section you're going to see projects for NASA um code for America which is a great organization um you also see National Park Service making making mapping libraries for the National Park Service um so uh lot of projects that you could contribute to here now something else that you might want to check out is the Milla volunteer page now I've personally never volunteered through this site so I have no firsthand experience with it um I just saw that it was recommended online as a way for um tech people to volunteer uh but if you look down here it's pretty much exactly what we've been talking about you can see here it says it's about learning collaborating and sharing your skills with a global Community um coders organizers activists and things like that and you can see that if you click here that they say that you can volunteer as much as you like or as little as you like it's totally up to you and if you click on get involved it takes you to a page where you can be matched up with your skill set and with your interest that are most suitable for you so I think that this looks pretty neat and maybe it's something that I'm going to give a try in the future and if it's something that looks interesting to you then you should definitely give it a shot now one of the last things I want to talk to you about is that if you want to be involved but you just don't have the time to do it then there are ways that pretty much require uh very little to zero effort um you know as software engineers and programmers uh a lot of us are are very fortunate to work for great companies that pay well and that sometimes allows us to earn more money uh than we need for our personal needs so if that includes you then I would try to find a charity that is involved with causes that are close to your heart and commit the donating portions of your salary to those Charities um on top of your donations a lot of tech companies like Google and apple and Microsoft will match donations made by their employees so if you're somebody who's uh currently already donating to Charities uh definitely check with your employer and see if they offer a match because uh you could potentially be doubling those donations and you should definitely take advantage of that if they offer that and there's one last thing that I wanted to talk about uh before wrapping this up and this goes for anyone not just people in the tech industry so it's great to get excited about volunteering and doing good things in the world but try not to overdo yourself um you're going to have the greatest impact when this becomes part of your routine and part of your daily life uh you don't want this just to be a onetime thing so if you overexert yourself or if you uh put in more time than what you have available or if what you're doing becomes more of a chore than something that fulfills you then you're less likely to keep it up and you're less likely to try it again in the future so I would just recommend starting slow finding your comfort zone and uh I can promise you that it's something that you'll enjoy once you get started so that about does it for this video um you know there's tons of ways to get involved out there if I missed anything which I'm sure that I did um then you know just put your suggestions for getting involved in the comment section below so I hope this video was useful for everybody and thank you all for watching
