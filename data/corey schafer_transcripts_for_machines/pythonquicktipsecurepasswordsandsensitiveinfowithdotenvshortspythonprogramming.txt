when writing python code that requires passwords or other sensitive information you never want to have this hardcoded into your Project's codebase for obvious security reasons it's best to keep sensitive information within environment variables that are local to our machines in Python this is made especially easy using the EnV package first you'll install this package using uh pip by saying pip install Python d.v and then within your project you're going to create a EnV file that holds this sensitive information you can now place it there the most important part is to then add this file to our get ignore file so that it's not pushed with the rest of our code otherwise we're defeating the entire purpose of what we're hoping to accomplish with all of this in place we can now access that information from within our python script using thatv module if you'd like more indepth programming tutorials be sure to subscribe to the channel and check out the library of topics we've already covered
