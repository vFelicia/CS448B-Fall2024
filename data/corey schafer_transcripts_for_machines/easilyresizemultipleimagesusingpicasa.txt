hey everybody how's it going in this video I'm going to show you how to resize multiple images all at once really quickly and easily using Google Picasa if you've never used Picasa before and you want to download it you can easily find it over here on the internet it is at picasa.google.com also if using the terminal is more your style I also have a video on how to quickly resize lots of images just using the terminal but in this video we're going to be focusing on using Picasa so this is what Picasa looks like whenever you first open it up what you might see at first is it may ask you what folders you want to connect to Picasa if it doesn't ask you then you can get to that by going up here to tools and then folder manager okay so this might be what you see whenever you first open up Picasa so the folder that we want to connect I have a folder on my desktop and it is this large folder and I will just do scan once and click ok now really quickly on my desktop let me open up this large folder and I'll show you what's in here if I highlight all these pictures and open these up in preview you can see that all these pictures are really large high definition pictures you know if we wanted to put this on a website maybe we would want the large high definition pictures for the detailed View and then maybe we would want some medium to small pictures for maybe like a thumbnail view or something like that so that's one of the reasons that you might want to resize lots of images at once okay so now we have all of these images loaded into Picasa and we can see our folder over here to the left and we have all of our images here so resizing these is super easy all we got to do is highlight all of our images and then come up here to file and then we want to come down here to export picture to folder click on that and now to this export location we're already on our desktop let's go to browse let's go to desktop let's choose the desktop and instead of large let's call this medium and then image size we want to resize to let's go ahead and stick with 640 picture pixels that's a good mediumsized picture image quality we'll just keep that automatic and we won't add an add a watermark right now but you can do that if you want to so let's go ahead and click export and you can see down here that it's exporting all the pictures to the desktop and then it'll open up the desktop and finder whenever that finishes up but I'm just going to close this down and then show you that the folder did pop up here on the desktop so if I double click on that then we can see all the images are here I can highlight all these open them up in preview and you can see that they all are 640 pixels so now you know if you wanted we could do this again if you wanted a really small 300 Pixel picture we could do the same thing export instead of large we'll call this small instead of 640 call this 300 export that and it's as easy as that it's super fast to resize the pictures this way so close that down and open up our small directory and you know we can open these up and look through those and they are all sized to 300 pixels so if resizing your pictures was all that you wanted and needed to do then at this point you would be done you have your three folders all of your large medium and small pictures one thing additional that you might want to do is rename the photos and there's not so much an easy way to do that but I figured it's kind of outside the scope of this video but I will show you a way to do that anyway I'm just in case you need to do it it's something that a lot of people need to do because once they have their different size photos they want to rename those to the specific size of their image so that they can distinguish between the different sizes maybe on their web server for the website or something like that so over here in my terminal I'm going to a CD into my small directory that is this directory here on my desktop and then I'm just going to go up to this command that I ran earlier so you don't want to run this command unless you know for sure that you're in the correct directory because this will overwrite the names of files so only do this if you're sure 100 that you're in the correct directory and we are here we're in the small directory on the desktop and what this is doing is it's finding within the current directory all the files which in this case it's all JPEG files and then we're going to execute this bash command where we're going to move but pretty much move is the same thing as rename so we're going to rename this file we're going to disregard the extension here Pack 1 size 300 and then also add on the dot JPEG to the end again since we disregarded it earlier so if I hit enter there and then I run an LS command which just lists all the files into directory now you can see that all of our small images now have this 300 packed onto the end of the image name before these were just the same names as the large and medium size images and now they have this Dash 300 on the end to distinguish that they are 300 pixels wide well that about does it for this video like I said if you'd like to see another video on how to do this image resizing within the terminal I do have a video on that and I will put the link in the description below but other than that I hope that this video was useful for you guys if you
