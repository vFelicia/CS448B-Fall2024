hey what's going on guys I wanted to make a quick little video to show you how to do screenshots on the Mac a lot of you guys may already know how to do this but for those of you who don't I wanted to walk through a few of the different ways that you can do this so the first way is plain and simple if you just hit command shift 3 on your keyboard then you will see that it takes a screenshot of the entire desktop and just places it ear on your desktop so if I open this up then you can see it took a an image of my entire screen so that's the easiest way just to do screenshot of the entire screen and save it to your desktop if you want more control instead of command shift 3 if you hit command shift 4 then you will see these crosshairs pop up and what you can do with these crosshairs is just drag them over top of the part of the image that you want and it will also save to your desktop size so here you can see that this image saved to the desktop here there's a few different keys that you can use with the crosshairs if you hold in shift while you're dragging then you can restrict it to drag only down so if I move out here to the right then it's restricted and then if I release shift it'll be I can go in any direction I want and then if I hold in shift again and move it right then I can move to the right without moving down so it kind of restricts your movement if you need to if you need to be precise there you can also hold in option and what option does is instead of dragging from the top left corner it drags from the center so this is really useful if you say for example I wanted this folder here to be in the center of my image I could hit command shift 4 and hold down the option key and click and drag and no matter where I drag this that folder is going to be directly in the middle of my image another thing that you can do with command shift 4 and your cursor is you hold in space and when you hold in space say you start to draw and you realize that you're in the wrong spot if you hold in space then you can just move your window so if I wanted to start this drawing at the top of top corner of that window then I can just hold in space and drag down until I'm there and at any time if you're doing a screen shot and you're not happy with where you are then you can hit escape and it'll just cancel out so another way that you can do screen shots is if you hit command shift 4 again and see your crosshairs pop up and now with the crosshairs on the screen if you hit space then you'll see a little camera here and what the camera is is it takes a screenshot of entire windows so so if I just click on this window then I don't have to line those crosshairs up it just takes an image of the window and you can see that the it also captures those curves and everything that you would have been able to do with the crosshair so if you want to take an image of a complete window then that's the way you should do it so for basic screenshots that should be just about all you need to know but there are some more advanced things we can do for example whenever I do tutorials sometimes I'll need to drop a menu down and show exactly where my cursor is and an image and we can't really do that with the methods I just showed you but there are some ways that we can do this so if I open up the terminal then we can actually run this screen capture from the terminal with some options that we set so I'll go ahead and do this and walk you through as I go so if we type in screen capture and then I type in a C uppercase C that will tell the screen capture to capture my cursor also and then if I do a T uppercase T that means that this screenshot capture will be on a timer and then we set the timer in seconds I'm going to set this to 5 seconds and this doesn't default to the desktop so I'm actually going to have to like this in manually desktop and i'll call this image SS P&G and as soon as i hit enter it's going to start that timer and then i can go and do whatever I needed to be captured in an image and then it'll save that to the location I typed in so I'll go ahead and hit enter and then go over here to my menu and you know do whatever it is that I needed an image taken care of and so after that five seconds it took the image and if I look here at the desktop then you can see that it captured everything here has the has the mouse and the interaction that I was performing when it took the screenshot we can also change some of the default settings for the screen capture within the terminal so for example if I go in here into the terminal and I type in defaults right comm dot Apple screen capture then a few of the options that I can change I can change the image type to do that I would just type in type jpg or type PNG it's PNG by default you can also change the the location for where it saves images by default so let me go ahead and show you this so for example if you look over here at the desktop it'll get a little cluttered if you take a whole lot of screenshots so I could make a folder here and just call this folder or screenshots and I'll go ahead and copy that and then if I go back here to the terminal and have my defaults right calm down Apple screen capture and then I can type in location and then I'm just gonna set this to the location that I just created screenshots okay and let's go ahead and take a screenshot and make sure that that worked okay now that didn't work because there was one step that I forgot to do here anytime I change any of these defaults in the terminal then I also have to restart something called the system UI server so to do that after I made the change then I can type in kill all the system UI server and that will restart that screen capture software and and those changes will take place so now if I take a screenshot then it should save it to the location that we specified and there it is so now we can move all these images that we just took over into our screenshots folder and that'll clean up the desktop for us and lastly I'm just going to show you one more option for taking screenshots if for some reason you don't like using keyboard shortcuts there is a way that you can do this with the mouse if you open up this application called preview then if you select File here then at the bottom you can see that you can go to take a screenshot and when you go to take a screenshot you can do all the options that we've already gone over you can do by selection you can do it by window or you can do by the entire screen one nice thing about doing it through the preview is that if you come in here and take your screenshot then it'll pull up this window here and show you what it looks like and instead of saving it by default you can close it to get rid of it or you can come in here and go to save and you can call it whatever you want you can change the file type and you can change the location that way you don't have to you know go in and mess with the terminal to do those advanced things you can do that through the preview application so well hopefully you guys got something useful out of this be sure to subscribe for future tips and tutorials and thanks for watching
