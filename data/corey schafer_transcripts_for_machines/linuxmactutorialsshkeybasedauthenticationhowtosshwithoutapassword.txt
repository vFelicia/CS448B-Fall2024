hey there how's it going everybody in this video we'll be learning how to use keybased authentication instead of passwords in order to SSH into a machine so this is much more convenient and also more secure than using passwords so if you ever plan on doing any system administration work in the future then you'll most likely spend a lot of time at using the secure shell to log into different machines to do some work and setting up keybased authentication not only saves time but it's more secure and also allows you to automate tasks more easily now for this video I'm going to assume that you currently have a machine that you can SSH into using a password and if you don't currently have a machine that you can SSH into but would like to follow along with this video then you can watch my video on setting up virtual machines within VirtualBox that you can access via SSH so let's go ahead and get started I have two terminals pulled up right now and on the left I'm going to keep as my local machine and on my right I'm going to use as my remote machine so I currently have a virtual machine running that I can SSH into but it requires that I enter a password every time so for example I can say SSH core EMS that's the username on that machine and the IP address for this machine is 192.168.1 hundred so the first time we try to SSH in we'll have to say that we want to continue and then I'll ask us for our password just like it did there and now we are in the machine so our goal is to be able to log into this machine without using a password now I'm going to leave this remote machine that logged in over here and leave this connection open while we're looking at how we can set up keybased authentication so what we're going to do is we're going to create a private key and a public key now the private key will live on our local machine and the public key is going to live on the machine that will be SSH into or the remote machine so when I first learned how to setup key based authentication for SSH I could never remember if it was the private or public key that I was supposed to push to the remote machine that I wanted to log into so just to say that again it's the public key that we want to push to that remote machine that we'll be logging into now you can remember this by thinking about the private key being on the machine that only you have access to your private local machine and the public key will be placed on the machine that you'll be trying to access so to create the public and private keys on our local machine we're going to use the command SSH keygen now if you look this up online before like in github Orla no documentation or something like that then you'll notice a lot of people recommend adding a key RSA B 4096 now that key option just means that we want to make sure that we're using RSA as the type of key and the B option just makes our keys a bit more secure so I'm going to go ahead and add that in the default is 2048 and it's probably fine but it's easy to bump this up so we might as well do that so now let's go ahead and run this command and it'll ask us where we want to save this and we'll just keep that default location and then it'll ask us to insert a passphrase now if you want more security or you're worried about someone getting access to your local computer then you can put in a passphrase here but I'm just going to go ahead and leave this blank so now that key was created so now that we created those keys we can navigate to the directory where those were placed and that was in our home directory and this dot SSH directory now if I list the files in this directory then you can see that we have two keys here ID underscore RSA is our private key and ID underscore RSA dot pub is our public key so ID underscore RSA pub is the one that we want to copy over to our remote machine that we're going to be logging into now at this point some people use a simple command called SSH copy ID ssh copy ID but if you're on a Mac and don't have that command by default first we're going to go ahead and go over how to do this manually which isn't very difficult and once we do it manually then we'll also see how to do this with SSH copy ID so first let's do this manually so we still have our ssh connection open up on this machine over here to our right and before I copy the key over to that remote machine I'm first going to make sure that the machine has a dot ssh directory for me to place that file in so within my home folder over here on my local machine or in my remote machine and if I do a PWD then you can see that my home directory on this remote machine is located at home core EMS now if you're not within your home directory then you can just type in CD enter and it will automatically take you there so once you're in that home directory then let's create that dot SSH directory we can do that with make dirty SSH and that will create our dot SSH directory if it doesn't already exist so now let's copy our public key over to that remote machine now to do this I'm going to use the SCP command SCP is a way to copy files to a machine over SSH now this is somewhat of a long command but to run this command I'm just going to say SCP and then my home directory dot SSH that's where we placed those keys and then the key that I want to come copy over is ID underscore RSA dot pub now that's the file that we want to copy over so now we'll put in a space and now where we want to copy it so we want to copy it to core EMS 192.168.1 hundred so that is the username at the machine and once we have that type in we're going to type in a colon here to specify where in that machine we want to place this file we want to place this in slash home slash core EMS which is that user's home directory slash dot SSH that's the one that we just created and then slash and now what we want to call this key when we move it over so I'm just going to rename this to uploaded underscore key pub now that's not necessary but that's just one that I usually pick so that it stands out so now if I hit enter then it will ask for our password because we haven't set up keybased authentication yet so now I'll put in that password so now that should have copied over so if we come over to our local machine here and we do an LS on that dot SSH directory then we can see that we have that uploaded key public key so now that we have that key let's append the contents of that file to a new file called authorized keys now this file doesn't currently exist but it we'll create it when we append the key to that file so to do this we're just going to say cat and then the file that we want to cut is in our home folder ssh uploaded key pub and now this double carrots here will append to a file and the file that we want to append to is the our home folder dot ssh and this is going to be called authorized underscore keys now this is a file it's not a directory on linux systems files don't have to have a file extension so we're just going to leave it like this and this appending right here will automatically create this file when we run this so let's go ahead and run that and now let's go ahead and make sure that worked by typing in cat which will print out the contents of the file and we'll print out that authorized key file that we just created and you can see here that it did append that public key information to that file ok and now I'm just going to clear my screen so we can see a little bit better here so now we should make sure that our permissions are set up correctly now if you don't know Linux permissions very well then that will be a topic for another video but in this video we will just set these permissions where they need to be so our SSH folder should be set to 700 and the files within that folder should be set to 600 so we can set this by saying chmod 701 our dot SSH folder so we'll go ahead and run that and now we want to do a chmod 600 all of the files in that folder so we're going to put an asterisk there to get all of the files and we're setting those to 600 so I'll run that okay so now if we did all of that correctly then we should be able to SSH into our machine without a password so now let's try this from our local machine so let's do an SSH we want to SSH in as core EMS at 192.168.1 hundred ok so awesome that looked like it worked and that we were able to log in without a password so now that you have this set up to use keybased authentication one last thing that you might want do is maximize security by only allowing this kind of logging login and turning off password authentication all together so this will require all users connect through SSH using this key based authentication so this is a really quick change so let me show you how to do this really quick since we're already logged into that machine over here so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to use this console to change our SSH configuration to turn off password authentication so to do this we need to edit our SSH config file and on a Linux machine that file is located at /et c / ssh slash sshd underscore config now it's a good idea to always make a backup of configuration files before you change anything so first I'm going to do a sudo copy of that file now is located at slash etc' slice SSH slash SSH underscore OSS HD underscore config so now to back this up we'll just put it in that same folder but we will give it a name of the same name but with a dot back to so that it's a backup file and then we'll have to put in our password there so now that we have a backup of that configuration file now let's go ahead and just change the original file and turn off that password authentication so I'm going to do a sudo nano you can use them if you want to use them but if you're not familiar with them the Nano is an easier editor for beginners so let's go ahead and just run nano on that file and what we want to find is the option that is password authentication so if we scroll down here a bit until we find this so it's right here so there's a chance that this is going to be commented out that's what this pound sign here is so let's uncomment out that and for password authentication we instead want to set this equal to no so now let's go ahead and save the file so on Nano that's control X and then a wide to save now you should have no problem finding that option in that file but even if you don't find that you can just add it in there so now that we've saved that let's restart our SSH service for those to take place and on a bun we can do that by saying sudo service SSH restart okay and now with that change that should prevent anyone from using regular pass passwords to log into that machine and that's going to make it a lot more secure okay so that is how you set up keybased authentication manually but now let's see how to do it using the ssh copy ID command so I have another terminal pulled up here now I have another machine that is able to SSH into as well and it is at query m/s at 192.168.1 hundred this one is at one zero one and we'll just go ahead and connect to this machine regularly using our password and once we're in I'll clear that so now real quick we're going to learn how we can use this ssh copy ID command to set up keybased authentication here on our second machine now this is considered a way easier approach than the one that I showed you how to do manually but for some of you meet you may not have access to this ssh copy ID command so I wanted to show the way that would work for everyone first and then this easier method if it's available to you so if you're on Linux then you should already have ssh copy ID as a command but if you're on Mac then you can install this by using homebrew and if you don't know what homebrew is basically it's just a package manager for the Mac now I have the website for it pulled up right here it's at HTTP brew SH and it's super easy to install and once you have that installed then it's just as easy as saying brew install SSH copy ID and then you'll have that command available to you okay so on our local machine we already have that public and private key that were generated using that SSH key gene command and those were here inside of our SSH folder now we'll go ahead and reuse these to login to the second machine without a password so this is as simple as just typing the command SSH copy ID and then the machine that we want to login to so our username and 192.168.1 is one zero one so let's go ahead and run that now even without specifying the key that command should find our ID RSA public key for us and when it does it will ask us for the password to our remote machine so I'll go ahead and type in that password and once that's finished let's go ahead and try to SSH into that machine now so let's do an ssh query ms @ 192 dot sixty okay so that looked like it worked so we didn't have to create an Sh folder on our remote machine we didn't have to manually copy the key over we didn't have to mess with permissions or anything like that so over here on our remote machine if we just do an LS la now there's a lot of files here but you can see right here we it created that dot ssh folder for us and if you even set the correct permissions of 700 there now if i clear my screen and list the files within that folder then we can see that it created that authorized keys file for us and it has the permissions of 600 already and it put our public key inside of that file so it did everything for us now that does do a lot of steps for you but it doesn't change the ssh configuration like we mentioned before when we went into that configuration file so if you want to disable password logins and you would still need to do that manually at this point okay so I think I just going to do it for this video I hope that this was useful for anyone wanting to learn how to use SSH key based authentication so it's really much more secure than regular passwords and also will be more convenient when running scripts that connect to these machines and things like that but if anyone does have any questions about what we
