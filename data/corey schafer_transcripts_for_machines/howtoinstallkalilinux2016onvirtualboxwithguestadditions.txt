hey there how's it going everybody in this video we're going to be learning how to install Kali Linux on VirtualBox Kali Linux is a distribution designed for penetration testing hacking forensics and things like that so getting this distribution installed within VirtualBox will be a good starting point for us to dig further into some of these features in future videos so first we'll need to download and install VirtualBox now this is pretty straightforward so I'm not gonna go into too much detail here if you just do a quick search on Google for VirtualBox then it should take you to the downloads page and that's here at virtualbox.org so from here you can choose your operating system and walk through that installation so for example I'm on a Mac so I would choose this OS X download here so I already have VirtualBox installed so I'm not gonna walk through that but it's just a simple stepbystep process that you click through just like installing any other software so after you get that installed when you pull it up it should look something like this so now that we have VirtualBox installed we're gonna need to download the Kali Linux ISO file and we can find this on the kali linux downloads page and also a quick google search of that should take you to this downloads page so once we're on this page we can go ahead and download the ISO file so I'm going to grab this Kali Linux 64bit ISO file so when I click on this is sure to go ahead and begin the installation and you can see that this is a large file this is 2.7 gigabytes that it's going to download here so I'm going to go ahead and fast forward until this download is complete okay so once that is downloaded let's go ahead and minimize our browser here and pull up VirtualBox so now we're ready to create our virtual machine so let's go ahead and choose new here and let's call this machine kali linux and we can leave the type at linux and for the version let's choose Debian 64bit and now we're not going to go into too much detail here with some of these setup options basically we're just saying how much memory and disk space we want allocated to our machine and this depends on your computer but you're usually safe staying within these green sections here so for the I'm gonna do 4096 megabytes which is four gigs and I'm gonna leave the default there and the default for the VirtualBox disk image they're dynamically allocated is fun and for this section here I'm actually going to bump the size of this hard disk up to 20 gigabytes Callie recommends on there download page that you have a minimum of 10 and you can get by with allocating that but I'm gonna go ahead and do 20 here okay so now the virtual machine is created but there's one more setting I'm going to change before we install Kali so if we go to the settings here then we can change some of the values that we just set but there's also a lot of other customizations that we can make so one change that I'm going to make here is within the display tab for the video memory I want to go ahead and bump this up all the way and this will just improve our performance when we start the virtual machine so now let's go ahead and save that okay so now we're ready to actually install Kali Linux so we install this using the ISO file that we downloaded a little bit ago so to do this we can select our ISO by going down here to storage and clicking this empty optical drive and then we can go to choose image and now we navigate to where we downloaded that ISO file so I'm already here in my downloads folder so I'm just gonna choose Kali Linux and open that so now I'm just going to go ahead and start this machine and it should take us to where we can install the operating system for the installation method here I'm just gonna choose graphical install okay now we can just walk through this setup and a lot of these are going to stay at the defaults okay I'm just going to leave that for the hostname I'm going to leave the domain name blank for now okay now we can type in a root password and you have to remember this for when you log in and here I'm going to go ahead and choose Mountain time so since this is a new install we're going to go ahead and do the entire disk okay and at this point we can go ahead and choose yes to write these changes to the disk now this may take a second here so I'm going to go ahead and fast forward until this is finished installing okay well you can just leave the default there and I'm gonna leave that blank okay I'm going to leave the default there and I'm gonna go ahead and select that and continue and now you can see here that it is finishing the installation okay so now it says that our installation is complete so let's go ahead and continue okay so once that is finished installing that it should come here to this login screen so we can just login with the root user and we can use the password that we created whenever we ran through the installation okay so now we have a fresh install of a Kali desktop but we're not quite done so one thing that you're going to want to do is to install guest additions software so guest additions software will fix the display settings so that you can use Linux in full screen and it'll allow you to share directories between your host computer and the VM and it'll also allow you to share your clipboard which means you'll be able to copy and paste back and forth between your host computer and the virtual machine so for example right now if I make this full screen then you can see that it doesn't take up as much of the screen as we would like and it has all this wasted space that it could be using and guest additions will fix this now if you watch my video on installing Ubuntu and VirtualBox then you would know that you could just come up here to devices and do insert guest additions CD image and it's super simple but with Kali that doesn't exactly work and if you search for installing guest additions for Kali and their own documentation they have the preferred method for how they would like you to do it so you can see here that it says to start your Kali Linux virtual Jeane open a terminal window and use these following commands so what we're gonna do is go ahead and open up terminal and we're not gonna be able to copy and paste back and forth between our host and our virtual machine yet so I'm just gonna go ahead and type these out so I'm gonna do an act get update and once that's finished I'm going to do and aptget install and we want to install with a dash Y option and we will do VirtualBox guest X 11 okay so once that's finished installing then we can go ahead and type in reboot us to allow those changes to take place okay so now I'm going to go ahead and minimize my browser here and maximize that and we can go ahead and log back in with root okay so once that's done now you can see that when we're in fullscreen mode that the VM uses all of the space that it didn't use up before and if we go to view here then you can see that it is set to autoresize guest display' so we do have those guest additions installed and working ok so now you should be good to go so you have a working fresh installation of Cali up and running and if you ever want to follow along with any of my command line tutorials then you could just come in here and open up the terminal and you could just start typing in commands and trying things out okay so I think that's gonna do it for this video if you have any questions and feel free to ask in the comment section below and I'll do my best to
