hey what's going on guys I wanted to make a quick video about an app that I've been using a lot lately whenever I'm at work I work a lot on a Windows machine and then whenever I get home I'll work on my Mac and there's actually a couple of features from Windows I find myself missing whenever I'm programming on the Mac mostly it's the windows snapping feature and that's where this application comes in it's called hyper dock that I found on the on the App Store you can once you download it you can come in here and change some settings around and tweak it to how you like it but let me go ahead and show you what it does here so normally if I've got a couple windows open here and I've got some code over here and a test website over here now I like to have my code and my website taken up equal sides of screen just fiftyfifty and normally you'd have to come in here and manually adjust these every time that you want to do that but with the hyper dock it brings that window snapping functionality from Windows to where I can just take this window and drag it all the way over to the right and then it snaps and then I can take this and drag it all the way over to the left and then it snaps into place so that's really nice if I take it up to the top it will maximize it and there's also keyboard shortcuts for this too so if you hit the command key and the left arrow then it goes to the left and then command key right arrow takes it out to where it was normally and then if I do right again then it goes you can see right side of the screen so it's a really quick way to move windows around on your screen and you can do really quick layouts with this say I want to say I wanted the you can also go to the corners so if I wanted this website you take up the top half of the screen I could go up here to this top corner and then stretch this over and then if I wanted my javascript file to be at the bottom right I could put that down here and if I wanted the HTML file I could put that down in the bottom left and then I can see everything and I could go ahead and make changes to the website and see them in real time so you can pretty much lay that out any way that you want to do it and it's just really nice to be able to do that quickly instead of constantly manually dragging those around and like I said I usually just go with the 50/50 but this that's not the only functionality that this app has it also has the ability to let me go ahead and drag these over here you'll see I also have some windows open up in the background here and those are in Google Chrome if on my dock whenever you scroll over the icon and the dock it actually gives you a preview of all the windows that are open so instead of moving windows around to see what's in the back I can just scroll over these and it'll show me a little preview of each one so if I want to go to this one here I can just click on that and it brings it to the front you can also close windows down from this little screen here so if I scroll over this Google tab here and then just click this X then it closes it down and then you can also add windows by clicking this little plus button so that's a whole lot better than then you know moving windows around on your desktop trying to find trying to find where everything is another nice feature I like is whenever you scroll over your calendar it will show your events that are coming up yeah whenever you scroll through your calendar it will show your events that are coming up and also if you scroll over your music applications like iTunes or Spotify then instead of maximizing these to play music you can just scroll over top of them and come up here and hit play and you know you can switch through these and you can also do that with iTunes so I can play a song then I can switch the next one all from here so it's really nice that it you know everything that I like more about windows this app brings it all over to the Mac and I think the application was around ten dollars but I get a ton of use out of it and I like it a whole lot so I just wanted to share it with you guys so yeah check it out and thanks for watching
