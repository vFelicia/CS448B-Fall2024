hey how's it going everybody in this video we're gonna take a look at some keyboard shortcuts from within the terminal that are extremely helpful once you get them memorized so let me pull up a longer command here so that we have something to work with so within the terminal if you just use your arrow keys to move around then you can only go one character at a time so the first shortcut is ctrl a if you hit control a you can see that the cursor jumped here to the beginning of the line so you can think of a as the beginning of the alphabet and so it goes to the beginning of the line the next shortcut is ctrl E and you can think of that as the end for end and that goes to the end of the OP end the line so ctrl a goes to the beginning ctrl ego's to the end now if we want to go in between that we can hold in the option key on the Mac and then use the arrows to go one word at the time so you can see I'm jumping by words here and then the right arrow goes one word to the right also if you're holding in the option key then you can then you see that the mouse here turns into this little bullseye here and anywhere that you click you go directly to that point so that's holding in the option key and then clicking anywhere within your command to go to that point so those are a few shortcuts for navigation now let's look at a few shortcuts for actually altering the commands so if you hit ctrl you then it's going to delete everything and the command before your cursor so for example if I hit ctrl you right here and it's going to delete everything before this type word right here so I'll hit control U and you can see that it took out everything before the cursor and now if I bring that back now this time I'm going to delete everything after the cursor so if I'm here at the same location this time if I hit ctrl K then it deletes everything after the cursor so I hit ctrl K it's going to delete everything after this type word here so ctrl K and you can see that deleted everything after the cursor and that command another nice command to know is the tab key and a lot of people already know this one but if you don't then you use it all the time it will autocomplete so say for example if I'm typing in CD and I know that I want to go to my projects folder all I have to do is type in the start of the word and if there's nothing else that matches that other than projects that can hit tab and you can see that it automatically completes that so if I want to go to demos I can hit D hit tab and then if I want to go to terminal so you can see it went all the way to terminal but then it kind of made a noise and it means that it can't autocomplete it all the way that's because with in here I have terminal demo and I also have underscore shortcuts so after you kind of give it a direction to go so say I want to go to shortcuts I'll type in the underscore then I'll hit tap again and it'll know how to complete the rest of that command so that's Auto completion using the tab key but you can also do Auto completion by dragging and dropping folders so for example let me move over my terminal window here so that you we can see my desktop say I want to change directory into this videos folder here well instead of typing in CD users kori desktop videos and things like you know all of that I can just type in CD back and grab this folder drag it to my terminal and drop it in and it'll fill in that path for me and if I hit enter then you can see now I'm in the videos directory so some other useful shortcuts here that you'll use all the time are the up arrows and the down arrows if you hit up it'll scroll through your previous commands and if you hit down it will go back through those commands all the way until you get to your new blank command now if you want to rerun a command that you've previously run and it's not immediately showing up whenever you try to scroll back through using your up arrow then you can type in the exclamation point and then some characters here so if I wanted to read the last fine command that I ran into terminal that I can type exclamation point find it doesn't even have to be find it can be fi and what that's going to do is the terminal is going to go back through your history and rerun the very first command that it sees that starts with Fi so if I run that then you can see that it ran this command here now if I hit the up arrow then you can see that the last command that it ran was this fine command that I ran a long time ago now you can also do this if you type in history then it's going to show you the history of all your commands and you can do the same thing with this history now you can either copy and paste these but say I wanted to rerun this find command again and I found this here at I want to run the one at 527 so instead of copying pasting or retyping the whole thing out I can just type in exclamation point 527 and I'll rerun the command in your history that is line 527 which was that fine command and you can see that it ran that there now if you want to interactively search for a previous command then you can hit ctrl R and you can see that's going to bring up this prompt here reverse search and so then you could just start typing and you can see if I highlight this here this is what I've typed in so far and it will go back and search your commands and will tell you which one it's going to run based off of the search that you've typed in so far so say that's the one I want I could just hit enter and they'll run that command for me and the last two shortcuts that I want to show you are two that you've been seeing me do throughout the whole video and that has to do with clearing the screen so say that I want to clear the screen right now I can hit control L and that'll clear the screen but what that doesn't do is clear the scroll back and what I mean by that is if I scroll up you can see that I can still scroll back aways here and if you don't like that then on the Mac you can hit the command key command K and it'll clear the scroll back so I just did that and now trying to scroll up and I can't because there's nothing there now if I hit ctrl L a few times which clears the screen but it doesn't clear the scroll back then you can see that all those control ELLs did was add a bunch of blank lines in to clear the screen out so those are a few keyboard shortcuts that I use within the terminal on a daily basis hopefully you guys found those useful if you do have any questions and just ask in the comment section below be sure to subscribe for
