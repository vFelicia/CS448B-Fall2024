hey there how's it going everybody in this video I just wanted to check in and give everyone some updates about the channel I'm always getting suggestions from a lot of you about some improvements that you'd like to see a lot of the suggestions that I get have to do with providing the code Snippets and source code from my videos and also some ideas for how I organize my videos so I've been working on getting some of those improvements in place and we'll discuss all of that here in just a bit um also in this video I have a couple of questions for you all and would love any feedback that you can provide in the comments or messages so first of all I just wanted to give a big thank you to all of you we recently hit 30,000 subscribers on the channel and I'm getting more and more messages and feedback every day I can't always respond to every message and question that I receive but I just want you all to know that I do read every one of them and really appreciate all the feedback that you send my way and I especially want to thank all the people who are supporting through patreon um now I know that not everyone has the means to support financially and that's totally understandable but for those of you who do I just want you to know that I really appreciate it um at some point I would love to make these tutorials fulltime so that I could put out a ton more indepth videos at a faster pace and every bit of support makes that more and more of a possibility and speaking of patreon I recently updated the rewards that I offer so if you're not familiar with patreon it's basically a way for people to financially support creators for as little as a dollar a month and they also have a feature where you can set certain levels so that anyone who donates a certain amount unlocks some kind of of perk or reward so the reward that I already had in place is that anyone who supports the channel gets a shout out on my personal website and that's over here on my contributions page now that is unless they opted out of that I do have several supporters who chose to opt out of getting that uh now I'm going to continue adding supporters to my contributors page here but I've also wanted to uh do more than just giving a shout out for people who support the channel so I was trying to think of some better rewards that I could offer and you can see that I've updated this over here on the side um so one thing that I was thinking uh was that we could do book giveaways specifically for people who support the channel so I've updated my patreon so that anytime I do a giveaway each supporter will get one entry for every dollar that they contribute and then I will randomly select a winner from those entries so for example someone contributing $10 will receive 10 entries and so on um so I'm probably going to do my first giveaway like this uh at the beginning of next month or so um and another fun thing I was thinking was that I could write my own script to randomly select this winner and I could make a video showing the process for how I go about writing a script like that so that's one question that I had for all of you is uh what do you think of these rewards for patreon supporters because I really do appreciate all of you who support the channel and I want to provide something in return uh so if you have any ideas or feedback then I'm definitely open for suggestions now the only caveat here is that I can't do any reward that's too timec consuming uh because I still do have a fulltime job and I'm also answering a lot of viewer questions in my free time so any rewards that I provide will have to be something that doesn't take up too much time uh because any time that I put towards that will take away from the time that I'm able to put into answering questions and making future videos and I know that for the most part uh you all would like to uh see me get out more videos than anything else okay so with that out of the way let's move on to some of the updates here now one of the most common suggestions that I get is that I should be putting up the source code from each of my videos so I've gone back through all of my videos and tried to put all of the code onto my GitHub page um now I've also gone through each video and added links to the source code in the description of each video so this is just one example here if you're looking for the source code then you can look in the comments and there will usually be a link like this the code from this video can be found at and it'll have a link and when you click on that it'll take you over to my GitHub page where I link the source code for those videos so in the future I'm going to make it a habit of pushing the code to my GitHub page before I publish a video and I'll be sure to add those links to the source code in the description of each video so be on the lookout for that okay and another suggestion that I get a lot is that I should create a playlist that orders all of my python videos in such a way where there's some kind of progression and this would be so that uh someone who's learning python can just start at the beginning of the playlist and the videos that I suggest for a beginner will be towards the beginning intermed intermediate videos will be in the middle and more advanced videos will be towards the end so I've created one large python playlist and ordered my videos in such a way that I think it's the uh best for beginners uh or what I think is best for beginners will be towards the beginning and they progress through to the more advanced tutorials now I do want to point out that this doesn't exactly flow like a python class where uh you should watch every single video back to back there are some videos that people will most likely want to skip so for example at the beginning of the playlist I've placed all of the development environment setup videos now I made development environment setup videos for Sublime Text and atom and eclipse and I made setup videos for each of these because different people have different preferences and I wanted to give my preferred setup for each of those but for someone who's getting started with python they might only want to watch one of these videos to get their environment set up and then move on to the next relevant topic they probably don't want to watch all three of these setup videos but with that said I did order these in a way that I think makes sense for someone learning python uh so at the beginning we have our development environment setups and then we move on to you know package management with Pip and creating virtual environments uh learning about scope and so on now this is one large python playlist with every single one of my python videos now for something that does flow more like a class then I have created other uh playlists that flow uh from you know uh from beginning to end just like you'd expect so if someone is only interested in learning how to create classes and objectoriented programming in Python then they can just go straight to this playlist instead and I have created several other playlists that focus on specific topics rather than the large python playlist with everything included um so just give those playlists a look and um and hopefully they're ordered appropriately okay so I think that's going to do it for this video now those are by far the suggestions that I get the most and hopefully now that those are addressed then the videos will be more accessible and easier to follow along than before um now as usual if you have any questions then feel free to ask in the comment section below um feel free to give me suggestions or feedback about anything that we talked about in this update video and again thank you all for everything and thanks for watching
