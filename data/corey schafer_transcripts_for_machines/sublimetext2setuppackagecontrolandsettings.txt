hey everybody how's it going I wanted to make a video on setting up a development environment in sublime text to just walk through how to get it installed how to get set up with package control and package control it's going to allow you to install some thirdparty plugins also I will show you some packages that I use everyday and also will mess around with a little a few of the user settings to get you started so we're over here at the sublime text website and the first thing you want to do is just go ahead and download the program you can either click on this download link here or there should be a download button on the home page I already have this downloaded here so I'm just going to go ahead and install it and once this is installed if you're on a Mac and you can just drag this app into your Applications folder and let's go ahead and open that up okay now the first thing I'm going to do now that I have sublime text open as I'm going to drag in a test project that I have here just so that we can see see some files on the screen so I'll just drag that over and drop it and I'm going to open up my sample HTML file my sample CSS file and my sample javascript file okay and now that we have something to work with the first thing that we're going to want to install is packets control so to install package control just go back over here to google and type in sublime text package control and it should be the first link at the top and from here just go to install now and you're gonna have two options listed here you're going to have an option for sublime text 3 and you're gonna have an option for sublime text too since we're doing sublime text to go ahead and move over to that time and copy all this and within sublime text if we go to view and show console that will open up the console to where we need to paste this code in to install package control so just paste there hit enter and it says okay you're finished please restart sublime text to finish the installation so we will quit out of here and open it back up and to test the package control works let's hit command shift P if that if you're on a Mac ctrl shift P if you're on a if you're on Windows and then do install and install package okay and so if you can get to this point then it means package control is work and now we can install all the any of these thirdparty applications just for just just for our first one let's just do something easy and install color scheme some of the color schemes I like or this guy has a ton these Dale Reis color schemes go ahead and install that to minimize this here and you can see at the bottom left that says installing package color schemes and it shouldn't take long to finish up here but okay so package color scheme successfully install it perfect okay now to change your color scheme you can click on sublime text here and go to your preferences and in color scheme now we should have that plugin that we just installed and it'll give us you know you have a ton of different color schemes to choose from here so you can just pick any one of these and it changes there's let me make this text a little bit bigger for you guys changes the color of your text but you can also install entire themes and wanting to what a theme is is it will change the entire layout of the application and make it look like an entire different application really so it'll change the style of the tabs it'll change the style of the folders so to do that let's go ahead and install one of those command shift P again and install and a theme that's really popular is one called predawn and if you click up here on predawn it will install and it pops up with a readme sometimes whenever you sometimes whenever you install these packages it automatically comes up with a readme file and a lot of these are really useful so I suggest you read through them whenever you whenever they pop up so right here it says to activate the theme add or replace your current theme settings with the code below so all we need to do is copy this and then we want to open up our settings so we go to sublime text to preferences and we want to open up our user settings the default settings I'll go ahead and open this up so you can see the default settings have all the settings for sublime text there's a ton of them in here but if you change this file then whenever sublime text updates then it's gonna but it's gonna write over all your changes so you don't want to put you don't want to make any of your customizations to the settings in the default settings file you want to do all that in the user settings and it won't overwrite those it'll keep them so let's open up our user settings and we can go ahead and close down the default and as you can see here a few of these have already been changed this changed our color scheme and I change the font size so let's just go ahead and highlight all that and paste it in and save it and you'll see when we save it it changes the entire look of the application so the tabs look different our folders look different and if we go back to that readme file he also says he has some other settings that he likes as well and I happen to agree with them I like these settings also it just changes some of the default behavior the font size the font style so let's go ahead and copy that and let's put a comma there and paste that in and we're not gonna need this last comment down here and go ahead and save that and a few of the chain you can see the font change the font size changed and I'm gonna go ahead and restart this just because it recommended that we do that after we he says he are important make sure to restart sublime after installing and activating freed on okay so now we can close that stuff down now we have our HTML CSS and JavaScript files and so now we have a theme installed and you can switch between color schemes that stuff is all by preference if you guys want to use a different color scheme or use the default that's you know that that's up to you so now let's go ahead and install some packages that are actually going to help you with your development so if we hit command shift P install package let's install one called bracket highlighter and once again we are going to need to restart now what the bracket highlighter does it's a simple plugin all it does is tells you where your brackets are anytime so I'm in this javascript file and I'm inside this function it tells me over here by my line numbers okay this function starts here and it ends here and this works and it's not very useful for the example that I have up right now because it's only 32 lines of code but if you have you know functions that are hundreds of lines long then finding where those brackets begin and end is really useful it works in your JavaScript files and your CSS files it works here and even in your index files so see I click on head here and it tells me hey the head tag starts here and the head tag ends here so that's really useful okay let's go ahead and move on and install another plugin install package and this one is going to be called sublime code Intel now this one takes a second to install but what the sublime code Intel does is it kind of add some IDE style functionality to your to the program so that'll it'll try to auto complete some code as you're typing it so for example here I'll just go and type in let's see VAR test string equals hey whoops okay so that completed while I was typing and opened up the readme file automatically okay so once again here's the readme file for the sublime code Intel so I highly recommend you guys read through these anytime you install package it get some good tips this one has some really useful shortcuts okay but let's go ahead and close that down and I'll show you what it does so this test string hey a test and on our next line if we type in test string dot then it's just going to give us some it's gonna try to complete the code for so it's going to kind of give us some suggestions here so we can you know see everything that we can do with this string so you know that's useful it kind of kind of helps out alright and let's go ahead and keep moving on install another package and another package I like is called Emmitt and I could do an entire different tutorial on Emmitt so I'm not going to spend too much time on this since we're just setting up and getting your sublime text setup for a development but Emmitt is pretty much a way to scaffold out your HTML files very quickly there's also some good CSS tricks that are built into it also but just really quick here what what Emmitt does is it allows you to quickly type in let's say like div class name with a with another div inside of that with class of summary and we want eight of those then we can hit tab and it's going to go ahead and autocomplete all that for us so it's just a really quick way to type these things out and and get them to display on the screen I'm not going to go through everything that you can do with it but I highly should just reading up on it once once you get comfortable with it it really makes your development setup a lot faster okay and the last plugin I'm going to show you guys is install package is sublime linter okay and you can see here sublime will enter as a plugin that supports LEM programs known as linter it will highlight lines of code that the Leonard deems to contain potential errors so it kind of helps you out it's that kind of shows you where you might be making mistakes in your code and also give you suggestions to best practices handles a lot of languages here so let's just go ahead and see what it does if I go back to my main J's file here and save it and let's see if we have so as you can see here on the number line it's given a suggestion here and it says if I click on the line at the bottom left is where the suggestion is it says hey test string is defined but never used so I have a variable here that I've defined and I'm not using that anywhere else in my program so you know that's a good that's a good suggestion it's just going to kind of pop those up for you now and then and tell you where you've made a mistake or where or it could just be a warning to maybe not something that'll break your program but something that you might want to look at so there's another one here if I just delete a semicolon and save it then you know same thing click on it says hey you're missing a semicolon here so it's a it's really nice to have while while you're developing just to have something watching in the background like that because everybody makes those makes dumb mistakes like that from time to time so hopefully you got this was used for you guys now you have a way to change your color schemes change your the way that the application is laid out you know now you have a way to install thirdparty plugins and also a few plugins to get you started so hopefully this tutorial was useful for you guys and thanks for watching
