hey how's it going everybody in this video I wanted to give a quick update of where we currently are with this channel also wanted to go over my plans for future tutorials so that you all know what videos you can expect to see in the near future and lastly I also thought it would be fun to do some kind of giveaway for subscribers and we'll go over the details of that at the end of this video so the channel is rapidly approaching 5000 subscribers and it looks like it's going to get there in another day or two so first of all I just want to say thank you when I first started making these videos I didn't really know what to expect but the entire experience so far has been nothing but positive I get a lot of feedback from you all and honestly I can't think of hardly any negative comments that I've received even when somebody writes in with constructive criticism it's always extremely respectful and meant to be helpful and I just wanted you all to know how much I appreciate that and also while I'm thinking people I especially wanted to thank people who have contributed so far through my patreon page there's a lot I want to do to improve this channel in the future and it's so motivating to see this kind of support early on in the process so thank you all so much for that now as far as channel updates go I've had a few requests from people saying that I should put together a list of tutorials that I'm currently working on and make release schedule for when you can expect those classes now the reason I haven't done this so far is because sometimes something will come up with my fulltime job that prevents me from devoting as much time to these videos as I'd like and I was worried I would announce to you all that I would have certain classes ready at a certain time and something would come up where I wouldn't be able to meet that deadline but I do like the idea of having a list of videos that I'm currently working on so I'm going to try to keep a small updated list here on my website and if you don't know my website is corey ms calm and that's c.o.r.e why ms calm and you can see here on my website that i have added a small list of tutorials coming soon to my sidebar now don't worry if you've suggested a video that you don't see here on this list I have a separate personal list that i keep on my computer locally with hundreds of video ideas that I plan on getting to as soon as possible but these are the videos that I've actually started writing sample code for and writing scripts for and things like that now I know there are only two Python videos currently on this list but don't worry I'm still going to focus heavily on Python tutorials since that seems to be the most popular videos on the channel but I've also wanted to start adding more command line tutorials and the ones that I have listed here I've been meaning to finish for some time and they shouldn't take that long to knock out but definitely expect to see more advanced Python tutorials coming soon as well now I would also like to start doing more videos on other tools that you'll likely be using in the industry so for example I'd like to put together some videos on continuous integration specifically how to install and use Jenkins I'd also like to do some more advanced get tutorials and also some more advanced SQL and database tutorials I could even do some SQL alchemy with in Python as well but this here is just a small list that I threw together on my website for now and i'll be adding and removing from this as time goes on and as always your feedback is always welcome so if there is something in particular you would like me to cover then just leave me a comment or send me a message and I'll write it down on my list of topics okay and lastly along with the channel update I thought it might be fun to also do a giveaway so I have a lot of programming books that helped me out a lot whenever I was first getting started and I thought instead of these books just sitting on my shelf that they would be more useful if I gave them away to subscribers so this time the book i'll be giving away is my own copy of the pragmatic programmer and you can see down here on my sidebar that i have this listed as one of my recommended books on my website now you also see this on a lot of lists as one of the top books to read when learning software development I enjoyed it a lot and hopefully someone else will find it useful as well so the value of the book on Amazon is currently about $35 and it looks like they're temporarily out of stock here now this is my used copy so it does have a little bit of wear to it but nothing too bad now I know a programming book isn't the most exciting giveaway that you've ever seen it's not like a new macbook or something like that but this is the first time I've ever done one of these so we'll see how this goes and if it's pretty simple process then maybe we can do some more valuable giveaways in the future so in order to enter for this giveaway you can just go here to my website and at the top I have this link here for the giveaway and the URL to that page is corey ms calm ford / giveaway now i'm using a thirdparty service here that will handle all of the entries for me and randomly choose a winner and things like that and there are multiple ways that you can enter if you're a subscriber to the channel then you automatically get an entry and you can see here that you can get additional entries by visiting my different social media pages and referring friends to enter the competition as well so I believe that this is set up to end on May fifteenth so you can see here that there are 13 days left but by the time I post this video the robber be 12 days left to join so just so y'all know anytime I release a video in the first week or so there are usually only a couple of hundred views and I'd say that the percentage of people who watch this and actually inner will be fairly low so if you go here and enter then I'd say that your chances of winning are going to be pretty good so like I said we'll see how this goes and if it goes well then maybe we can do these giveaways from time to time when we have channel updates and things like that so I think that's going to do it for this video thank you all again so much I'm really excited that the channel has reached 5000 subscribers and I hope that everyone continues to enjoy and learn from these tutorials and you can expect many more in the near future so thanks again and thank you all for watching
