hey everybody how's it going in this video I wanted to show you how you can open up files and directories using Sublime Text from within your terminal uh so if you use your Terminal A Lot you've probably run into a situation where uh you're within a project and uh you find the file that you want to open or if you want to open up the entire project uh what you do is you go into finder you find that project or you find that file and you open it up that way but uh that's kind of timec consuming it'd be really nice if we had a command uh maybe called subl um and then the name of the file that we wanted and we could just open up the file that way uh well Sublime Text actually has in a builtin command line tool that we can use that does this um but it doesn't add it to our path automatically to where we can use that command so the location of this command is in applications Sublime Text contents share support and it's within this bin folder and it's called subl so if I type out this whole command and then type in X index.html whenever I hit enter you can see that it opens up that file from within Sublime Text so that's exactly what we want but this file or this line here is extremely long it would be nice if we could just type in this subl command and do it that way now there are two ways that we can go about this um first let me Echo out my path here and so what this shows is the these are the locations where your computer looks for these commands um so I've got a couple extra ones here but uh you can kind of see a theme here there's user local bin user bin bin uh user s bin um so what we our two options are we could add this whole line here up to this bin folder we could add that to our path or we could add this command into one of these existing folders and just link it to this command here and that's the approach that I'm going to take I just think that it's easier it's one line you don't have to go in and edit your uh bash RC files and things like that um so the one line to do that we can do an LNS which will create a link and then we can just copy this from before the entire thing and paste that in so that is what we are linking to and then to create our link we'll just type in user and I'm going to go ahead and go with this uh user local bin and so user local bin and the name of the command and I'm just going to stick with subl so let's go ahead and hit enter and now if I do an lsla within this user local bin directory and I'm going to take away that command and then I'm also going to do a GP for the name of the command so let's hit enter and you can see here that it found uh one entry and this L right at the front means that it's a link and you can see that it has the name of the command here and that it links to Applications uh Sublime Text app contents shared support bin and the command that we want so now that that's set up for us we should just be able to type in the short command and then the name of the file that we want hit enter and it opens it up in Sublime Text and this isn't only for opening up files we can open up um we can use this just like we use any other terminal tool now so it accepts relative pass so we can type in subl and do a DOT for the current directory and then if I open up my sidebar here then you can see that it opened up uh the entire test project um I can do that command with a dot dot Dash to open up the directory above and you can see that now I have three projects in this Parent Directory so you can use this just about any way that you want to use it and uh it's a lot faster than um tracking down these files from within your finder if you're already looking at them from within your terminal anyway so that about does it for this video uh now you should be able to open up any files or directories from directly within your ter teral um so if you guys have any questions about this you know feel free to ask in the comment section below I hope that this video was useful for you guys and thank you for watching
