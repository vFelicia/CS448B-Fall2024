hey everybody how's it going this is just gonna be a short little video just for fun we're not gonna go over tutorial or anything like that I just wanted to show you guys something that one of my friends pointed out to me that I thought was pretty neat so there's this movie I liked a lot called ex machina and it's about this genius programmer who owns this multibillion dollar company and he goes out into the middle of nowhere to work on this artificial intelligence system and after he builds this AI system he has one of his best employees come out to the resort to give it the Turing test and to test whether it's actually displays real intelligence or not and I thought the movie was great it's super intense but there's one point in the movie where on one of his monitors this Python code pops up and it's only for a split second but if you pause it then and write down that Python code then this is all the Python code right here at the top it has this comment blue book code decryption and then the rest of it just kind of looks like gibberish it doesn't seem like it would actually do anything but if we run this code then the output is this ISBN number and an ISBN number is a code for books so if we copy this and then go over to Amazon and search for this ISBN number then it's this top result here the embodiment and the inner life cognition and consciousness in the space of possible minds so I thought that was a pretty cool Easter Egg that they threw there into that movie like I said I thought the movie was really good if you guys give it a watch then be on the lookout for that Python code it just pops up really fast but but yeah check it out and you can type in the Python code for yourself and and run it and see what you get but yeah that's it for this video thank you guys for watching you
