hey everybody how's it going in this video we're going to be creating a table for our database if you remember in the last video we created our sample database and we set up our SQL environment so that we could begin writing commands but currently our database is completely empty so let's go ahead and fix that the first thing that we need to do is populate our database with a table so a table is made up of columns and rows and the columns make up the fields and the structure of our table and those will hold our rows which represent individual records within our table and this will make more sense in a minute so when we first create our table we will have to also tell the table what columns we want our table to hold and when the table is first created it won't have any rows because rows will only be created once we begin adding records to our table so that may sound a little confusing but let's go ahead and create our first table and I think it'll make more sense so we're going to create a create table and we're going to call this table people now you're going to open up some parentheses here and I'm going to go ahead and make this on a new line here and now within these parentheses now we're going to create our fields which will be our columns so within this table people I want the fields ID and name and these fields have to be separated by a comma now these fields also need a datatype the table has to know what kind of data each field is going to hold now remember we are using Postgres as our SQL platform so we can view the different data types if we get online here and you type in Postgres data types then you can look at the Postgres documentation to view these data types so it's the very top link here and I've already got that opened up over here now this is a page that has the documentation of the data types now if we scroll down here then we can see the different data types that we can use whenever we create a table now I know that this looks like a lot of options and it is but don't get overwhelmed because a lot of the time you'll only be using a select few of these for your table so in our example we had the fields ID and name so we want ID to be an integer so if I look at the table here we can see that we have integer right here it says that it's assigned for byte integer and it also has a name integer and we can also use int or int for now the value that I'm going to use is integer so if I open up my GUI program again here then I'm going to put this before the comma right after the field name I'm going to type in integer and that is the data type that we want ID to be now for the name field I want that to be a variable length character string and if we look back at the documentation here we can see that we have this character varying and then the alias is far char and the description is exactly what we want a variable length character string now you can see that it also has this in here and what that in is is that is a number that we can put in that will be a maximum on the number of characters that can be added to this field so for example if I was to put 255 therefore that in then we wouldn't be able to add any records with a name longer than 255 characters so let's go ahead and go back to our program here and I'm going to use a varchar' here and in the parentheses I'm going to go ahead and put in that 255 so this looks good we haven't run this yet but if we look back we are creating a table called people and within this table we're going to have two fields which will be our columns one is going to be ID which is an integer one is going to be name which is a variable length character string of 255 characters max so let's go ahead and run this query and now if I go over here and refresh my tables then we can see that we now have this people table 1 if I click on the people table then you can see that we have a column here ID and a column here name so what if something was wrong with this table and we just wanted to delete the table all together now we in this GUI Pro we could just come over here and rightclick and delete table but we're learning about sequel commands so we're going to do this in SQL now this is super easy to do that's just going to be the drop table command so we're just going to delete this and we're going to type in drop table and type in the name of our table which was people and let's put in a semicolon there I think I forgot this in my colon before you kind of want to get in the habit of adding those in so now if I run this query and then refresh my tables over here then you can see that the people table was deleted it got dropped so you want to be careful with the drop command because it will delete your table and all of the information that that table holds so now let's go ahead and recreate that table that we just deleted just to kind of get a firm grasp on this so you may want to type these from scratch a few times just to kind of get the feel for the syntax if you just copy and paste these commands over and over then you might not actually learn the commands as well as you think you are and you won't know how to do it from scratch when you don't have your clipboard clipboard available to you at a later time so let's go ahead and rewrite this create table again from scratch so create table people we'll put in our parentheses here and that was an ID with an integer and we'll put in our comma there and a name with far char 255 let's go ahead and run that query refresh our tables over here and we can see that we now have our people table back with ID and name so there we go now we have our table back and in this video we created our first table we looked at columns and the different data types that we can use in the next video we're going to actually start putting records into our table and then we'll be able to kind of see how all of this comes together to create a simple database with all of the parts working together so
