hey there how's it going everybody in this video I just want to give a quick update on the channel I quick look back on 2017 and also what to look forward to in 2018 so first of all I've been out of town a lot lately so I've been a bit behind on putting out videos but I just wanted to let you know that I will be releasing a video this week and have a few others that I'm currently working on so I've just been busy traveling home for the holidays and also I went out of town for the Amazon Web Services conference a couple of weeks ago and the conference was a great experience and there are a lot of videos that I'd like to make in the future on Amazon Web Services and how to get started using those but I was also so busy that I wasn't able to put as much time as usual into getting videos released but I will be putting out a video this week on Python contacts managers so be on the lookout for that okay so I also wanted to give a quick update on the channel and what to expect moving forward so 2017 was a big year for this channel the most popular videos released this year was probably the nine part introduction of Python series where we covered you know Python data structures and functions and working with the standard library but there was also a lot of other popular videos released you know covering regular expressions and unit testing essential skills for programmers web scraping and several other topics and I just really want to thank everyone who has subscribed to the channel and also those who support the channel so at the beginning of 2017 I think I had less than 20 thousand subscribers and it looks like we're going to go into 2018 with probably around eighty thousand but just recently we hit 75,000 subscribers just the other day so I really want to thank you all for that and also on patreon I think I started the year having around 20 patreon supporters at the beginning of 2017 and will probably end that with around 75 supporters going into 2018 so right now we have 74 and I just really want to thank all of you all currently there are 55 who wanted to be you know who were ok with the public contributors page on my website but I just really appreciate all the support that you guys give the channel and you really make it possible because I really wouldn't be able to put as much time into these tutorials without you all and it really helps with creating these videos moving forward so speaking of moving forward I also wanted to mention a little of what to expect in 2018 so I really want to put out a lot more content in 2018 than any year before so there have been a lot of larger tutorials that many of you have been wanting for a long time and I really want to be sure to cover as many of those topics as possible so I'm finally going to get around to getting out of series on creating a fullfeatured web application I spelled that wrong don't worry about that so I'll do one of those in flask and Django and possibly some other frameworks as well and I'd also like to do a series on data science where I cover you know things like numpy and pandas and Syfy and also I'd like to cover some DevOps and assist admin videos covering you know getting started with Amazon Web Services and how to use docker and ansible and all kinds of different technologies and there are some other big announcements that I have in mind for early 2018 but I'm not quite to the point where I'm ready to talk about those just yet but early next year I'll make a couple of videos covering some more future plans that I have in mind so that is going to do it for this video again I apologize that the holidays and some traveling have slowed down my releases a little bit but watch out for a new video coming out this week on contacts managers and I should be back on schedule with regular releases soon and as usual if you have any questions and feel free to ask in the comment section below and I'll do my best to answer those and also like I mentioned before if you enjoy these tutorials and would like to support them then there are several ways you can do that the easiest ways to simply like the video and give it a thumbs up and also it's a huge help to share all these videos with anyone who you think would find them useful and if you have the means you can contribute through patreon and there's a link to that page in the description section below be sure to subscribe for future videos thank you all for an excellent year and I'm really looking forward to 2018 and the topics that we'll be able to cover have a happy holidays and thank you all for watching you you
