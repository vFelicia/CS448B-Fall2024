hey how's it going everybody in this video we'll be going over some simple terminal commands to get you more comfortable within the command line in a previous video we learned how to navigate the file system without altering the file system in any way but in this walk there will actually be creating files and directories will be deleting files and directories and we'll also learn how to copy rename and move files and directories so I'll have my finder window opened on this side of the screen so we can visually get an idea of what's going on so let's go ahead and get started so first of all over here in the terminal if I run PWD which stands for working directory we can see that I'm currently within my user folder projects demos terminal and basics now this is also the folder that I'm in over here within finder so that we can see what's going on now let's go ahead and create a directory within this folder called testdir and the way that we're going to do that is MK dir make there and we'll call this tests birth now you can see when I ran that that this folder popped up over here within finder but within the terminal we can run LS and we run LS we can see that the directory is also showing up within terminal so now let's go ahead and navigate to that directory and to do that we do CD test dirt and navigate into there and within finder we'll just click into it so now let's create a file within this directory called test file so I'm going to do a touch to create this file and that'll be test underscore file dot txt and if I run that command you can see over here in the Finder window that that test file was created now I'm going to go ahead and open this file and add some text so that we have some unique file contents to work with and we can do this within the terminal with open test file dot txt and that will use the default program on your machine to open up this file and the contents that I'm going to add here are just I'm just going to call it test file txt the same name as the file slightly different so now let's go ahead and close that down so now let's learn how we can make a copy of this file within terminal to do this we use the CP command I'm going to do CP and then to autocomplete like that I'm just hitting tab after I type a little bit so I'm going to do CP test underscore file.txt and this new file I'm just going to call copy file dot txt so now if I hit enter there you can see within our Finder window that it created this copy file dat txt and if I open this up you can see that it does have the same file contents that we put in the first file so it is a copy so now let's look at how we can rename a file now renaming a file might seem a little weird because moving a file and renaming a file is actually the same process so if you want to rename a file then you use the MV command which is the move command and since we're just going to leave it in the same place we're going to move the file to the same directory but give it a different name so I'm going to rename test underscore file.txt to original file dot txt so I'm going to do move test file dot txt and I'm going to call this a ridge underscore file dot txt and you can see when I ran that command we no longer have test file that txt we have this a ridge file that txt now what if we want to move a file without renaming the file we can do that by specifying a new location and no file name so to show an example of that I'm actually going to create a new directory here in this current folder called subtor 1 so if we remember its make their sub door 1 and you can see that here within finder now I'm going to move this original file dot txt to sub door 1 but I'm not going to rename the file so I can do that just by doing a move a ridge file dot txt and now I'm going to type in the new location and I want to put this within subdora so if I run that you can see that the file vanished over here within finder and within terminal I'm going to CD and the sub door 1 into an LS and you can see that the file is there if I navigate there in finder you can see that is there also so now I'm going to move it and rename it at the same time so to do this I can just do a move a ridge file dot txt and I'm going move this up one directory into our tester folder which is visible over here in finder and now that I've specified the location I'm going to go ahead and give it its name back to file dot txt so if I run that command now we can see that this sub door one is empty and that the original file got moved back to our tester and renamed at the same time and if I open this up you can see that the contents are still the same okay now let's look at how we can delete some files to delete a file we can use the RM command so let's remove this copied file here with RM copy oh and actually I'm in subtor one so let me CD backup a directory so now I'm going to do RM copy file dot txt and you can see over here within testdir that the copy file that txt was deleted now be careful when you're running remove files from within the terminal because deleting a file within the terminal isn't the same as deleting a file on your filesystem it doesn't ask you are you sure and they don't get sent to your trashcan for easy recovery so when they're gone they're gone so be careful when using the remove files within the terminal now we've been looking at how we can copy and rename and delete files now let's look at how we can do some of these same things to directories working with directories can be slightly different than working with files so let's go ahead and move up a directory here so that we can see our entire testdir directory so if I do an LS you can see that we have our tester here and I'm going to go ahead and do that over here within finder also so now let's try to copy our testdir to a directory called copy der in the same way that we did a file so I'm going to do a CP testdir and then I want to name the copy copy Durr so let's run that so the first problem that we run into here is that it says that copy dirt doesn't exist so let's go ahead and make a directory called copy dirt and run that now you can see that this directory exists but it's empty so now let's try that command again copy the tester into copy dirt now you can see that we're getting this message that tester is a directory not copied so in order to get around this we need to use the our option now remember if you never need to find out more about the options that are available to you then you can do that by viewing the man page by typing man and then the command that you want to look at so we did man CP and then you can look at all the options that you have available to you there and you can just hit Q to get out of that so we're going to be using the R option so really quick let's just take a look at what that means exactly so you can see here this R it says if the source file designates a directory CP copies the directory and the entire subtree connected at that point so that's what we want so let's go ahead and do that so if I go back to my CP command I'm going to come back here to the beginning and do a R so now if I run this and make this half the size of the screen so now we didn't get any errors that time so if we do open this up you can see that it has all of the same contents that test our head so now we successfully copied our entire directory so now let's try to rename the directory remember when we rename the files we use the MV command so let's try to do that to our tester so I'm going to do a move tester and let's rename this to a ridge Durr so if I run that then you can see that we didn't get any errors and that over here within finder it did rename this to a register so the MV command renamed the directory without needing any additional options and also like files I can move the directory without renaming the directory so if I wanted to do an MV of a ridge there I'm going to move this entire directory within the copy directory so if I run that then we can see that it took it out of this folder here and if I navigate to copy durr it still has the other contents that tester used to have but we also have the original directory here and it contains all these contents as well so now lastly just like we did with files let's go ahead and move the directory back up to the parent directory and rename it at the same time and we'll rename it back to tester so in order to do this I'm going to CD into the copied er here and that's where we are within finder over here and I'm going to do a move and I'm going to move the original directory up one directory to the parent and then at the same time I'm going to rename it to tester so if I run that you can see that the original directory is no longer within the copy directory and if I navigate back to the parent folder then it was renamed to tester and you can see that all the subfolders and files are still there so one more thing just like with the files let's go ahead and try to delete the word directory so if we remember when we deleted the file we use the RM command so let's do an RM and let's try to delete this copy directory so and actually I need to navigate up to my parent folder where these two directories are and now let's do an RM and let's remove the copy directory now you can see here that I got this error and just like copying a file it says that copied ur is a directory so also just like copying we can add the R option and it will remove the directory so I'm going to do an RM r on copy dirt so now if I run that within finder over here you can see that the copy directory was deleted so one last quick note here sometimes you might run into some files that give you issues when you try to delete them if you want you can force a deletion of the directory by using the F option now again you do want to be careful with this now to do this you do RM and then are because we are deleting a directory and we're going to do this F to force the deletion and then I'm just going to delete the tester that we have here and if I run that you can see that it deleted the directory so once again be careful with that command because it's very powerful and it will permanently delete your files the only way to recover them would be from some kind of backup and that's not something that anyone likely wants to do you're also just a reminder there's a ton of other options that you can use with these commands should be sure to check man pages if you ever get stuck and just kind of play around with all the cool things that you can do but hopefully you guys found this overview of these commands useful keep practicing with these commands it's really one of those things that you wonder how you lived without it once you begin using these on a regular basis but if you all do have any questions feel free to ask in the comment section below be sure to subscribe for future videos and thank you all for watching
