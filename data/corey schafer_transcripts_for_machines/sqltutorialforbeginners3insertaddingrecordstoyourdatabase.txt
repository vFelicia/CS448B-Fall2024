hey everybody how's it going in this video we will start populating our table with some records so if you remember in the last video we created our table called people and we populated this table with two fields ID which is an integer and name which is a variable character string of a max of 255 characters so now let's actually start adding records to this table now there are a few different ways in which we can write our insert statement to achieve this so first let's just do an insert into and then the name of our table which is people so insert into people and let's just do values of 1 and Cori so 1 will be our ID Cori will be the name let's go ahead and run that query and if we look at the data table and refresh this then you can see that we have an ID of 1 and a name of Cori that was added to our table now this is a row in our table this is a record so now let's go ahead and add a another record to our database so let's do an ID of 2 and a name of Travis so let's go ahead and run that query and look at our data and refresh it and you can see that now we have an ID of 2 and the name of Travis now we can also specify the exact fields that we want to populate within our table so for example here right now I'm running insert into people values and then the name the ID and then the name but we can specify the exact fields right here after the table name so if I type in ID and name then these are going to match up with the values that I pass in so 2 is going to get passed in as the ID Travis will get passed in as the name so right here if I was to change this to 3 and then Dave and then ran this query if we look back at our data and refresh that then now we have another record in our database with the information that we inserted but you can also switch these around to specify whatever order that you want so that's one advantage to doing it this way so instead of ID and name I could do name and ID and then in my values I have to change these accordingly so I can do a name of Bronx and I can give that an ID of 4 so if I run that then we go back to our data even though these were out of order since we specified the order here if we refresh that we can see that we have an idea for and the name of Bronx now the values that we insert into our table they have to match the values that we specified for our fields so for example if I was accidentally to mix these up and I was to do a name of quarry and an ID of 5 but then the order was ID and then name so what's going to happen here is it's going to try to insert quarry as the ID and 5 as the name now if I run this you can see that I get a syntax error so you can see that this error says invalid input syntax for integer and we were passing quarry as an integer and it didn't like that and it even gives us the statement here and if it was a longer statement it would be useful to know which line that was on so now it's not like that populated our database with bad data because since it was an error it never even got added you can see that there's no ID of 5 here or name of 5 nothing got added in incorrectly so if I switch these back around and I do the ID of 5 and then the name as quarry that's what we did before so I can run that query you can see this time we got no air and if i refresh our table data then you can see that we added in the correct record so there we go I know that this was a shorter video but we've added data to our table and now we have several records to work with and our next video will begin looking at how we can retrieve values from our table using the Select command and also we'll use the where command which allows us to specify exactly which records we want to retrieve so that about does it for this video if you have any questions just ask in the comment section below be sure to subscribe so that you're notified when these future SQL videos are released and thank you all for watching
