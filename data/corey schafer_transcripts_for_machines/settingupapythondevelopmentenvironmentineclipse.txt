hey everybody how's it going in this video we will learn how to set up a Python development environment using the Eclipse IDE and the pydev plugin so if you've watched my videos before then you've probably noticed that I do a lot of my Python programming within a text editor called sublime text now the reason that I use that for my tutorials is because it's nice and clean and there's not a lot of other bells and whistles that are getting in the way and it really allows us just to focus on the code but an IDE which is an integrated development environment it does have some advantages over a text editor so for example if you want to debug your code then eclipse will allow us to set breakpoints and and step through line by line in our code and print out variables and step in the functions and a lot of different things that we just can't do in a text editor so in this video we will get Eclipse installed and also get a Python environment set up to where we can begin writing Python code so right now I'm over here on the Eclipse website and so the first thing that we're going to do is install this Eclipse installer so let's go ahead I'm on a Mac so I'm going to download this Eclipse installer it's going to take us to another download page here and I'm just going to click this download link here and it will take you to a donation page eclipse is opensource software so if you have the money to make a donation then I'm sure they'd appreciate it but if if not then we can just wait for our download to finish ok so that a download has finished so I'm going to go ahead and open up this Eclipse installer okay now first thing when you open up the Eclipse installer right off the bat you might see this over here that says that it needs an update so let's go ahead and run that update and it'll restart the installer for us okay so now we've restarted that installer now this is the point where some people get confused because there's not a specific version of Eclipse just for python right out of the box so you can see here that we have an eclipse ide for java developers for c and c++ PHP and all these different things now a lot of people will just download the java developers version and then add in all the python stuff after that on their own and it does come with some it already does come with a git client and the marketplace and things like that but really I don't like that extra overhead so kind of what I like to start with whenever I'm doing Python development is just to start with the Eclipse platform and you can see here that it says that this package contains the absolute minimal IDE suitable only as a base for installing other tools and that's what we want to do are going to install a Python environment on top of this so I'm going to go ahead and choose that platform and you can choose the Java version if you'd like and everything will still work just fine but now that we're in here I'm just going to accept these defaults it's going to install the Java JVM and then the installation folder you can choose where it installs Eclipse so I'm just going to choose install here and let this finish now once this finishes here I'm just going to go ahead and launch this and when it first pops up it may ask us a couple of things so for example it's going to asked us ask us to select a workspace and this is where it will put all of our projects and files so I'm just going to accept this default location here and so now we have a new version of Eclipse here so I'm just going to maximize this and then I'm going to click on go to workbench here ok so now that we're within here now we want to install PI dev pipe f is a plugin which will allow us to do python development so for example right now right out of the box if we go up here and go file new project you can see here that all we have is this general project here there's nothing that is python specific so to fix this let's go to help and we want to install new software now the new software that I'm going to install is one called marketplace now this is something that allows us to install things in the future a little bit more easy now Market Place comes installed already if you were to choose the Java version but from where we started from just the bare minimum Eclipse platform we need to install the marketplace so I'm just going to choose all available sites here for what to work with and then I'm just going to search for market and it should find that for us so it's here under general purpose tools marketplace client so I'm going to go ahead and choose that and then walk through this installation process and go ahead and accept these terms and choose all the defaults so now it is installed and it says that we need to restart eclipse that's probably going to happen a few times while we're doing this so let's go ahead and do that so now that we have restarted Eclipse we should have the marketplace installed so now if we click on help instead of going to install new software let's go ahead and click on this Eclipse marketplace now the marketplace is just a more visually appealing area to download new software rather than the where we were before where we had to manually look through all those different sites for the marketplace and things like that so what we want to install here in the marketplace is pydev now we can either search for it but it's also very popular so we just if we just click on this popular time then it should just be the third or fourth one down from the bottom and you can see you can also install whatever else you want here you can see that there are some color themes some ways to integrate Eclipse with subversion so if we scroll down here you can see that pydev I think it was like the fifth one down so we can just click install here and it's going to tell us all the things that we need to install with this so let's go ahead and click confirm and let this run the room now I'm going to go ahead and accept these terms and click finish and now this may take a while to install here I'm going to go ahead and trust these certificates and click OK now once that is finished installing them we'll have to restart eclipse again so let's go ahead and do that okay so now we have pydev installed so we should be able to go to file new project like we did before but now instead of just general here we have this pydev option and if we go down and into here we can see that we can make a Django project we can make a Google Google App Engine project or just a PI dev project and this is just for your regular Python projects so I'm going to choose PI dev project and click Next and then I'm just going to call this project name demo underscore project and then we can to use all of the defaults here you can see that's going to put it into our workspace here we can choose our Python version that we want to use I'm just going to leave it at 2.7 now it may choose an interpreter for you but it may say that you don't have an interpreter selected so what I'm just going to do here is click on please configure an interpreter and just let it auto configure its just going to choose my default Python interpreter so that may have already selected the default interpreter for you but if it didn't then you can just click on that link that I clicked on and click on the quick auto configuration and it should set the default interpreter for you so for everything else I'm just going to leave the defaults and click finish and now this is going to pop up and say that this kind of project is an associated with the pydev perspective you want to open this perspective now I'm just going to click on remember my decision and hit yes and I usually recommend that you open up the PI deaf perspective because it lays out all your windows here and the way that they believe is best for python development and if you don't entirely like the layout then you can always customize it yourself later on so now we have this demo project here and I'm just going to right click on this demo project and go to new and now you can see that we have a file but instead of file I'm going to choose PI dev module so now this is another case where an IDE kind of comes in handy over a text editor because this can set up a lot of stuff for us so for example if I want to put my module directly inside of a package so I can just do a test underscore as the name of the package I don't want to put it in and you can see here it's going to say note package not found which mean it doesn't exist yet and that they will create it for us so now the name of my module I'm just going to call this test module and I don't think you need to put the dot pie yeah so it says that the name may not contain any dots so it'll put the dot pie extension on for you so just call it a test module or whatever you want to call it and click finish and then it's going to cop pop up with some preferences here and I'm just going to leave these defaults and click OK and now it's going to ask us if we want to use a template so if we use the empty template then it's just going to put the timestamp at the top of the file but if you're going to write a class or something like that then you can choose the class template and it'll fill in a lot of boilerplate code for you like it'll put the dunder init function in for you and and things like that but I'm just going to choose the empty template and you can make your own templates also if you have a specific way that you like to make new files but for now I'm just going to hit empty and you may see this pop up to read documentation for pi dev I'm just going to click on show later ok so now I have my newly created test module and you can see that it did add in the date and the author here and you can also see over here on the right within our project that when we put this within a package it went ahead and made the init file for us over here and everything like that so it's nice that it went ahead and made all the files that we need in order to make this a package so now we should be ready to write some code here so if I just do a print HelloWorld now I am in Python 27 still so the print function is going to look like this and now I can just go ahead and run this code and when I run it it's going to ask me if I want to run it as a Python or as a unit test so I'm just going to choose Python click OK and now you can see that it ran our code here and that's showing the output within the console so really if you wanted just a basic Python setup and Eclipse then should be done you can go ahead and do whatever it is that you need to do but I'm also going to show you some of my more favorite preferences here so for example the first thing I'm going to do is change the font and make it a little bit bigger and I also like dark themes just because whenever I'm looking at a computer sometimes these really bright themes kind of hurt my eyes after some time so for here for the theme instead of Mac I'm just going to choose dark and for the color and font theme I'm also going to choose well I'll just leave that default and click apply and see how this looks okay so that looks good there with the dark theme and now I'm also going to expand the appearance here and go on colors and fonts and for the basic font which will control this font in here I'm going to scroll down and the text font is what you want to change to change the font within your source code editor here so I'm going to edit this and I'm going to use source code Pro and I'm going to set this just so you guys can see better I'm going to choose size 18 for now and apply that and click OK and actually I'm going to open up these preferences one more time and show you guys it looks like this font got set to something else here maybe I don't have source code Pro installed on this machine or my clicks are just kind of moving around here funny okay so yeah that's what I wanted there now there are also some pydev specific preferences that we can run so if we look over here and the right we have this pydev option so if I expand this then within editor I'm going to open this up now within here you can specifically choose how you want certain things to look as far as your decorators and numbers and things like that but really the one thing that I like to select whenever I first install Clips is to go in here to code style and then code formatter and I like to automatically set my code to be Auto pepp 8 compliant so I'm going to click this use auto Pep eight for code formatting now if there are any I don't know you don't if you don't know what auto Pepe it is it's not a big deal but it's just a way to kind of check your code for certain income to make your code more consistent and also if there's anything that you want to ignore with Auto Pepe you can look to all these up online then you can put in your ignores here so if there are certain errors that you want to skip over then you can do this ignore within here and set it up that way I'm also going to click here on save actions and it says that the apply save actions I'm going to do an auto format editor contents before saving now what this means is that I don't have to what it's just going to auto format all of the code right before I save the code so now I'm going to go down here to apply and click OK and then click OK here so now for example if I go to write a function and do a test function here and then just pass this and then do a test to function and then go to save it now let me put in the pass code here as well and now you can see whenever I save that it automatically put in the spacing between these two different functions so I like that Auto pepe selection if you don't like it then you can turn it off but it's nice whenever you're working on large projects for everybody to have all their spacing and everything like that consistent so that about does it for the basic Python setup within Eclipse that I wanted to show you guys now if you do want to install more software then I would give the marketplace a look you know eclipse has a lot of different plugins so they have plugins for git if you want to use some git functionality within Eclipse they have other color themes that you can choose from this default color theme here it isn't the one that I usually use I usually install some other ones that look a little bit better so if you want to look at any of those then you can just do a search here if I just type in color then some stuff will come back and also I would give the popular tab a look because if you click on the popular tab then these are some of the more popular color themes and also like I said some of the plugins that people frequently use like this so this one is for subversion and they also have this moonrise dark theme that is likely a little bit different than this dark theme here so I would definitely give all those a look all those over and try to set this up to the way that you like it but that about does it for this video if you have any questions about this stuff just ask in the comment section below be sure to subscribe for future videos I know maybe I'll make some videos on how to debug projects within Eclipse and things like that so hopefully you all found this video useful and thank you for watching
