hey guys how's it going this is gonna be a quick little video here I just want to show you a situation that I run into from time to time and how I solve it so the situation I'm talking about is if I have a lot of tabs open but then I need to shut down my computer or shut down Chrome or something like that but I don't want to lose those tabs I want to come back to them at a later time so how do you do this quickly and easily without going in bookmarking each individual one or without copying and pasting all of the URLs into a text file or something like that well the way that I do this is fairly simple so if you have a bunch of tabs open then you can right click on the tab and then there's an option here that says bookmark all tabs so if you click that it's going to open up a bookmark all tabs option here and then usually within my bookmarks bookmarks bar I'll create a new folder and the folder I usually call it something like saved or something like that and then within the saved folder now this is just personal preference but I don't do this very often so I usually just date it so for this example I'll do Oh 730 15 now that's just a personal preference you know if you're reading about something specific then you can name it whatever you want to name it so let's click OK there and now if we open up a new tab then you can see that we have this saved folder here in our bookmarks bar so if we click on this saved folder and then you can see that it saved all of our bookmarks or all of our tabs that we currently had open so now let's say for example that I closed down Chrome and now I have a new Chrome window here so in order to open up all those tabs it's just as easy as looking at our dated folder here or whatever you named all of your tabs rightclick it and there is an option here that says open all bookmarks so if we click on open all bookmarks then if you have enough tabs if it's only a few it's not going to ask you this but if you've had a lot of tabs open I'll say are you sure that you want to open up all these because it might take some time to load so just click yes and there you can see that all of the tabs that we had open are now loading up and we can close down our new tab there and then you can see that we have all of our tabs available that we saved so now once you're done reading through those tabs or whatever if you don't want to clutter up your saved folder here that you created then it's just as easy as rightclicking on that folder that has all the tabs that you saved then you can just click delete and it gets rid of it so that's the quickest and easiest solution that I've found to whenever I'm in this situation and I want to save a lot of times you know I used to go through and bookmark tabs individually but this is a lot faster and it's a lot easier and also you can get rid of them just as easy so I hope you guys found that video useful be sure to subscribe for future videos and thank you guys for watching
