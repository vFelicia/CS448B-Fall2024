hey everybody how's it going in this video we will look at how to update and delete records from our database using the update and delete commands now I'm putting both of these into one video because they are very similar concepts now before we update or delete any records in our database it's usually a good idea to first run a select statement on the values so that we know that we're acting upon the correct data but first let's look at an extremely simple example with this test table here so that we can see what happens if we update or delete values without using a where clause to filter which records we want so if we look at this test table here it's a very simple table that just has eight records in it and all of the location values here are null so let's update this to where all of the location values are set to the string unknown so to do this we can run the update statement so I'm going to go over here to write my query and I'm going to say update test table and then I'm going to do set location equal to and then the string unknown so if I run this query and then I go back over here to the table and reload the data you can see that now all of the location values in the entire table have been set to unknown now the reason that updated all of those values is because in our query we didn't have a where clause so it's just going to do all of the records so now let's say that we want to delete all of the records from this table so we can do this with the delete statement and if we want to delete everything then it's just as easy as doing a delete from test table so if I run this and then I go back over here to the content and reload the data you can see that our table is completely empty it deleted all of the records that we had and again the reason that it did that is because we don't have a where clause here so it's just going to go and delete everything now more commonly you're going to use these commands to update or delete specific records and not all of them at once so this is where I said that it's beneficial to first run a select statement for the records that you want to update or delete and that way you know what you're acting upon is the correct data so let's look at all of the records from this people table by running the query select star from people and if we run this then we have all of our records back so now let's say that this record right here number 14 that we want to set Jane Smith's occupation from student to programmer so first let's write a select statement to grab that record so that we're sure that we're getting the correct one so once the like statement that could get that record we could do a select from people where firstname is equal to Jane and lastname is equal to Smith now if I run this query and you can see that we only get back to one result which is good because that's the one that we want to update now we could have also done a where the ID is equal to 14 if we were worried about there being multiple Jane Smith's but this is good for our purpose here so now let's replace this select with our update and we're going to leave the where clause exactly like it is so let's do an update people and then we will do set occupation equal to programmer and let me capitalize this so now if I run this query and now it doesn't look like anything happened but now if I do the select star from people again and run this query you can see now if we look at Jane Smith down here at number 14 now her occupation is set to programmer so now let me show you why it's important to run the select statement before updating or deleting records so in this example let's say that we want to delete all of the people with the occupation scientists who are younger than the age of 58 so let's let write a select statement that we think will do this but we accidentally make a small mistake so let's do select star from people where occupation is equal to scientist and let me fix this here and now when we do our age less than 58 let's accidentally type in or age less than 58 so notice when I run this query we get back a lot of results here and it's a lot more than we planned and it's because we meant to say that we wanted scientists and their age is less than 58 not or so now if we run it then we can see that we only get one result now if I had run the delete statement with that bad where clause without first running the check using the Select statement then I would have accidentally deleted all of those records that were returned with that first select statement that I didn't mean to delete so now that we have selected this record and we know that we're acting upon the correct data then now if I want to delete this record then I can just do a delete from people and I could leave the where clause exactly as it is so now if I run this query and then do a select store from people and run this if we look through all of this data then we'll notice that the Neil Tyson record that we had in there has been deleted and it no longer exists in our table so that about does it for this video hopefully that cleared up some different ways in which you can use the update and delete statements if
