hey what's going on everybody this is going to be a super quick video um i just made a video on how to use a get diff tool and the git diff tool that i used was called diff merge and i wanted to show you a problem that i ran into whenever i was recording that video if i do a if i open up diff merge by using the get diff tool that i showed in the previous video by default you can see when this opens up this text is extremely small i think this is like a 10 point font or something like that and on the latest version of mac if you go in here and you try to change this font so i'll go over here to window font and choose a different font and you can see here that the program crashes and it won't allow you to do it no matter no matter how many times you do this it's going to crash so whenever i was looking for a solution to that problem i couldn't really find too many good answers online and i finally found one but it was kind of hidden in some forums so i figured i'd make a quick video about it so to change this problem you can't change the font using the window you have to use this kind of work around here but if you use this command here and open up the diff merge preferences so just paste this into your terminal and hit enter and you'll see that'll pop open in text edit and then these lines right here will change the font you need this file in brackets and then font equals and then this 22 is the font size i'm not sure what the 76 is but i saw it there in the in the work around so i just included it in so i just put this here under license and paste that in and save it and exit out of that and so now if i go back up here and run the gif get diff tool again now you can see that the font is a 22 size font so you guys can change that font size to whatever is it you want so yep hopefully this quick tip was useful
