hey everybody how's it going in this video I wanted to do a broad overview of one line learning and the different resources that are available so there's such a vast amount of websites and places you can go online to learn about programming web development design software engineering basically anything that you'd want to learn about so these days I think it's entirely possible to be selftaught in your profession using these resources now when I say selftaught I'm not advocating against any type of higher education like I think there's a huge benefit to college and inperson classes but even if you are enrolled in something like that these online courses are still fantastic ways to complement that education and to reinforce what you've learned so with that said let's go ahead and get started so this first web site here is my personal favorite it's called Udacity and the courses you can see here are put together by Google Facebook and several other large companies you can see here that they have a variety of topics they have frontend web developer data analysis intro to programming full stack development things like that if we take a look at the full list of courses you can see that there are just tons of different topics and courses to choose from now one thing I really like about the courses that they offer here is that they also offer like fundamental courses so down here you can see like software debugging design of computer programs intro to algorithms software testing those are the kind of courses that are going to apply to just about any job within computer science no matter what language you decide to program in those fundamentals are going to be really important to learn but even after after you learn those fundamentals they still do offer things that are specific so for example here like objectoriented JavaScript data analysis with our so Udacity I think they offer a great variety of topics and the content is really well put together also one thing that I do with wish you'd asset II would change is like for example if I click on the intro to computer science class here I don't know about you all but my eyes are kind of immediately drawn to this big orange button here that says start free trial and this is only on some courses but then you see this big price tag here of a dollar or a $1.99 a month one hundred ninetynine a month and I've told several people about this website and they see this and immediately click off of it and say that they didn't that they thought it was free well actually it is free this price tag here is just for like personal oneonone coaching and to get a certificate after you complete the class each of these courses have this blue button here which mine says something different because I'm logged in I think yours may say like free course materials or something like that but you still get all the videos and you still got all the exercises you just don't get that oneonone help from these coaches so if I was to click on this blue button here then it takes you to all of the videos and all of the lessons and these are all still free I really like the format of the courses that they've done here so they have videos and each lesson is kind of laid out here and they explain everything in the videos and then at certain points they will quiz you on the material so if I click on quiz here sometimes these are like multiple choice but a lot of the times it's an actual place online where you can code live code and see the results and I think that's great you know to do the videos and then to code I really think that you learn this stuff better whenever you write it out yourself rather than just watching it so I think the format that they have set up here is great so that's a quick look at Udacity it's my personal favorite but there's tons of other resources as well so here I just opened up MIT OpenCourseWare now this is something that a lot of colleges and universities are doing now where they will videotape their lectures and save their lecture notes and exams and quizzes and things like that and they'll put them all online for free so for example you can see here that in their electrical engineering and computer science courses they have all of these classes where they've added some type of material from that class that you can look at so all of these courses that they have listed here may not have videos but a lot of them do have lecture videos and they also have quizzes and exams and solutions and things like that so for example if I look over here this is introduction to algorithms and if we look down at the course features you can see that we have video lectures assignments and solutions exams and solutions and even transcripts of the courses now things like this are great this is what I meant by complementing your education because after I graduated from college algorithms is one of those things that I didn't really retain much of the information so being able to go back and take an intro to algorithms course from an MIT class was super helpful now a lot of these universities when they videotape these lectures they will put them up on YouTube and personally I like YouTube's interface a little bit better than these other websites so a lot of the time what I'll do is I'll just go to youtube and search for that University and then click on their YouTube channel then I'll go to their playlists and within their playlist I'll find the course that I'm looking for so for example here you can see that we have the same intro introduction algorithms course and you can scroll down through here and see the length of every video and also all the videos that they have available through that course now like I said MIT isn't the only University doing this so search for your favorite University and if they have a YouTube channel then most likely they'll have playlists associated if courses that they offer so for example if you search for Stanford and look at their playlists then they have a course up here called promote programming methodology where it's kind of an introduction to computer science and software engineering principles so I think it's great that a lot of these universities are starting to offer a lot of this material for free now since we're already on the topic of YouTube I wanted to mention that it's also a great resource itself pretty much any problem that you run into or anything that you want to learn about you can just search it and most likely there's going to be a video or several videos made on that topic so real quick let me go over a few of the channel so that I'm subscribed to I'm not gonna go into each individual one very into too much detail but if you were looking for a couple of channels to check out and maybe to subscribe to then these are a few the ones that I check regularly so Google developers they put up some good tips and tricks and also a few videos from some conferences the new Boston he has tons of subscribers and he does a wide variety of topics on just about any language you can think of he's probably done a series on that now this guy Dara ba√±os I hope I said that right he has a lot of great content that covers a lot of different topics I especially like the videos that he does on software design patterns and the fundamental topics that I was talking about earlier okay computer file now this isn't like your typical type of tutorials but I think it's a neat channel they do a lot of like history of computing and they also go in depth of into some topics like down here you can see that they have SQL injection and and they really show in depth how these things work do I have the computer guy is another good channel this guy does a lot of tutorials mainly on things like system administration and networking and things like that learn code Academy I think this is a newer channel I've just recently subscribed to it but it's really great it's more centered around web development and this guy does a great job of making short videos but fitting a lot of information into short videos and really getting the point across level up that's kind of the same thing centered around web development and also does a good job of fitting a lot of information into short videos dev tips this guy has a lot of good content and most of it is centered around web design so a lot of CSS and things like that okay speaking of CSS the channel Reese real CSS tricks is run by the guy who does CSS tricks comm Chris queer he doesn't put up videos a lot but when he does put up a video it's usually of a realworld problem that he ran into and how he solved that so I think those videos are extremely useful so just a few more here PHP academy' does some great PHP videos this guy syntax does some good Python programming videos so these next to new circle training and next a video both of them put up good videos and a lot of them are taking taken from talks from conferences and things like that now speaking of conferences if you have a favorite conference then search for that conference on YouTube and they might have a channel so for example I'm on the Python channel here for 2015 now some of these conferences you may not be able to afford to go and travel there in person but a lot of them put their videos online for free and they're super useful and have a lot of great content so that's a few of my personal suggestions for YouTube let's go ahead and take a look at some other websites so Khan Academy is more famous like for their math tutorials and science and economics and things like that but they do have a computing section so they have this computer science section where they go over like algorithms and the fundamentals I mentioned are there and then they have a computer programming section where I believe that the majority of their material is web development based so like JavaScript and HTML and CSS and things like that now they don't have a ton of computing material on Khan Academy right now but the stuff that they do have is really good but the most benefit that I get from Khan Academy is their math section so if you're in computer science and you're looking to level up on your math skills I think Khan Academy is one of the best resources out there and they have a ton of great classes they have pre calculus differential calculus linear algebra things that are going to come in handy big time for your career down the road now another website I wanted to take a look at is one called one called note school I oh now I really like the approach that note school takes to their tutorials so it's not like other websites most of their tutorials are based in the terminal so for example if I pull up my terminal here and if for example I wanted to take the node tutorial on their website then I could copy in this NPM and all command now you have to have no js' installed but that's outside the scope of this video I just want to kind of show you how the website works but you install this package onto your computer through via the terminal and then when that package finishes installing in your terminal then you can just run that package within your terminal and then the entire tutorial runs within your terminal which is really neat now the thing I really like about this format of tutorial is that not only are you learning the topic that they're trying to teach you but you're also learning a lot of terminal commands which is more important than a lot of beginners think you know some people think that it's this esoteric skill that you don't really need to know but if you learn it really well early on then you'll realize kind of how crucial it really is and so these walkthroughs do a great job of teaching the topic and making you somewhat proficient with the terminal so that was note school IO and I think they have a pretty unique approach to how they do their tutorials now moving onto the next website this one is called code Academy calm and on here you can see that they mainly focus on web development skills and it's very interactive also so whenever you go and take a tutorial most of the time you will be typing your code directly into the browser and then it will check against that code to make sure that it's right I think that's the best way to learn is by doing and they also provide these API tutorials now I think these API tutorials are super useful because I don't think enough emphasis is shown in the other websites I've shown on api's if you don't know what an API is basically it is a way to use information that other people provide so for example if we were to take this tour tutorial on the Twitter API maybe you want to make an application that maps out tweets onto a map of a certain topic and when those tweets were tweeted out and things like that that's something that you can do with an API be Twitter provides that information through their API publicly and like I said in the other resources I showed I don't think they that they have enough emphasis on programming with API so I think it's really neat that code Academy here does these different tutorials and how that you can work and how you can work with these different API is that a lot of companies provide now the what next website I'd like to show you is one called EDX now I've never personally used EDX but it's something that I here brought up a lot in podcast and and online forums if you look at their courses for computer science I have these filtered out here it looks like they have a lot of great material here they have intro to computer science through Harvard some introduction to Linux now most of these courses are free but you'll see here some of these that are tagged with this professional education here those are not free so for example if I clicked on this class here you can see that it does have a price tag of nearly five hundred dollars now that's a good segue into what I wanted to talk about next every resource that I've shown you so far has been a free resource but if the information that you're looking for is only offered for through a paid class or something online and you shouldn't always shy away from paying for your education so for example this class here at $500 it seems like a lot of money and it is a lot of money but if you compare that cost to taking a class you know through University or through an inperson workshop then it's really not that bad and if the topic that you're paying for in this example Linux system administration if it's something that is your professional job then really that money that you spend on the class is just a drop in the bucket compared to the return that you're going to get on that education throughout your career so with that said there's a couple more websites here that I want to show you that aren't entirely free but the content that they put together I think is it would be worth it for some people so this website here is called code school and you can see that their topics mainly revolve around web development you have JavaScript Ruby on Rails SQL and some angular classes now some of these they do offer for free you can see that this try SQL course here is listed as a free course Google Maps Google Drive things like that are some free courses that they offer this first JavaScript class is free but say for example you want to take a class on angularjs and you can't find any great tutorials elsewhere then paying for that class may be an option that you want to consider and if you look at the pricing for websites like this it's really not that bad when you can pair it to paying for classes in person so for example on code school you can get classes for twenty nine dollars a month or two hundred and ninety dollars per year so the next website I want to show you here which is also mainly revolving around web development and web design is tree house so tree house I think is a great website you can see here that they offer HTML Javascript Python Java classes and things like that I think one criticism that treehouse used to get when they first started is that the content was mainly focused for people who were beginners I have an account through them and lately I've seen some more advanced classes coming out and there's some good content there and so if we go over and look at their pricing then it's kind of a similar situation it's really not that bad in the grand scheme of things so their basic plan is $25 a month and the pro plan is 50 bucks a month so the next website I want to show you is another paid tutorial website but there's a loophole to paying for this website that I'm not sure that a lot of people are aware of the website I'm talking about is lynda.com now Linda is a very popular website you can see down here that they have all kinds of topics of foundations of programming fundamentals JavaScript essential training PHP Java get and github raspberry pi C++ so their topics pretty much span the entire spectrum now that loophole that I was talking about in the is that Linda does a great job of partnering with universities and with businesses so I've had login IDs for three different universities one of those universities was where I got my undergraduate one is where I worked after my undergraduate and one another one was for my graduate degree and all three of these universities had partnerships with lynda.com which meant that they paid for a premium membership and allowed you to log in through their portal into Lynda and view any tutorial that you wanted to view now another thing that I personally noticed was that not one of those three universities did a good job of advertising that partnership that they had so I had to go out and seek out that information on my own so if you're in school or you work for a company that pays for tutorials then be sure to check with them to see if they are partnering with somebody like this because you could potentially be missing out on a premium membership to a lot of great content now the next website I want to show you isn't a website that you would normally associate with learning programming but if used correctly then you'd be surprised how much you can actually learn from following other people on Twitter so Twitter is a great place to follow professionals in your field so for example I've been doing a lot of Python programming lately so I can follow the person who created Python on Twitter and these people will post a lot of great articles and tutorials and things that are interesting to them which in turn will help me so for example I can also follow Raymond Hettinger who is a Python core developer and a the Beasley who authors a lot of Python books and also gives excellent tutorials on Python so try to follow people who are specific to your interests so for example if you're a web developer then maybe you want to follow addy Osmani and Paul Irish and people like that now another website that I think is definitely worth checking out now there's a few websites that have been popping up like this lately but my favorite is code pen so what code pen is is it's a way for people from within the community to come in and create demos and within those demos you can come in and see the final product down here at the bottom but then you can come in and look at the HTML and CSS and JavaScript that it took to make this final product so you can learn a lot by coming in and seeing what other people are doing and how they did it now the next place that you can go for some great information is on reddit now kind of similar to Twitter reddit isn't actually the resource itself but has links to a lot of great resources so this is where community members can come and post articles and people will vote them up based on their relevance and also give a lot of good insight in the comments to what ever articles or videos that they post so for example I'm in the programming subreddit here and you can see that there's over 600,000 readers of the subreddit so there's a lot of good information being posted and voted on and commented on here so it's great to check out and learn from other people so some of the ones I go to frequently are this one is the programming subreddit and we also have a web dev subreddit there's also a web design subreddit that you might want to check out and also you can get more specifically to if you'd like so for example like I set up and doing a lot of Python programming so maybe I'll subscribe to the Python subreddit and if you are more of a JavaScript programmer then you can go and look at that reddit page now the next website which is very similar to Reddit is hacker news now I don't personally use hacker news but I've heard a lot about it and felt like I should definitely include it in the list it's similar in the sense that people can post resources that they find interesting and videos and blog articles and things like that and the good ones will get voted up to the top and people can make comments as on that resource saying what their opinion is about it so we're just about finished up here but there's one more resource that I wanted to show you so most everything I've shown you so far has been more for visual learners like so you'll watch videos and then you'll do coding exercises afterwards and things like that but for people who prefer books there are a lot of free books out there with a lot of great content and many of those books are posted online so if you google free programming books this is one of the first links on Google that you'll get and this is on github and it's a repository by VHF and you can see here that it's a very popular repository has over 40,000 stars on github so whatever your topic you're looking for just scroll down through the index here and say that you're looking for JavaScript so within the JavaScript section they have a ton of books here listed that are available for free online so this one here learning JavaScript design patterns by addy osmani that I mentioned earlier if you click on that you can see that it goes to the book online here and you can read the entire thing online for free so if you're someone who prefers books over videos and coding exercises and things like that then definitely check out this github repository and you'll almost certainly find something that interests you so that about does it for this video you know there's such a large number of resources online to learn this stuff so I'm sorry if I left any out or forgot any important ones but if you do have any favorites then just post those in the comment section below so that other people can check those out so I really hope this video is useful for you guys don't forget to subscribe for future videos and thank you guys for watching
