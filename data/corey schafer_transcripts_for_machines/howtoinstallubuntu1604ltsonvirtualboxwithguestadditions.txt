hey there how's it going everybody in this video we're going to be learning how to install Ubuntu Linux on VirtualBox so I plan on doing more Linux tutorials in the near future so if you'd like to have a fresh install to follow along or if you just like to give Linux a try then this will be a good starting point so first we'll need to download and install VirtualBox so this is pretty straightforward so I'm not gonna go into too much detail here but if you just do a quick search on google for a VirtualBox and it should take you to the downloads page and that's here at virtualbox.org now from here you can choose your operating system and walk through the installation so for example I'm on a Mac so I would choose the OS X installation here so I already have VirtualBox installed so I'm not going to walk through that but it's just a very simple stepbystep process that you click through just like installing any other software so after you get that installed then if you open it up then it should look like this here so now that we have VirtualBox installed we're gonna need to download the ubuntu linux iso file so this will allow us to install the operating system so do a quick google search for a boon tube and it should take you to their home page that looks something like this so once you go here then you can go to the downloads page and the boon to desktop should be the first option here so if we go ahead and choose the desktop now you can see here it has a couple of recommended system requirements and we can just go over here and click download now this is free opensource software but it will take you to a donation page so you can donate if you'd like to but if you just like to download the ISO file then you can go to not now and take me to the download now your download here should start automatically now you can see that this is a pretty large file so here this is nearly one and a half gigs so I'm gonna go ahead and fast forward this video to when it's finished downloading ok so once we have that downloaded now let's go ahead and minimize Chrome here and pull up VirtualBox so now we're ready to create a new virtual machine so let's go ahead and choose new now for the name here let's just go ahead and call this a boon to Linux and for the type it's just going to be Linux it's Auto selected Ubuntu 64bit for the version so let's go ahead and keep that and continue now we're not going to go into too much detail with some of these setup options basically we're just saying how much memory and disk space we want allocated to our virtual machine and this depends on your computer but you're usually safe staying within the green sections here so from my memory I'm going to go ahead and choose 4096 megabytes which is 4 gigabytes and for the hard disk here I'm gonna leave that default and I'm gonna leave the VirtualBox disk image as the default there I'm going to leave that as dynamically allocated now for the hard disk size I'm actually going to bump this up to 25 Giga bytes here because that's what a boon to recommends on their downloads page now you can probably get by with allocating less but I'm going to go ahead and do the 25 so now we have that machine created but there's one more setting that I'm going to change before we install Ubuntu so if we select our machine and go to settings then we can see that we can change some of the values that we just set but there are also a lot of other customizations that we can make within here so one change I'm going to make is I'm going to go to the display tab and the video memory I'm going to go ahead and bump this up to the max and that's just going to improve our performance when we start the virtual machine so I'm going to go ahead and save that okay so now we're ready to install it boom so we install this using the ISO file that we downloaded earlier so to do this we can select our ISO by going down here to storage and clicking on this empty optical drive and then go to choose disk image and then we just navigate to where we downloaded that ISO file and select that ISO file and click open so now you can see that it has that ISO file attached so now we can just go ahead and start this virtual machine to install boon to okay so the actual installation here is a pretty straightforward process but we'll go ahead and walk through this really quickly so now we can just go here to install Ubuntu now this is optional here I usually choose to download the updates while it's installing so I don't don't have to do it later but for the sake of time here I'm just going to go ahead and leave this unchecked but it's up to you whether you want to download those updates now so now since this is a fresh installation we can just leave this erase disk and install and go to Install Now and then here we can just choose continue and then here you can just go ahead and choose your timezone and then continue and I'll just keep walking through here and now it'll bring up to where we can type in our name and choose a name for our computer if we would like and also a password and you need to remember this password because it's going to be what you use to log in whenever we restart the machine so let's go ahead and continue there and now this will install the operating system so I'm gonna go ahead and let this install and fastforward until that's complete okay so once that installation is complete then I'll come up here and ask you to restart so let's go ahead and do that now at this point you may run into this problem where it freezes and it gives you this warning and I have to be honest I didn't really understand this warning until I did a little research online but basically it's a harmless warning and we can just manually exit out of here to power down the machine so if we were to start that machine back up then it should just be good to go but if you do want to suppress that warning then I did see a few people say that you could come in here to settings and then you can go to system and acceleration and you can turn off this enabled nested paging but it's never really been an issue for me so I'm going to go ahead and leave that checked and just start back up my machine here okay so once we start our machine back up then everything should be installed and we should see a login screen here so now we can just sign in with the password that we specified during the installation okay so now having a boom to desktop ready to go but we're not quite done yet one thing you're gonna want to do is install guest additions software so guest additions software will fix the display settings that so that you can use the Linux in full screen and it'll also allow you to share directories between your host computer and the VM and it'll also allow you to share your clipboard which means you'll be able to copy and paste back and forth between your host computer and your VM so for example right now this is full screen and you can see that it doesn't take up much of the screen and that we have a lot of wasted space here on the sides and guest additions will fix this now there's a couple of different ways that you can do this but one of the simplest ways is just to come up here to devices and then you can choose insert guest additions CD image so this will pop up here and ask us if we want to run the software and we go ahead and do that and then we will have to put in our password and once that's done it will ask us to go ahead and restart so to restart we can just up here in the top right we can choose shutdown and when we choose shutdown we can go to restart ok so once that's done you can see that now we're in fullscreen and that the VM uses all the space that it didn't before so now we can just go ahead and log back in here ok so now you should be good to go so you have a working fresh installation of Ubuntu and if you ever want to follow along with any of my command line tutorials then you can just come up here and search for the terminal and run that and you can just come in here and start playing around with any of these commands ok so I think that's going to do it for this video for people who are new to using VirtualBox one of the first things that they usually want to know is how to do simple things like getting guest additions software installed if it isn't already and we've already done that on this machine they also would like to know how to copy and paste back and forth between the host and virtual machine and also how to share folders between the host and virtual machine and I'm putting together a quick video covering how to do all of that if it's something that you want to learn and I'll put a link to that video in the description section below once I get it released if you do have any questions and feel free to ask in the comment section below and I'll do my best to answer those if you enjoy these tutorials and would like to support them then there are several ways you can do that the easiest way is to simply like the video and give it a thumbs up also it's a huge help to share these videos with others who you think would find them useful and if you have the means you can contribute to the channel through patreon and there's a link to that page in the description section below be sure to subscribe for
