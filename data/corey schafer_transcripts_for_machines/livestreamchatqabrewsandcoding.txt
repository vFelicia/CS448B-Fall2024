okay did that do it all right can everybody hear me okay sometimes I have problems with this microphone where you can only hear from one side so hopefully you can hear from both sides of the alright okay so hopefully this is working I know that a lot of us are stuck in our homes right now with everything going on so I figured I just hop on and we could just chat and have just a laidback kind of session and maybe do some coding maybe answer some questions and things like that I've got a couple of drinks here so I can have some drinks while we're doing some coding might not be the best idea but so what would you guys like to see this is my first live stream that I've ever had so we could just have a Q&A and I could kind of read the chats back and forth for a little bit and answer some questions or I could just jump in and start start doing some code worst problems for you guys we can kind of do a mix of both comments are coming in pretty quick I didn't expect this well thank you guys yeah okay so it looks like some people want to do kind of like a QA at the beginning I've never I've did a Q&A video a long time ago and call somebody send a super chat thank you for all the Python videos thank you for that so I did a Q&A a long time ago I think that's back when I had gosh it was probably I don't know five thousand subscribers or something it's been several years since I've done one so yeah let's go ahead and answer a few common questions here okay somebody asked vs code versus sublime text so it really depends on what you want to do I'd say a lot of you have probably noticed that I use sublime text in my videos but the reason that I use sublime text in my videos is mainly because it is very minimalist and it just lets you see the code and the output without anything else getting in the way so I used that for the videos so that people can see when I'm doing without all this other stuff kind of taking up their peripheral vision but vs code is a very good editor I have a video on how to set that up as well so whenever I'm actually working on projects I will use vs code to actually work on projects because that way I get access to the debugger I get access to the I get access to being able to jump into the code and things like that and seeing all the packages that I have installed so I actually like the s code more for actually working on projects but I use sublime text for kind of daytoday coding just being able to do things like that I also have a couple of questions here thank you for pandas and Jango series oh you're welcome I'm glad that you like those that is from Alpha Umar Diallo thank you I also have some questions here that I have pulled up excuse me and these are some common questions that I have that I just wrote down before we started the livestream just in case I didn't get too many questions pulling in from the chat but I also answer some questions from the chat as well but a lot of people just ask me you know what is your fulltime job or what do you do fulltime so recently now I'm actually doing YouTube fulltime so before I was doing YouTube fulltime I've had several different jobs I worked in I grew up in West Virginia and I lived in West Virginia for most of my life and always worked at universities and I used to work at a GIS lab and that's where I actually started or I worked at gs GIS lab at West Virginia University and that's actually where I first started using Python before that I was a JavaScript developer fulltime and then I started using some Python scripts on the back end and that was probably that's around the time that I started making my videos like my very first videos which will probably I don't know about six years ago now or something like that that's when I was basically just getting into Python and I was making the videos just so that I could learn personally and and it kind of grew from there and then I moved out to Boulder Colorado and got a fulltime job in Python doing some flash web development on the back end and then we also did a lot of system and sorry this is my first this is my first live stream and I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually if you guys like this kind of video then I can do more of these but it's it's kind of I'm getting used to talking and seeing all the chats coming in at the same time so it's so if I get distracted then sorry about that but yeah so I was mainly working in flash development doing some backend web services and then moved on to do some more system administration stuff with using things like ansible and then after I did went YouTube for full time that's been over a year now I ended up moving back east and moving to Greenville South Carolina where I live now so and now I'm just doing Utah YouTube's fulltime here and putting courses together okay let me check some of these super chats I don't want to miss any of these just to make sure I answer any questions that are coming in here because it's so hard to thank you all for the Python and Django videos thank you thank you for helping me understand higherorder functions closures and decorators keep up the good work I'm glad you guys enjoy those so another question that I get a lot is people ask me a best way to prepare a portfolio so this is kind of a difficult question because it really depends it really depends on the the job that you're going for but I would always say that the best way to prepare a portfolio I've said this a couple of times when people ask me this question is I think the best thing you can do if you're preparing for a job or trying to get a job is to make a website with all of your let make a personal website and it depends on the time frame as well so if you were a time frame for getting a new job is within the next you know a few weeks or months and you don't have time to build a website from scratch then there's nothing wrong with those services that just allowed you allow you to easily build a website like you know what are some of the services like wicks or Squarespace or something like that or something like WordPress but whenever I say to build a website for your portfolio what I think the best thing to do in the long term is to go in with something like flask or like Django if you're a Python developer and take what you have learned there and it's going to expose you to so many other technologies as well so you're going to learn Python because you're going to be building a website in flask or you were going to be building the website and Django and from there you're going to have to host the website so you're going to get a hosting service either like Heroku or like the node or something like that and you're it's most likely going to be a Linux server of some kind so you're going to get some linux experience and some system and administration experience by logging into that and and doing you know setting up security and setting up things like that you're going to learn SQL and databases if your website has a database so making a website will really expose you to kind of all the different areas that you can learn and that will be and that's something that's going to be really valuable to employers whenever they see that on your portfolio so that's always my recommendation if somebody doesn't have anything and they're just looking for something eyecatching that they can show to somebody then I always recommend you know making a website ok let me grab another beer here so let's see I grabbed a bunch of local beer as well whenever I went in the town so alright I'll take this one this one is from Asheville North Carolina Gaelic ale so let's try this out ok let me catch up on some of these questions here these are scrolling back past pretty quickly ok well you do a series on machine learning yes I definitely want to do a machine learning series mmm it people ask me this a lot now the reason that I haven't put together a series on machine learning yet is just because it is such a large topic to cover so it is something that I'm a bit intimidated to kind of tackle because when I do a series like the Panda series that I'm working on now you know I've probably been working on that series now for about four months or something like that so and that's gonna be that's not going to be as large of a topic as machine learning so I just know that it's going to take a lot of time but I know that a lot of people are looking for that so I will start working on something like that here soon but it's definitely gonna be a big commitment so I've been a little slow to to do that but I know that a lot of people want that so I will start working on a machine learning course here in the near future okay let's see best websites to learn a w s gosh I would say that the best websites learn AWS I did a little bit of AWS training back whenever I was at my last job and I think that Amazon as far as I could tell Amazon had the best training for AWS on their own personal websites AWS is a hard thing to it's a hard thing to teach and it's a hard thing to make tutorials about because they are adding so much so often I think they're starting to kind of settle on some things that won't be changed too often now but whenever it first came out there were just you know hundreds of services being added on you it seemed like every year there were hundreds of new services so let's see here okay more about machine learning what is your age I'm 33 years old Oh is flasks better than Django okay so this is a question that I get a lot especially since I've done a video on for a series on flask and a series on Django in my opinion there isn't one that is better it just depends on what you are doing so flask is what they call a micro framework so flask is you I use flask a lot because I usually don't need all the bells and whistles of Django but Django comes builtin so flask will give you hardly any functionality out of the box and you can come up with a complete website with just one file that's all you need but Django is kind of intimidating for beginners because you download it and you're handed this entire directory with all these different things and it's kind of hard to you know to look at that and to know even where to start but it comes with so much out of the box you have an admin panel where you can create users and things like that so it depends on what you're doing if you need a very simple website like say that you're making a static website generator or something like that then I would definitely recommend flask for that but something like Django if you need an entire user system then it's probably better to go with Django since that comes with all that out of the box and people have put in so much work in making these secure user systems and that's just a bunch of code that you don't have to rewrite yourself so I would recommend a Django for those applications where you want all that outofthebox functionality and I would recommend flask for simpler websites quarry you coughed I'll probably be coughing a lot it probably wasn't a great idea to drink beers on stream whenever I have my mic right in my mouth and I'm sure I'm gonna be burping a lot as well so but I'll try to cover up the mic when I do that so I don't curse you guys out okay let's see what else we got here do you have a CS degree yes I went to I have a computer science degree I went to Marshall University in Huntington West Virginia and I got my computer science degree from there okay let's see and if we run out of questions here then I can go ahead and just start coding up some sample problems and you guys can kind of watch as I solve some problems here or try to solve some problems okay from our June hopefully I don't if I mess up these names I'm very sorry but it looks like our June said Cory thanks for being an inspiration I'm a developer now after starting to learn from you do more videos like react and flask and come to human you too me too okay yeah I've heard a lot about react I actually haven't used react personally but I haven't seen a big demand for that lately it's been a long time since I've got dope back into the JavaScript world back when I did JavaScript full time that was before es6 even came out so that was probably I think the biggest framework back then was probably ember j/s I don't even know if that's if people still use ember or not but that was before angular and all that stuff so it's been a while since I've done JavaScript coding but I do know that a lot of people have told me to do react in flask so that would be that would be a fun series to do will I do a web scraping series well I've put together several web scraping videos already so I have one on beautifulsoup and I have one on requests HTML and requests HTML was written by the same person who wrote the request library Kenneth rights and but those are kind of the basics of web scraping if you want me to do something more indepth like you know maybe crawling some dynamic sites that have JavaScript and things like that then yeah I could use a framework like scrapy or mechanize or something like that we could definitely put together a series like that and the same thing with async io that's kind of the same thing that I was talking about with the machine learning is I definitely want to do an async IO course but it's something that's kind of a large topic that a lot of people that I just know will take me a while to put together so I've been a little hesitant to do that because sometimes I get burned out on these courses like this pandas courses has taken a long time and I'm getting getting to the end of that course now and I'm getting you know a little burn out on pandas but after I put out these next couple of videos then I'm probably going to take a break from pandas for a while and then go back to someone off videos and and go from there and but yeah async is definitely on the list of stuff to cover okay any plans for a PI spark development series in the future well it's not in the immediate future I've had a lot of people that have asked about that so I definitely have it written down but probably I don't know if I'll get around to PI spark even in 2020 maybe in 2021 but in 2020 I'm kind of focusing I'm gonna finish this panda series and then a lot of people want me to do that machine learning course so I might dive straight in the machine learning now and then I might I want to do a machine learning basics before I get into Python machine learning kind of like whenever I did the matplotlib series and I didn't touch on and I didn't touch on pandas in that series until I had a series on pandas I kind of want to do a machine learning course Quan Python first that's kind of general any any programming language and then from there I can jump into Python machine learning but yeah PI spark a lot of people have wanted me to do videos on that as well so and I'm kind of taking my cues from you guys here like I said this is a laid back laid back livestream I don't have really any plans for what I'm doing here so if you want to see coding or if you're enjoying just listening to me answer questions then I can do that too so it's it's completely I'm kind of taking my cues from you all so I I didn't really have anything planned out I just know that a lot of people are home right now including myself with everything that's going on so so I just thought I would hop on and this would be kind of a fun thing to do so I see a lot of people that say I've seen several comments so far about switching over to you to me and I've actually I've used you to me for some courses but some of these comments I've used you to me for some courses but all of my stuff is available for free on YouTube and I plan to have it remain free on YouTube I've thought about switching over to you nummy just for people who want add free videos so maybe I could just put all of the same all the same videos that I have on you to YouTube and put those on you to me and and you know just offer those as an adfree version but everything that I have on youtube or all the content that I have is going to continue to be free into the future so anything that I'd ever do put on you to me it's it's also going to remain on YouTube so don't worry about any paywalls or anything like that what kind of beer are you drinking this is a local beer from Asheville North Carolina and this is called Gaelic ale I think it's kind of like an amber ale or something like that yeah please stick to YouTube is what somebody said yeah I'll definitely like I was saying I'm not going to get off the YouTube platform I'll always be on YouTube and all the videos will remain free if I ever go to another service it'll just be to upload the same free material on to that other service so so yeah don't worry about that can you get rich off of Python programming I saw that I saw that question and then I lost it so I don't know who asked that um well I mean it really depends on mmm it really depends on what you're doing I mean if I was to give somebody career advice I mean I think that computer programming is one of the best careers that you can get into right now I don't know about I've never looked at the standard salaries around the world I know that in the United States it varies a lot on where you're from so if you're in Silicon Valley in California then you're gonna be making you know you're gonna be making a lot more than you would in a state like West Virginia or South Carolina or something like that so it really depends on where you are but but the salaries are definitely good I would say in in California it's probably six figures for sure but they also have extremely high cost of living out there but you know depending on where you are it's it's usually on the higher pay grade compared to other jobs what games are you playing these days I don't I don't play a lot of games I used to play a lot more than I do now right now I'm playing League of Legends a lot so I play League of Legends but that's about the only game that I play any ideas on CI CD so for those who don't know CI CD is continuous integration continuous deployment so it is you know the most popular ones are like Travis CI and Jenkins I think it's great I don't it depends on what your project is it might be overkill for a certain project but if you know CIC D most jobs are using that these days too to handle their projects you can set up pipelines to where whenever you commit your code to a repository it'll automatically run your unit tests and deploy and things like that so it's definitely a good thing to know okay got another super chat here I vote for a little introduction to the machine learning course yet that's a lot of people definitely want that course I I think after the pan discourse I will get started on something like that excuse me try not to burp into the mic bad idea to drink beer on a live stream all favorite youtubers okay yeah that's a great question I actually planned on doing a video about this and I do I am gonna do a video about this in the in the near future but yeah my favorite youtubers I would say Centex Harrison Kinsley over syntaxes channel he's great tech with Tim is really good the good thing about syntax is he just seems like an extremely nice guy like he is just very whenever I was just getting started out I think I probably had you know five thousand subscribers or something like that and he shared a post of mine to all of his subscribers and said hey I found this really good object their morning course by this guy Corey Shaffer and I didn't ask him to do that I never talked to the guy before at all and it was just really cool that that he would do that and whenever I almost had no subscribers at all and I also found tech with Tim through his channel he he had him in his suggested channels on the on the right that he put together so who else who else do I like on YouTube there he doesn't do many videos anymore but if you go back and watch Derek manases old YouTube videos he doesn't do a lot on Python but if you're really trying to get an understanding of computer programming in general he did a he did like a design patterns course using Java and design patterns carry over from language to language so as long as you're learning in one language it'll kind of carry over oh yeah somebody said traversing media I love ya I love Roger see stuff he's he's got some good stuff I don't I've seen that he has a he's more JavaScript oriented from what I can tell but but yeah he has some great I think he has a flass course and some Python stuff as well let me see here let me uh these chats are that's that's one thing I'll have to keep in mind for next time is whenever I did this live stream I thought it would be a few people in here I didn't know that the chats would be going by so quickly so let's see mmhmm so Piyush Sharma asked can we expect a series on data structures and algorithms using Python and common algo problems I would definitely like to do that that that kind of brings up whenever you asked favorite youtubers that kind of brings up something else is before I do a data structures and algorithms course I would really like to get good with computer animation because I'm not very I've not really used a lot of computer animation libraries and I feel like the best way to learn certain algorithms is to see a good visual representation of these so if you've ever seen what is his name grant Sanderson he goes by the name of three blue one Brown and his videos are awesome he usually does he usually does mathematical related content but he has an opensource Python library that he uses to create those animations so I want to learn how to use that library and if I could do those types of animations then that would really help with those with that algorithms course being able to actually visualize those in a good way okay let me look through some of these other questions here oh yeah real Python somebody mentioned real Python as the YouTube channel the websites already is great that's run by Dan Bader actually met Dan at PyCon two years ago and yeah he's a really good guy I don't know if anybody's aware but PyCon 2020 was cancelled I was going to go to PyCon I actually backed out of Python before they cancelled out the just to just to be safe but then a couple of days later they they cancelled PyCon for goods hmm okay let me look through a couple of these here and I hope you guys don't mind I'm not doing hardly any programming yet you've been basically been looking at a blank screen here I should have planned this a little bit better let me see if if we want to work through some problems we definitely can I didn't realize how many questions I'd be getting so I've been kind of stuck on the questions here for a while but let me see if there's any more pouring in here and then maybe I'll just work through a couple of problems okay and very grateful and appreciative so Jim Shawn I'm very grateful and appreciative that your videos are free used to only make thirteen dollars an hour now I'm actually in the middle of class making six figures congratulations man that's awesome yeah I'm really happy to hear that okay so let's I've been answering gosh I don't even know how long this livestreams been going on for now about 30 minutes Oh a delq I know I know I know this I know this girl that's one of my friends they're great content looking good thank you a dhoka all right so let's let's go through and do a problem here and just kind of work through these problems and also I kind of want to show you guys how you don't have to whenever I do my videos I have everything scripted out so I kind of know exactly what I'm gonna say and when I'm gonna say it and things like that and people always say like Oh in your videos how do you never mess up and how do you always you know it's like you never make mistakes but I make mistakes all the time it's so and then I just edit those out so whenever I'm doing this live you're probably going to see a lot of these mistakes so we can see kind of what that looks like so let's go ahead and work through a couple of problems here on code Wars if nobody knows what code Wars is it's basically a website where you can just get some daily challenges so you hop in and let me go ahead and cover up my chat here because it's distracting me a little bit more than I thought it would and then I will hop in and see your all's chats after I get done solving a problem here so basically you get a daily problem here and a lot of people ask like okay well does this apply to real programming when I do these types of problems that's kind of a hard question I mean this isn't going to make you an excellent programmer by any means but it's one of those things that you can do just to kind of you know get the syntax down and to you know kind of keep fresh with with whatever language you're using they have problems and Python they have JavaScript C++ csharp all kinds of different things and it's usually you know some short solution so let's just work through one of these problems and see what this looks like and they also have these sample tests down here so that whenever you run the test it'll tell you if you got the problem right so you don't have to write your own unit tests or anything like that and I've not seen this problem yet so this is new to me and I'm not very good at these types of problem so you guys in the chat might have to help me out but let's see here so it says write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings ordered from shortest to longest so for example if we get this array where were your past an argument of this string here then the function would return so let me actually post this and sublime so that you guys can see a little bit better I know that the screen is a little small here but I'll just leave a comment here so let's say that we got this as an input this list here and we want to return or we want to write a function that will return that list sorted to where it looks like this so they are sorted by length of characters I think is what it's asking for all the strings in the array pasts your function will be different links so you not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length okay so from here the way that I would solve this we can write a custom sorting function and this is another thing that a lot of people ask a lot people always ask like how do you remember everything that you write down in your video well I really don't remember everything from the video like I said I have scripts for the videos so something like this you know this can be something where I need to search like okay list or Python Python list custom sort something like that and then I can go to the Python documentation or a stack overflow question here and I can see how to pass in a function to the sort argument so we can see here that we have a list dot sort and we can pass in the key so if you forgot that syntax then that's how you would do it so how I would do this problem here let's see if we get this right so I have just this custom Python script open here so I'm just gonna call this you know code Wars func and we're gonna take in a list as an argument and now what I want to do with this list is let me create another function up here let's say you know sort by Lynn and we will take in let's see how do we want to do this actually I don't even need to do this all I can do is I can just return L that's sorted and then I can pass in a lambda function and for those who don't know a lambda function is basically just a throwaway function I can just pass the lambda function here and I believe that I can just return by the length of X let's see if this works let me try this might not work you guys are also seeing the code after a few drinks here so hopefully this may not have been the best idea let me go ahead and copy that return statement here and let's test this see what we get L is not defined okay I have to pass this in they were taking it as a ray I'm gonna take it in as L has no object sorted sort see this is my problem here so people say I don't make mistakes and videos and now you can see how many mistakes I'm actually making so yeah we want to set the key equal to that lambda function so let me go back here okay so why wouldn't this work so now whenever I'm working in something like code wars if I don't get it to work then I'll just take the function here and I will paste it into my sublime text and now let's just try to run this function and pass in their sample input and see what we get so I'm going to do a sort by length pass in this list here I'm going to set this equal to L and then I'll print out the return the list okay so we get none okay so let's try this here let's do result is equal to sorted L key is equal to this okay so this might be what we need here so we have the sorted function so when we did L dot sort what it does is it actually sorts the list in place but it doesn't return a sorted list so when we actually capture this as a variable using sorted then this should work so now let me take this back to code Wars here and let's see if this works instead okay so it looks like all of our tests pass and if I hit enter here then the good thing about code Wars is that once you get the right result so we did get the right result here and all of our tests pass if I submit this then I haven't done code words in a long time but it should take me to a page here where I can see everybody else's top submissions and so then we can see all the other submissions that were uploaded and the most what the best practices were and whether they have a clever ranking and they have a best practice ranking so we can see here that this is pretty similar to what we did they returned a sorted array with the key oh ok so see they just set the key equal to Lin which so that was kind of bad practice what I did by passing in that lambda function we didn't even need the lambda function because there's already a length function so that's the kind of stuff that whenever you make those small mistakes and then you see how somebody else did it you can just say like I knew that of course but but yeah it can make you feel dumb sometimes when you see other people's submissions but that's kind of what you can do with code words there so now let me jump back to the chat and see how many people are making in front of me for for how bad I'm doing on these projects here what's the name of this practice exercise so this one was called sort array by string length and let's look at some of these other questions while I was while I was doing that okay so somebody else left a super chat here they said coding coding game.com word / start is another good site for working on problems while making it more fun I've never used that but if anybody wants to give that a shot they can mmhmm TJ Durkin said I'm stuck on database best practices after refactoring to app factories can we get an SQL light my sequel QuickStart I do have a video on sequel light using Python but I haven't done I haven't jumped into a pack thérèse yet so I think I started to touch on app factories at the end of the flash series but yeah if that's something that that people want to know more about them we can take a look at that as well let me see if I missed any other chats up here love the accent thank you it's pretty thick yeah like I said I grew up in West Virginia so I have a thick southern American accent why Python 3 4 I'm actually on my on my machine I'm probably using what am I using here on my machine I'm probably using 3 7 so yeah I'm using 3 7 on my machine I need to download 3 8 but it looks like on code worse they're still using 3 4 I'm not sure why they are maybe it just takes them a while to update that on the website or maybe they had 3 7 then I just didn't see it I could have done a dropdown or something do I use code words often I don't use code words often anymore I used to a lot it was a nice daily exercise for me to kind of try to solve problems on my own and to see I I think the best thing about code Wars is seeing other people's respond or other people's solutions to the problems that you just work through because just like just like I just showed I use that lambda where I returned the length of that list but I could have just set that key equal to the Ling to the length function and that would have been even easier and even better so yeah a lot of you got the answer to that question long before I did like I said I'm not great at those onthespot programming questions you guys should see me in a job interview it's you can ask me the easiest question and I will freeze up when I know people are watching you code better after beers I don't know about that I think I'm I think I might be proving that wrong here somebody said how about data science videos so I am starting on data science videos if you've watched my last videos I've been doing pandas videos and that's you use pretty heavily in the data science world and I'm going to continue with the data with the data science series I'll probably have three or four videos left on pandas and then I'm gonna take a little bit of a break and but that doesn't mean that the series is over there's still a lot to cover so in the next couple of videos on pandas is going to be our you know is going to be how to load in data from multiple different sources how to read in data from multiple different sources like SQL JSON files Excel files and things like that and then after that I'll probably take a break and start doing some oneoff videos for a while but then I'll come back to pandas to touch on some topics that people have requested you know like how to merge data frames and how to do pivot tables and pandas and things like that so where is my dog my dog is currently out of town so I went to Canada a few weeks ago it was actually right before gosh how long ago was that it was probably about a month ago it was right before all this virus stuff became you know became very serious and to where people shouldn't travel anymore so it was right before that so it was there were kind of talks of that virus spreading in certain areas but I don't think there were any confirmed cases the United States at that time so but it was yeah it was a strange experience so when I went to Canada I dropped my dog off at my parents place and and I haven't picked him up yet but I'll probably go and pick him up next week now that's something that a lot of people wanted me to make a video on as well whenever I went up to Canada I visited a I visited a quantum computing company and that was a deep wave deep wave is the name of that company and I don't know anything really about quantum computing it was a totally new experience for me so I was kind of going in completely blind not understanding how this stuff works at all and and I would like to say that I learned a lot while I was there and I think I did learn a lot while I was there but that stuff it still is absolutely mindblowing to me that they actually have these things working and running like I didn't I thought that this stuff was still hypothetical but deep wave if I do do a video on that experience some time then I'll show you their online platform they actually have a service where you can get on and you can run some of your code on their quantum computers and get results back I think there that service is called leap through deep wave and that was in Burnaby Canada it's it's close to Vancouver let's see here let's see if what other questions we have what kind of music do you like and play gosh can okay so yeah you can see my I got my guitar in my banjo in the background there but that's kind of a that's kind of a lie because I don't I'm not good at playing music I just I want to get good at playing music but I I listen to a lot of folk music so I like folk Americana style Avett Brothers Mumford & Sons Lumineers bands like that but I can't really play I'd like to I'd like to learn at some point in the future I saw your face for the first time okay well yeah the I did I've only had one video previously where I actually showed my face so yeah I don't do it a lot I don't like having the webcam on I feel like it's it can be distracting in most videos I just like I just like people being able to see the code so yeah this is this is kind of new new for me as well but in the last video I did I had short hair so I've grown out the hair since then and let's see somebody asked so we have one super chat I just want to thank you and a year and a half thanks to you and syntax I went from zero to senior D s I don't have enough words thank you well yeah man that's I'm glad to hear that that's yeah I love getting messages like that it's one of my favorite things to wake up to is to get messages from people that say that the videos have helped them out in some way so yeah I really appreciate that and thank you for the message I thought you were younger yeah I probably need to change my avatar that's probably my fault that avatar that I have for the YouTube channel is pretty old it's probably about ten years old so I hardly ever take pictures so how do you make your videos uh I've thought about I've thought about doing a video on this as well I use basically it kind of depends it depends on who you are some people were very good at just being able to get on and talk off the cuff and teach whatever they need to teach I'm better when I go off of the script so you guys can probably tell you know this being my first live stream I probably sound a lot different and trip over my words a lot more than I do in the videos and that's because in the videos I write scripts and that takes about probably 95% of the time to write the scripts so I'll write the scripts for the videos I have all my bullet points I know exactly what I want to say what coding examples I want to show and then after I get those scripts done I will use Camtasia to record the videos and then I edit in Camtasia and Camtasia as well have I been to India I've never been to India actually I actually didn't start traveling until recently after i whent full time in youtube I've really only been out of the United States a handful of times I would love to come over to India it would be a be a nice trip the places that I have travelled have been I've been to Mexico a few times I went to Dubai for a work trip whenever I was out in Boulder I worked for the laboratory for atmospheric and space physics and we had a Mars mission with Dubai and the Mars mission was being worked on by the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center and we went over to Dubai to visit that Space Centre and kind of train their team and get to work with their team that was a lot of fun and then recently after I quit my job in went fulltime I went down to Peru but yeah I'd like to do a lot more traveling I've not done a lot of traveling outside the United States do I have a wife I do not have a wife I'm not married how was Boulder Boulder is a great town I loved it out in Boulder it was a beautiful area it was just kind of high cost of living so it's a very expensive place to live and it just didn't make as much sense for me anymore now that I'm working from home to live in such a highcost area so I could get a lot more bang for my buck and where I'm living now and I was able to get a little bit more land for for the dog to run around and stuff out here so so I decided to move back okay so how long have we been going here we've been going for almost an hour now and so like I said I didn't have any plans for this for this live stream whenever I came on I just wanted to you know just to kind of see what you guys were up to and I know that a lot of us are home so I just wanted to get on and do something that might be a little bit fun and answer some questions and maybe do a coding problem but let me know what you guys think about this like I said this is my first live stream I'm completely new to this I probably tripped over over my words a lot and I spent most the time answering questions I planned on doing some more coding but I didn't realize how many people would actually be here writing questions so since we're coming up on an hour let's say yeah I'll probably stop the stream at about 330 and then just do an hourlong stream and if you guys liked this then we can do more of this and if you hated it then you can just say hey go back to 200 and go back to doing normal videos and only do those very you know only do the live streams very rarely so so it's up to you guys really I just want to uh it's it's something we can do more of if you like it it's it's but also the main focus is always going to be the tutorials the the normal tutorials that we do let me read a couple more questions here and then we'll so we'll spend about two more minutes answering questions I'm sorry I didn't do more coding problems but like I said there were just a lot more questions than what I initially thought I thought I'd be answering like two or three questions and then doing mostly coding but we have a lot of questions here so how did I choose Python well I didn't really choose Python I'm glad that I learned Python though it's my favorite language now that I'm using it so like I said I was a fulltime JavaScript developer and after I had to do a backend Python web service once and I learned Python to create that web service and after I wrote that I kind of fell in love with that I was like man this is so much easier than you know what I've been using before which was Java and JavaScript so after that I really enjoyed it wanted to learn more and I wanted to do it fulltime so I started looking for fulltime Python jobs okay all right let's say I'll answer one more question here and then then let's in the live stream for now and if you guys want to do more like this then we can in the future I'll probably be less nervous than now that I've got the first one out of the way let's see here so do I one question was do I plan to do more with the Django and flask series it's been a while since I have have put out videos on the Django and flash series now I definitely do want to do more with the Django and flash series but I think what I'm gonna do is instead of adding to those existing tutorials I think what I'm going to do is I'm just going to completely revamp the series and I'm gonna do flasks from scratch and I'm gonna do Django from scratch and I'll probably build a similar application but I'm just going to add more to the application so so some things that weren't added to the first Django series or the first flash series that I would like to add to the to the next series that I do on those are going to be things like twofactor authentication how to you know a lot of people want me to show how to add pictures and comments to different posts and things like that so we could take that application and we could make it a lot larger than it is now with a lot more functionality and teach you guys a lot more so that so that's something that we can definitely do with that series and I will do that for both flask and Django but those those should take a while to put together but not too because I'm probably just gonna use the same the same building blocks of the application that we built before and just add to that with those extra features and you guys can always send me the features that you'd like to see added we can do twofactor authentication images and comment section and things like that as well all right well I think that is going to be it I really appreciate you guys tuning in and asking all these questions I know that it's not hopefully that it hopefully you guys had a good time hanging out and asking questions and and just you know talking back and forth I hope you guys are all staying safe I know that it's crazy times going on right now it's it's wild it's wild what's happening and I hope you guys are all staying inside and doing the social distancing protocols that are in place everywhere so but yeah you guys stay safe stay out of crowded areas and I will talk to you guys soon if you guys enjoyed this again just let me know we can always do more all right thank you guys so much and I will see you soon
