hey everybody how's it going in this video we're gonna take a look at the new split screen feature that's shipped with the newest version of OS X it's called El Capitan now the split screen feature is something that I think has been missing from the Mac for a long time and I even did a video a while back on some thirdparty software that I use called hyper dock which has this boot screen functionality because I use split screen Windows so often and I need something that does them efficiently now I'm actually still more of a fan of hyper dock than I am of the native split screen functionality in El Capitan but even having the functionality available is a step in the right direction and hopefully they will continue to improve upon it in the future so with that said let's go ahead and get started and see how to use this new splitscreen functionality so first you need to be sure that you've updated your operating system to the newest version now once you've done this then so this maximize button here if you click this it'll maximize a window now in the latest version if you click and hold this then it'll give you an option to choose which side of the screen that you want this to be on split screen so if I choose the right side of the screen here now it's going to take my other programs and applications and I'm running and it's going to spread them out over here and what at once is for me to choose which one of these I want to share the other half of the screen so if I click on my terminal window here then now you can see that both of these programs are in split screen now what are the things that I like most about the native split screen functionality is how both windows are resized at the same time if you move this middle point so if I click and drag here then you can see that I never have to worry about one application overlapping the other because they're both resized at the same time so if I want one half of the screen to be more dominant than the other and see maybe I don't need as much room here in the terminal so I can make that a little smaller while I'm over here working and then for my text editor here this can be a little bit larger and and then I can come over here and do what I need to do so it's nice to have that functionality built in so that I can move the windows around to diff sizes without having to fuss too much with which one is overlapping another now another thing I really like about this is that they really provide as much real estate as possible so that you'll see that there's no border here in the middle it's just they do as little as possible so that you have as much screen to work with and it's just nice to have all this extra room now there's actually another way that we can do splitscreen instead of clicking and dragging on the maximize button what we can do instead is so if I go ahead and maximize one of these and then go back over here to my desktop now if you're familiar with the Mac's then you should be familiar with being able to flip between the desktop and full screen applications but if you don't know how to do this that all I'm doing is holding in the control key and using my arrows to switch back and forth between the desktop and these full screen applications so now that we're back here to our desktop another way to do this split screen is instead of clicking and holding on this maximize button here since we already have a full screen application open I can just drag this up here to the top and once this opens up you can see that I have a desktop here and I also have my full screen window here now if I drag this over the full screen you can kind of see that it puts this overlay down and it'll tell me where which side of the screen I can drop this on so if I drop this on the left side of the screen here and then click on this window now those are in split screen mode so that's pretty much it for the new splitscreen functionality I'm really glad that they finally have this available on the Mac it's been in Windows for a while but I do still like the thirdparty application hyper dock a little bit more and there's a couple of reasons for that so let me go ahead and get out of split screen mode here and then I'll open up a hyper dock and show you a couple of things that I like a little bit more and hopefully that maybe they'll get added to future versions of this split screen functionality so I'm just going to go ahead and open this up now I'm not going to go into too much detail because I have already done an entire video on hyper dock so I'm not going to go into too much detail but a couple of the things that I like more about it so for example I can just take this window and drag it to the right side of the screen here and it automatically takes up one half of the screen now if I wanted to do a quarter of the screen then I can take this terminal window and drag it to the top left and it takes up the top left corner and then for this one I could drag it down here and take up the bottom lefthand corner so you can see see instead of just to split halves of the screen you kind of have more options of what you can do with this and I actually use this a lot of the time whenever I'm doing whenever I have multiple terminal windows open here or terminal sessions running and I want to see what's going on in both and not having them overlap each other now another thing that I really like about hyper dock and this doesn't have anything to do with split screen functionality but I would like to see this at some point on the Mac is that hyperduck gives you these these previews to your open applications so for example if I have I have my Chrome browser open here with a couple of different windows and if I scroll over a chrome that I can see the different web sites that I'm on here and it also works with like music players so on Spotify if I scroll over Spotify here instead of opening up Spotify and playing what I need I can just scroll over here and get quick ask access to whatever is playing so I can go ahead and play a song and and do that that way so it's just nice to be able to preview those windows and be able to make those clicks and changes like that without fussing around with moving windows around and going in and out of full screen and things like that now like I said there are a lot of things that I like about the native splitscreen functionality I really like how the windows are tied together so for instance here whenever I resize one of these windows it doesn't resize the other I like how they both move together in the native functionality and also I like how it provides so much more screen real estate so all these borders are gone and you really have that room to work with so yeah like I said I think it's a step in the right direction hopefully we'll see some there's certain updates I would like to see with it but if all you're looking for is two different for two programs to be in split screen then it's a great option for you so definitely give it a try so that about does it for this video if you guys have any questions just ask in the comment section below be sure to
