my dear students in today's lesson we are going to learn about tokens of python here you can see 5 chocolates ok i give a statement 5 chocolates are here if you bifurcate into smaller units you can see a number which is at the starting 5 and then after the space you get a word called chocolates similarly r here also so this is a statement made up of small units called words are numbers similarly tokens are nothing but smallest individual unit in a program which interpreter can understand this is also called as a lexical unit most of the time when you give white space that ends the token python has following five types of tokens keywords identifiers we have already seen these two in my previous video still we will see little more elaborate then literals operators as well delhi meters we already know the keywords are the words which convey a special meaning to the language remember these words cannot be used for any other purpose in the program the current version which i install here that is 3.9.4 version it has 35 keywords if you go to previous version there may be little lesser than this for example 3.7 version has only 33 keywords whenever they upgrade the language there may be one or two keywords added now here are the keywords available in this version if you see this first three words and the rest of the words can you make any difference yes you are absolutely right first three keywords are starting with capital letters rest of all the keywords are with small letters in computer language we always call it as uppercase letters and lowercase letters you must know one thing that python language is case sensitive that means for python language you type a alphabet in capital letter and you type a same alphabet in small letter both are different for it you cannot indicate the same alphabet with opposite case so the keywords are also same you need to have the same spelling with the case whenever you are using it okay now let us know how do you know the keywords of your version you go to interactive mode and then just type this health open the bracket inside the double quote keywords and then close the bracket you will have one extra thing if you are having 3.9 version let me know whether you are checking it or not just message what difference you can make from this surely i will reply to it if you want to know a detail about a particular keyword instead of this keyword inside the bracket you can directly type the keyword which you want to know about let me show that to you open the python ideally now type help open the bracket and then open the double quote i say continue continue is a keyword here so now the details about the keyword continuous display to v i said there are 35 keywords right so all 35 keywords you can give like this but don't worry i am not telling you to do this and learn everything gradually when we start doing programming the keywords will automatically you will understand you don't need to do any exercise for this or you don't need to try to remember all the keyword in your memory now let us see identifiers i already told about this identifier it is nothing but a name given by the programmer to identify any part of the program but we cannot give any name as we like there are certain rules to follow let us check the rules first character of the identifier should be an alphabet the digits that is numbers can be the part of identifier except for the first character already it is been mentioned that it should start with alphabet right identifiers cannot be a keyword we have already seen that keywords cannot be used for any other purpose than mentioned in the programming language so keywords cannot be there as a name of the object or variable or class or whatever it is you cannot use any other character other than underscore only underscore is allowed to combine with alphabet or digit to create an identifier this underscore is always used to bifurcate two words in case you are giving two different words to name the part of a program then you can use this underscore so that easily you can read the name of the part we have already discussed that it is case sensitive so similarly even identifiers are case sensitive you need to remember whether you are given in upper case are lower case or mixed case whatever it is it should be as same as you have given previously if you want to reuse it can be arbitrarily long sequence of letters and digits hope you understood this very clearly now let us have a small exercise you just identify whether the identifiers given here are correct or wrong you can just take a paper and a pen or pencil you don't need to write whatever is appearing here just you put tick mark or wrong mark according whether it is valid or not valid one result to combine underscore follow while find hashtag val sum of series continue hyphen in q3 true lab underscore 3 stu percentage tot area of try hope you all marked whether it is true or false that is valid or not you just check now result is right two combine is wrong do you know the reason yes the 2 is in the beginning which is digit it is not allowed and then underscore follow yes this is right it can start with underscore but you need to understand one thing here any name starts with underscore will have a special mention for it that you will learn in future classes no need to worry but as of now it is correct while is correct see actually while in all small letter is a keyword here i have mentioned while with capital w so small w while and capital w while has the difference this can be a identifier but if you use small w instead of capital w here it cannot be a valid one and then find hashtag it is wrong because hashtag is the symbol which is not allowed sum of series is correct continue hyphen in is again wrong because of the symbol hyphen given it is not underscore so to know the difference i have given there and then q3 is correct you can combine the digit after the first letter so it is at last no problem and then true is wrong because true is a keyword capital t and ru e is a keyword which is not allowed to have a name of a part of program so lab underscores 3 is correct the 11th one is also wrong because of the percentage symbol and then area of try is also say right or wrong some of you might have indicated as right but it is wrong because the space is available after each word which is not allowed we have already seen the space ends the token right so if it is a token completely one name is a token so now if you give space then it will take as another word or token after it i will give you some tips to create identifiers if you are combining more than one word use underscore to separate the words always choose descriptive identifiers starting with lowercase in case you are using identifier for creating class then you can use uppercase it should not be too short or too long but should be the right size to be clear and concise avoid using identifiers that are homophones that means for example b two in digit and d see i mentioned here binary to decimal okay the other one b underscore t o underscore d both may be different but when you read are similar you can avoid giving these types of identifiers in case you are using abbreviations avoid using 0 and capital o similarly if you are giving l r uppercase of i or sometimes even 1 all these looks similar so please avoid this now i will take you to python window to experiment some identifiers i will dynamically initialize a variable for example x is equal to 10 i u it accepts now if i use like this if is equal to 20 see if is a keyword so it will not accept it will have only the special meaning in this language now i try to give with some symbol say total and then percentage symbol is equal to 85 it will not accept it is good idea if you are giving many words to combine with underscore as i said some underscore of underscore series u see it is very easy also to read sum of series is equal to this is a variable dynamically we are initializing with some value so just i am giving like this in case it is a class name or maybe a function name or maybe a object you can use it when wherever is required if i start this with any digit for example uh 12 grade i say see it is not accepting right so it should not uh start with a digit now i say grade 12 85 index students i don't want to take a very lengthy class so we will stop here we will continue this in the next part until then bye students thank you
