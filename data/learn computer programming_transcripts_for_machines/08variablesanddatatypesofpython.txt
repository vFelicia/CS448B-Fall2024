hello everyone in this video class we are going to learn about data types generally let us see what is data types in computer programming language data type indicates that which type of data a variable can hold for example if we need to have a details of a person or a thing and then we may have different types of data in this example name breed date of birth age height weight all these are there these are names of the variable the right side the values are available if you see the values are having the different types for example name has a string type which is collection of characters similarly the second one also and then date of birth is having the date age is having a whole number which is a integer we call it and the height which is 2.2 is having a decimal place we call it as float or double similarly even weight to store the value in a variable in most of the computer language the variable to be declared with the particular data type and then the data is been assigned to that variable then the type of data should be same as it is declared it will not accept any other type of data other than which is indicated see here in x is given x is the variable and then int says it is integer type this is the declaration then when we need to assign a value then we say the value using assignment operator that is x equal to 15 this can also be done like in x is equal to 15 directly declaring and also initializing it but if you see python language we don't need to declare a variable of which type it is directly we need to say the variable name and then we assign the value like this x is equal to 15. by seeing the value python automatically understands which type of data it is so it becomes very simple and dynamic and then one more thing in the other languages if x is already been declared with the integer type we cannot give any other type say x is equal to 25.5 is given that is not accepted even x equal to show it is given that is a string type it is not accepted but in python again the same variable you are using for some other data to store it overwrites there it is accepted it can be again changed as some other value for it so when we are handling the variables we should be very careful that variable we are not repeating for any other purpose we need to remember all these this is actually a drawback in python different languages allow different types of data let us see what are all the data types available in python language it has been categorized and the data type for that category is given and then also example has been indicated first we are having numeric type there are four types in it says integer that means the whole number without any decimal places for example fifteen thousand five hundred and sixty six uh seventy seven all these the second one is the boolean type here we are having two values one is true which indicates one and then false which indicates zero next one we are having float which says it can have the decimal places for example two point zero five thirty two point one eight two sixty five point zero zero zero two the fourth one we are having the complex number we already learned in the literals it will have the real part imaginary part with imaginary number which is j next we are having sequence in python one is string type which is collection of characters we know always these are indicated inside the single quote or double quote next one we are having the list it is a collection of data it can be with different basic data types the first example is similar data type but the second example you can see a b car d and the 10 is also included there different basic data types can be there in a single list next one we are having tuple this is always indicated in the ordinary parenthesis here also we can have different types of basic data i forgot to say list always given inside the square bracket now in sequence the last one we are having here is set this is always indicated inside the curly bracket all these we will see in different videos in future so just you remember these are the data types now next we are having mapping which is called as dictionary here each value is indicated with a key which is unique for example age is a key here and then colon is given 16 is the value the values can be same or repeatedly there it may have different data types like list tuple or string whatever it is but you need to remember that the key always should be unique known type here this is the keyword node which indicates it is empty still no value is been assigned to that particular variable you need to remember only known here is the keyword and all other data types are not keywords now i will demonstrate through python ideally and now i am having x is equal to 25 if i want to know the type of variable x i can give like this type type and then open the parenthesis give the variable's name that is x now it will show the variables data type class in this the data type of x about that class we will discuss later just you know about this similarly i am telling a is equal to 8.50 now let us take type of a so it is showing us float now same variable only i can change the value now with some other type c now i give here as keyboard now if i see type of a it is accepted and already changed to keyboard as a string now now let us have one complex type z is equal to 5 plus 6 j so type of z is complex now see here you can get the value of the real part and the value of imaginary part if you want to get like that we can give the variable name dot real and then we will be getting the value of real part to get the value of imaginary part we can give z dot imag so you can see 6.0 now i give m is equal to true type of m is boolean now let us see an example for list i say lst as a variable for list and then i give equal to we always use a square bracket to give the sequence of list i open it and then simply i say one two three and then close then if i give now type of lste it will be showing us it is a list we can also have different uh basic data type inside one single list i said let us try that also lst is equal to 0 comma 0.1 comma 2 comma 3 see float also i have given that 0.1 is the decimal number and then 2 and 3 are integer type now i give even a string type i say mouse so it is also accepted again i say type of lst is a list next we are going to see tuple t is equal to ordinary parenthesis we use 50 100 200 and then i give one 200.001 so type of t is tuple and the set we are giving for example s i u s is equal to curly bracket video one two three then i close with curly bracket now type of yes if i give it similarly we have dictionary i give d is equal to again we are using curly bracket but now we will be using a key for each value to identify that value i give key as age i said you can have different basic data types there even a value can be a list here so i give 15 16 18 and then as a list i close as a dictionary close otherwise we can also give one more value with this comma i simply give here height colon and then again i open square bracket 6.5 6.2 and then 5.8 then close the curly bracket to close the dictionary see now type of d if i give it will be showing us d i c if i want to say simply nothing is there in the variable but i need to declare a variable there c is equal to n o n e see if i give c nothing will come and then type of c known type it says if you want to print c says known that is nothing is there hope the concept is very clear now keep watching my channel to learn more thank you
