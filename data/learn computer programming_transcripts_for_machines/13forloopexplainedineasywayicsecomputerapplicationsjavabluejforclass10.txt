hello students welcome back today we are going to see iteration grow loops the iteration statements allow a set of instruction to be performed repeatedly until a certain condition is fulfilled iteration statements are also called loop are looping statements Java provides three kinds of loops the first one is far loop second one is wide loop the third is dowhile loop in this session we are going to see simple for loop let us create a program every loop has its elements that control its execution generally loop has four elements first Tony's initialization and control variable the next one is test condition the third one is body of the loop and you can say the fourth one is step value let us have a variable count ie in type so we are going to see here Farlow so Farlow as I told we have four things first one is initialization so initializing the variable which is given here as I is equal to we'll take as 1 so we have initialized this so then we will give a semicolon here and then the next one here is the test condition let us have I is lesser than or equal to 10 so do a check for the test condition every time so what is the next one is the step value here whether you are going to increment or decrement so already we learnt about increment and decrement in the previous tutorial let us have here just increment and because it is from 1 to 10 so I plus then we close this see only in the Far loop all three things come in a single state we initialize to you the test condition and then we'll give you the step value here to maybe plus plus I R I plus plus both the way tank so the next main thing we have here is body of the loop so any statement which we give inside this loop going to be the executor has many times as the loop condition get fulfilled let us just print the values system dot hope dot print line now here we are going to print just I let us print only I so what happens here in the beginning is equal to one it checks whether the condition get fulfilled or not so is lesser than ten that is true so what happens it is going to print I and then the next is it is going to increment by one so I becomes to test the condition and then still it is true so again it is going to print two then when it increments it becomes three again it checks it is true it is lesser than ten in the knee prints so like that it you will keep on doing until it is lesser than or equal to ten so when it is lesser than or equal to ten it is going to print and then when it increments it becomes eleven at last when it checks the condition eleven is false so ultimately it comes out of this loop so nothing else is there so automatically the program will start let us companies now this is going to print one to ten in next next lights so you can see that one to ten printer in case if you need that numbers in reverse so this I to be printed in Reverse what you are going to do it is very simple so you are going to initialize as 10 yeah so I becomes 10 and then I the condition is there so it is going to be greater than or equal to one isn't it so when it is going to print it will keep on subtracting one by one from ten until one so we can change here which is and then it is not I plus plus see here it is from bigger number to smaller number it is going to decrement so we can say here degree matter so let us try this so you can see 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ok let me tell one more thing in this see it will work until 1 but it will run also one more time which becomes zero and then test the condition which is false at last the number store in is 0 only but the test expression is false here so it stops so when it stops it will come out of the loop right so let us say Q the printing statement here let us bring the last value of I so the last value of i if we print what is going to be 0 so 0 also will get printed this is forever reference compile this so you can see 10 to 1 the condition is fulfilled then it comes out of the loop and then the previously stored value which is 0 also printed let's argue some tips for you see when you want to initialize whether you want to smaller to big or big to small first you have to decide it after deciding you really have the number as you need here we have given ten and then we are going in decrement so that is bigger to small so do not forget to give greater than or equal to when it is big too smart so until that greater than or equal to that number it is going to do otherwise even you can you greater than zero also you can do so which is one but zero is not going to be executed and then if it is greater to smaller then you must have here okay if it is small to big automatically you will have here small and then here bigger one then bigger one is lesser than or equal to lesser than you have to do then here it should be plus plus so here sometimes the matching doesn't work what happens it becomes unconditionally running or never ranks that means you won't get output so these three things you have to see very seriously then it is going to work perfectly well today you understood how to use for loop in a program let us have many sessions for farlow so that I can take you to the higher level of using far loop that is even nested for loop so let us meet again in next session until then thank you students keep watching my videos and subscribe
