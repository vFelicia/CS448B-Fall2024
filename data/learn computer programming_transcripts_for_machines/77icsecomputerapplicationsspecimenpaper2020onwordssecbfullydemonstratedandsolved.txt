welcome back students in this video we are going to continue solving Part B of computer applications 2020 onwards given by the ICAC both I will demonstrate the program directly on the bluej environment so that we can easily verify it question number four function transport company charges for the parcels of its customers as per the following specifications given below class name is given as air transport and then member variables are given here string name to store the name into W to store the weight of the parcel in kg and then int charge to store the charge of the parcel member functions given as usual it is wide except of to accept the name of the customer weight of the parcel from the user using scanner class it is being specified that you have to use scanner classwide calculator to calculate the charges as per the weight of the parcel as per the following criteria weight in kilogram charges per kilogram up to 10 kilogram it is 25 per kg next to kilogram that is from 11 to 30 it is going to be 20 / kz above 30 it is going to be 10 per kg so it is a slab program we have to follow the calculations when we do in the program a surcharge of 5 percentage is charged on the bill in the next wide printer to print the name of the customer weight of the parcel total bill inclusive a surcharge in a tabular form in the following format so it will be in the tabular format as given here you will be giving first name weight and bill amount and then it will be printer whatever has been calculated define a class with the abovementioned specification the main method create an object and Ino of the member methods let us first have the blueprint of this program in the mind see here member variables are given here three variables are given apart from that we may also require to find the surcharge and also the billed amount so we may need two more variables and then we will take a wide accept of there we will take the input so that is only these two are it required and then charged we are going to calculate then calculate off as per the slab we will calculate and then we will write one more method that is wide print off and then we will print it as needed here and then we will take object in the main method and invoke the member methods let us go to Bruges it I have copied the question here for my reference so let us start we need a input that is in scanner class so we will write import Java dot util dot scanner so class name is given there a transport here we need to declare the variables string name int W and also charge both are given if you want to calculate the surcharge that it will be in the decimal points so we can have double variable here W such as I will you yes charge then build amount also will be double so both I have declared here so we can have the comment here we can write yes charge to calculate surcharge and bill to calculate final amount now we need to create a method called accept so that is why wide accept of here we need to create a object for scanner class I will write scanner SC is equal to new scanner a system dot in now we will prompt the user to view the name system dot out dot print let it be print enter the name so we are going to assign now name is the variable given their name is equal to SC dot next line up we can also give line if it is a single name and then next we will prompt the user to you the weight of the parcel enter the weight of the parcel so here W is the variable W is equal to SC dot next int up so we are not going to take any more thing so we will just close this method now we have to create the other method called calculate off so wide calculate off so here if weight is lesser than or equal to ten so if W is lesser than or equal to ten charge is equal to so whatever the weight is there into twenty five right W into twenty five the next else if W is greater than 10 and W is lesser than or equal to 30 so next to 20 this is 11 to 30 so that will be 20 as given in the question now what we are going to do charge is equal to say listen if it is greater than 10 and less er than 30 already approaching 25 is the charge right so what we will do 10 into 25 plus the remaining so how do we find the remaining if it is lesser than 30 whatever the weight is there W minus 10 because then we have already calculated them so this 1 into I think it is 20 rupees so 20 let us confirm yes it is 20 rupees otherwise that is else charge is equal to first 10 will be calculated as calculated before 10 into 25 plus next 20 20 into 20 plus the remaining thing so remaining will be W minus 30 up to 30 we have already calculated into 10 rupees right yes here the calculation of charge is completed now we have to calculate the surcharge so what we can do yes charge is equal to charge and plus 5 percentage of charge so what we do charge into 0.05 we can directly write that is the best method 0.05 otherwise we can also write 5 a 100 point zero otherwise 5.0 divided by 100 so after this we will close this now we need to print now why to print off here we can also calculate the billed amount otherwise our class while printing we can do so we will calculate here itself build this equal to charge plus surcharge now we are going to print the name of the customer weight of the parcel and amount that is in tabular form it is cell right so we will just print as a heading system dot out dot print line enough I print in the double quotation as it is going to print whatever rig you name so after this news we may need one tab space so backslash T I am giving for one tab space and then I am going to print wait wait and then again backslash T and then a month otherwise billed amount now we are going to print the actual values so the variable for name is name plus we need space so I give in double quotation backslash T then plus W plus again space plus bill demott so that is the build variable after this we are going to create a main method where we will call above methods so we need to create a object for creating object we need the class name the class name is Air Transport and then we need an object name that can be any valid identifier just like you EA t is equal to new and then the constructor so that is a T or a in SPO RT R so now with using the object name Katie we are going to call the methods so that is first is except of next is calculator next is printer then we closed the method so here two more or extra one more this also yes let us compile there is no syntax error let us check enter the name I write Kea yes the name simply enter the weight of a parcel let us check below 10 let us use 7 so name is a a weight is 7kh and then build among tasks including such as let us calculate about 10 students you can verify this manually once so that you will be confident that it is right enter the name just I give BV and then wait I give this 20 so it is been calculated as four hundred and seventy two point five so let us go to the next program write a program to input name and percentage of 35 students of a class 10 into separate one dimensional arrays arrange students details according to their percentage in the descending order using selections or Twitter display name and percentage of first ten toppers of the class see listen here we have to create two single dimensional array one having the name of the student other having the percentage of the student so that is 35 is the size of the array then we are going to sort it according to the mark wise that is the highest in the top so that is descending order we must use the selection sort and then we will print only the toppers that is ten toppers we are going to print this so let us go to blue Z and write a program so I have copied the question here let us start we need to take the input further erase so we will import Java dot util dot scanner class yes SATA you now I create a main method here here we need a few variables so as we are going to start out descending order we are going to take the maximum value and the maximum index then for swapping we need a temporary variables there are two arrays that is one is with the string other one is with the integer type so we will take two swapping variables and then for loops we will take inj so first I create in maximum value as EMV and then maximum index as see my I take and then for percentage Pete my tech that is for swapping then I and J for loops so for swapping string array I need a string variable that is name so that is name and Tempah you now let us create a scanner class object now let us declare the erase string yen off so this is the single dimensional array is equal to new string of 35 is the RSS given so I will create 35 next we need a percentage that is average right so integer type into P array symbol is equal to new in half again 35 marks we are going to enter now let us give the prompt to before the loop itself so that it does not continue every time system dot out dot print line off enter the name and percentage of 35 students we can do so let us go to loop now far the index starts from zero we know I already have declared is equal to zero is so last index will be 34 so that is lesser than 35 we can also give lesser than length also so I am going to do just here neon dot length of sorry length length off means it becomes first string then I plus plus so first let me take the input for the name yarn is the variable we are given for array enough I so that is 0 1 2 3 up to 35 so that is from 0 to 34 it will take 35 elements yes see dot next up so that we are going to use a single name here PF so that is percentage so every time after entering the name we will take the percentage a see dot next int after that we need a loop for starting when I is equal to zero I is lesser then n dot length minus one now you will give so instead of lesser than 35 minus 1 that is 34 we give like this then I plus plus students we are just solving the paper here if we want to know full detail about this selection sort you can watch my previous video the maximum value we are going to assign s MV as the first one so that is P of I according to percentage only we are going to start so we are going to start PFI later it will sake rather which is the maximum one and then it will swap so the index of that mi is equal to I to check the greater one we are going to have a far loop here far J is equal to ie plus 1 so the first index and the next index it is going to take then J is lesser then young dot length then J plus plus here if p FJ is greater than maximum value then what we are going to do maximum value becomes PF j sorry small j and maximum index becomes J so it will be doing first pass and then when it completes this inner loop get completed the maximum value from that particular array might have been found then it is fact that is outside the inner loop the swapping here we will do P temp is equal to P of I then P of Y we are going to put it P of mi and then again PF mi is equal to PM students see here we have started the percentage but name also should be shattered isn't it we can sort as their marks are getting sorted the same way the names also will get sorted so that the particular student only will have that whatever the marks he has taken so we will swear as the marks are swept enough I and then enough ie is equal to enough mi enough mi is equal to nm now after this we will come out of this outer for loop and then we need to print the name and the average so let me give like this system dot out dot print line of a regular one tab space and then now to print all the names and percentage I need for loop right here far is equal to 0 it has been asked to only the 10 stoppers so we have done in the descending order from that we will take only 10 elements and print not all the elements so we need a far loop 0 to 9 otherwise 0 to lesser than 10 is lesser than 10 I plus plus now I just simply print the values sorry tiger print enough I so that is name it is going to print and then let me have one tab space here plus P of X so that is percentage it is going to print so let me give in the next line otherwise it will be in the same line so I mean I give a escape sequence e to make a next new line so we have closed method and the class let us compile this no syntax error students I don't want to show that 35 students name and the person days I entered so I will just change this to 5 or 6 so let me give 6 students so here Y n dot length is there so there won't be any problem from 6 I will print the top two students name and the percentage so lesser than 2 I you there is no syntax error let me run this program so enter the name of the pathways of 35 students we have not change the prompt it's okay let us enter 6 details simply a UA 56b 78 see 65 sorry see 65 become a name it's ok 65 be 98 e39 yes 99 let us check it is not being subtle that may be small mistake let us check that and I'll see here instead of Jay we have given I so we should be very careful compile this once again dry we'll run let us enter now a 78 b7 100 C 25 be 65 e30 to f100 sorry 100 so you can see that B is 100 then you have this hundred so it is being sorted and then the tapas list has displayed here or let us go to the next program question 6 design a class to overload a function sum of as follows so here this is the function name given it should be overloaded first one with which is returning integer type and then having two variables both are integer type what it does some of the even numbers in the range of a and B so the starting and the ending number is given as the input and then the sum of all the even numbers between the range is taken inclusive of a and B next one some ee n so it is returning double type then Yun also is double one with one double argument calculate and return the product of the following series so it is starting from one into 1.2 into 1.4 so Z by 0.2 it is increasing up to n the next one it is returning integer type it is taking the argument also as integer 1 with 1 integer argument calculate and return the sama only our digits of the number here for example it is a given sample four three nine six one is the number so that is forty three thousand nine hundred sixtyone here it is going to take all the odd digits so that is 3 is odd here it is taken nine is odd here it is taken and then one is are here taken then it has been added together and then it has been asked to write a main method to create an object and invoke the above method so we have to write the main method and call the methods so these are all with parameters when we call we should mention the parameters reverberated so let us go to blue Z so here is the question which has been copied ok let us start we don't need to take any input here the class name I give s power load itself does not mentioned in the question so I need to have in some off with two integers that is given in the question into a comma in to be here I will have some variable because it to be returned hint I will take someone is equal to zero in the beginning default value then far so int is equal to the range is given here to be so ei will be there then I is lesser than or equal to be I plus plus so from this range what it will do it will take only the even numbers and take the sum so for that we have to check the condition if I more two equal to equal to zero means it is going to be even number so then what I am going to do some one equal to some one plus I we can you and then it is going to return so we come out of this far low and then we will write return someone so that's all the first method get over you can also check this method separately so let us try that no syntax error so we have to create the instance there then I run this for example just like you five and then to ten so it will be adding only six eight that is 14 and then ten is 24 so let us check so 24 it written close so let us start continuing it next one is double type double some w double type sum to is equal to here we are going to multiply and the series is multiplication so I should start with one far let us take double variable here double I is equal to one point zero then I is lesser than or equal to n what it is going to do by point two it is going to increase so just I you here I plus equal to zero point two so every time it is going to add point two with that some two is equal to some 2 multiplied by I then it should return it is only one statement in the far loop so that I have not given the curly braces return some toe so let us see one try this I will you 10.2 only one into one point two it will print as one point to itself that is sick you can check manually as you need for the correctness of the program let us do the next one the third one here int sum off into n here I need to extract the digits for that I will create a variable called into already and then sum 3 is equal to 0 as we are going to just add initially 0 then we need a loop here we don't know how many digits will be there and the user gives so when we are not confirm about the number of iterations we will take while loop while n is greater than 0 what we will do now we will extract visit by digit so that is last digit I have taken right LD is equal to n more sorry capital n more 10 so it takes the last digit after dividing by 10 the remainder will be once if we are going to check now whether it is odd or not if card only we are going to sum otherwise we will not do anything LD more to equal to equal to 1 so then it is alright now we will do some 3 is equal to some 3 plus Garrity and then we should remove that last trade is it for that we will take only the quotient so n is equal to n divided by 10 so this will keep continuing until n is greater than 0 we have to print the sum at last that is returning return sum 3 so let us check so I will run into one C four five six five then one see here four is even number five is odd number and then again five is odd number so 10 10 plus 1 is 11 so you can see 11 is wind it up close so we have checked all the methods now we need to create a main method and then call this public static void main a string of arguments let us queue the class name overload I just use o is equal to new overload of poor dot sum of two integer arguments so I use 6 comma 10 and then OH dot sum of 1 double type I you 1.4 and then OH dot sum of 2 3 4 7 so compile this no syntax errors let us go to the next question using the switch statement write a menu driven program to perform following operations to print the value of Z where Z is equal to X cube plus 0.5 into X divided by Y where X ranges from minus 10 to 10 with an increment of 2 and y remains constant at five point five see here here it is given 10 10 as the value of x so we have to print all the values when X is minus 10 minus 8 minus 6 up to ten so we need a far loop starting from is equal to minus ten and lesser than or equal to 10 the next one to print the Floyd's triangle with and Rose the floods triangle will be the continuous number one two three four five six like that then whatever the number of rows given so that many rows it is going to print now we need input so we will do import Java dot util dot scanner class may know I have given now I write a main method I need to take option for the menu so I you int whoa scanner SC is equal to new scanner a system dot in then I give the menos system dot out dot print line up here just I print minnow and then now I will continue this so one is for value of Z right one dot the second one is flight strand of Andros so now I will prompt the user to into the choice whether you print instead of printing then I am going to assign the value so whoa is the option Rho is equal to SC dot next int up so user will enter whether one are two now we are going to start switch the option which we have taken is row now case one we need two variables here one is double Z that is the value it is going to calculate and then vice value is already given as 5.5 there so I initialize directly here then I need a farlow int X is equal to as I said minus 10 X is lesser than or equal to 10 x+ equal to two so every time two is been incremented then I want to calculate here so we know the math function Z is equal to math dot P whoa W of X comma 3 X cube it is plus 0.5 into X this is whole divided by Y divided by Y now it should print all the values of Z so I do system dot out dot print line off value of said while X is so it will be better to understand axis X plus so whatever the value it starts from minus 10 minus 10 minus 8 minus 6 so all will be displayed easy to understand the output plus so that is that it is going to print then what we will do we will break this do not forget break you will lose the marks the next we will start case to case 2 so I need two variables into N and then also the case value it will be keep increasing so that is IJ and then K I take inj further loops and then K is to increment the value continuously to write the variables there now system dot out dot print off so I asked the number of rows from the user enter the value for n far into is equal to 1 is lesser than or equal to n so these many rows we need so outer loop is four rows then here again I need a inner loop that is far into J is equal to 1 J is lesser than or equal to I so it will be right angle triangle J plus plus now I need to print case value system dot out dot print only not print line so it will be in the same line these are columns so K I am going to print with that some space is required otherwise it will look like a single number so I do some two space then I need to increase the K so always keep increasing and prints it doesn't relate to I loop are J loop we have not taken any input we have not assigned it so n is equal to yes C dot next int C we should be very careful about this so outside this loop we will give a line space then what we're supposed to do we can break otherwise you can just leave like that in the question it is not been asked to display the message for wrong option given with a user so that is optional we can give our way without that also you will get full marks here we will not do that but in case in the question it is been asked to display the message when the user gives the wrong input means you must try to default remember it compile no syntax error let us run this so now I do so one has the option see there you could see 4 minus 10 when the x value is minus 10 when X values minus 8 all the values it has been calculated and printed here the dispel you of Z now let me try with the next one option number 2 I you here so now it will be asked how many rows I need I may need 4 so you can see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 continuously it is being filtered for rows so let us go to the next question write a program to input and store integer elements in a double dimensional array of size 4 into 4 and to find the sum of all the elements so here only in this year double dimensional array programs are also there I will give you more videos on the double dimension array but I have already taught how to declare and II retrieve the variable from the double dimensional array so let us do that so I do import Java dot util dot scanner class double dimensional array IU public static void main of string of our events now I will take the input from the user for that scanner class object scanner ASC is equal to nu an error system dot in I prompt user enter the values for double dimensional array I do not declare the double dimension array so in AR are of two types of array symbols use the double dimensional in new int of the size is given s 4 into 4 so 4 rows and 4 columns so I need to take sum of all the elements so I do int sum is equal to 0 now I need a Farlow we need to follow for double dimensional array far in is equal to 0 is lesser than 4 then I plus plus next Farlow so before that let me give the prompt so that every row the user will come to know it is next to Row system enter four elements for a row so that is the row number we will give so I will be the row so what I do here it starts from zero but the row starts from one when we count I will give I plus one then I plus 1 plus now I will give the inner for loop far into j is equal to 0 J is lesser than for J plus plus so now let me take the input ARR of I and J see here is the row when I is 0 J will become 0 1 2 3 so that is 4 elements it will take again the outer for loop it will go I becomes 1 and then like that totally 4 times it will take a seedot next in tough just we need to sum all the elements so in this far loop only we can add as the user enters the value it will take the sum sum plus equal to a or are off now it will sum and then we are going to print the sum outside the loops plus some it is very simple one so let us compile no syntax errors so enter four elements for Row 1 so I will enter 5 5 5 5 4 times 5 then now I will give 4 times 6 so now the total is 44 let me give now to I am giving similar because it will be easy for calculation to check now I will give 8 here so this becomes 40 plus 44 84 correct let us go to the last question write a program to input a string and convert it into uppercase and print the paid of vowels and numbers of pairs of vowels occurring in the string for example input is beautiful beauties so that is paid of verbals see here E and a this is a pair of oval and then again next a and you said a and you are paste like that here again ena is there again yen he was there then here ine is there so all these pastes to be printed and then has to be countered and then print the number of page there so let us go to our program so again I will take import Java dot util dot scanner so I need a variable string variable string s then I need two character variable to check the first character in the next character so I will take care C 1 and then C 2 then I need to count so I will take int count initially 0 now I need to take an input scanner class object now then I prompt the user enter the string so we are saying now yes is equal to SC dot next line up line up takes the complete sentence until you will press the Enter key next to means it will take only one word until the space given now we need to convert this into uppercase s is equal to yes dot to uppercase off we need a far loop and then inside the follow only we need to print so let us give just the reference before the far loop system dot out dot print line now the rice print will you paid off verbals now far the index value always starts from zero so int I is equal to zero is lesser than or sorry lesser then only the last index is one lesser than the length so yes dot length off here if we take I is 0 I plus 1 will be 1 so at last if we see it will go out of bounds because the last character and then plus one is not available so we will go before that only so I you minus one then I plus plus now I take first character that is C 1 is equal to yes dot carrot I the next character also I have to check whether that is also verbal or not so I assign C 2 is equal to yes dot carrot I plus 1 this is next letter here now how I will check if C 1 equal to equal to whether a are I will copy this I will check all a eio you yeah I have checked now I placed at 5 times totally e i o u so it is checking whether C 1 is AR er IR oru and see this should be inside one bracket okay means if this is true and the next character also any one of this so all this but it should be see to see here there is one extra let us delete now I will copy this all this let me in the next life so I should close this if now this is c2 right c2 then what it will do you will just print system dot out dot print off c1 plus c2 if we give like this it will take the ASCII value and I are both so better we will give one double quotation here so it becomes a string there nothing there it cannot be added so it will display nearby plus one stays to differentiate this or not to space now if it is there it prints and then also count increases count plus plus I here so outside the loop we will print the count the pace will be printed every time the count will be printed once at last so here without print line we give so we need to create a new line for that I do backslash n then number of fade of all vowels plus count just compile this no syntax error let us run this we will give the same example which was given in the question paper duties so you can see here here it is shown 17 or let us check what mistake we have done there most probably curly braces we are not given yes for if we need to view the curly braces there so otherwise only the printing system is in the condition the count is not in the condition compile this and run once so you can see now that's why it is always better to dry run once after writing the program students keep watching my channels it will lead you to get excellent marks maybe 100 you make it Thank You students
