welcome back students today we are going to discuss about constructors and that program to demonstrate constructor constructors are very important part of Java the main purpose of a constructor is to create an object of a class in previous tutorial we have seen how to create the object of a class but there we didn't construct any constructor then you may have a question how it was possible to create a object without creating a constructor if your constructor is not defined then the compiler provides a default constructor for the class so it is possible to create a object without creating a constructor in a class there are two types of constructors one is default constructor and also called non parameterised constructor as the name it doesn't have any parameter for it the next one is parametrized constructor which will have some arguments as parameters let us create a program which demonstrate constructor fitness let us queue the comment example of a constructor class fitness when creating constructor you must know that it should not have any return type even we should not mention wide so let us have a constructor fitness of C there it doesn't have any return type but it can have the access specified we can give us public it is always better to give us public because we may need this to be called in another program let us create some variables double height is equal to 176 point gate come on wait a sequel 95.7 fivestring name let us simply print the details name of the candidate plus name let us copy this and paste it down let us modify to print the height so what is height plus centimeter here wait wait wait plus kilo gram so let us have another method to create an object let us consider the main method public static void main string of arguments we already learned how to create an object so we have to view the class name fitness and then object name may be or is equal to new keyword we are using new again the class name of constructor doesn't need to be called but we have seen when we create a method we have to call using the object name but the constructor ultimately get invoked when the object is created we are not initialize the name let us initialize the name equal to a a let us compile this no syntax error right click so you could see name of the candidate height and weight is now let me explain the constructor with parameter so let us not have all these variables let me just delete this and then we are having parameter here double hit come on double w and string yeah here we are having three arguments so we should initialize the values for it this can be done using creating object so let us give the value for H one sixty eight point five comma seventy three point four five comma name which is a string should be inside the double quotation maybe BVB so in the parameter we are given as H W onion so let us change that in the clinic statement also so this here will be n then here it is H and then here it is W compel this no syntax error run this so we could say name of the candidate height weight let me repeat the main points once again the constructor must have the same name s class name that is the first point constructor must not have any written type like wide or int so these return types will not be there then the constructor is automatically invoked when the object is created we don't need to call as we used to call in the method for example we used to call if it is a method see now it is not a constructor as I change the name of the method here constructor here so it will have Godot fitness off so like this we used to call this calling will not be there for a constructor and also we can have n number of constructor in a class we may have constructor with parameter R without parameter when we don't create a constructor the compiler provides a default constructor students I hope you learnt constructor very well thank you and keep watching my videos
