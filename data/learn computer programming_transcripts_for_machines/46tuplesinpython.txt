[Laughter] hello everyone in this class we are going to start tles in Python tles in Python are type of sequence which may have any type of data in it and then these are mentioned inside the p parenthesis that is round brackets and each element is bated with comma tles are ordered that means order of the elements cannot be changed elements are referenced using index numbers tles are immutable that means once the tle is initialized we cannot change or add new or delete the element from tle these are some examples here first one having all the integer numbers as its members second one having mixed data type we can also have another sequence inside this tle or again one more tle may be inside the tle let us create tle and learn how to access the members of the tle let us go to python directly let me create a tle called I where I'm going to give all the integer numbers as its members 1 2 3 4 7 8 9 so if you want to know what is stored in it I can again give itup and then I get displayed now with multiple data types Mt is equal to cap roll 60 40 3 + 10 J this is a complex data type and then 34.7 so again Mt if you give we get the doule let me also have with sequences s t is equal to as I am having here 40 80 120 and then this is a sequence and the next one I am having here cooling as a string and then I am having a tle here again inside a tle that is 678 and then I close this so s tup is again a tle if you want to know know the data type we already know that type of name of the variable you you we will be getting stup so it will say class tle now let us learn how to access the members m t of that is a square bracket I give here one and then it will be giving role as the answer as cap is having as zero as its index and then role is having one as its index similar way s t of I'm giving here zero that is the first element here you should understand that totally one list is one Element it is not only the 40 is the element so it will be giving the complete list in case if we want to access the elements inside the list then we shall give once again the index number of the list that means we can give stup of zero is the list and then from that if I want to have the index number two that is 120 similar way if I want to get seven from this tle then I shall give Stu of that is two is the index number number of the tle and from there it is one is the index number of seven in the tle so we got this seven we know now tle is immutable let us check St U of say one that is cooling I want to change this with some other element called cool which is UN like again a string but I want want to replace that it is not possible because see it shows tle object does not support item assignment that means we cannot change any of the element from the tle but if you are having a scenario where you want to change the tles value we shall do in this way we can change that to a list then make the modification required then again change it back to the tle that is possible let me change the tle to list yes list is equal to list of so any sequence is going to be converted into list now I am giving stup so this is a tle changed into list and put in the variable called yes list now yes list is a list now I can make the modification as lists are mutable so now I change yes list of 1 equal to cool now s list if you see it is changed now again I can convert this list into tle so yes T is equal to tle of s so the previous tle will be replaced as I have given the same name here in case you need to keep the original tle as it is you can change the name of the tle say for example I can say here two so here it becomes S 2 as a modified one the original remains as it is stup 2 is modified one stup is same in case you want to replace again you can do that St U is equal to tle of s list see now St is Chang now with cool creating empty tle eup is equal to empty parenthesis I give then it is empty so now e T is empty here is a small challenge see any number we put inside the parenthesis becomes a number type only for example m is equal to in the parenthesis I give here 10 so what is the type of M you may think that it is a tle because it is mentioned inside the parenthesis but it is not so let us see type of M this is integer similar way other data type for example if I give n is equal to White sorry I need to put it inside the parenthesis let me rewrite n is equal to in the parenthesis right so now type of n if I give and then it is string only it is not a tle so how do we create a tle with single element tle with single element proceeding with comma see now I give n is equal to new and then I put here one comma then it understands as a tle it is not a string anymore so type of n if you see it is a tle so similar way m is equal to I put 20 here and then comma it becomes a tle type of M is not integer it is a tle slicing is also applicable as we do using string and lists we can use square brackets with the name of the Tuple let us create one Tuple called xtup I'm giving here 7 a b n 42 20 40 80 30 10 and also a list here saying 1 2 3 4 5 now let me give x t of 2 is 4 so that means here start and stop is there two is B and then 3 is n and then four is 42 here which we mentioned four as stop is not included so it will be index number two and three only so we will get B and N here you can see that a new tle is returned after getting sliced x p off we can also have the negative index number in tles from right side to left side so if I start from Min 2 is to 5 and then the step must be there as minus1 or minus steps Min one only I give and then I close Min 2 is the big tle which is given and then minus 3 is 42 4 is n 5 is B but 5 is not in included so it will be giving the tle 42 and n as sliced sorry I supposed to give the square bracket so let me give XD of 2 is to 5 is to minus1 so I will be getting the tle 42 and N this slicing is similar to list I already said if you want to know more about the slicing you can visit my previous videos strings are lists to learn the slicing of sequence here one more thing I wanted to tell you that we can also create the twodimensional tle similar like list that is also called as nested tle so n t i give is equal to 1 2 3 comma 4 this is a tle inside the another tle having one more tle inside 5 10 15 20 now I close the main tle there it is called Nest tle no hope you understood well let me recap Once empty tle can be created mentioning only parenthesis without any value tle with single element shall be created mentioning a value followed by comma tle shall be nested index numbers are mentioned inside the square brackets with tle to access the element slicing of tle can be done similar to Strings or lists hope the concept is very clear to you let us meet in the next class thank you
