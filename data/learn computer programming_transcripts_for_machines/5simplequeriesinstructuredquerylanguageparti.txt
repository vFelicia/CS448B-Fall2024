hello everyone welcome back in this class as i said we are going to learn simple queries in mysql we know that database is a collection of data and the data are collected in the form of tables if we are having a database then we may collect the data into different table for example i have a database called school in that there are three tables one is students where all the details of students are entered and then other one is teachers where all the teachers details are entered and then stuff where all the soft details are entered similar way there may be many databases some industry having different tables called workers expenses products and sales a sales is a database again where customers represent it even the product is there another example here india where details of states details of districts ministers and citizens are showed in the form of tables or relations how do we access these details let us see before moving into that i wanted to tell you one thing the queries made in the mysql is not case sensitive that means the queries typed in the small letters are in the capital letters both are considered as same after getting into mysql to know what are all the databases available in the database that is list out the database we can have a query show databases remember here any query we are giving it will be ending with the semicolon and then after writing that we need to press enter key so that it get executed now show databases will list out all the database names that is just it will say school abc industry sales india all this if these are available next if we want to get inside the database i already told you to access the data from a table first we need to get inside the database to access the database we will be using use the database name here i have put the database name inside the angle bracket to indicate whatever is given inside the angle bracket to be changed as needed for example if i want to get inside the database called school i will be giving use school and then semicolon in case i need india database to get in i will be giving use india semicolon if i want to use sales database i will be using use sales and semicolon similar way abc industry also can be used remember here we cannot have the database name with any space that means it should be a single word so now how do we check the tables in the database once we get inside the database that is when we are accessing the particular database to list out the tables available in the database we will be giving show tables and then semicolon so for example if we are inside the database called india then we are giving show tables it will be listing out state district ministers citizens only the name of the tables to display entire table for example a state table is there these are the details if we want to get all the details of this table we can give select star from and the table name for example here we will give select star from state and then semicolon then we will be giving enter so it will show or display all the records all the details of that particular table the star says all the from the table name whichever is mentioned where in case we don't want to get all the columns from the table but only selected columns we can give select first column name comma second column name comma third column name and so on how much are the columns that much column we can mention the name of the column to be mentioned and then we will give from and the table name whichever the table is then semicolon enter this will display only specified columns and all the records with these columns if we want to understand the structure of the table that means the properties of each column for example data type whether it can be null a primary key mentioned or not all these for that purpose we can give describe and then table name we can also use first four letters of describe that's d e s e and the table name to view the structure of the table let us learn all these queries by executing these now let me open mysql command line client i will maximize this zoom little bit i give my password this get opened this is the prompt which we are having for mysql so just i wanted to check what are the databases available on my computer so i will be giving show data bases and then semicolon enter so these are the databases available on my computer it showed india is a database so if i want to use the india database what i will be doing use space india and then semicolon enter so database changed that means we are now inside the database called india now i don't know what are all the tables available there means if i want to check the tables i know i created only one table here for teaching you all let me check show tables so all the tables inside india database only will be shown so as i said state is the table here even this will be viewed as a table even one attribute is here further the column name tables in india it has shown here these are all only views these are all not permanent now if i want to see all the records in state table select remember select to display anything any query you will be giving select before it all the details so star then from the table name the table name is state i can see all the details of state state underscore ut district zone language capital area these are the columns which i have let me recall here the degree and the cardinality degree of the table is 6 here as there are 1 2 3 4 six columns the cardinality here is five rows so that is the cardinality okay now if we want to get only selected columns for example i need state district and area or capital of it what i shall do select the column names that is state underscore ut comma district d i s d r i c p s see i already told it is not case sensitive so i have given small letter still it will be accepting it and then i need a capital c a p i l all these columns from which table so you should remember it from state then semicolon i can see only the three columns which i mentioned with all the rows you can see here how long it took to execute it took just no moment so if i want to know the structure of the table i will be giving describe table name right state i can see the field names here these are the field names available the type of this field so state ut worker type it is 25 characters it can accept whether it can be null or not yes all the columns can be null no key is defined here in this table and then default is null so that means anything if you want to put as a default value that also can be given any other mention is not there if i want to go to any other database there is a database called world that will be defaultly installed when you are installing mysql let us change it to world use keyword space and then world you can see database change let me see what are all the tables available there show tables there are three tables available city country and country language if i want to get structure of the city table describe rdesc city so it will show the structure of the table you can see id name country code district population all these are the fields the type of this ids integer name is character 35 country code is character 3 district is character 20 and population is integer null nothing can be null then id is a primary key any default value population is given as 0 there extra is given ideas auto increment if i want to check what are all the records available select all the details i can give select star from city so there are plenty of records in this table this we can use for learning purpose there are 4079 records available to come out of this mysql we can type exit and enter hope the concept was clear keep watching this channel keep practicing and keep learning thank you
