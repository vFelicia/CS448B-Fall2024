welcome back students in this class we are going to learn auto boxing and auto unboxing automatic conversion of a primitive value into an object of the corresponding wrapper class is referred as auto boxing similar way but in opposite conversion of an object into its corresponding primitive data type is referred as auto unboxing let us understand with few examples now i initialize a variable of integer data type called h having value 16 this is ordinary primitive data type now if i want to convert this into an object which is corresponding to its wrapper class we know now what is wrapper class corresponding wrapper classes integer i capital integer now i give the object name let me have obj h is equal to new integer of h so the primitive data type here it is getting converted into its object this is called boxing let us check by printing it i say here object just for reference plus object h obj h you can see the object is printed here now let me tell you what is auto boxing instead of giving the new keyword and then integer of age we directly say here as h so this statement is taken care by the compiler automatically it is being done so it is converted into its object called objh of its corresponding wrapper class integer this is auto boxing let us run this also you can see the second time the output has come now let us understand what is unboxing unboxing is nothing but again converting this object into its ordinary primitive data type so let me give in now i use some other variable say a is equal to obj h see this is an object that object is being converted into ordinary data type so this is auto unboxing let me print this this is unboxing okay you could you could see that unboxing you may have a question what is the need of this as object oriented programming everything resides as object and class so even you store the primitive data type it is automatically converted or wrapped into its object you may have some situation in advanced programming where you need all the data as object not as primitive data so that is the reason why concept of boxing and auto unboxing is introduced in java sometimes we need to convert one data type into another data type right for example integer to string at that time the object only will be helpful see let us check i am trying to convert string str is equal to obj h dot 2 string okay now this will be converted as string now let me print this so i will be printing here string you could see that it is printed 16 that is a string now if this is not an object okay so let us give a r h let me give h itself i am trying to convert this age that is primitive data type to string will it accept see that is an error so this is the purpose of having the object students hope concept is clear keep watching keep learning and keep sharing thank you
