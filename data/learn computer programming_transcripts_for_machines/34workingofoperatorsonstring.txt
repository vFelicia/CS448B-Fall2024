foreign welcome back do you know even The Operators works on strings here we will discuss which are all the operators works on string concatenation we use addition symbol for that repetition multiplication relational operator also works on the string membership operator in and not in and then identity operator is and is not also works on the string even we have slicing in the string in this class except slicing we will see all other operators how it works on the string I will demonstrate everything directly on the python window let us open python window I initiate ST1 as word there and then st2 as power now arithmetic operator Plus I will give ST1 plus s t 2 that means it will concatenate both the word and display together note there is no space in between the words just it will display nearby now let me have ST1 multiplied by 3. so this will replicate word three times in membership operator you will check whether the substring is available in the string and then if it is available it will return true otherwise it will return false so now I am giving here enter in International so enter is available there so it will be returning prove here now I am giving word in International so it is not available it will be giving false we will also check not in enter not in international see it is available it should be saying now false now let us check power not in National so it is not there it will say true I have S1 is equal to Windows here then es2 as let me give paper now I can check with this relational operator when S1 is equal to IQ S2 it is false as both the ASCII value of the starting letter is different so it is false now if I give S one is greater than S2 see here S2 starts with p so it's ASCII values lesser than W's so this will be true now let me give win is greater than S1 see here win is the starting part of S1 that is Windows rate but Windows has more than the swin so win cannot be greater than S1 so this will be false now I have here windmill is greater than Windows that is S1 I will you here w i n d is common in both the next letter it will be checking so War has more ASCII value than m so S1 is having greater value here than windmills m so this will be false now let me have paper is equal to S2 see S2 is also paper so both are having the same spelling it is true similar way it works with greater than or equal to and lesser than or equal to let us have some example for that laptop is greater than or equal to lap so this will be true as laptop is having more characters than the slab which is the starting of laptop now let me give learn is greater than computer see here L is having greater ASCII value than the C let me give greater than or equal to so this will be true now I give programming is lesser than or equal to online please ASCII value is 1 greater than o so this will be false now I give YouTube is not equal to you it is true now e is and E is not that is identity operator now let me check U is u this will be true similar way YouTube is not YouTube see there here this will be true as capital Y and small y are different so these are not same right so ID of this also will be different so this will be true now let me give paper is S2 see S2 is paper so this should be true hope this was very simple to understand keep watching this channel keep learning keep practicing thank you
