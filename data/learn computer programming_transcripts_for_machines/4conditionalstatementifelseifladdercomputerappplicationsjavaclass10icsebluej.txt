hello students today we are going to see decision making statements decision making statements are also called selection statements in java we have if conditions and switch case these statements hello to control the flow of execution of a program which is based on the conditional expressions given let us create a class conditional you are going to see only you conditionally okay so delete all this let us take closed on the previous one until we take by input so until this we copy put a randomly paste let us change this conditional if if so let us have an example program to find whether the given number is even or not so we have here importing statement then class as conditional conditional yes and then we take a number to check whether the given number is given so just we assign a variable single variable Y and then we do not consider this and then scan it obj little bit of grac we want to change we can change this yes so system gotta enter that number enter the number and then disagree in the same line with so user enters the number and then we take test the N is equal to object name that is yes we ugly no yes that next inter so after taking the number we should know logically how to check whether the given number is given basically when even number is there we are divided by 2 then we do not get any remainder so now let us view the condition if condition is given inside the parenthesis if n mod 2 is equal to equal to a single equal to value that becomes assignment or greater which is the value if we do W equal to then it says we checks whether the condition is true or not whether it is equal or not so this is called condition up to T or total so equal to equal to 0 and then we say the result Pro printing statement system duck Oh frankly no so we say this is even in degree even so the if condition can be without block of code when there is single printing segment or single statement is given and then we close there with that close then class let us compile this no syntax error please give this we use 98 so it is even it said if we you number which is not a um number odd number it is not going to say anything just it is going to like if we want to print even odd number so we will have the else condition here else is given yes there is no condition we're to give to be given quickly you here system dot out dot print line of odd so let us compare this so now even it is a number it is going to say that result so now physically odd if you want to check the series of conditions then we need if else if ladder so for example if we give a student mark then it says which grade it is for example above 80 that is a distinction then 60 to 80 maybe first last 40 to 60 maybe second class and then lesser than fortieth maybe Facebook so let us have a program for this so we you firstly let us take these conditions in the comment line so we have here if to another number is so you will get this think that more space in greater than 80 and let's go to them kadhi 10 distinction distinction save if greater than 16 and lesser then not equal to s again 80 tenses for success so if it is greater than 40 greater than or equal to we can check a quad result equal equal to greater than equal to less than or equal to or equal to greater than or equal unless again plus again 60 say second class is below okay let us consider this let us take any input as mark REM then we are going to cut the mark until the mark associate the variable change again it is taken now we are going to check the veins so for this we need to have the logical operator called end operator so let us consider the n is greater than or equal to KT and then is the adapt egg and Kami's yesterday I said then I this protocol under you say s description so you'll see is going to the last condition is to create more condition say it is greater than or equal to 60 and lesser than 8 so it says first class so if it is less than 40 and I sell them 60 say second class second class else it is going to the last condition we don't need to check so we are not going to give any conditions here so here it is not if we supposed to be elseif elseif elseif yes so this is the else else if glad companies right click on this we will check all the ranges say 98 distinction say 45 second class 35 first class say cutting so maybe I think we are not changing okay we are not saying we finish salvation okay so complete this and then it is director say free 30 okay I think you learnt if condition today let us see switch case if not in next session
