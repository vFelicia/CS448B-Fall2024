welcome back students today we are going to see math functions in Java we know how to solve a simple mathematical expression using variables constant and operators but to solve mathematical expressions with powers square roots etc we need some special functions Java provides math class with many mathematical functions this math function is available in java dot Lang package you know land packages default package which we don't need to import let us see the math functions available in java syntax of math function is like this math dot that is a machine capital dot function name the name of the function available in Java then in the bracket we give the argument list otherwise a single argument to find the power of any number we have P whoa W of X comma Y so X and Y is arguments here Y is raised to the power X so for example we may have math dot P whoa W of 5 comma 2 25.0 most of the math functions return double pipe output next we have SQ RT of any argument this will give the square root of a number example here math dot s qrp of 36 this will return six point zero next we have seal of a number this method helps to round up the decimal number to a integer value but gives the output as double value for example we have three hundred twelve point three four this will round to the next higher value of integer maybe here our 3r8 whatever it is that is lesser than five or more than five that doesn't matter this will round up so we will have 313 as the output next we have floor of a number this will round down a decimal number though the decimal point has five or more than that it will not consider it will only round out so that means the decimal number completely left and then it becomes only 45 here another one we have here rent of the number this will round as per mathematical rule so here we have ninety one point five six if it is five or more than 5 it will round up otherwise we will round down so here as per mathematical rule we have 92 as output next we have ABS of X so this is the absolute value absolute value is the position of a number either left side or right side of the zero in the number line for example if we have a number line like this zero is in middle right side we will have all positive numbers in left side or negative numbers if we take minus three as a number absolute value of this is three that is counter only the position of the number it doesn't matter whether in negative side or positive side so absolute value of minus three becomes three in mathematics we have two vertical lines like this to mention the absolute value if we take one then we will have absolute value of 1 is 1 itself this function will help us to convert negative value into positive value for example if we have minus 72 point three this will become seventy two point three next we have Mei X of two arguments here this will return the greater value of the given two number for example we have five point six and seven point two the greater values seven point two this get returned next we have my enough two arguments this will return the smaller value here this will return eight point two six next we have exp of X this will give the result of X raised to the power e for example we have math dot exp of five next we have log of X this will give large epidemic value of X next we have sine of X this will return sine value of x and then cos cos value of x and then tan tan value of x next we have random off this will not take any argument but it will return any random number with double type now let us test these mathematical functions through a program program to test map functions import Java dot IO dot star plus math class let us declare the variables we should have throws ioexception prompting the user a is equal to 2 double dot parse double of BR dot readline off let me copy these two lines power here it is B so let me have one more variable called just C so we are going to do C is equal to math dot P whoa W of a commodity let us print this simply give power plus that is C let me also have the square root without variable directly let me print so that is directly I am going to write the function here math dot s QR t off let me have a itself compile this enter the base say 25 to the power 2 so 25 to the power 2 is 625 square root of 25 is 5 now let us write the code to round off the numbers enter decimal number so here a is going to be a decimal number let me remove this let me remove this also now b is equal to math dot seal of a then C is equal to math dot floor half a then let me have one more value this B D is equal to math dot print off here so I will have here 3 printing statements first we'll print this is SIL so up this roundup so what it will print it is B then here rounded down this C as per mathematical rules just D so let me compile this I am giving him five point six now when it rounds using seal function it will round up so six point zero if it is floor function though it is more than 0.5 it will round to the down value that is 5 will remain this is neglected as per mathematics as this is more than 0.5 it will round up that will become 6 let us have one more example with lesser decimal place I give here no 8.03 see round up though it is 0.03 it is going to the next higher value round down is 8 as per mathematical role it is 8 now let us test for maximum and minimum function we need to input so let us take from the user this will be B math dot Mac cinema ma X of a comma B then here minimum or a Mayan of a comma D so here let us have maximum that is C minimum of given 2 is B here let us also have the absolute value here so absolute value of let us have B math dot a BS of B so we will do negative value for B to point 3 to another number 4 sorry minus 4 point 1 so maximum is 2 point 3 2 so this is positive number this is negative number so this is lesser than this minimum is minus 4 point 1 the absolute value of B is 4 point 1 so this negative value converted into positive value with this let us also create a random number Double R is equal to math dot random off system dot out dot print line off I'll just compile this see it written the greater number the smaller number absolute value of 60 3.0 and 63 itself so this is the second number we have taken for absolute value and then random number is created dear students I hope this is very clear to you how to use math functions in Java program next video tutorial I will teach you how to write Java statements to given mathematical expressions until then thank you students
