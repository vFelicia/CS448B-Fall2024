hello everyone in this class we are going to learn two important things which are needed to perform a for loop in python program the first one is range of function range of n this is a function which creates a sequence of the integers with n elements it will create from 0 to n minus 1 this can also be mentioned as range of 0 comma n so here remember n is not included previous to that number itself it will stop so for example range of 6 are range of 0 comma 6 when we are giving this python creates a sequence of integers starting from 0 and then stops at five the range function can also be with two arguments when we are giving two arguments this will create a sequence of integer from m until n minus one for example if we are giving range of 4 comma 10 this will create a sequence 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 remember not 10. range of function can also have three arguments say l m and n it creates a sequence of integer from l to m minus 1 so here n will be the steps for example if i have range of 1 comma 10 comma 3 what happens it will start from 1 it will end by 9 but the steps given to it is if we take a number line like this one is starting and then two and three are skipped and then it jumps to four and then it jumps to third step that is 7 then after 7 it should go to 10 but 10 is not included so it stops by 7 the sequence will be 1 4 and 7 when we are having only two arguments that is the second one four comma 10 how it acts the steps by default it takes as plus one so this is the meaning so it is four five six 7 8 and 9. the next important thing is in and not in operators with range of function in operator checks whether the mentioned integer is in the given range of integers and returns boolean value accordingly similarly not in operator checks whether the mentioned integer is not in the given range of integers and returns boolean value accordingly for example 14 in range 8 comma 20 comma 2 this means the elements are 8 10 12 14 16 and 18. so whether 14 is there in this range or not yes it is true so it will return true the next example 3 in range 12 comma 1 comma minus 2 here the step value given as minus 2 the elements should be 12 10 8 6 4 2 3 is not available in that so it will return false the next example for not it one not in range eight see eight means it starts from zero and then ends at seven so one is there you are checking not in so it is false one more example three not in range minus 6 comma 0 the elements will be minus 6 minus 5 minus 4 minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 3 will not be there so this is true let me execute and show all these let me give x is equal to range of 7 it should be 0 to 6th right so if i ask what is x then it says 0 comma 7 but how do we know elements are created let us put this into list just i say list of x so you can see 0 to 6 is created as list similar way range of 10 comma 20 iq then just i convert directly into list you can see from 10 to 19. so far we have not seen list but just understand for time being that list of elements are put into square bracket becomes listing python elements are separated with comma we will see elaborately list in future lessons so let me check with three arguments list of range of 5 comma 25 comma 3 see it starts from 5 6 7 it will not take 8 it will take then 11 like that it will be going until 24 so that means not exactly 24 before that whatever element comes it stops there so you can see that 23 is the last element so now similar way let us check some negative integers list of range of minus 50 comma 6 i give let me give list of range of minus 20 comma minus 25 what will happen now see here from minus again it is going in negative way so it is not incrementing it is decrementing this cannot happen because the third argument by default it is plus 1 not minus 1 correct so let us check so there are no elements put it into it if i give same thing list of range of minus 20 comma minus 25 comma minus 1 it will go up to now minus 24 okay let us check in and not e so 5 in range 10 i say so that is 0 to 9 right it will be true if i say minus 20 in range 2 comma 5 that should be false now let me check minus 20 not in range 2 comma 5 it is not there so it will show us true t not in range 10 comma 100 the step is 5 so 50 is included right it says not in range so it will be false i hope you are clear in this concept let us meet in the next class learning for loop thank you all
