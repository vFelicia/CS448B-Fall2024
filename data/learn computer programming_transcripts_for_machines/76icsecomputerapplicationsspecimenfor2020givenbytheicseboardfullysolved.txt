dear students in this video we are going to solve the specimen question paper of computer applications which is given by icac board for 2020 onwards in this video we will solve only section a and the next we'll continue section B section y a 40 marks answer all the questions question 1 what is encapsulation wrapping up of data under a single unit is called encapsulation it is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates this is one of the groups concept explain the purpose of using a new keyword in a Java program new keyword creates a Java instance that is object and allocates memory to that object question C what are literals literals are constants in Java a literal specifies a fixed value in a program D mentioned the types of access specifiers access specifiers are public private and protected there is one more we call it as default this is not a keyword when none of the above is mentioned it is called default if you write a default you must indicate that it is not a keyword what is constructor overloading when more than one constructor that is different parameters is given in the program it is called constructor overloading question number two a differentiate between boxing and unboxing converting primitive datatype into object is called boxing converting an object into corresponding parameter of data type is called unboxing these terms that is boxing and unboxing are added into new syllabus the world syllabus it was called wrapper classes I have already explained wrapper classes in my previous video please refer it then you will understand it clearly rewrite the following condition without using logical operators if a is greater than B or a is greater than C it print C a so we should not use and are not operators here so those are logical operators without that how we can use here R is there are we can use using if and else if statements if a is greater than B it is going to print a else if a is greater than C again it is going to print yeah so this is very simple tree write the following loop using for loop while true so it prints star while true means it is always true the condition becomes always true so how we can convert into farlow a always true means it is unbreakable one that is infinity loop so just we can create a infinity loop where there is no initialization no condition and then no increment so it becomes a infinity loop so we are going to print a star next question right the prototype of a function search so that means name of the function is search which takes two arguments one is a string and other is a character one and returns a integer value here we can write public static R that is optionally we can leave it I have mentioned it here it returns integer type so we mentioned int instead of void so public static int and then search is the name of the method and the arguments are string and character so string s comma cat see I have written differentiate between equal to and equal to equal to operators we know equal to operator is assignment operator this assigns value to the variable the value is right side and the variable should be left side equal to equal to operator is a relational operator this compares the values of a the side and returns a boolean it says whether true or false question 3 state the number of bytes and bits occupied by a character array of 10 elements so we know character data type has 2 bytes and then 10 elements are there in array so 2 bytes into 10 elements equal to 20 bytes if we need it to convert into bits we can take it as 16 bits into 10 elements otherwise we can also calculate 20 bytes into 8 that gives in bits differentiate between binary certain linear search techniques linear search binary search linear search search element is compared one by one here binary search search element is compared with middle element linear search the entire process would be timeconsuming here in binary search it is faster than linear search it is more efficient than linear search linear search works for both sorted as well as inserted RS binary search works only for satara's this question was asked in 2019 bore paper question see what is the output of the following string a is equal to Java is a programming language backslash n developed by backslash T backslash single inverted comma james gosling single inverted comma close with backslash so these are escape sequences backslash n gives a new length so until Java is programming language it will print and there will be a one space that we can't see and then the next line it starts after one space so there is a space before and after backslash in developed by and then backslash T that gives a single tab that much space is given and then james gosling inside the single quotation differentiate between break and system dot exit of 0 we know break is a key word but system dot exit of 0 is not a keyword it is a standard library function break eliminates this switch our loop here system dot exit of 0 terminates the execution of the program right a statement in Java for root of a plus B the whole cube divided by a plus B inside the two vertical lines that means the absolute value disk so first let us write the numerator one for a square root we will have math dot esq RT half a plus B whole cube is there so what we will do math dot s qrt off math dot three whoa W of a plus B comma three so we will be writing like this a plus B can be inside the bracket our without that that is option divided by math dot a BS half a plus B and then we terminated what is the value of M after the evaluating the following expression M minus equal to nine percentage plus plus n plus plus plus n divided by two the values are given here iam isten and nearmiss six here we can notice that M minus equal to is given so what we do we will write m equal to M minus whatever is the right side expression within a bracket so first we have to evaluate that and then we will subtract from M so M value is ten minus nine percent a symbol plus plus y n so y n value is here six preincrement so it becomes 7 plus already the value of VN will be seven again it has been pre incremented so it becomes eight divided by two so now if we evaluate as per operator precedence we should do multiplication or division or the percentage symbol first and then only we have to add so we will do this one first and then this one nine divided by 7 gives to us a remainder then eight divided by two is four so we will add whichever is inside the bracket first so 10 minus six becomes four next predict the output of the following math dot P whoa W of 25 comma 0.5 plus math dot scene of 4.2 see here piwo W of 25 comma 0.5 0.5 means half so anything to the power half is route so it will be giving their value of 25 routing so that is five 5.0 + math dot seal so seal is always rounding up so it will do 5.0 so it becomes 10.0 here next math dot round of 14 point 7 + math.floor of seven point nine round means according to the mathematical law it will drown so here fourteen point seven it becomes 15round use the output in integer type so it is 15 a math dot floor floor means round down so seven point nine though it is more than five point five it will leave that and they take only the integer value that is seven fifteen plus seven point zero it is been implicit by computer automatically so that both becomes double now so the result will be twenty two point zero you the output of the following Java statements here transparent dot to lower case of so the transparent is a string here it will be converted into lower case completely so it becomes transparent in lower case the next one transparent dot compare to transition see here you can see trans trans both are same in the beginning and then here P is there in the next one there is I so until that it will check both are same so wherever it is differing that is peace here is here so it will take the ASCII value of P and then ASCII value of I ask you value of P is 80 ASCII value of is 73 so it will take the difference first one second one so that is 80 minus 73 becomes seven as the answer Thank You students let us continue in the next session that is section B
