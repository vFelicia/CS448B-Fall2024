hello everyone welcome back we are in the process of learning for loop from last few sessions today also we are going to continue with the nested for loop in this class we are going to learn how to create the pattern programs using nested for loop nearly 25 programs are there i will be explaining most of them i have also given the source code in the description you can click on the link and get the code for all the pattern programs as pdf file before going into program just i wanted to tell you one thing if you don't know how the nested for loop works please go to my previous video learn and come back here so that it will be very clear for you to understand further let me go to the script more now let us consider a very basic shape using star just i wanted to print maybe a rectangular one so this is the shape which is rectangular shape having five stars in the each row like that there are three rows i give for i in range so first let us consider one single row there are five stars right so i in range if i give five right it will be printing five times if i give print statement here print i just wanted to print star so i give star and then if i want to print in the same line i will be giving n equal to that is open and close yet nothing inside i give so it will be just simply printing only one row with five stars let us check this so it prints like that in case i need this to repeat this three times in rows what i can do before this i can give a for loop and then three times iq see just a small change i make i make this as i and then this j now this second for loop will be inside the previous for loop so one indent i have given for this see now three times it will be working first time it takes 0 in the range and then here this will take 5 times it will be running so 5 times the star is being printed right after this i want to come to the new line for that purpose what i shall do i can come to the new line after executing this so not every time after executing this after completion of all 5 stars so that is outside this for loop so i will be giving here print and then one simply open and close bracket that means just it prints a new line i will tell you one hint this three that is responsible for rows so anytime you are giving the outer loop number of rows it will be in the inner loop here it will be number of columns see one two three four five so five stars are there five columns so every row five columns it pre so prints okay this is the first one let me have user defined number of rows and column so for that purpose what i can do instead of this 3 and 5 giving us a constant i will be taking from the user saying for rows i said r and then i say integer of input enter the number of rows similar way for columns i suppose to close one more bracket for columns number of column circuit after this i will be changing this s row as i said this is for row and this is for column right c i give and then this i give here a c let me run this i need five rows with seven stars you can see the same is being printed hope this is clear so the second one is modified one with number of rows and columns input by the user now instead of this pattern i need maybe like this let us take away this i in range so 3 rows are there i put 3 here or else we can also take 1 comma 4 here j is there that is number of columns 1 to 5. so it starts from 1 i will be giving 1 and then it should stop at 5 means i should be giving 6 here see every time that is every column the number keeps changing right that is responsible for column so instead of star i will be giving here j so it increases it prints j remember we don't need to give inside the quotation if it is a quotation it will be printing only j so here it is a number i just give us j there if i need a space between the numbers i can give one space here let me run this it has printed exactly whatever we need now instead of this one two three four five each row with the same number that is first one is as one one one second is as two two two three three three what i supposed to do so remember here i is meant for the rows as the number of rows changes the same count also is being printed first row one second row two third row three so it is not going to change every time j runs five times similarly five times it is being printed small changes we are making here instead of j we make i that's all nothing else you can see now let us consider this pattern see here the first row is having one element second row is having two elements and then so on and also we can notice that every time the column increases its value how it can happen first row with one column second row with two column third row with three column that means number of columns is equal to number of rows how many rows are there totally there are five rows so we can consider as it is starting from one and then ends with five we can give here 6 so it becomes 1 to 6 for i that is our number of rows now what we need to print if we print 1 to 6 every time it is going to print 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 instead of that as i told number of columns equal to number of rows we will connect i to j when i is 1 this let it be i itself but i means it will stop on that number so we will just give plus one so that if i is one here it will be one comma two so one time it will be printing so like that if it increases when it is two this becomes 1 comma 3 so 1 and 2 it will be printing the next count when it is 3 this becomes 1 to 4 so this will be printed now when it is 4 this will be 1 to 5 that is this row will be printed and then similar way the last rows day is only being printed as every time number changes in the column i am running this you can see perfectly done let us consider this pattern see here 1 and then here 2 1 last time it was 1 2 1 2 3 like that it is going in reverse every time right for this what we supposed to do the row count is same let it be but when it is 2 for the next one we can give i here so that when i becomes 2 this becomes 2 so where it should end it will be ending by 0 0 means before this at 1 it will be stopping when it is going in reverse remember by default it is plus 1 if it is minus 1 we supposed to give here so minus 1 again j that means changing every time when it prints a column correct let us run this you can see perfectly this also done now i need a pattern like this see the shape is same the increment is same but instead of changing every time in the column it remains as it is that means when first row it is 1 the second row all the numbers are 2 so that means nothing but i so let me just change this to i that's all no more changes perfect now let me consider the other way at the beginning 5 the next row is 4 5 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 1 2 three four five every time the first number of row keeps decreasing so it starts from five i give five and then where it stops at zero that is before that one it will be stopping that is this one now when it is going in reverse minus one i supposed to give as a step now j loop you can notice that every end element is 5 so it should be ending at 6 that is confirmed now the beginning always one lesser than the previous one lesser than the previous where it starts it starts at five now five to six that is only one what i can do here to make next time to lesson 1 i will create one variable k is equal to 0 in the beginning and then here i will give just minus k so now next time what happens the k will be increasing by 1 so what i will give k plus equal to 1 so every time k increases it is subtracted from 5 it will reach up to 1 as this goes 5 while printing every time the column changes the value so that means i will be printing here j let us check this so it is again perfect now i have a pattern 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 see the number does not repeat at all it keeps increasing and the pattern is same what i can do for this the pattern we can use any way here let us have the beginning how we did it was one comma six and then here let it be as one comma i plus one this will create a pattern like right angle triangle the shape but here when we need to print the continuous number i start this k as 1 and then i will be printing k here i keep increasing k every time but not in the outer for loop it is inside the inner form so that every time it gets increases it doesn't have any control on this irj loop continuously it keeps increasing let me check this you can see it is perfect again in case number of rows you need as per user's choice we can just simply add n is equal to into input of enter number of rows you need now what i will do instead of this 6 i will give n plus 1 let us try this let me expand this i could see 25 lines here this time i have a pattern with alphabet a a b abc abcd i will take help of ascii values we know capital a's ascii value is 65 and then it increases so on so what i will be giving here i will increase this from 65 up to 70 so that is 5 times here it starts from 65 then i plus 1 when i print instead of printing this number i am going to change it ascii value to character so ch r of j i will print so every time the column keep changing i don't need this k here now for time being let us check this it is right if i need number of rows given by use a similar thing n is equal to into input of enter number of rows so here what i am going to do it starts from 65 so i add 65 plus n the 65 itself is included so plus that many times it comes let us check so for example i need 15 rows you can see that 15 rows it has been printed now if i need a repeated values in each row it is very simple i just print i instead of j so every row the same alphabet is being printed let us check this 7 you can see that it is being printed if i need a pattern with alphabet continuously here smaller alphabets are there i will take n s 97 as ascii value of lowercase a is 97 let this be as normal 1 comma 6 and then 1 comma i plus 1 what i am going to print is character of n i need to increase n's value every time so n plus equal to 1 let me check this it is right now let us consider the pattern which is opposite right angle triangle from the greater one it keeps decreasing i will be having here 5 up to 0 then right when it keeps decreasing i will be writing minus 1 s step so first time it is 5 next time it is 4 so i need to link this i in the beginning of this so that it is i here and then until where it can go it can go up to 0 here also so that it stops at 1 always and then here also minus 1 will be the step what i am going to print i can print just star inside the quotation so it prints this star i don't need this i take away let us check it is right if i need the number type say like this it starts from 5 and ends at 1 so this is right and then every time this i keeps decreasing so this also starts from 4 and the next 3 to 1 and this is also same instead of printing the star i am going to print j as every time the column keeps changing let us check this even this is right if i need the repetition of number like this simply i print i instead of j it is so simple this is another type it starts from one and ends with five every time it starts with one but ends with one lesser than the previous one so the outer for loop is right it runs five times but the inner for loop we can change as it starts from 1 i can give 1 always it ends which is equal to i so i will be giving i and then plus 1 here it is in increasing order so i can cancel this now i will be printing j as every time the column changes let us check this this is right let me have little bit changed version here see one two three four five two three four five three four five four five and five it ends with five so it starts from one and it goes up to 5 so the outer for loop i can write like 1 comma 6 i keep increasing every round the same increased number only i need so i give as i and then this will be ending at 6 again every time it ends with 5 here in the pattern that's all j it is printing let us check this this is also right if i need using alphabet like this we know it starts from 65 i will be giving 65 and then it will be ending with 70 e is 69 here i2 again 70 i will be giving then character of j let us check this this is also perfect if i need that in other way say like this it starts at e that is 69 and then will be ending at a that is 65 so i should be giving here 64. this is going in reverse order i give minus 1 now 69 next round will be 68 so the same thing only we need let it be as i only so ending will be here as 64. you can see every time it ends with ea this is in reverse order so i should again give here minus let us check this yeah this is also right if i need the repetition of letter e d c like that like this what shall i do i just print i there let me check yes this is also right so far we have seen so many right angle triangle using the nested for loop you might have got good hold of nested for loop by now practice is more important than you just listen the class so keep practicing most of this i have explained you there are nearly 25 programs pdf of this is given in the description when you click the link you will be getting it these two programs are using the string functions that i will let you know once we complete learning the string functions so keep watching this channel keep learning let us meet in the next class with sum of series program until then bye thank you
