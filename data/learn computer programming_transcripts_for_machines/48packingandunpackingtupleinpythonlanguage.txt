[Laughter] hello everyone in this class we are going to see packing and unpacking of tles in Python let us open idle let me initiate the variables with some values I give p is equal to 20 Q is = to 40 and then R is equal to 60 now if I need a tle from these values I shall create a dou T1 which is equal to open the parenthesis indicating the tle so p comma Q comma R and then I close this so now the values of these variables are in the tle then tle 1 becomes 20 40 60 so let us check so it is a tle this is called packing unpacking is just reversed to this let me have another tle tle two which is equal to I have some names here Henry Abdul Surya 500 600 400 so if I want to unpa this I must be giving the variables which are equal to the length of this tle so in this tle six elements are there that means the length is six so I will be giving six variables bifurcating each with comma for example I give A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 which is equal to T2 otherwise we can also directly give the tle here I have the tle so I give the name of the tle there and then now each value is assigned to the variables A1 will have Henry A2 will have Abdul similar way up to A6 let us check now what is A6 it's supposed to be 400 now A3 is Surya however the tle remains as the there is no change in it if we need names as one single variable and the values are in different variables I shall give star for example I give name only name and then the remaining 500 600 400 with other variables A1 comma A2 comma A3 then equal to T2 so now Henry Abdul sua those together becomes a list remaining A1 is 500 A2 is 600 A3 is 400 let us check this so now name is a list having the names now A2 if you check it will be 600 in case we need the values in one list names are in different variables we shall also do that I give N1 comma N2 comma N3 and then here star V IU which is equal to T2 now if I ask N1 it is hry V is a list with values we cannot apply this star to many variables only one it is possible what if we give a middle element with the star let us check I have here A1 star and A2 then A3 which is equal to T2 now A1 will be having Henry A2 will be Abdul sodia 500 and 600 let us check now the A3 is 400 in case we give star for two variables it will give you the error let us check A1 star a star B is equal to T2 here it shows error as multiple star expression in assignment let me summarize hope it is very clear to you keep watching my channel keep learning and keep sharing too thank you
