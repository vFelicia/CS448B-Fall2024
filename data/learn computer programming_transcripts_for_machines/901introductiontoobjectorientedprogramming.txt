hello students in this video lesson we will learn what is objectoriented programming before seeing objectoriented programming let us learn what is computer program computer program is a set of instructions to complete a specific task for an example just let us have adding two numbers and take the output from the computer for this first computer needs a first number so we will ask the computer to take the input for the first number and then store it in a variable again we have to ask computer to take a second number and store it in a another variable then we will ask the computer to add these two numbers which are in the variables and then put the answer in the another variable and then at last we will ask the computer to display whatever is there in the third variable so here we get the answer so to do this task we need a number of instruction to be given to the computer so this is what a set of instruction given to the computer to complete a specific task program can be written in any computer programming language there are so many computer programming languages for example we can say C C++ Java Python COBOL Fortran and so many let us see how computer understands these language computer can understand only zeros and ones instruction written in this form is called binary our machine language so computer directly does not understand whatever we write in the high level languages it should be converted into zeros and ones so it is very difficult task to write the code in zeros and ones computer languages were introduced which are closed to human language for this purpose these languages are called highlevel languages programs written in highlevel languages get converted into machine language using translators so now we should know water translators translation of a codes programs written in highlevel languages are translated using compiler or interpreter to machine language so what is this compiler compiler converts the code written in highlevel language into machine code in one go that is at once it will convert all the course into machine language that is zeros and ones but the interpreter is there the interpreter converts statement by statement that is the difference between compiler interpreter so any language will have one of this course written in highlevel languages are called source code so whatever we write a programmer writes those course are called source code the translated code which the computer can understand are called object code the person who creates a programming code is called programmer that everybody knows very well there are two types of languages that is categorized into two lower level language and high level language let us see what is lower level language machine language so that already we have seen machine directly understands the code written in this language machine language can be written using only zeros and ones assembly level languages uses symbolic course which is more understandable than machine language assembly level language is used for device drivers high level language when we speak about programmer we probably think about the people who programming highlevel languages only no knowledge of hardware is needed to create a sities machine independent source code written in any highlevel language must be compiled or interpreted into machine code in order to run so that we all be discussed as every language has general set of rules or grammar for example English is a language so there is a grammar for that some set of rules given same like that any language you take there will be some rules to be followed that computer also has a set of rules our structure this is called as syntax example for computer language basic C++ C Java Python Perl all this so now we know what is computer language but when we write a program there will be different type of approaches high level languages gives easy approach to programmer to create a program to any task there are many approaches in the programming we will discuss about only two that is procedure oriented programming and object oriented programming what is this procedure oriented programming the procedure oriented programming approach allows the programmer to apply the large using number of functions many instructions are written to carry out the task these instructions group to form functions functions take more importance than data items data items are applied globally which is to be used in all the functions to make any changes in the functions may need to reschedule the Associated data values this affects the normal sequencing of the programming logic objectoriented programming the objectoriented programming increased the programmers productivity and overcome shortcomings of traditional approach of programming objectoriented programming does not allow data to flow freely from one function to another so that means it will be more secured one problem is decomposed into a number of entities called objects each object includes a set of data items and related functions data values are applicable within the functions associated with that object let us see the difference between procedure oriented programming and object oriented programming procedural programming language functions are more important than data but here in objectoriented programming stress put on data data can flow freely throughout the programming procedural programming but here in objectoriented programming data is restricted to be in the specific area wherever it is needed so it will be more secure as I told before here the topdown approach happens but in objectoriented programming bottomup approach in procedural programming language there is no access specifiers available so we will come to know about this access specifier in upcoming classes objectoriented programming has access specifier so that means which will tell whether you have access to that particular part of a program or not so there are some keywords for this but in crucial programming it is not there so procedural programming becomes very less secure objectoriented programming is more say pure were loading is not possible in procedural programming language here objectoriented programming overloading is possible you will also come to know what is overloading in upcoming classes examples for procedural programming see Visual Basic Fortran and R for objectoriented programming C++ Java Python and Exeter students I would like to tell you one thing when you learn any language in the beginning you have to follow the set of rules whatever is been told later you will come to know the definition for those things when you come to know the definition for those things it will be very easy to understand so in the beginning just follow the instructions given to you so after learning the language once again come back to the beginning and start revising so that now you will understand everything so clear students keep watching my video we will meet in the next video lesson where I will be describing you about basic concepts of objectoriented programming Thank You students
