foreign welcome back in this class we are going to see how operators behave on this for joining we use addition symbol for replicating we use multiplication symbol we can also have relational operators to compare the lists and also membership operator which is in and not in also works on lists let us see those in detail addition operator is used to join two or more than two lists all the elements of lists are added to a single list and being returned for example if we are having different lists one is called City other own State other one is called pin so now if I give CT plus State plus pin then I will be able to see a new list which is having all the lists together like this next replication so multiplication operator is used to replicate the elements of the list if n is the integer given with the list elements are replicated n times and a new list will be returned for example Tech is the list here if take into 2 is given and then all the elements are repeated twice next relation operator we can use any relational operators within two lists to compare after comparing it will return whether it is true or false for example here I have two lists compared with greater than symbol see it will compare the first element and the first element if both are different and then whichever is having the bigger value is greater so here 6 is greater than 1 so it is true next I have some strings here and then the same ring in small letter it starts with second list now when the strings are there it will check the ASCII value the first string first character capital A is 65 and small a is 97. so 97 is greater but here it is given as capital A that is 65 is greater there so it is false if the characters in the beginning are same wherever the character differs it will be comparing those characters if complete element is same and then it will check with the second element so similar way it will be returning whether true or false we will see this in detail with many examples while we run an ideally now again 630 is greater than 6 comma 5 see that first element in both the lists are same so the second element it checks 3 is smaller 5 is bigger so this is going to be false membership operators unlist in takes value and the sequence if the value is available in the list it will be returning true otherwise false similar way not in checks whether it is not there that means if it is not found in the list it will be returning true otherwise it will be false for example 5 in 1 2 3 4 5 6 that is a list so 5 is available there this will return true now ml not in e i m l n n d l see ml is available there here the operator used is not in so it is going to give false next one 8 in 5 10 15 20 is the list here so it is not available so it will be giving false let us execute everything in ideally so that we are very clear about all these I have a list here called L1 I will be giving some numbers here and then let me have L2 equal to some more numbers here let me give L1 plus L2 so it will be returning the list having all the values of both the lists if I want to store and this new list into another variable I can do that for that I can give L3 is equal to L1 plus L2 so now L3 will be the same list so now L2 multiplied with 3 so 3 times all the elements group of elements will be repeated that means 10 20 30 40 again 10 20 30 40 one more time 10 20 30 40. right now relational operators L1 is greater than l two see there l1's first value is 1 L 2's first value is 10. so L1 cannot be greater so it will be giving false now let me change the value of this to 10. you know how to change L1 of 0 is the index of 1 right so just I give that let me have 60 there okay so it will become 60 so if I see L1 6234 okay now I am giving L1 is greater than L2 so it is true 60 is greater than 10 right now let me give some string values in the list s is equal to a b c d m n o p q r now I have S1 is equal to a b C now if I compare s is greater than S1 see here it will be true as the first string both are different and then the first two letters are same but third letter is here C is there here it ends with B itself so definitely this is going to be greater so s is going to be greater than S1 it is going to be true let me insert one new value there in S1 S1 dot insert off I'll use 0 as the index number to insert and I will add here ABCD now if I see S1 a b c d a b so here a b c d and then s here ABCD both are same elements now it will check with this M and A so both are different right so a is smaller it will give yes one is smaller than yes so it is going to be true now let me add S1 first index insert of 1 comma x y z Now S1 is a b c d x y z s a b c d m n o so now here it is going to check with this and this so definitely X has the higher ASCII value than m so if I give s is greater than S1 it is going to be false now if both lists are same let me create S2 is equal to let me copy all the elements here so yes also same S2 also same now if I say yes 2 is greater than yes it is going to be false as both are equal now if I say yes to equality operator I use and then yes it is going to be true S1 is not equal to S is true now let us check S2 is not equal to yes but both are same right so it will be giving false so now let us check the membership operator S1 is here it is I give a value here x y z in S1 so it is available so it will be giving true if an element is not available in S1 say here op in S1 it is going to say false now I give PQ which is not available not in S1 so it is not there in S1 so it will be giving true this is how the membership operator works hope all the operators how it behaves in the lists of python are very clear let us meet in the next class we will discuss about the slicing in lists until then thank you bye
