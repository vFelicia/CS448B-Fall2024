welcome students in this video we are going to learn how to use nested for loop let us copy some codes from here so in next step follow we are going to learn how to print pattern so let us convert this as a simple for loop which is starting from 1 2 and then which is going to end when it is lesser than or equal to 5 so it is from small to big so it is increasing so it should be plus plus so now this is going to run 5 times and then when it becomes 6 it is false value so ultimately it comes out of the loop I am just removing this so now what it is going to do it is going to just leave a line it is not going to print anything file ends it is going to let us have another for loop here far in see already we have to use I so let us use another variable called j is equal to 1 and then when j is lesser than or equal to for example 3 and then J plus miss so here we are having a printing statement strung out dot print line now let us print this star symbol which is commonly used to form a pattern so how it is going to run even let us consider this as only 2 for B so when it is 1 it is true it is lesser than or equal to 2 it is going to the next farlow which is inside this so J is equal to one it is true it is going to print so then it is to this is again true it is going to print when it is three this is again true it is going to print then when it becomes four it is false so this will not get printed instruct that it is coming out of the loop where it can find on printing line statement nothing else so it is going to give a new line and then goes back to this far to make this as two so here it is two and then this is true now again it comes here as I said before it is going to print three times so how many times it is going to execute three times of this one time of outer for loop again the next time three time of this having this when it becomes three this becomes false so it will not run so it comes out of this loop totally it comes out so let us have here instead of print line only print so three stars continuously it is going to print side by side and then when it comes out it comes to a new line and then again it prints three times star so it is three x star below one more three x star so it is like a rectangle let us change this name instead compile I think this you can see three times start again the next line three times stop so in case of this is 5 and this is three so one time it runs three times like that it is going to complete 5 into 3 15 times so every 3 stars it is going to come out of this and then prints a new line so like that three stars horizontally and then five times vertically it is going to print so where this looks like column three times and then the five times it is going to be like rows so let us compare this let us run so you can see three times horizontally and then Phi times vertically so Phi look like five rows and then three is columns so here this outer loop is responsible for making number of rows this inner loop is to make columns in case if we have here three times then let us have here six times what it is going to have six stars horizontal it is going to print as it is in the print statement which is inside the inner loop and then after printing six times it gives a new line again it was two outer loop like that it is going to print totally three times which will look like three rows and then six columns see three rows and six columns in case this is five and then this is also five this is going to execute five times columns like that Phi times Phi rows so it becomes like a square this doesn't need to be from only one to five it can also be from five to one c5 and then when this greater than or equal to 1 so this is also going to run five times but it is opposite side so let us have as it is from bigger to smaller so this also will print five times again the same output is going to come that is five stars in rows and five stars in columns let us run this you can see five columns five rows here you learnt how to print that enough left angle R square let us see right angle triangle pattern let us consider this pattern which prints one star in Castro to star in second row three star in third row four star in fourth row and Phi star in fifth row so here the number of rows equal to number of columns let us consider this is one then lesser than or equal to 5 then as it is from small to big it is going to be plus plus every time I am repeating so that you will again event.listen and will become thorough in this so where j is 1 and then J is equal to 5 so which is 5 times again so 5 into 5 25 times the star is going to be printer and how it is you know that I times horizontal it prints and I go to next line items horizontally Prince Ferg like that it is going to repeat as we have seen this star pattern there as a rectangle triangle first row it prints only one column second row it prints 2 column third row three columns so that is number of rows equal to number of columns how to arrange that it is very simple just we are going to link this i to j is equal to j isn't it so we are going to make this as i it is very simple to see now when is 1 it comes here and then 1 and then this one isn't it so J is equal to 1 one time it prints this star then comes out of this goes to next line here this would have become 2 now so 2 means this is also 2 so 1 and then 2 times Stargate printer and then come to next Lane same like that when becomes 3 this becomes 3 so now 3 columns it prints comes to next line it becomes for it this also becomes 4 that is 4 columns it is going to print and comes to next slide like that last time 5 and then this also 5 it prints by 5th row 5 columns and comes out when it becomes 6 the condition is false so ultimately it comes out of this loop so that is it is coming out of the loop let us compile this turn this so you can see the triangle pattern now let us consider number pattern which is like this C 1 then here 2 2 times 3 3 times 4 4 times 5 items again it is same like this but instead of star it is a number so just little bit think about this what it is go back to the program see here you're printing star just instead of this we are going to have is printing statement C now what happens here is 1 and then it is true it comes here this is also 1 1 time it prints either is 1 it comes to next line this is 2 so 1 2 this is 2 it is going to print i value is values 2 in this loop right so 2 times it prints to then comes to next line again it becomes 3 here so it is 3 I 3 leaves 3 for this look so 3 3 3 it prints 3 times like that it is going to execute five times let us compare this so you can see that one two three four five like that in case you need a pattern like this for example 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 so just think about this what is this every time it changes is J here in the thing we are going to just modify this s J see now for first time of this J is equal to 1 it prints 1 then comes out this becomes 2 this is 2 then it prints 1 2 again next line it becomes 3 this is 3 so for first time it prints 1 second time of this two third time of this is 3 so like that five times it is going to say 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 Rogen's this doesn't need to be from only 1 to 5 this also can change as we need and then linking of this also can be changed as per the pattern we are going to print on the screen let us consider other one let us consider this type of pattern so here we have 5 times 5 and the next 4 times 4 3 times 3 and then so on so in case we are starting from the higher to lower level so then I will become Phi then I is greater than or equal to 1 then it is from bigger to smaller we must use here and then just we see here this is 5 this becomes 5 so 1 2 5 it will get executed as we are having here and then this becomes 4 this also becomes 4 so 1 2 4 it is going to ask you but here it we have to check what it is going to print so if J is going to be printed and then every time it changes or if it is going to print I means in a row it is going to be same thing here we have seen the same thing so let us have here only I see now that same pattern given so 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 1 in case we need another type of pattern 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 and 1 so let us consider this pattern so for that we need to print J here because every time it changes see it is very simple now 5 this is 5 so it is going to execute 1 2 5 so 1 2 5 it will print again then which becomes 4 this becomes 4 so it is going to print 1 2 4 like that compile so you can see 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 1 as we have seen here students I hope you learnt how to create patterns using this nested for loop in next session also we will see some more patterns keep watching my videos subscribe and like thank you
