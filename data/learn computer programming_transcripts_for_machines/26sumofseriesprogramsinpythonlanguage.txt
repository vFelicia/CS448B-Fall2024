hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to see how to find the sum of series the first series is nothing but the natural numbers up to n number or n terms we can say let us understand how it works 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus up to n we need a variable which will be initiated as 0 before totaling anything by default it should be starting as 0 so i initialize a variable called sum as 0 the series here starts from 1 and then ends at n n should be taken as a user input we need a for loop to start from 1 and then which ends at n if the user input is n it will be ending at n minus 1 so to make it to stop at n we need to give n plus 1 in the for loop so the for loop may be like this for i in range one comma n plus one now the range here is one two three four so that means ice value every time changes as one two three four we don't need to do anything just take this number and then add with the sum so we shall write sum is equal to sum plus i sum is a variable where the old sums value will be added with i every time the i changes the new number is added to the sum and then variable get updated as a new sub for your understanding here i have given the step by step process at the first round sum is 0 that is initiated before the for loop and then i is value now when it is entering it will be 1 sum is equal to sum plus i that is 0 plus 1 is equal to 1 this answer 1 is been taken as sum for the next round here by the time i's value will be 2 now new sum will be 1 plus 2 equal to 3 again the value of sum will become 3 so ice value is 3 and then sum is equal to 3 plus 3 6 so if you keep working like this the pattern clearly says sum plus i i have shown you for better understanding in red color i is 1 2 3 4 like that and then sum is every time it gets the new sum if you are clear with this concept and then future any type of sum you are doing it will be very easy so take a time bit and understand clearly let us go to python and create the program let us take the user input for n sum is equal to zero for i in range one comma n plus one sum is equal to sum plus i once it is done we will be printing the output outside the for loop let us execute this so let us consider 5 1 plus 2 is 3 plus 3 is 6 plus 4 is 10 plus 5 is 15 so the answer is supposed to be 15 it is right let me consider the next series here 2 plus 5 plus 8 up to n terms so the initial number is 2 and the next number is 5 the difference is 3 here again the next number 8 has the difference 3 as the initial number is 2 i will create one more variable called ini as 2 and then sum as usual it is 0 every time i take this sum it will be ini instead of i i will be counting the terms nothing else every time the new term gets formed by adding 3 to the old ini i will be giving here ini plus equal to 3 that means ini equal to ini plus 3 let us check this if i give 3 as the input that is 3 terms 2 plus 5 is 7 plus 8 is 15 answer is right hope you understood this if i need to print the series instead of the sum i will take this away i will get the user input that means the initial value also from the user some i don't need to have it instead of the constant value 3 let me take even that from the user let the variable for the differences d we copy this and paste below enter the difference so i shall print value now as ini and then if i need to print in the same line i take the help of end equal to with one command space this i won't be required and every time we need to add d instead of this 3 so i add this here let us execute this i need 5 terms to ls initial value and then 8 as the difference so 12 20 28 36 44 is write series with 5 terms now i have a new series to find the sum initial value is 1 then 4 then 9 then 16. if you see the common difference it is not there so what else it can be try this 1 squared 2 square 3 square 4 square then it shall be similar like the first program number of terms let it be initial value is not required and then sum supposed to be zero in range n plus 1 is right we shall take the sum plus equal to i into i so that is 1 into 1 2 into 2 3 into 3 every time it will be adding it to the sum when we need to print we shall print it outside the for loop print sum of series sum let me execute this i need 3 terms it is 14 so 1 plus 4 is 5 plus 9 is 14. now let us consider this term 1 by x plus 2 by x plus 3 by x plus until n so for n already there is a input statement we need x so let us take x is equal to value for x see 1 by x 2 by x 3 by x so in the numerator it is nothing but i in the denominator that is x so just divided by x we give it is so simple to understand let us run this let us give the easy number to calculate manually and check it i give 4 terms x let it be just 2 the sum is 5.0 1 by x that is 1 by 2 that is 0.5 plus 2 by 2 will become 1 plus 3 by 2 become 1.5 plus 4 by 2 will become 2 so the answer is 5.0 here also when we are calculating manually then it is right if this is x by 1 x by 2 x by 3 x by 4 and so on it is very simple we need to just change the denominator and numerator numerator is x and the denominator is i here again let me take 4 and then here as 8 this says 16.666 let us manually do this 8 by 1 is 8 8 by 2 is 4 8 by 3 is 2.66 or let us give like 8 by 3 plus 8 by 4 is 2 so this answer should be equal to the answer we got from the program it is same let us consider now 2 by x plus 4 by 2 x plus 6 by 3 x and then so on the denominator is 1 2 3 multiplied by x the numerator is 2 times of it so if you are understanding the pattern of the series then it is very simple to solve this so in the numerator we can put i into 2 i is going to be 1 2 3 4. see now you check 1 into 2 2 into 2 3 into 2 and then so on divided by x 2 x 3 x so that is again i into x so this is 1 x 2 x of x 3 x of x and so on you need to remember one thing here this multiplication and division both are having the same operator precedence this will be done from left to right so that is i will be multiplying into 2 divided by i then it will be multiplied by x we will write it in the bracket similarly the denominator also in the bracket let us run this i give 3 terms easy to calculate and then 5 as the value it is 1.200 let us calculate 2 divided by 5 plus 4 divided by 10 will be 0.4 plus 6 divided by 15 6 divided by 15 so here also we are getting the right answer so far we have done this series which were not having any powers now we are having a series which is having a power that is x squared by 1 plus x squared by 2 plus x square by 3 and then so on now we can understand that denominator is i so we can change this as i and the numerator if you see x square so we can give here x to the power 2 we can use the power operator that is star and star x square by 1 then x square by 2 x square by 3 it is so simple to understand let us run this i'll give just 4 and the x value let me take as only 2 8.333 it comes let us manually calculate and verify it 2 square is 4 so 4 divided by 1 is 4 plus again 4 by 2 is 2 plus 4 by 3 that is 1.333 let us give like as it is 4 by 3 iq plus 4 by 4 that is 1 so it is verified next here you can see x by 1 minus x square by 2 plus x cube by 3 and then up to x to the power n divided by n the pattern here every time the even numbers term has minus in front of it the odd number has plus so we need to check whether it is even or odd if it is r then we will have plus otherwise we can give minus let us check this here if imod 2 is equal to 0 then it is even element we should be subtracting it so sum minus equal to the term is x by 1 x square by 2 x cube by 3 that means x to the power i then divided by i otherwise else let me have the semicolon and the indent do not forget this now the same thing but we will have plus change this as plus let us run i will give four terms and the value of x again i will use only two i get minus 1.3333 let us check manually x is 2 2 divided by 1 is 2 and then minus x square by 2 that is 4 by 2 will be 2 next plus x cube that is 8 divided by 3 let us put this in the bracket then now minus x to the power 4 that is 16 16 divided by 4 this is nothing but 4 we are getting the right answer let me have the new series here x by 2 plus x square by 4 plus x cube by 6 so on here always it is plus so we don't need to check whether it is odd or even terms i will remove all this now if you see the numerator is x x to the power 2 x to the power 3 so that means x to the power i so it is same as it is here and then if you see the denominator it is 2 4 6 that is i into 2 we need to put this in the bracket so this is that here the pluses missing let me check now i give three terms and then five is my value i get 29.58333 let me just check giving the values 5 by 2 is 2.5 plus 5 to the power 2 is 25 divided by 4 i put that in the bracket plus x cube that is 5 cube is 125 divided by 6 yeah this is right let us consider a new type of series one exclamatory mark to exclamation mark and then keeps going up to n exclamatory mark is nothing but factorial symbol for factorial is exclamation mark product of all positive integers which are lesser than or equal to n is n factorial then generally it is written n factorial is equal to n into n minus 1 into n minus 2 into up to 1 for example 4 factorial is equal to 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 5 factorial we can calculate also in reverse that is 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 into 5 the calculation can be in any way but the result is important let us understand first how do we find the factorial of a number if we see the sum of series the first series it was 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus up to n the factorial is nothing but replacing this plus into multiplication if we see the series which is needed to be find the sum now it is 1 factorial plus 2 factorial plus 3 factorial so every time you are finding the product of 1 1 into 2 here 1 into 2 into 3 the next will be 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 so up to n you will be finding so every time you are taking the product of that number and then you are adding also so the code may be like this f always we use as 1 as default and then sum is 0 for i in range it is same 1 to n plus 1 f is equal to f into i otherwise we can say f into equal to i see every time this will be finding the product of up to this number just we will take every time the sum of that it becomes sum of each term let me elaborate little more so first f is 1 i is 1 f is equal to 1 into 1 becomes 1 and then sum becomes 0 plus 1 is equal to 1. so here this one is here now when i is 2 the factorial will be already 1 so 1 into 2 is equal to 2 the sum is 1 here that is added with 2 now it is 3 the next round when i is 3 the factorial is 2 already now this 2 into 3 is equal to 6 and then 3 plus 6 is equal to 9 so the previous sum is added with this current factorial similar way it keeps going now 6 into 4 24 old sum and the new factorial has been added let us modify the program to get the sum of the series i do not need this x i remove this with this i need f and then some f is by default 1 here i am adding f into equal to i then every time i take the sum of f here let us execute this i give 5 here the answer is 153 1 factorial is 1 2 factorial is 2 3 factorial is 6 4 factorial is 24 5 factorial is 120 so this is verified now let us consider a new series with the factorial so that is x by 1 factorial plus x to the power 2 by 2 factorial plus x to the power 3 by 3 factorial and so on here we need the value for x let us write the statement again x is equal to into input of enter the value for x in the numerator x to the power i is given correct so we will write inside the bracket x to the power i let us execute this i just give three terms the value of x let it be just two the sum is 5.333 let us calculate manually x is 2 and then divide by 1 factorial is 1 so it is 2 plus x to the power 2 is 4 divided by 2 is 2 x to the power 3 is 8 divided by 3 factorial is 6 so we will give here 8 by 6 the output of the program is verified let us see the last one 1 by 1 plus 1 plus 2 by 1 into 2 then the third term is 1 plus 2 plus 3 divided by 1 into 2 into 3 so up to n terms if you see now in the numerator it is sums of all the numbers up to current number of term similarly in the denominator it is product that is nothing but factorial so we need to take the sum also the factorial both and then again we need to divide both we don't need this x let us take it away to take the sum of numerator again i need one more variable let me initialize that as s as 0 now i need to take s plus equal to i so every time it takes the numerator as that particular top now the grand sum will be s by f let us run and verify i give just three terms three point five is the answer one by one the first term is one plus 1 plus 2 is 3 and then 1 into 2 is 2 so 3 by 2 let me put this in the bracket plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 is 6 and then 1 into 2 into 3 6 so 6 by 6 will be 1 3.5 it is verified hope the concept is clear and all these programs we have seen keep watching this channel keep learning and also keep sharing so that others also benefit from these videos
