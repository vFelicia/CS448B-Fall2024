welcome back students today I am going to teach you more about farlap so that we will be very good in using far loop or even some theory questions are there in part a that is section here you will be able to answer perfectly I will teach that throw the previous program itself we already know that there are three expressions in the for loop that is one first is initialization next is the test condition and then whether it is incrementing or decrementing are you can say step value so now if you see this is equal to 10 which we have initialized the value so this can be there are else without this also we can do but it can be done before the for loop itself for example is equal to 10 as I am given previously so you can have the initialization in the farlow other ways before itself you can have and then this also will run let's just run this and check semicolon compile so we could see that it is running perfectly the second one I am going to tell you is about the step that is increment or decrement so even this we can skip in the far loop so instead of here we can give that inside the loop itself so we can say that is I whether it is going to be here or here it doesn't make any difference so even now this is acceptable so every time it decreases after printing the statement and this also runs so you can see that again goodra okay now let us consider so when there is a step condition that is increment or decrement and then even this is here itself but we are not giving any test condition here so what it is so if there is no step condition then what it is going to happen it is not going to test any condition so this low loop is going to be infinite loop so it is not going to come outside of the loop and then it will keep on printing the same thing again and again without any limiter so this is called infinity loop so when there is infinite loop then the statement cannot be outside of the loop so because that becomes unreachable statement so let us delete this otherwise I will show compile so it shows unreachable statement so let us delete this and then let us run so it is going to be infinity without ending now syntax error rightly so you can see that it is not at all ending so how to stop this we can click on this and then here you can go and stop this otherwise control shift and re if we press it is going to stop the java virtual machine you can right click and then reset java virtual machine so it stops now so then you can close otherwise you won't be able to close this so next now we are going to see here we do not give anything in this look so this also can be without initialization and even without increment decrement then when there is no condition it is going to be infinity loop so we do not have any more in the farlow just all these are empty in the sense there is no expression given so we are going to print ie so let us initially sense just five so this is also going to be a infinity loop compare this see there the five is keep on going but we can't see the difference as it is the same number repeating again and again so let us stop this now I'm going to tell one more example for infinity look so for example I if I give is equal to 10 then is going to be say than or equal to 10 okay and then I'm going to you I only see here this is is going to be lesser than or equal to 10 so I use initialize it as 10 so it is true and then it becomes one less after printing this it becomes one less so it becomes nine and then that is also a lesser than 10 then prints then eight seven six all these are lesser than ten even it goes eight also lesser than ten so there is no limit for going the minus side so this also becomes infinity loop when the test expression always true compile this so you can see as before it is keep on and I mean let us stop this so let us have here greater than or equal to one so from ten to one it is going to run now so the last one thing I am going to list you look without any body statement this is called empty loop where we don't have any action to perform what it is going to do just it is going to delay the time if we give in a big numbers it will surely delay some time so for example we can you let us have thousand as it is empty body it is not going to execute anything but it is just going to delay for some kind okay one more thing I will tell about Fargo so let us have this s10 and then printing statement here so we have declared until now we have declared this before the Fargo pizza this declaration also can be done inside the for loop so let us have here in is equal to temp so here we have declared in PI and that also initialized this also can be done using Fargo students I hope you learnt more about follow so which will be very useful for you to do any type of program Thank You students subscribe and like if it is helpful for you so please watch my next video where I am going to explain about nested for loop for creating pattern
