welcome back students we will continue learning arrays we will learn passing array as an argument getting length of an array and out of bounds exception in our a I will demonstrate passing array as an argument to a program passing array u+ passing array I create a method static wide passing as array name and then I will give thee integer array to pass so in name of the array IQs EI and are a symbol here I am not supposed to give size of the array because when it receives array elements automatically it will assign the length of the array we can give the array values in the arguments itself so after giving the values let us sum up all the values in that array so I need a variable to sum int sum is equal to zero as initial value so we need to take each and every element from that array so what we can do we can give a far loop far from 0th index whatever is stored up to the last index we have to take all the elements to sum so int I is equal to zero I assume we are going to do five elements is lesser than five so that is 0 1 2 3 & 4 I plus plus to get the sum and you sum is equal to sum plus 1/2 I I terminate this so it will take element from 0th element to the last element that is fourth element then I will print the sum after the loop plus some let me compile this no syntax error when I give the value for that array I must give inside the flower bracket so as I assigned five elements so I will give one two three four five each separated with commas okay here I have given loop variable will go up to five iterations but in case you said use less or more what happens let us see again let us run this now I give just three elements one two three okay so you can see it has come back to the program and it shows Java dot landed array index out of bounds exception this error happens when the loop tries to get the element which is not available in the array so that means we have given only three elements that is 0 1 & 2 when it is trying to get the third element from the arrey it is not available so ultimately it shows out of bounds exception so we should match number of iterations in the loop to the last index of that array in this case we were not knowing the length of that array so at that time we can take the length of array by using length function to find the length of array we write name of the array dot length and we terminate for example if we have array called arr then we initialize the value like this to find the length of this we can write a RR dot length and then we terminated if we wanted to store this length in a variable then we can initialize the variable int L is equal to because the length is in integer ARR dot length so ultimately length of the terrain will be stored in where you will call yell here in the example we have eight elements so L will be eight let us go back to the program so now here we can have one more variable called length and then we initialize this as y l is equal to PA is the name of the array dot l yi ng th then we terminate so ultimately the length of the array given is stored in Y n so we will new instead of constant here we will give L so now no matter how much our element is given there in the argument it is taken so let us run this now I do 6 elements 1 2 3 4 5 & 6 okay so it could show the result now I will demonstrate another program where we take the input from the user further array and then we pass that array to the other method maybe the same method so to take the input I will have import Java dot IO dot star and then determine it so I will have another method static wide input off as we have imported IO class I will give throws IO exception so let me declare first the integer array variable I will take it as class variable static int array called B so is equal to new int of maybe size 10 now to take input let us create the bufferedreader object a new input stream reader of system dot in then we cross terminate we will prompt the user system dot out dot print line now we say input 10 integer array element to take ten elements I will have farlow in is equal to zero is lesser then we can give a lesser than ten otherwise lesser than B dot length then I plus plus now even if we change the value of this also not a problem so I give now four so again we don't need to change here as lesser than four or not so better always we will say the length here in the Farlow so let us assign the value B of I is equal to integer dot parse in half BR dot read line off so now this method takes the elements for the array called B now we will pass this value to this method how we will write the main method public static void main have string of arguments then we will say throws IO exception so we have to create object for that class so class name passing array and then object obj obj is equal to new pas si ng passing array ah so now I will call the methods first I will call the method which is input method so that we will take the input for that array B so I will write obj dot input off now I will call passing method so obj dot passing half see here I have taken values for array B I will pass this value to the method here so I write here B then terminate let us again change this to ten itself now compile this no syntax error we have to run the main method so it is asking 10 inputs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then 10 we already know it will be 55 so let us check whether it is right or wrong so sum of all the elements given array is 55 students I hope it is very clear to you how to pass array as I argument we will continue in the next session until then thank you students
