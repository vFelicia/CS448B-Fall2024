welcome back students today we are going to see how to do string programs so in that we will see count the number of words in a sentence and print the initial of the name to take the input let us import the package we are going to write the program to count the number of words in the sentence so class throws IO exception let us create the variables we need string variable strname the user then to count we need intercom when we need to count we have to give the initial value as 0 so that counting always starts from 0 let us create the object for the bufferedreader class instead of creating object for the input stream reader and then bufferedreader object we can also create in this way so that is bufferedreader BR is equal to nu buffered reader of new input stream reader then system dot in so again we close this so we can do it in 2 statement differently other ways we can also do using this type of statement they are given a space here that should not be there so let us prompt the user to you the input and sentence so we can you print instead of pretty so now assigning the input STR is equal to BR dot you know that each word is separated by the space so after ever there will be a space if we count the space then this word is being counted same like that we will keep on counting the number of space but at last when we see there won't be a space given by the user so at that time what we do we add one more space after getting the input from the user but by mistake user also gives the space after the full stop then what we can do we can trim it using trim function so that the extra spaces before and after the sentence will get trimmed so let us give here dot trim off now what we do STR is equal to STR plus one space the ad now we go to the condition inside the form we will create the far loop far int I is equal to zero I is lesser than STR dot length of I plus plus so if character at the disk is tr not STR dot character at ie is equal to equal to so character type should be given in Sidney single quotation so we check for one single space then what we do we increase the counter count plus plus we increase by one so until the last index it will keep on doing after it becomes false it will come out of the Farlow so we will print the number of count here plus count in case if we give this inside this Farlow then it will print every time it counts we do not need that let us compile this no syntax error Java is very interesting so we have four words here so number of words in a sentence for let us create another class initials I will copy the code from the previous one so this is programmed to print the initials of the given so here I change the class name we are not going to count anything here so let me delete this and then enter your name with first middle and last name so we don't need to trim here so here we want to print the first character of every name given so first character means we can count the space after that the next character we can take but when the user gives the input there will not be space in the beginning what we do here is going to add the space before the string so let us delete this and then I am going to add here now the character after the space we are going to extract and then take it as a new word so for the new word I give a new variable string variable str1 so initially it should be without any value so now I give the Farlow is lesser than st r dot length off the high plus plus so I am going to give the condition if st r dot character at i is equal to equal to i am checking for space so one single quark then one space everywhere so if it is so then i am going to add to the next letter to the string 1 st r1 is equal to str dot character at i plus 1 so i is space the plus 1 is the next character so it will extract the next character here this is added with the new string str1 just now let us print the new string in shells of given name except our given name plus str 1 so let us close the method and cross the class compare this no syntax error so when you come see Krishna look see vkg has come we have not given any extra character that so we can assign here a full stop there so we can add with this plus dot otherwise 1 space so compile this right computer designing so you can see see ad students I hope you learned how to do these two programs let us do more programs in coming video tutorials until then thank you one by
