welcome back everyone in this class we are going to see the another jump statement which is continue statement continuous statement in for loop let us consider the general code here for variable in sequence statement 1 so if the variable is available in the sequence statement 1 compulsorily get executed if condition then continue statement outside the if condition there is a statement 2 and also statement 3 outside the for loop statement 4 is there when this if condition becomes true the continue statement is here it lets again continue the loop instead of going to the statement 2 and statement 3 so in this way the statement 2 and statement 3 are skipped and then it continues to the loop again when the condition is evaluated as false then it will be executing statement 2 and 3 also when the loop is completed normally it will go to the statement 4 and executes let us understand this using the example program i give for i in range 12 comma 20 i just print in the loop and also i print i here outside this loop i will be printing print loop completed let me introduce the continuous statement with condition if i mode 2 equal to 0 that means when it is divisible by 2 it will continue to the loop without printing it so only odd number is going to be printed so i give continue here let us execute this so you could see that it printed 13 15 17 19. in the loop it is printed every time but only the number is not printed when the loop completed it came out of the loop and printed loop completed here continuous statement in while loop it is almost similar while condition the statement one if condition continues there statement 2 and statement 3 outside the loop statement 4. when the condition becomes true it continues to the while loop and then statement 1 is executed again statement 2 and 3 are skipped whenever the condition is false then it will execute statement 2 and 3 also when normally while loop get completed it comes to the statement 4 which is outside the loop let us also execute an example program for this now for while loop i will first initialize the variable x is equal to 12 while x is lesser than 20 print x now i will increase the value of x by 1 plus equal to 1 outside the loop i print loop completed let me execute this so all the numbers are printed here now i give the continue statement if x mode to equal to 0 continue see when it is even number it is not going to print x it is going to continue well but when it is even number when it enters inside the if the increment is not done so it continues with the same number it becomes nonstopable loop or infinity loop so what i do i just take this from here and then add it to the beginning of this now it will start from 13 otherwise we can make this as 11 so now it becomes 12 and then it starts let us execute this you could see 13 15 17 19 and then loop completed so this is how the jump statements work to skip some code inside the loop hope the concept is clear keep practicing thank you
