welcome back students today we will learn some array programs to print only even elements from an array to print some of even elements and add elements to print the count of even and odd elements to print smallest number and largest number from an array let us create a program print even import Java dot IO dot star class interval let me declare an array integer type name of array ARR half is equal to new in tough I will new size as 10 prompt the user to take ten elements I will give a far loop in is equal to zero is less up then we can say a RR dot Flint then I plus plus so ARR of I is equal to integer dot pass in top BR dot feel enough then we terminate this so now we have taken input for that array so that is ten elements we have taken now let us give a line outside the loop saying following our even elements so system dot out dot print line now so now we have to check the elements one by one whether the element is even or not to access each element again we will give a far loop let us copy the same Farlow we already know how to find even numbers if the number is divisible by two that is without remainder then we say the number is even number so to get the remainder we will use percentage symbol that is modulus let us give that in the condition ARR of I modulus two equal to equal to zero so it divides by two and gets the remainder if remainder is zero then what we will do we will print the element so system dot out dot print line off this a a of sorry ARR of I tablet if you need the elements to be printed in the same line we can cancel this and then we can add 1 comma R space with this so I will add one space here so let us compile this no syntax error so you enter ten elements forty five three seven eighty four 96 12 15 17 21 18 so we can see here only given numbers our printer now program to get the sum of even number and sum of odd number so I will you some even called as a class name so before this I will import Java dot IO dot star rest of the code I will copy from the previous program so even we can copy from here to here we don't need this line let us delete this so after entering all the numbers we will again have a far low if it is even number we will add it to even some so for that we need a variable even for our sum we need a variable so let us give int sum of even equal to zero in Chevy then sum of art also zero initially now we have already checked whether it is even or not if it is even we will add with this sum of even so yes II equal to AC plus ararar I otherwise we can also give plus equal to here plus equal to and then else otherwise sum of odd plus equal to a or our half right so then we close this further see if it is true that is even number then it will add with the sum of even otherwise it should be odd number automatically it will add with this variable so now we have to print the sum of even and some are some of even numbers from given array plus yes II so here are number so this will be yes so now we will close the method and then class just compile this no syntax error to check the right result I will give the sequence of number just I will you 1 2 3 only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 so even numbers total is 30 and odd numbers total is 25 you can check next we will learn counting number of even elements and number of odd elements so count even order you I will copy whole program from the previous program here instead of taking the sum of even numbers and sum of odd numbers just we are going to count so let us change the variable name count even number then count odd number so initially the count is zero for both so if this is true then what we will do we will just increase the count of even number c plus plus else what we will do we will increase the count of odd number co plus plus so now we are going to print number of even numbers of given array that is C oh sorry see e here number of odd numbers of given array that is C let us change the class name and you count compile this no syntax error let us run this any number let us give eleven fifteen eighteen twenty forty sixty five 7103 11 30 let us count one two three four five six or odd numbers so remaining four will be even numbers now program to find the smallest and largest element of that array I will copy again the code from the previous one I will copy ant in this I will change the class name they are just smallest let us have double type of array so I will change this double again here also double so instead of counting here I will have the smallest element and the largest element so again I will change even the datatype of this smallest also will be smallest our largest also will be double type itself so double instead of C largest and then here smallest so we cannot initiate as 0 in case the user gives negative numbers so it cannot be 0 so I will take an element from array itself so let us take just first element itself this ARR of 0 that is index same like that smallest also let us take first elements itself ararar 0 now I will give the condition to find the largest element of that array it takes all the element of that array that is ARR of I and then if it is greater than largest sometimes it is also possible to be same number so we will give greater than or equal to also so if this is true I will assign the element to the variable largest so largest is equal to a half I now I close the far look so now I will search for smallest one so again we will have the same look now we are going to find the smallest one so we will have lesser than or equal to smallest so if it is true the element will go to smallest now let us print the largest and smallest elements so I copy this largest element is plus not just so here smallest element is smallest let us close the with that cross the class compile this we have done a mistake here while typing the variable it should be capital L here not from the capital L let us check here you have given capital so here also should be capital so we should be very careful while writing this then okay so here we have given double but in the previous program it was integer so let us change this double here also double any other error let us compile and check no syntax error now so I entered 10 elements 31 point zero one minus sixty three point one two forty five thirty nine point four seven zero point two zero zero two eighty five point zero zero four five eleven point one one one one one thirty seven forty eight point two three point four so we can see here the largest number which I have given at the last the least number is minus sixty three point one two so it is right dear students I hope it was very clear to you how to do all these four programs this are only just ideas you can create your own programs keep watching my videos learn more thank you students
