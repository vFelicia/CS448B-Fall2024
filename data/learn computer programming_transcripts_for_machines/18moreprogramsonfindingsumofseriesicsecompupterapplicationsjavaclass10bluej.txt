welcome students today we are going to learn some of series program using Farlow we are going to see the following series this series we have already done so we are going to see how to find the sum of the series here you can see the changes instead of plus here you can see so again here it is plus and then here it is instead of class it is minus so from this you can find the even number whenever it is there before that it is minus so you are going to subtract the answer of the e1 term and the odd term the answer of that autumn you are going to add until X to the power Y n so it may be plus or minus at last so whenever it is changing we are going to give a condition for adding our subtraction so let us go to the program this was the program which we have done in previous tutorial so let us have this modifications what we wanted to do so before finding the sum only we are going to change so if to find the odd term that is odd number we can have the condition I mode so that is y is going to be divided by 2 if the remainder is 1 then it is going to be our top so it will do plus else it is going to be even so that is two more two that is going to be zero we have to give here relational operator that is two times equal to then here sum is equal to sum minus y so this simple condition will change the subtraction or addition according to the term compile this I will just run and show you you can check manually whether the answer is correct or shrunk for few terms so let us have X is 3 and then NS for terms so you could see some is equal to minus 0.375 so this is very simple one here in the numerator all these are only constant that is 1 and the denominator the powers are all constant which is 2 and then the number only it is changing as I so this is 1 2 3 and so on up to Y n so let us go to the program again so here we are not going to take any input for X up to the Ultem we are taking so let us cancel this X and then we are not going to have this Y and factorial that F 1 so this is not required here so this is going to be some now some is equal to some plus so what is going to be 1 divided by math to the power that is ie to the power to the two is constant power was the constant one then this we don't need see here one by math dot power of I comma 2 so these conditions are not required so that's all it is very simple program then compel this no syntax error so let us find just for two so it is going to be one point two five let us go to the next some of series here you can see in the numerator it is all X which is a constant here it was one here it was X so X we are going to take as a user input and then here you can see here up to n term so but the term here it is not continuous like one two three four that is like I so young term you need so that is one two Unterman that I loop may be one too young but here the starting number is changing and then every time the difference is three here you can see the difference here 3 2 plus 3 is 5 5 plus 3 is 8 so we need 2 variable which is 4 I and then which is for this both going to change and then X is going to be a constant 1 so let us go and modify the program there so this is in P n n time it is going to run and then M is the other variable which is going to increase every time 3 but it is starting from 2 let us give here itself we know how to you multiple variables in so we just you comma here we can have em as the next variable and then it starts from 2 so it is increasing every time by 3 so we can give comma M is equal to M plus 3 other ways we can you M plus equal to 3 so we have assigned denominator here we need a numerator which is X which is going to be user input so it is int X so here let us change the formula in the numerator it is going to be X and the denominator going to be simply M so X the value given in the Neum is at the first time it is to the next time it is going to be 5 the third time it is going to be 8 and like so on up to the term which is given by the user here I want to tell you one more thing when this is integer and this is also integer when it get divided by a number it may have decimal points so it should be a double so we can explicit here by giving the data type forcefully to convert into a double double compare this let us run this soyoung's value maybe three time terms then the value of x is going to be 4 so 3 point 3 is the answer so please calculate and confirm whether it is true or not let us see the next series now here we can see 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 see we already know what is the factor factory loss 1.1 into 2 plus 1 into 2 into 3 that was the factorial so instead of factorial here it is plus so instead of doing F is equal to F into ie you will do that variable is equal to variable plus I so that's a so let us change here you should have n term and then we don't need this and this M so I is equal to 1 is lesser than or equal to n I plus plus so here one more variable let us go in yes so let yes is equal to I plus yes so what it does is initially 1 so this less is initial has a default value when it is adding so 1 plus 0 1 so the next time that 1 then 1 plus 2 so that is 3 then 3 plus times that it is 4 so every time it is going to take the sum of this one and then the sum so it is going to be yes here see now what it will do 1 then that is become some then here 1 plus 2 it is going to be 3 so that 3 plus 1 is going to be some 4 so let us compile this so let us have two terms to this for if it is three terms then four plus one plus two plus three so that is going to be ten let us run that also three times it is ten the last one which we are going to see is 1 plus 1 plus 2 by 1 into 2 that is factorial here here which we have seen already here this one so below it is going to be a factorial upper thing going to be instead of factorial it is going to be plus here it is 1 so that is 1 by 1 it is going to be 1 only so we have to introduce the numerator and denominator separately and then we will do this so I'll let this yes be numerator as we have already calculated that numerator and then this denominator be D is equal to D into I so that is going to be factorial so instead of F we have given D so that it should be initialized into D is equal to 1 say this is going to be factorial this is going to be additional value so here what it is going to be there yes by D then this here again explicit double so how many times maybe four times so the answer is this Thank You Florence please watch my channel then you can subscribe this is what free
