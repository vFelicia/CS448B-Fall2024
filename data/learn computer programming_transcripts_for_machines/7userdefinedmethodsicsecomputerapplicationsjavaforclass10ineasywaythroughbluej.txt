welcome students until now we were using main method which is a standard method so that was public static fly me up string aft arguments now we will see the definition of each one so let us first consider this public so public is an access specifier this can be either public or private our protocol these specifiers determine the type of access to the function that means these keywords decides whether a method in a class can be used are invoked by another method in another class our subclass we can write public or private our prototype even without this also we can create a method when we don't give any of these three keywords then it is called default access specified the next keyword is static so static is a modifier other modifiers are final native transient and volatile method becomes a static method when we use a keyword called static even we can declare variables also using static keyword then it becomes static variable static methods also called class methods because these methods can be called without creating an object of that class that we will see later of this session so the next keyword is wild so public static void so what is a return type when it is not returning any value in struct this void we can use any of the datatype two data types so maybe interare maybe double so when we have these keywords then that it is going to return any data value which is mentioned that for that we have to specify return at the end after next comes main main is the name of the method then off so now here it isn't the third prototype if you need we can also add public from liquid so it becomes public static void main of instead of this main we can have any name so that it is an identifier for example I say calc so here tank is the name of this method which is going to return a double value and then it is a static method it is having access pissfilled as public next let us write the course what we need scanner will be JS for the new kind of system bottom and then let us say some variables before this into X Y and then double this difference difference this is to calculate the difference between two numbers so let us figure the printing statement to the out inclined off I guess number let us create a method but X is equal to all these a duck next point off and I will now protecting string back out back x ID here is a mistake it sister hold back print kind of health and no y is equal to obj dot next winter so now we are going to see the difference depth is equal to X minus y so let us print this system out print difference is equal to this so here you are we have given the output using the printing statement solar does not have double instead of this let us have wild so when it is not returning anything so we will let see further how it is going to written so let us compare this no syntax error we are running this wide calc off so enter a number so difference do you got it in double so let us clear this close and then now I will teach you how it is going to return so let us consider double here so we know that difference is a double rate so in stock this statement we will write return so what it is going to return is diff let us compare this no syntax errors so now the output will be in a dialog box so enter a number so you can see that a dialog box appears which returned here as double data type then 8000 point 0 as a difference let us close this so now let me explain about the theorem a test which we give in the method so let us not have this and then we are not taking any input from the user using scanner class so let us not have all this and then you one get us not have please so now we can see very simple program public static double Kalka the input from the parameter so even the x and y is also not required here so we are going to MU the parameter here so when we give here the variable with its data type we are going to give so for how it space X so this is one variable and then when we knew the variable in the parameter list we have to again give the variable though it is same I again we have to say ink and then but but this will not work with X comma Y if you do it will not work so this is the way to give X and one so what so we have given here two variables that is as a parameter so let us consider this program and then it is also returning which is a double type then the working is calculating the difference close to compile so now you can see a dialog box where it is asking in text and employed let us give here what is X and then Y is okay so it has returned a double data type which is minus four five three seven five eight point zero so this is the way of taking input using parameter and then getting the return in case if we have some other data type for example we say bullet boolean so just we are taking any age just let us consider as late so age it is taking and then what it is going to return means it must return boolean data type so let us have pool in yeah just for an example and then if Y is greater than or equal to 60 here we are checking whether given is seen yes it is are not so let us not have this so if it is greater than a we say m is important too is M is going to be false so what it is going to return here is yeah see now if the condition is true you're miss going to be true otherwise it is going to be false what it is going to return yam so young here is a boolean type so we are having boolean type as a returns here let us compile this no syntax error right click so we say different so it is not a senior citizen so it says boolean false so now let us see how this static works it does not have this study here and then let us not even have publish here so now if we compile this see there is no syntax errors let us run when static is not that we need an object so it will ask for you to create an object so oh it is asking create object so name of the app the default by default sir it has come just with you okay so we can see here a red box which is an object right click on this now you run this boolean calc intier it asks for the value so 85 if I you it returns true it is a senior citizen so one more thing I wanted to tell you are not the same time we can print and as well as we can take a return from the that how we can use some de system duck over in China so we are every citizen okay this let it be in true when it is truly we say inside so let it be here and then when there is more than one statement under if so we must open the block of statement so let us have this so else we are going to say false so we are not not a senior citizen however it is returning the value okay so he has putting statement X also there and then returning values also complain we have not terminated so so now there is no syntax errors let us run this program so you say 45 okay see you are not a senior citizen it is printed here and as well as we will see that it will turn see it is they get close one more thing I will tell you if this printing statement comes at last anything you after the return statement that is this for example on giving so after that is a return statement so that I told already return statement will be a last statement in line with that if we give this waterbugs let us see compile so it says untreatable statement so we have to do any printing segment if we need that should be before the return string Thank You students I hope you learnt the user differing the method and then all the keywords why do we use in the method prototype let us see in the next class thank you
