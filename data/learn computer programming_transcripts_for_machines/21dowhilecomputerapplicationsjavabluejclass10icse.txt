welcome back students in this session we are going to learn dowhile loop we will see how it is working and syntax of dowhile loop and then we will do a small program that is finding multiples of given number this dowhile loop also used when we doesn't know the number of times to be executed in free hand there is one main difference between far loop while loop and this dowhile loop far loop and while loop checks the condition before going to the body of the loop and then it runs if only it is true in dowhile loop it is not like that whether the condition is true or not the body of the loop get executed and then at last the condition is being checked so even the condition is false it will run once so here far loop and a while loop both checks the condition in the beginning so it is called entry control loop and dowhile checks the condition at last so it is called exit control loop let us see the syntax of dough in wig you do and then we open the bracket statements are written here and then we close here the condition is given after while keyword and then it is terminated using semicolon where we are not doing in far loop and while loop this is the syntax of while loop let us create a program throw that I will explain it class do well so I have public static void line off I initialize a variable Cali int I as one then do we have here body of the loop I just print one line system dot out dot print line now we are learning though while loop so later we give the condition here while the condition here is when I is greater than or equal to five so here you can see is initialized as one and the condition here is greater than or equal to five which is false though it is false without considering any condition it jumps into the body of the loop as it is do while loop and then later at last it is going to check whether it is true or not later when it finds as false it is going to stop see we have to terminate this in case if it is true again it is going to execute from the beginning that whole body of the loop let us compile this no syntax error so you can see we are learning dowhile loop in case if we do here condition is lesser than or equal to five and then we give here I plus plus so it is going to increment after printing this then you will checks it becomes two that is true and then it is going to execute so it will execute five times like this compile so you can see this is one is previous output and then five are outputs you can see here let us modify this to get the multiples of number so I am giving here in M multiple and then how many times we have to run int n so we are going to have a multiples we can say I into gam and then I is going to be incremented every time then up to how many times n times compile this no syntax error let us run this so multiples of maybe five how many times maybe twelve times so you can see 12 times multiples of five dear students I hope you might have learned do I look very well keep on watching my videos to learn more Thank You Florence
