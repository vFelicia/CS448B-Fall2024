this is my first tutorial class I am going to tell you about opening bluej creating project as well as creating a program so after installing bluej click on browser icon browser gets opened so any class to be created must be inside the project so we have to create a project click on project new project so we get a dialog box where we can give the name of the project for example I am giving learner and then click on create so we get a prove the project here so you can see that learner heading here so to create a class click on new class or right click on the window anywhere and then click on new class you get a dialog box again make sure that class is selected by default class will be selected and then click OK so here you can see the icon this is the class program so to open it and edit the course doubleclick on it or rightclick and open editor you can see already written course there which is the cell skeleton alpha code according to the name given to the class as a beginner we are not going to take all these codes so we just drill it all the codes and then we are going to start a program it is good practice to start a program with a comment line there are two types of comment lines given in Java program one is with double slash and other one is starting with slash and star many lines and then I mean it is going to end with star and slash so if only one line is been given then just we start us with a double slash after the double slash whatever is written is going to be a comment line which is not going to be executed or compiled when Java is going to compile the program so we start a command line say this is my first program bringing like always the program starts with class name class name is going to be a program name or any program name you wanted to do you must do that as a class name class we have already given the class name as my first program we can use the same name my first program RS if we give some other name YUM FP when it is going to compile it will take the new name and then world name is changed to the new name which is given it say the program and then we open a curly bracket class must have at least one method here we are going to learn a standard method called main method in the beginning of the learning just we can follow the course as given and then later we will come to know what are the words what are the keywords which is used for which purpose so now we are having a method for main method with public static void main of string of arguments so here we have keywords called public static void main so here mean is the name of the method and all these are keywords Java is casesensitive so the keywords to be returned very carefully with that same spelling whether it is a perky our lawyer case so here the public static void all these three are with only lower cases in the string only yes is capital and then ours that is arguments all are with small arrests so you need with that we right we must have a block of quartz which is open with the curly bracket and then we are going to write the codes their actions there so we are going to just print one line so we are going to write a printing statement system dot out dot print line off then we terminate the action or a single statement which is to be terminated with the semicolon so this is going to create a new line so print lines are print we can give print line means after the output it is going to create a new line this is a empty statement when nothing is written to print so whatever to printer to be given inside the quotation we give here inside the quotation video hello welcome to Java and then we close the method here and then we close the class so this is going to be a first program let us compare this there is no syntax error so we close this window and then right click on this we run the method can't avoid me so there is no argument just click on ok so we get hello welcome to Java in the same program I would also like to tell you about print and print line the difference between print and print line so if we create one more line are print one more line here this was how I printed your line so when we don't give print line here in the first statement the output is going to be in the same line it is not going to be in a fresh line for the next statement this is the difference compiled no syntax error and close this rightclick wide me so you can see hello welcome to Java this was how printer deadlines I hope you learnt the first program how it is created an executor Thank You students keep watching my
