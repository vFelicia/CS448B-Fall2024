[Laughter] hello everyone in this class we are going to see functions of tles comparing to Strings and lists we are having very less functions in the tles Len of which is common to any sequence which gives the length of the given sequence so even tle also it does the same job when I give a tle which is called days here and then I have mentioned three letters of days Len of days will return seven here as seven elements are in this tle next I am having index of tle do index of the element the value we give it will be returning the index number of that particular element which it occurs at the first time in the tle in case more than once it is repeated it will take only the first one days. index of THU I have given so index number starts from zero THU is 4 next we are having count off it gives the occurrence of AR argument that how many times it repeats or we can also say it is nothing but a frequency here just to understand I have made one small change in the previous stle I made that Saturday to Sunday again so there are two times available I have given same thing into the example days. count of su it will return two next one we are having sorted of tle it Returns the sorted list it is not going going to be a tle because tle is immutable and then we also know that sorted always returns it does not change the original sequence sorted of days sorted list we get in case we need that in descending order to be sorted we can also give reverse is equal to true so sorted of days comma reverse is equal to True remember is a keyword then that is a Boolean literal so it is in reverse order that is in descending order we can also have the aggregate functions that is sum minimum and maximum if integers or any number types are there then only it will give the some otherwise if it is mixed or it is only string and then it is going to return the error I have given 10 is equal to 10 20 30 40 50 sum of 10 so the sum here is 150 it is returning that Max will return the maximum value that is 50 here it returns that similar way Min will return minimum value which is 10 at last we are having a tle of function which converts any other sequence into a for example I have a list here D see there it is a list it is not a tle now I give tle of D it returns a tle if string is there then you are changing into tle each element that is each character will become an element and then it returns a tle let us execute everything on this ideally let me create a tle called material are mat pen paper pencil marker cutter so first one if I want to get the length of this Len of M it gives five as there are five elements if I want to know the index number of particular element I will be giving m dot index of the argument inside the bracket I say pencil here so I get the index number in case there are two similar things it will give only the first one let us even check that I give one more paper in between now Matt do index of paper I okay paper is available in the index number one so it is going to show that only not the next one now let me use the count of mat dot count off this will be giving the frequency there are two times paper so I'm giving it to get the result so it is two now let us execute sorted off sorted off mat so you could see that it is a list and then C is the first one and then M so two times it is available paper pen and pencil if I need that to be sorted in descending order I can give sorted of M comma reverse is equal to true so it is in reverse order that is in descending order if all are strings it will be getting sorted according to lexico graphical method in case numbers if I say noos equal to 650 485 200 1 so now I say sorted off no so it is according to the value in case we need in reverse order we can give again sorted NOS with reverse is equal to True right so in case we are having strings as well the numbers I just make some changes I make it as temp and then I remove some of this from here I remove it and then I also use some numbers in between 40 35 so here let me give 50 200 so sorted off temp so this will be giving you a error message now let us see the aggregate functions numbers are with purely numbers so I will be giving sum of N so it is 338 you can check it Max of no so here 200 minan of no it is minus so in this aggregate function what happens if it is only strings so strings we are having in mat right I give Max of mat lexico graphically it will check which is the highest one and then returns so pencil is the highest one it will be comparing according to the asky value Min of M we cannot have the sum of this it will give error now let me have the string name is equal to I am just giving any name VI raaan now I make this as tle okay so tle of name will return the tle having each character as one name element there in case if I have a list for example no equal to 1 2 3 4 5 then I change it to a tle or I can also put in another variable num is equal to tle of no sorry I need to give tle and new m is equal to tle of a noise so now if I give num we will get a tle hope the concepts are very clear to you let us meet in the next class thank you
