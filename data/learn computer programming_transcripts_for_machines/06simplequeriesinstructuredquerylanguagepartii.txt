hello everyone welcome back in today's class we are going to continue simple queries of mysql we will discuss performing simple calculations distinct function aggregate functions other simple queries like adding text column in view using alias naming view sometimes we may need to perform simple calculation for example multiplying two numbers or adding two numbers and displaying the result even these can be performed using the selection statement just we can write select and the expression and terminate for example we can write select 10 plus 25 so it will be displaying the result as 35 select 5 into 100 another example how do we apply this in the columns of a table for example particular column is there if we need to multiply the whole column values into some numbers or if we need to find the percentage or we need to convert that into other unit we may need to perform the simple calculations like that we may add the expression to it and then display the result in the view for that we can have a query like this select which are all the column names we need and then the expression with the column name from as usual the table name if we consider the table called state here there are many columns at last if you see area square kilometer if i need to convert that into square meters for that purpose i can multiply that columns value into thousand that particular column all the rows to be multiplied and displayed with the state name how do i perform it i need state as well as the area so i will select these two columns select the column name that is state underscore ut area square kilometer is another column that i need to multiply with thousand so i have multiplied that with thousand from the table name so that is state is the table name when i give this i will be getting the state and the area in square meters i open my sql to perform the basic calculation select 500 multiplied by 10 then terminate this is also a view as a table here 500 into 10 is the field name and the 5000 is the result as an item another example select 70 divided by 10 we are getting that in float data type as it is a division now if we want to apply this in a tables column to access the table first we need to get inside the database i have a database called india i use it there is a table called state let me check all the details of state select star from state if i want to display this state and the area all the values but multiplied by thousand as we saw in the example select state underscore ut comma the next column that is area column area multiplied by thousand from state we can see now values in the area all are multiplied by thousand and displayed distinct function selects the items from the column without any repetition for example if we are taking the table called state here you can see in the zone there are values which are repeated if we want to display these values without any repetition that means the north east we need to have only once not many times just to know how many distinct values are available there in that particular column we can use this statement this can also be combined with other functions syntax is here select distinct and then column name in the bracket from the table name for example if we need to perform zone here select distinct zone from state the column name should be inside the bracket that is distinct is a function here let us perform and check uniquely we will display the zones value select distinct off zone state you can see the values uniquely displayed north east is not repeated let us see the aggregate functions first let us take sum to find the sum of column of a table we shall give select sum of column name from table name for example if we are having this table if we need to take the sum of districts all the districts so it will be adding all the values in the district column and then it will be displaying as one value select sum of districts from state similar way if we want to take average of the particular column we shall give select average of column name from table name again for example select average of area square kilometer from state so it will be giving the average of the last column next finding maximum and minimum value of a column to find the maximum value we will have mbix to find the minimum value we will have min according to neet we shall give column name in the bracket from the table name for example here for maximum maximum of districts that means it will be displaying 38 as it is the highest value similar way if we need a minimum value of districts it will be giving 13 as the answer to count the total number of records from a table we are having count of function this also can be used to count number of values in particular column to display total number of records from a table we give select count of star from table name the example is select count of star from state if we want to count the number of rows in particular column it will exclude the null that means empty select count of column name from table name for example here if you see language column does not have value for this arunachal state it will not count this in the count it will count number of values available in that particular column so it will be showing 4 as the result for that example is here select count of language from state let us perform all these on mysql to select the sum of all the districts which is appearing here we shall give select sum open the bracket districts close the bracket from the table name that is state so we can see 142 is bit displayed there similar way if we want to find the maximum what shall we do we can change this as max so maximum number in the district maximum value will be shown that is 38 if you want to bring the previously typed query we have an option here on the keyboard just press on the upper arrow key you will be getting the previous query if you want to go to previous to that and press once again similarly you can check all the queries and again execute even if you want to modify some query you can use the sideways arrow key you can come back and then change it here now i change this as minimum and then check this so minimum of a distance is being seen here if you want to check the average similar we will change this min as avg so 28.4000 is the average here if you want to know the number of rows in the table that is total number of rows will be shown select count of star that means all the rows from state so there are five records totally it is shown in case you want to specify only how many rows are there in that particular column then we shall give select count of the column name that is zone of from state actually all the values are available in zone but if we see in the language one language was not available which was for arnold chad so let us change this as language i think there is a spelling mistake there l a n g so let us take l i n g we could see the 4 as there is one lesser that that is null that null says empty distinct function also can be combined with count function for example if we need to count the distinct values of this particular column north east is repeated twice if we want to take only once and then count it will be 4. to do that we can give like this select count of distinct of zone from state so now only the distinct value is been counted and displayed to add the text as a column that is the constant text will be appearing as a new column with all the rows filled with the same text we shall give select column names which are all we need the text in the double quote are even in the single quote from table name for example select state underscore ut area square kilometer into thousand see this is converted into square meters to indicate that i may need square meter to be added in all the rows of that particular column so i add this sqm in the double quote from state another simple query using a new name for the column while displaying the details we shall give select column names and then for whichever you need to change the field name there you will give as the new name from table name otherwise we can also use select column names wherever you need to change without having as keyword we can put the new name inside the double quote or single quote from table name example is here select state underscore ut area square kilometer into thousand if i give this the column heading will be area square kilometer into thousand i don't want to show that as it is i want to change the field name there as area underscore in underscore sqm from state let us execute all these select state underscore ut if i want to multiply the area by thousand from state this is for example i am showing you see the column heading is area in 2000 i don't want to see this one instead of this i want to see area in sql for that purpose what i will give as area underscore in underscore sqm if you see this now column heading is being changed as we require here similar way we can also give like this instead of ascii we just put it into the quotation let us check this so again you are getting the same so either you can use this as otherwise within the double quotation one more example like you if you don't want to see this state underscore ut and then just you want to see as only state select state underscore ut as state from state you can see that it is being changed remember these are only views the original table will be as it is now let us use text added into the column same thing i give but instead of giving area in square meter just i show that as area i add a new text column having the same value in all the rows i put it into the code i just add s q dot m you can see the state area this area into thousand i have mentioned as area so area has come here with that i wanted to just put this in all the rows of that particular column we can follow this method for adding a text into a new field remember here if there is no comma then the heading is going to be changed as this if there is a comma then this is going to be a new field added like this so only the comma makes the difference between these two students hope the concept is very clear keep watching this channel keep learning thank you
