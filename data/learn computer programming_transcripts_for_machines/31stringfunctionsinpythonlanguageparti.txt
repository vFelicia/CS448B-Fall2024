foreign in this class we are going to see string functions in Python those who are new to this Channel and watching as first time if you need to know more about strings please watch my previous video and come back to this so that you can understand clearly plane of Str this will be returning the length of the string that means number of characters present in the string it will return for example line of programming as a string so the length of this that is total number of characters available there in this is 11 so it will be returning that 11 as the output we are having index of function this will be written as string dot index of the character whose index number is needed for example if I have a word called James Bond and then I need the index of yes then I will write like this James Bond as a string in the code dot index of s in the code as a character there so it will be returning 4 as the result next one in case we need to convert the string totally into the lower case that is a small alphabets then we are having the function which is dot lawyer of for example James Bond dot lower of all the letters in that string will be converted to lower case and then it get returned similar way we are also having upper half so that all the characters in The String will be converted to uppercase and then it will return again the example James Bond dot Opera now you can see all the characters are converted to uppercase in case we need the first character only in the capital letter then we are having a function called capitalize of this will be returning a string but only the first character as uppercase character this is the example here J becomes capital in it in case we need every first letter of a word to be capitalized then we are having the function called title of we can use string DOT type love which will convert each and every words first letter as the capital letter if you want to find whether a substring is available in the given string we have the function called find of this will be returning the index number of occurrence of the substring it will take only the first lattice index and then it will return for example james1 dot find of mes see here mes is available in James Bond the first character M of the substring is having the index number two so this is being returned if we want to find a substring only from the particular part of a string we can also give find of the substring and then where you need to start that index number and then where you need to end so it will check only in that part whether the substring is available or not all these functions now I will demonstrate so that you can have the better understanding first function we learned is length function for that we need to give a length lenov a string inside the parenthesis I say here programming so it has 10 characters so that is the length it returned the same it is not that we can give this string directly in the argument we can also give the variable there I initialize a string called St I want to know the length of this so I will be giving now l e enough s t if I want to get the index of a character for example N I say I will be giving this string that is s t Dot index of the character which you need so I can give here n and then close this so it will be returning only the first occurrence index number so that will be 4 here in case I want to search in the other part for example I take only from the index number 15 up to the end if any n is available so there it will take the first occurrence for example s t Dot index of I want to give the character there and then I give comma and then from where I wanted to start I start from 15 okay so I close this the ending automatically up to the last character of the string so it gives 24 so what is 15 here let us check n is 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 is p okay so from here 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 so n is at 24 it returned in case I give after 24 it will be returning this one so let us check let me modify the previous one I just copy paste here insta 15 I give 25 and then between 30. so at 28 this n is that let me also explain the find function that also works similar like this for example if I give St Dot find out com so I will be giving us a string here com and then I close this it will be giving the index number of C there if the substring is available in the string so it is 6 similar way we can also check from the range I give here s t Dot find off I find out something else for example in iPhone in see there are two wins available one is in programming and Furnishing online so it will be returning the first occurrence index number that is ice index number you can see that is 23. in case I give 25 up to the end let me check St Dot find out in I need after 25 so let me just close this I could get 30 here so that is in online whichever in is there we can also give staff similarly in case if it is not finding the occurrence then what will happen it will be returning 1 let me show you SD Dot find out we have here some I give book okay which is not there in the string so it will be returning 1 so that means find returns the integer number but in the index if I give the character which is not available let me check what happens book dot index of the letter which is not available here I so it gives the error message see that is the difference between find and the index find always returns the integer even the substring is not available but index if the character is not available it gives the error message St Dot lower C in s t l the starting letters Capital all of this are small so that starting letter also will become lowercase now let me change everything to uppercase before that let us check what happens to the SD it Remains the original or the changed one St it remains as the original so now let me change now St Dot Upper half all these are in capital letter let us also check the title case St Dot title so you could see each and every letter of a word the starting character of a word is in capital letter now capitalize I will write the new string here we are learning python Dot capitalize of so only the first character of the string will become Capital that means w become Capital now let me just check whether I have done all the demonstration of the function which I explained yes I have done all the functions demonstration hope this video was useful to learn the string functions still there are many string functions which we will be learning in the next class thank you
