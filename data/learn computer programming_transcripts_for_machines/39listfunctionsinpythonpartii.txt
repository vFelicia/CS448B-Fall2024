foreign in this class we are going to continue functions of list .player is a function which will remove all the elements from the list and then it will be empty for example if we are having a list called num and then we are giving num dot clear off nothing will be there it will be empty list dot count of item is a method which will give you the frequency of an item that means if any element is repeated in the list it will count number of times if it is not repeated absolutely it will be 1 for example if we are having num is equal to these numbers stored in a list you can notice that 15 is repeated three times here so now I wanted to count I just give num dot count of 50. so how many occurrence of 15 happens it will count on get back it is 3 now list dot reverse of it will completely reverse the list so if this is the list I will be giving num dot reverse of the first element will become the last element last element will become first so until that it will be reversed you can notice that completely it is reversed 15 40 20 80 in reverse order it is the next method sort of this will sort the elements in ascending order for example if I have the same list which is shown in the previous slide and then I give num dot sort of it will sort the elements remember this will modify the previous list the original list will get modified and then the current sorted list is only available there original list you will not be able to get back if we want to sort the items in descending order we can give the list dot sort of as argument reverse is equal to true so this is an optional one so I have put it in the square bracket to know that so now for example if we are having the word list here I give num dot sort of reverse is equal to true now the biggest value will be in the beginning and the least value at the end sorted off list in the previous one list get modified into the new list it is sorted but if we give sorted off list the original list will remain as it is but the elements are sorted and then it is being returned as a new list for example if we have the word list which is not sorted and then I give sorted off num this will return I will show you when I execute but this art will not return it will just reverse and keep it in the list next one we are having extend in case if we want to add all the items of the second list to the first list we shall give like this list one dot extend of list two that means all the values of list 2 will be added to list one and then list one get modified for example I have two lists one is num one is ch if I give num dot extend of ch um get modified into a new list where all the values of num and then all the values are characters are followed there now I am creating a list called l i which has some integer values say 1 2 3 4 5 6. now if I see what is Li it will return the list I am going to give l i Dot clear off so that means it will remove all the elements in it it becomes empty now if I see a line it is empty let me create one more list called Li underscore one again I am giving some values one three five six two three four five six one two three I have repeated few values here now I will show you how the count works Li underscore one dot count of value I wanted to count so if I give 3 how many repetitions of three are there it will count 1 2 and then three three repeated three times so it will give three as its result let me check Ally underscore one dot count of 1 so 1 is repeating two times it will show two as the result let me give Li underscore one dot reverse of so you will be able to see now all the elements reversed l i underscore one see it is not returning that you need to remember it will just modify the list and store it in the memory so when I call it the reverse one you can see that three two one has come here and then six all other things reversed completely now same list I will use to sort the elements sort of will sort in ascending order this is also not returning it will modify the list Li underscore one if I you it will show the list now see there one one two two three three three four five five six six so most of the elements are repeated here so as it is repeated it is sorted now if I give l i underscore 1 Dot sort of reverse equal to true is a Boolean value so it will be in descending order Li underscore one is in descending order now let me copy the word list and store it again sorted off Eli underscore one see now this will be sorting and returning the new list the old list remains as it is you could see that new list is being returned and then if I see l i underscore 1 it is not changed it remains as it is similar way sorted off Li underscore one comma reverse is equal to true now this will start in descending order let me have a list with strings l i S I U okay is equal to I have here A B a x y z hello if I sort this Li yes Dot sort of this get started according to the ASCII value of this string if the starting characters are same then it will compare the next one so l i s is here a a b hello and then x y z if I mix both that means the numeric value as well as the string value in the list it will not sort out before that let me add all these values to the l i underscore one so for that we are having extend method right l i underscore 1 Dot extent of l i s so if I see l i underscore 1 it is having both the elements now let me sort this Li underscore one dot sort of this will be having error here so purely numerical values can be sorted otherwise purely strings can be sorted out so what is the difference between sort and sorted sort does not return the list starter Returns the list insert the original list is modified and word list never be available but in sorted the world released remains as it is a new list is written after sorting out extend also modifies the list hope all these functions are very clear to you we will continue more about lists in next class until then thank you bye
