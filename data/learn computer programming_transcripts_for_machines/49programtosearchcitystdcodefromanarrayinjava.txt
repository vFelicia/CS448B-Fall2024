welcome back students in this video tutorial we will see how to search yes to decode of a given city from the array for example if we have array called city and then all the cities are entered in that as a string type and then STD code which is having integer type so according to the city's yesterday codes are available if we search for the particular city's aesthetic or for example bangle it should say 0 8 0 is the code of that bangle let us create a program drilling for java dot let us have scanner class this time util dot scanner then class city yes Katie will create an object for scanner class you stand a rough start out you let us intimate to do the length of the array so system let LBD length so guilty a list fault oh yes see dot next int off now let us declare to our s1 is for city names other is for city code so string city is equal to new string off the length will be L so next int STD code is equalto new int of length will grab in here so now let us take the input for both the s we will give far too far into is equal to 0 yes lesser than yellow I plus plus so let us intimate are going to enter the city name enter the city so here city half I is equal to SC dot next half now to take the STD code now both the arrays are ready let us search for that city so let us near the intimation to get the city name system dot out dot print off enter the city NATO serves the STD code so this will be string type string so certain level so it is also the Sidra next off we already know when search becomes successful then we should have a boolean type of variable for that I will you boolean flag initially false so now we will start searching so for that we will give farlow in is equal to zero is lesser than L I plus plus now condition to check you search dot equals ignore casa okay so that is CP now CI k y of i equal to equal to true then we will print STD call halfpress the city name which is given for search will be printed class CT plus index number of both the arrays will be the same so if it is finding the city in the particular index number we will print the same index numbers value of STD core array so STD code of I so you flag is equal to files then we will say system gun how about print clean off there is no such city so let us check once so we can do here print so it will be in the same line so L is the length so this is right and then we have created both RS far loop is right then we have taken input for both the things here we are taking the searching element then flag as false so this is searching so this far loop is right so this is the condition so it is everything is right so let us compile right click so enter the length of the array so I give 7 so I give code for that is five six next to City ten 944 next disappear Lucknow the code will be 522 then jumbo 191 is the code then Shimla 177 mother 179 Bangalore Oh Katie so now we have to set so let us search for Shimla so even we can do small case or upper case because we have already ignored the case Shimla so we got the code which is right similarly we can also search for the students roll number and name of the student and also CT pin code and the CP Thank You students keep watching my videos
