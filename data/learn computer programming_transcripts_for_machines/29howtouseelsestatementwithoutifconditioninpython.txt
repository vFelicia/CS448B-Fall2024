hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to discuss about loop else statement in python python allows the else block associated with the loop the else block gets executed only when the loop completes all the iterations that is when exits normally and not when gets terminated by the break statement the general format is here for loop for variable in sequence statement 1 statement 2 and then else block for for loop if you see here the indentation is same as where the far starts here again the statements 3 and 4 outside the for loop if any statements to be given it can also be given similar way even in the while loop while condition statement 1 statement 2 and then else block the indentation is again same as while and then statement 3 and 4 are there statement 5 is outside the while loop let us understand these by some example programs for i in range simply i give 1 comma 10 print i now else statement for this for loop the indentation is same as for so i go back and then else i just print a statement again print i comma is the last value of i let me execute this so you could see after printing 1 to 9 the else statement is executed it printed 9 is the value of i now let me show you if the break statement is given and then this else part will not be executed so i introduce the else statement with some condition here if imod 5 is equal to 0 then i say break when it comes 5 the condition is true and then it breaks so the else statement will not get executed at that time you could see here now let me change this value instead of 5 i give 11 the number which is greater than the range value so this condition is not met true for even a single time then the loop will be getting terminated normally then the else part will be executed let us check this so you could see again when the break statement is present but still it is not meeting the condition required the else part is executed us also execute the while loop program i initialize x is equal to 1 while now i give x is lesser than six print x then i need to increment this x plus equal to one now else part for while else print x comma is the last value of x so it printed as it is and then the else part is executed now again when i give the break statement here if x mod 3 equal to 0 i q then i break this now let us check so 1 2 3 and then the else part is not executed similar way if i increase the number which is greater than 6 or even equal to 6 the loop get terminated normally not with the break statement so the else part will get executed you could see it hope the concept is clear keep watching my channel keep learning thank you
