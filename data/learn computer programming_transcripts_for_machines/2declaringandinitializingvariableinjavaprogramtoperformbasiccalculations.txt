hello students today we are going to see how to use variable in a program we create a Class C as a name of the program double click on this control a delete write a comment about this program using variables so we create a class class space c then we must write a method which is main method public static y name of string of arguments then we open it so before using variables I would like to say about the variables and data types a variable is a location in the memory which will have the name for it data types are storage format the size of the variable are determined by the data types there are two types of data types that is primitive data type and reference data type primitive data types are classified into four groups first one is integer data types that is bite short int and long the next one is real data types or decimal data types which are float and double third one is character data type which can store a character in it and Boolean is one more data type which can store true or false in it generally we use int data type for integer and double data type for decimal point points before we use a variable in Java we need to declare it to declare a variable we need to type the data type as I said for example int so this is the data type and then name of the variable so we give one space and the variable we say for example a and then we terminate it so here we have declared a variable called a so if we wanted to do some operations we may need one more variable or few more variables as we do a calculation we'll see a program to add two numbers and print the sum so we need one more variable called in B and then to store the value one more variable called C in C in case of same data types we don't need to declare in different statements we can do like this a comma B comma C and then we terminate so I cancel these two so we have declared now three variables called A B and C where we are going to assign a value for a so there we use the operator called assignment operator so a is equal to 10 and then B is equal to 12 so these two values are stored C is going to be means the sum of two A + B so here A and B are called operant and then the plus symbol is operator there are five mathematical operators one is plus that is addition minus it is subtraction the star symbol which is multiplication and the slash symbol which is Division and then one more symbol which is having the percentage symbol so this is used to get the remainder after dividing a number now we have calculate the value for C and then stored in variable called C if we wanted to see the result we have to print it otherwise it will be in memory it will it won't display anything so we write a output statement system do out do print line off and then what to be printed inside the brackets so we print C let us compile this there is no synx close this and then run so it shows 22 as the answer see it shows just 22 if we want a reference line with it we can also print before this we we can do it system do out do print line off so which is a reference line will be inside the double quotation sum is equal to so it is going to give sum is equal to and then the total if there is a print line the next value will be in the fresh line so we take off this print compile this so now we can see sum is equal to 22 instead of writing in two different lines we can also uh save the space and time by giving plus symbol here and then C so that means in single printing statement we have given two things to print which is uh constant which is a string uh which has no value whatever is in the quotation going to be print that and then the value which is calculator C so these two are concat by using plus symbol so that is adding both the outputs in a single printing statement so we don't need to give the second like here no syntax again it is going to be the same type of outut now I will uh show you how to use the variable which is having decimal places which is having decimal places nothing but we give us double double and then all these a B and C are going to be double though we give us integer value it will automatically convert into double saying 10.0 otherwise we can also give 10 .2 2 1 B is equal to 13.89 so now C is going to be the answer and then it is going to print C you could see the result now we will see how to store the value of character so nothing here we are going to give character data type care and then character CH generally we use CH or C whatever is so that is CH is the name of the variable so what we are going to store there in CHS CH is equal to inside the single quotation value any value as a character so that you should know so for number value we are not going to give in ins the quotation character value we are giving inside the single quotation so for example f f is a character so it is going to store so we are going to just modify this program to print the result of this CH so we are going to the character event is character is so that is ch ch compile so character is f Boolean data type stores only two or false so we can give the data type here Boolean Boolean maybe any number X so what it is going to store it can store uh value true or false so X is equal to how do we assign X is equal to true so if we say to print X it will say true so we terminate this and then it is just I have given for an example it is compile it is true thank you students for watching my second session we will meet you in third session thank you
