other students we are going to see how to get input from the user in this session this helps to calculate the values according to the users choice draw or provide scanner class to take the input from user scanner class provides convenient methods for reading input values of various types we will create a class say creating simple interest calculating simple interest we are giving comment in Pinterest user important to use scanner class we have to write import statement at the top of the program import Java dot util dot scanner know we open the class complex simple interest static void no argument removing this let us give all the variables which we require in T time T both re integer type will double the rate of interest you may have decimal places so double R and then simply press which we are going to calculate simple int we can use next we need to create a object for the scanner class so scanner scanner the object name to be given here object name can be an identified so identifier me any name between offending the program so for example will you will be J OB is equal to new keyword vu and then scanner ah system dot we then we technique this you program should get input from user user should get a prompt for entering this system dot out dot print line off until be a mob now we have a method for each data type so we are going to assign that to a variable called T so P is equal to then object name which we have given we have to write here obj and then dot next we use and immediately after that without giving any space we have to write the data type first care letter in the capital empty and then open the bracket next and close the bracket next in bar saying like that we have to take input for other two variables we will copy and paste the statement it is about that then we will change this one as enter the time so here it is to the next on this going to be the rate of in test so as it is a greater interested w we say w that is these capital here and then this is going to be our so we have taken the input needle now we will calculate now so yes I xx is equal to P into R into P divided by 100 point zero I have given point 0 here because we are going to calculate that into interest at a double so it is better to give point 0 here next we are going to print the result so come back dot print line of equal interest is equal to and then plus the interest what we have classes to the variables yes I am T so we are going to you yes int I will let us compile this or syntax error we will run this so you can enter the amount only 10,000 enter the time to years enter the rate of interest may be 7.5 the simple interest calculator is thousand five hundred Thank You students
