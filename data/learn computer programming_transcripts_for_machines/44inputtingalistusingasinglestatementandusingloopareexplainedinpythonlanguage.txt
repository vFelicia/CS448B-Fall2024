foreign in this class we are going to see how to input elements for the list there are different methods One is using Loop we can use either for Loop or while loop that depends on the programmer's choice other one is taking input using a single statements both we will see in this class now normally if you want to take a input using the loop then we need to have the list initialized as empty there in the beginning so I have L1 as empty list there and then number of elements whatever is needed that we will be giving in the range function so for I in range 5 I need five elements here I have given five there now I will be writing the input statement n is equal to input of entering element so every time the for Loop runs it takes one element and then we will be appending the to the list so L one dot append of n this is one method where it will take five elements for the list after that it stops similar way we can also use while loop for using while loop we will be having one more variable to ask the user whether to continue or not I give a condition here while c 1 is equal to Y so similar in the for loop I write here n is equal to input enter an element it will be taking the element and then it will be appending to the list and then it will ask whether to continue or not in case the user gives any other than y it will be stopping so either one of this you can use if you want to get the input from the user this is the proper way to get the input of our list or even Tuple even for the dictionary we can use this the other way is using eval function we will learn what is eval function and will come back here eval function has the capacity to evaluate the expression even if it is a string so for this reason we can also use for inputting the list our Tuple even for the dictionary for example eval of 50 minus 30 which is inside the code that means it is a string still it will understand that as a expression and gives the value after evaluation so that means it is 20 now similar way if e value of 1 2 3 as a list in as a string then it will take that as a list we can also use this for Tuple this also means a tuple here we know that input statement always takes input as a string if we add e well to that automatically whatever input is given by the user will be evaluated as required and then taken as input so we can give L1 is equal to e value of input of then the message to the user so the user now can give a list a tuple or even a dictionary there please note that using eval function has some disadvantages so it is not increased now let us run the code on Python and understand better let us create a small program which takes input for the list and then again it displays it I need an empty list to be initialized before I give L1 is equal to MT for I in range 4 x is equal to input of message to the user enter the element now I will be appending this to the list so L1 Dot append of x so it takes four input for the list and after that it stops it will be saved in the L1 I will be printing this statement to be outside the loop so just say you print L1 let us run this I say here python C plus plus Java C you could see the output as a list similar way if we need a while loop we can take continuous input or else even n number of input we can give let us change this program to have n number of input until user says no I need to get the input every time whether to continue or not for that purpose I need one variable I give C is equal to initially I give the test capital Y now while C is equal to equal to y I don't need this for Loop so input is taken then that is being appended and then I will ask the user to continue or not for that purpose I will be giving C is equal to input of the message I give here is to continue enter y sometimes user may give in lower case to avoid the error there I convert that to uppercase aparaf so either the user used in lower case or uppercase it works C plus plus it asks whether to continue or not I give y Java so again why python again y Perl again y like you see see now I have given five inputs all five will be in the list if I give any other simply I press enter also it will stop now let us use the eval function I need nothing here one single statement that is eval of input of message to the user enter the list so just I am going to print that list so you could see that it has taken as a list and then it is printed back simply I give here input I am giving here 5 into 3 it will give the result so we can also use eval for this type of inputs hope now it is very clear to you keep practicing keep learning keep sharing this video to others so that they also learn well let us meet in the next class until then thank you and bye
