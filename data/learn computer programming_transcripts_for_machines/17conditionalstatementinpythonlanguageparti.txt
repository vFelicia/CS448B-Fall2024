hello everyone welcome back in this video lesson we are going to learn conditional control structure in python in python selection or decision constructs are implemented using if conditional statement if statement tests a particular condition when the condition gets evaluated as true actions that is the statements or statement in the block are executed when the condition gets evaluated as false the actions that means the statements under this block are ignored so in all the forms of if statement relational and logical operators are used to form the conditions relational logical operators i have already explained in my previous videos if you are not knowing about this you can please visit those videos learn and come back to this here i will give you one example for conditional control structure this is just a real time example on day to day basis just imagine this is a lunch time and then teacher is with a group of students so here the question is did you bring the lunch in the box so how do we use if condition here if yes so this is the statement have it with your classmates the teacher says to the student this is simply if yes in case not yes that is false or that means he didn't bring it then no other options given there so just it is ignored the other way they are here now if and else did you bring the lunch in the box if yes have it with your classmates here now having an option here if not that is go to the cafeteria still it can be elaborated if alif alif and then so many ellipse and else what is this how there may be so many conditions put together for some actions so did you bring lunch in the box yes then have it with your classmates the next condition here do you have enough money if not means then go to the cafeteria so if even the money is not enough do you have less money borrow some from friends see one more condition similar like that we can keep adding the conditions using alif so when none of these conditions get applied and then at last it comes to the last one where it is else so then what is the action here the teacher says i will share my lunch with you come in today's class we are going to see the simple if statement how to use it in python i will also give some example programs for this if else if lflef ladder will be learnt in the next next classes if statement if statement is used to check the situation with conditional expression when the condition gets evaluated as true it carries out the action the syntax for writing give us if see remember this is a key word i and f both are in small letters that is lowercase letters and then the condition is given the condition is in the angle bracket here as a syntax that means the condition keeps changing and then you know any block of statements end with the colon and the next line starts after one indent of space so statement one is given if you have more statements it can also be given you can keep continuing that n number of statements so when the condition is not true and then no action is being taken or no other statements are executed this is simple if statement remember here all these statements under this block so will be with the same indent level once again remember here whatever is given inside the angle bracket is changeable and then whatever is given in the square bracket those are only optional this statement may be there or may not be there here is the flowchart of conditional statement you know condition is given in the diamond box and then when this evaluates true the statements are get executed here we do not have any other statement when it get evaluated false so it directly ends or it continues with the other part of program for example we can say if a is greater than b print a then another statement if i say to print dot dot that's all it prints if false it is not going to do anything else it is going to start with the other part of the program next part of the program come let us go to the python and execute some programs create a python program to accept two variables and print the first if it is greater than the second one so only if the first one is greater than it will print otherwise it is not going to do anything okay that is the program so let us take the input from the user for both the variables say a and b so a is equal to the input we will take that we will convert to integer right so into input of enter your first value then here the second value we will take i copy paste and then right here second value okay so now here is the condition we are going to give if is a keyword with all small letters so if then one space then i will give the condition here if a is greater than it is going to print here that's nothing else if b is greater it is not going to do anything so that is the question given here so if a is greater than b then we end this with colon and then automatically it will leave one indent when i give the enter button so one indent then i say print i may print a or a is greater so a and then if i want to print a is greater than i print here is greater i can also write again print you have successfully learnt if condition program so we need to open that with double quote so this is the prompt simply have given that there are two statements here so let us just run this i save this and then run enter the first value 5 second value 7 so what it is going to do it is going to do nothing so run once again so now i give 10 and then second value is 5 so it is going to print now 10 is greater right 10 is greater and then you have successfully learnt if condition program here is the another question create a python program to print the marks entered is pass marks so the condition is given marks above 39 is considered as pass let me take the input for the marks marks is equal to so in our float we can take float of input of enter your marks so there is only one comparison here if marks is greater than 39 then it is pass right print pass if it is lesser than that it is not going to do anything so that's all the program is very small just three line program so if i say 50 pass so if i say 15 nothing it does hope this if concept is very clear to you let us meet in the next class until then bye thank you
