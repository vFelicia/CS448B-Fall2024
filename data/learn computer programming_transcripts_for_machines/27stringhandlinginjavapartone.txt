welcome back students in this video lesson we are going to see string handling let us now see string class creating string a string is a reference data type so the variable yes I have taken string s is equal to keyboard inside the double quotation and I terminated so this is the way of initializing the string variable string object string STR here STR is the object name that is a valid identifier can be anything equal to new keyword we use and then string of mouse I have given inside the double quotation where the most store in the string object called ystr next string buffer class creating string buffer object string buffer yes b1 is equal to new string buffer off here yes b1 string buffer object has been created nothing will be stored in this next string buffer yes b2 is equal to new string buffer off Joystiq I have given in the double quotation we're in the SB to object Joystiq has been stored the third way yes b3 is equal to new string buffer of 20 here 20 is the integer number it creates an object where it can store 20 characters in Java there are many functions for the string let us see one by one the function here length of so what will be the output data type always it will be integer the length says how many characters are available in the string including the special character our space so here output data type is int for example I have given here keychain there is a space between key and chain which is in the double quotation Bo dot length of so here it will count all the characters available in it 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so 9 will be the output next to upper case of here there put data type will be string only the function example here dr dot to uppercase of see here d is already there capital r IV is in small letter so which are all in small going to be converted into uppercase so then the output will be dr i ve in all in capital letters next to lowercase off the output of this also be string type for example I have taken monitor here to lowercase off it will be giving this monitor in the lower case the next one re place of world character dot new character that means we are going to give a character which is available in the string and then we are going to change into the new character which we want to replace so again the output data type will be string itself here for example I have given store dot replace whoa comma a Co is a letter here that is a character so it is been in single quotation same like that ei is also given in this single quotation so the output will be boy is being replaced with a so it will be stare next trim off here the output data type again is string type for example I have given some space I love Java then again some more space what it does it will cut all the extra spaces before and after the string so that means it starts from I and then it ends with ei the extra space before and after the string going to be trimmed up next can't cut off concat is going to be string type output here for example key which is given inside the double quotation that is first string and then concat off board I have given again in the double quotation here these two are going to be added together which is going to display nearby so keyboard will be the output then value of so this is also going to be string type the function here example string dot value of 32 so 32 is a integer number here please note that o is capital value all in small and then whoa is capital e effacing small letter so the integer value going to be converted into string value that is just 3/2 as they object here there are many string functions in this class we will see only this much we will continue that in the next class now I will demonstrate all these string functions through a Java program string STR is equal to I just give here mirror let me take a length of this so I need a variable integer variable so that is into L is equal to STR dot length of so let me print this Plus Yelp now let me also convert into uppercase so I can store this in the new variable after converting into uppercase otherwise directly I can print so let me assign to a new variable string str2 IU is equal to STR dot to you is in capital upper and then KC is in capital so now STR becomes uppercase of mirror let me print this also in uppercase this just for reference I am giving so that is STR after converting into uppercase it is going to print let me convert one more string into lowercase system dot out dot print line enough I am just giving here this is my book dot to lowercase of yelling should be capital then C should be capital lowercase F so now this is going to convert this is my book into lowercase C at this is in small all other things are in capital so let us compile then run this so you can see here length of the string is 6 in uppercase so a mirror we came in uppercase this is my book so this asks already in the small letters all others were in big letters so it has been converted into small at us the next we are going to see here is replacer so let us say we place any of the string with the other letter what I will do here system dot out dot print line off I will give here snow snow dot replace half a world character to be given here yes I change this here in single quote yes and then comma instead of that I change it to K so capital K so now the yes letter is being changed into K so it is going to be printed we don't need all these things let me remove this so compile this so you can see there yes n what W become K n roll doubly so let us learn about trim function now I will you here string STR is equal to with some space I give snow now system dot out dot print line off I am going to print STR next let me take this without space that is trimming it I pasted that same here and then hey here I go dot trim off so what it will do first it is going to print the original string here with the space and the next it is going to print after trimming it if I give space after this we can't understand but we can understand whether there is space previous to the string or not let us compile this so you can see that the extra space here is been cut let us give a lengthy string Snow is cool so it is going to cut to only the space after and before not which is in between so in between whatever is there it is going to stay like that next let us see the concat function I will add one more string with the STR so let me do like this system dot out dot print line of st r dot concat with if we take it in the handle let me cut this I will take this also so with this STR one it is going to add if we take it in the hand compile this so snow is cool if we take it in the hand it is displayed together now let us learn value of function let me take in n is equal to 45 so let me print this system dot out dot print line off after converting into string so that is string dot value of ricean now this is going to be converted into string value it is not going to be integer value how we can know this after converting this we won't be able to add any number with this for example I add just 10 with this if it is a number then it is going to be 50 fight if it has been converted into strength ten is going to appear nearby let us compile and check see here it has been converted into string so it is been displayed and the near weight n is been displayed students I hope this was very helpful for you to learn the string functions let us continue the second part in the next video until then thank you students
