dear students today we are going to see function our method overloading this method our function overloading is concept of whoops as polymorphism you already know that we can write many methods in the class Java language also facilitates designing of number of functions with the same name when we write method name our function name as same name then it is called overloading let us create a class so let us create a variable which is common to the class into B let us create a method void volume so let us have cube so we need only one argument that is side into side in decide in yes calculating V is equal to yes into yes yes print this KBC photo press let us write down other makeup why Warren Beatty boy if we need for cube ID we run this video 3 Phi you search shows thousand in case if we need only four cube we will have 140 you can see no see these are having different method name we are going to make this as same name which becomes of overloading note so when it is having same name how it identifies it identifies by number of parameter see here only one parameter is there yet three parameters are there so when the arguments differ ultimately matches to the arguments and it runs it may be number of arguments or even type of arguments our arrangement of arguments also this is example for number of arguments let us win this you will have the same see shows 125 no sorry trust us now let us have only one argument in both the methods so let us cancel this see now this is yell this is yes the name of the variable is different but that doesn't matter it checks whether type of the variable that is parameter is same are not sea trouts already method we boil of int is already differ in a plus function overloading so let us change the parameter type let us have as W so when we have double the answer must be also from in W let us change this as double so automatically so int can be converted to double but double cannot be cannot retained to int C no number of parameter is same for both so let us have this also so this still this is also volume of cube let it be like this only it does not change this just for understanding compile no syntax error see if we run w it asks double by so let us do twenty five point two three so you can see that I said in case you need fifty just ask so let us have example for arrangement of arguments that the number of argument be the same but arrangement of the arguments different so let us have here into length into breadth and the double height so let us you hear us let us just try let us do the same type simulate except no because these three are in the same arrangement int into double entailed double so let us change this see it is showing the error message link interpreting sorry into TR into let us change this yes the arrangement order of that sea so now there is no error because here you tell here double and then here int int double here in so order of the arguments is different let us run so first here it is asking intel eight will be five and then here double it is four point six three let us for this here W 2 point 5 then 5 so you can see keywords this must be easy example to understand the function overloading let us create one more program which calculates the area of different shapes so let us take yes yes so the another method why area same Lim s method name here let us have double 3.14 here I meant reaches for with you hide so this is for let's compile this so no syntax errors my students send this for area of square we have one D length seventy so you can see this area of squares 4900 next so this is for circle 0.15 you can see area of circle and then our parallelogram b67 item a t33 when this program here different type of parameter here number of parameter varies and then let us have one more also here see here it is here it is inked and double your double and in so however the arrangement of the argument differs so there one so let us how mm hypothesis so this is fine I hope that you learnt function overloading very clearly but you may ask one question that what is the use of function overloading and you can say instead of giving same name we can give different names and can be performed isn't it function overloading is useful when we do not like to remember so many names if names of the functions are all same then we do not require to remember many function names and according to arguments passed it will run hence function overloading is one of the most powerful and useful features of objectoriented programming which implements polymorphism which is a oops concept I hope this video might have been very helpful to you all for understanding function overloading in very simple manner please subscribe and like if this video helped
