welcome back students in this video tutorial we are going to learn far loop then we are going to learn step value here then using multiple variables also we will learn then we will see finding factorial then sum of series let us create a class called multiple pass multiple let us write in my main method probably static why have string of arguments or let us find the multiple of five let us create a for loop Phi is equal to let it be five s the beginning and then when I is lesser than or equal to maybe fifty then so now the step value until now we were giving increment or decrement so that is I plus plus R I now we are going to see how to write other step value so now I is equal to I plus five so everything what it happens is values going to increase by five simply we are going to print this system dot out dot print line off so we are going to print I first it is going to print five si and then next it is going to increment by five so it becomes ten then it will continue until lesser than or equal to compiled no syntax error so you can see if I 250 has been printed in case we need value from a user until which we want to print so instead of fixed value here 50 we can you hear any value which is given by the user say X so you can input this X either by scanner class or you can use here as parameter so this is userdefined method with a parameter I am giving int X so X is going to be input now don't add to it whatever the value of x is going to be printed compile so let us have 100 so you can see 5 200 and then one more also we can do here any multiples you need so here we had 5 as a constant number instead of that that also can be created by user so that is int Y so whatever the value is given by the user it is going to be taken as multiples of that number so here instead of Phi we can say here as Y and also the beginning also as Y you only so that it begins with the same number and then multiples of that we will get let us compile no syntax error so multiples until what we need here we may need until hundred multiples of 20 so it does good 20 40 60 and under now let us learn how to do multiple variables in this Farlow so for that let us have main method easy to learn so let us have number of times to run a loop so that is I is equal to 1 so if you feel that this loop should run 5 times we will nu is lesser than or equal to 5 and then it is going to be I plus plus so now see from 1 to 5 it is going to run it is going to run 5 times case if we need to print the multiples of then how we can do here we can give comma already we have declared as int so we are giving J is equal to 10 and then here the condition is 5 times it is going to run the increment operator is here after this we can give here plus and then what we are going to you we are going to increase also j j is equal to j plus 10 see here in is equal to 1 and j is equal to 10 here after that semicolon so that we have initialized two variables here and the condition is lesser than or equal to phi it is going to run 5 times and then i plus plus 4 ice value it is going to do ie plus plus that is every time it is increasing 1 but here J is increased by 10 times so we are going to print here J so let us run this so you can see 10 20 30 40 and 50 so this is the way of giving two variables in a Farlow the third thing which we are going to learn here is finding factorial so let us have the normal loop here that is is equal to 1 then is lesser than or equal to 5 and then I plus plus I am removing this the second variable which we have given before finding factorial let us know what is factorial first if any number is given to find a factorial for example 3 so 3 factorial the factorial symbol is exclamatory mark here which is C equal to that is up to 3 you are going to multiply all the sequence of numbers starting from 1 so that is 1 into 2 into 3 so what is the result of this 1 into 2 is 2 and then 2 is multiplied by 3 is 6 so 6 is the answer so 3 factorial is 6 in case if it is 6 factorial we are going to do 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 into 5 into 6 so the answer it is going to be 2 3 6 6 fours are 24 24 fives are 120 126 are 720 so this is how we find the factor to find factorial we need one more variable which is called ya and then F we are going to initializes 1 and then inside the Farlow we are having F is equal to F into I is equal to five means five times it is going to run and then it is going to find factorial of 5 in case if you need factorial of 10 we will you get in other ways as usual if we need user input means we can you using the parametrized method otherwise user input let us have this 5 itself and then let us print yeah after compiling this I will explain how this works let us declare this into F is equal to 1 compile so we can see factorial of 5 is 120 we also can give ya factorial of 5 is equal to this should be inside the quotation then plus in the factor of five is equal to 120 let us know they method how it works see five factorial so that is 1 into 2 into 3 into 4 into 5 which is equal to 120 here yes we have already declared as 1 and then I is in the loop so ice valet first it is going to be 1 so we have given F is equal to F in toy it is going to find F is equal to 1 so that is the value of F is 1 into is value is 1 we can see here 1s result and then this value is stored for next time as f is 1 next time this is going to be 2 so i becomes 2 here it becomes 1 into 2 is equal to 2 so the value of 2 is substituted in F so the x value becomes 2 then now I evaluate 2 and ice values 3 2 into 3 is equal to 6 the result again going to F then I becomes 4 C F is equal to 6 and then 4 is equal to 20 then the 24 is going to be substituted in F and then it becomes 5 automatically 24 into 5 is equal to 1 country so like this we are as a result when it becomes 6 it is invalid so it comes out of the loop and then we are printing only the last value so we can see here F is equal to see these values are calculated every time then F into I ice values it is changing every time 1 2 3 4 5 6 I have given colors to easy understanding I hope this was clear to you to understand how the factorial is working now let a CD sum of factorial so what is sum of factorial we are going to see 1 factorial plus 2 factorial plus 3 factorial plus 4 factorial plus 5 factorial so we need to find the sum of this let us have one more variable int so we have to initialize this as we are going to add so in the beginning before the add the default value will be 0 so we have initialized as 0 and then we have also initialized F is equal to 1 here we are going to find the sum of each time further let us have some is equal to sum plus ya see we have many statements here so let us have here as block of course we don't need to print every time here so we are going to print only once so let it be outside the loop so sum is equal to ya some so what it is going to do it finds one factorial that is one it adds with the sum and then 2 factorial it will find and then again it is going to add with this old sum which is already one so like that it is keep on continuing until 5 factorial there should be in the comment line so compile this no syntax error let us run this you can see some base equal to 153 okay now let us have some other type of series so let us have like this so that is X to the power 1 by 1 plus X to the power 2 by 2 plus X to the power 3 by 3 and then so on up to X to the power n divided by yeah so let it be here sum is equal to 0 but it is having some denominator value so it may be double here double and then instead of EF we take the answer is y and then just the answer also may be double wy so what it is y is going to be X to the power I isn't it so we need also a variable called Y X so let us have here in the parameter series just like you Ser trilliant next so we need the value of x here it is going to be math dot t o w of math that power of x comma hi so this is going to find X to the power 1 for 1 and the next to the power 2 for 2 like that and then we also need divided by I so when is 1 X to the power 1 divided by 1 X to the power 2 divided by 2 so like that it is keep on going to find when sum is equal to 0 first time it is adding and then again so instead of this here then second time third time like that keep on adding until five times reenter means we also can do there imp n so that is y n time so this will print the summer series which we have seen there as find this X so by x value we are giving for example two and then ends value up to three times you can see some is equal to six point six six six now let us consider instead of 1 1 factorial and then here as 2 factorial then here as 3 factorial and then there up to n factorial so we have to find factorial of the number as well as I is going to be in the power let us modify this program as we need factorial let us have factorial also into F is equal to 1 and then we need factorial yeah Super T of intro ie which we have seen already how to find the factorial and then yeah so this is the same thing here instead of I we are going to substitute yes that's our with students it's very simple right click here x value will be 10 up to 5 times pradhans I hope you learnt how to find the sum of series today let us see some more series in the next session scrape this channel it is free so that you can get always information about my uploading Thank You students keep watching my videos
