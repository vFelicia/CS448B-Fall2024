welcome back students in this video lesson we will learn menudriven program before going to a program we will learn the algorithm of menudriven program the list of tasks are displayed as menu for the user using printing statements so we will simply print the tasks then user will to whichever tasks to be performed then programming codes are written to perform all the tasks using selection statement to match the options given here we can use switch case statement our if else statement that depends on the question given when given choices matched with the option for the task that particular task will be performed in case user gives a wrong choice then appropriate messages displayed using printing statement so if it is switch case we are using then it will be in default otherwise in else part we will create a menu driven program for two tasks that is to find the factorial of given number the other one is to accept a number and print its factors so it should print appropriate message for rung input given by the user let us go to the program and create a class called me know to take the input from the user I will import scanner class so import Java dot util dot scanner class you know we will declare the variables for choice we need integer variable so int C hits I you for choice and then we are going to find the factorial and factors of given number so we need a number to take so for that I will give n as the variable to use in a loop I will you I now let us create object for scanner class now we are going to print all the Minho's available here so let us print so I am just giving menu and in the new line it will print option oneness to find factorial and then again in new line 2 will be to find factors and also we will say enter your choice now we will take the input from the user that is we have given as charge HC h is equal to SC dot next int R after taking the choice from the user we have to take a decision to which tries to be executed for that we will use switch case here so switch then that will be choice here if user enters 1 and then we will give case 1 for that the program code for finding the factorial of that number here we need one more variable count there for factorial we will take so in F is equal to 1 we will initialize now we should take the input from the user for the number which factorial is required for that we will give system dot out dot print line off you can say enter the number to find factorial so we can you just print here we have already declared Sen so n is equal to the C dot next int off we already learnt how to find factorial in previous program we have to use far loop so far I is equal to 2 I is lesser than or equal to n so up to n equal to 2 then I plus plus so here you have two is equal to your intro I so this will find the factorial now we will print the factorial n is the given number plus we will write the factorial symbol here and then also equal to then plus F let us have one more space here then after this we will write break statement if you forget break and then case two also will get executed so we should not forget break now I will write case two for the second choice case we need a user input for find the factors of a number so I will just copy this and paste here then later this I will write a code to get the factors of the number if given number is divisible by your number and then the divisor is called a factor including one and the number itself are factors to print all the factors we will give the farlow and find whether the number is divisible are not so I starts from one is lesser than or equal to n then I plus plus if n more I is equal to zero it is a factor so we will print the factor so we will give system dot out dot print line of so I plus one comma V will you can also add one sentence here factors are factors of plus R Union so that is the N number given R so it will print factor sir and then the same line it will print so in same things I take this Yellin now we will break this now we should not forget to you the default statement we William from invalid input so here we copied both our factorial let us change this enter the number to find factors let us compile this so enter your eyes I enter s1 enter then number to find factorial we know 120 is 4 5 so I give 5 the answer is right now let me check for the second case I am giving 2 as the input so factors now I say 21 so factors of 20 or not it is given now let us also check by giving invalid choice thank you 5 for example so invalid input it says always we can expect one menudriven program for the board examination the task given may be different but most probably there will be one menudriven program students I hope this would have been very useful for you to learn menudriven program keep watching my channel learn well thank you students
