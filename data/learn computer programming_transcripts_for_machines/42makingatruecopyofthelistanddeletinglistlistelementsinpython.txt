foreign welcome back in this class we are going to see copying and deleting list in Python usually we used to copy a variable using another variable with assignment operator but using assignment operator with new variable in list does not make a copy for example if I have a list like if is equal to 246 if I want to make another copy of this with a new variable called num1 num1 equal to U will not make a copy of view instead here num1 becomes another variable name for the same address of the list let us little more be clear with the diagram is equal to 246 if you see the ID of this it may be showing some idea on your computer right now if I give num1 is equal to U then both the IDS are for the same list it is not two different list then ID also is the same if you want to change the list having give as the name when you see num1 that also get changed that means it is one single list this is called shallow copy then how do we make the exact copy of list so let me again take the same example it has the ID as said before now if I want to copy I will be giving Eve dot copy of that I will put it in a new variable that means I can write num 2 equal to U dot copy of this will make a true copy of the list so if you see that num2 is another list having different ID now so now num2 is a true copy of Eve let me create a new list called num I'm just giving one two three four five n is equal to num let me check the ID of num also ID of n so both are same I am trying to change n so let me append n Dot print off I give 70 there now if I see n I didn't make any change to number right let me check what is num so you can see there change in Num also it is clear for us assignment operator creates one more variable name for the same list so let us use now copy of I am giving N1 is equal to num Dot copier see now N1 is a new list here let me check ID of N1 now it is different let me also change this N1 Dot up and off I am having a list inside list so just like you twenty Thirty nested list I make it so now if I see N1 it is changed if I see num it Still Remains as it is so from this we are very clear that dot copy of only makes a true copy of the list given now let us learn Del is a keyword in Python we can make use of Del in different ways Del will delete a single element from a list Del will also help us to delete multiple Elements which is in a Range Del will also delete a list let us see the Syntax for these to delete a single element we will give Del space list and then the index number in the square bracket so that particular index numbers valued it removed if we want to delete multiple elements we can also give the range instead of single index Del space list of index range we give if we want to remove the complete list itself we can give Del space name of the list for example if CH is the list if I want to remove one element Del space CH of 5. so 5 will be F right that gets removed so if we see what is CH now it will be this one so let us take this list for the next operation if I want to delete a range of elements then I can give Del CH of 4 is to 8 so that means we know the slicing according to the slicing it will be removing the elements that means Fifth Element having index number S4 that is e G h i so 4 5 6 7 8 is not introduced that means J will not be included it will be there so a b c d j will be the new list after performing this so next one if you want to delete the list itself we can give Del space CH if we try to check what is ch it will say it is not identified so that is CH is no longer available let us execute all these on the python ideally with different examples I'm just giving the same list which was in the example Dell space c h r I give six so that is g get removed ch I got removed now let me give some range here Del CH of 3 is to 7. so 3 4 5 6 so 4 elements get removed from the list let me check now let me have num is equal to one two three four five six seven eight nine then also 10. now till num of see I am giving the first index 0 and the last index is 9 I give 10 so that 9 is also included if I do this this will remove all the elements right but I'm not doing this instead of that I am going with the step which is 3 here so now first element get removed 4 is removed 7 is removed and then 10 also gets removed let me check now so even this facility is available when we are removing some particular range of sets so as the slicing we can remove the elements now if I want to delete CH it gets removed now let me check it it is not available
