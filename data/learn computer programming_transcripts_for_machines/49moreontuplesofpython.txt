[Laughter] hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to see tle operations copying and deleting a tle inputting a tle in tle operations we will see joining replicating relational operators and tles membership operators and then slicing we will learn all these directly from idle let us open let us have a tle called books the we have Library I give Li is equal to now coming to addition operator books plus Li see there this will add all the elements together and then display a new tle there will not be any change in books or Library however the tle cannot be changed as it is immutable so it returns a new tle having all the elements of both the tles now books into two this will be replicating all the elements two times even it may also be two into books R2 into Li IB it replicates two times but we cannot have books into Li this will give you error let me create a tle called ET 2 4 6 8 okay so similar way OT I have here 1 3 57 now if I give e is greater than o see the first element it is going to check it is greater right so it will give true in case now ET one I create with using zero there 0 2 4 6 8 then if I give e 1 is greater than OT it is going to be false as ET is having lesser value value than OT similar way it can also compare the string members but it cannot compare string and values let us check let me have St is equal to I simply give here Python and then here Java okay now let me check e is greater than St it will give you error this is similar like list so if you want to learn elaborately please visit my old video which is list operations and then come back so that you can learn this quickly now membership operator in will check whether the element is there in the tle if is there then it returns true otherwise it will be returning false for example six in E I give so it is there so it will give true similar way 10 in OT is not there it will be giving you false now next coming to slicing slicing is very much similar to string or list again you can go and watch from there to no elaborately otherwise just simply I will give one or two examples here we will be having three arguments here with the slicing slicing is always given in the square bracket beside the name of the tle I have here e in the square bracket I give 2 comma sorry 2 is to we use 2 is to 4 step is not there so we will have 6 and 8 there similarly o t in the square bracket I give is to 3 so 0 1 2 it means 1 3 5 will be there copying and deleting a t let me create books is equal to when I want to make a copy of this I can give a new name called B1 is equal to books so this tle is copied also to B1 if I check B1 it is same if we compare the list when we change the element of B1 then the elements of books also shows the same it means idea of both the names are same but here being tle is immutable we won't be able to change the elements but however the IDS are same let me check ID of B1 and then ID of books both are same if we don't need any one of this we can also delete it so to delete we use DL space the name of the tle so B1 I give B1 is gone there now it will not be there but now books will be available inputting a tle in the previous classes we have already discussed about eval function we can also use the V Val function to input the tle for example if I need to input a tuple I give T is equal to I write eal of input of I give a message to the user saying input a tle so now the user will be able to give the input and then this stores in tup now let us print and check dup it will be returning the same tle so just execute this I'm giving a tle here one 2 3 so it has return the same thing we can also input without having a tle symbol automatically it will take this as tle the right way to take input from the user for a tle is using a loop accepting all the elements so we cannot add the elements to tle directly so we will create a list and then the list will be converted to a tle so let me have list is equal to Mt and then for I in range so this is number of elements we need from the user it can be a user input as n otherwise we can give here a particular number I give four here right so now I will be taking the element from the user e is equal to maybe int or uh string I take integer once the loop is done then we will be changing the data type that means T is equal to tle of L so L get converted to tle now just we will print the tle which is given there t let us execute this so four inputs it will take I give five 10 20 100 so you could see the tle hope this is very clear to you let us meet in next class thank you
