foreign welcome back in this class we are going to see list in Python list is a type of sequence in Python many values can be put into a single list bifurcated each with comma and all the values together mentioned inside this square brackets lists in Python are mutable that means we will be able to change the value of an first example there are four integers bifurcated with comma mentioned inside the square bracket this is a list having four values in it similar way we can have different types of data into it example 6 5.5 34.748 see some of the integers float numbers and also a string which is book here and then again there is integer type so mixed data types can be put in a single list we can also mention a list inside the other list see the second element if you see it is a list having 30 60 90 as its values again playground is the string one two three is a integer again float number is there let us understand more by creating list using ideally let me first create one empty list I have Li underscore 1 as the variable to store the list and then I open the square bracket close the square bracket there is no element available inside this square bracket that means it is empty so I just press enter so if I want to know what is Li underscore 1 I can write l i underscore 1 I will get the values of this so as it is empty it will be showing again empty to us if I want to mention the values inside the list let me create one more list here line underscore 2 is equal to let me give some values 5 comma 9 comma 1 and then also here laptop Mouse 3.45 it is a complex number one more string with double quote so now I press enter so it will be stored in list called Li underscore 2. so l i underscore 2. so here is the list having multiple values in it having different data types now let us see how do we refer each element of a list for example I have Lis is equal to and ball and the list BF string 24 7 365 are its elements as we have seen string has index numbers for each of its character here the list also will be mentioned with its index number the index number always starts from 0 when it is from left to right for example here and will be having 0 as its index number bar is 1 and the complete list that is 10 20 30 is a single list that is one single element having two assets value and then DF as a string having three acids index number 24 as 4 7 as 5 and then 365 as 6. now if you see from right to left even we can go from right to left the index number here it will start from 1 so here 365 is minus 1 7 is minus 2 so on it will be ending at minus 7. so if you want to mention the position then we can say length of list minus 1 what is length means the total number of elements in the list is only the length so the last index number will be 1 lesser than the length the index number starts from 0 but when we count we count as one two three four right or we can also have minus 1 as its index number which will be the last element if we want to say the position and then index number plus 1 when we count from left to right so let us understand clearly using ideally so here in list 2 5 will be having the index number as 0 9 will be having 1 1 will be having two laptop will be having three and so on so if I want to read the fourth element that it is a laptop here the index number is 3 so how do I read that particular element or extract that value here is I will be mentioning the name of the list l i underscore 2 and then I will open the square bracket and then I will write its index number which is 3 here so that laptop is being extracted here so similar way if I want any other value at particular index number you want to know I will be able to give l i underscore 2 in this square bracket I will mention five so the value 3.45 has appeared here similar way if the index numbers if you want to run from right to left so you can have minus 1 minus 2 like that so nice will be having minus 1 as its index number from right to left the which is the last element here in the list so let us check here Li underscore 2 of minus 1 so it will be giving nice assets answer so here there are eight elements so the length of this list will be 8. so the first element in reverse order is feature minus 8 will be that so l i underscore 2 of minus 85 U it will be the first element otherwise I can also give l i underscore 2 of 0 there so that is also indicating the first element as I said lists are mutable type that means we can change the value of an element so for example if I want to change laptop into a PC PC here 3 is the index number so what I will do it is so simple as we extract we will give Li underscore 2 of 3 in this place we need a new value so that value just we will type here that as PC there so that value is replaced here so if I see now l i underscore 2 will be with new value of the list if we are having a very big list we can also type it in the next line so for example I have l i is equal to I have a very big list for example wheat fruit vegetable rice some numbers I give here so if I want to give the next value I can just put comma and then we can write it in the next link so automatically it will take even the elements which are in the next line unless we close the bracket so now I close so the big list which is in the next line also being accepted here so l i is the list as it is so if we are having n number of values for the list we can put it into next next lines it doesn't matter hope this is very clear for you let us continue in the next class until then thank you and bye
