hello students creating game is interesting that too when ourself we write computer coding to create a game will be more interesting isn't it now as a learning process we will create a Java game program which is called guessing number let me explain this game first computer generates a number within a range player should guess the number so the range may be given by the programmer it can be said as we need if the number guessed by player is not correct then it gives a clue the clue will be whether the number guessed is smaller are greater than the number it has with this clue again player should guess the number this gets continued until the guest number is correct finally it rates you with stars to take the input we will import the scanner class import Java dot util dot scanner class card guessing you I have written the main method here now I generate a random number using math class so just I I declare and assign the value in it so I say int R is equal to a random number will give the double number so I will make it into int so I give explicit here int then math dot random off so this will create a random number between 1 and 0 if we need in between 0 and 10 what I am going to do is I am going to multiply this with 10 into 10 then plus one I terminate this now I create a object for scanner class scanner SC is equal to new scanner half system dotty now I prompt the user to view the number so I will write system dot out dot print off enter a positive number below 10 now I will assign it int n is equal to yes a dot next in tough if I want to give the ratings I need to count how many chances the user used for that I will create a counter variable that is int C so in the beginning it will be one here we need a loop because we don't know how many times the user will take so when number of iterations are not known we will be using while loop so I use while the number guessed by user is n is not equal to R which is the computer number then what it will do chance is counter here so C++ if the number given by the user is smaller so that is if n is smaller than R then what we say system dot out dot print line off that is young given whether user plus is smaller I say yes it will be greater so i copy this and paste it here and write it here as greater now I will be asking to enter another number so let me just change this enter another number no oven I store it in the variable called n is equal to yes C dot next in tough now this course keep getting executed until the guest number is number generated by the computer now we know how many chances the user has been taken so we will code according to that the ratings if the first chance itself it is right then we will give Phi star to the player if the second chance is right then we will you three stars if third chance is taken and then one single star otherwise more than that it is been taken just we say you win so let us write the code for that so that will be outside the loop if C is equal to equal to one then what we say system dot out dot print line enough we will give five stars here one two three four five backslash n gives the new line and then say congratulations so let us copy this and paste in case if it is two counts else if this to count and then we will give three star if it is threecount then we will you one single star so here is elsif yes we will you you win let us compile there is no syntax error let us run this game so let me enter a number I enter 6 so first guess itself it is right congratulations it came with 5 stars so let me play once again so now I you for 4 is smaller so the number should be greater than 4 I guess with 8 8 is greater so it should be 5 6 7 let me guess 7 congratulations so the third guess it was right so it says one single star and congratulations students I hope that you might have enjoyed this program keep watching my channel keep learning thank you
