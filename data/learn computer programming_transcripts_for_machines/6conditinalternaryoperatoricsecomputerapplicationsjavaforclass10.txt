hello students today we are going to see ternary operator ternary operator is also called conditional operators here conditional operator is a question mark this operator requires three operands I will explain this with small example program let us create a class this is like a if is condition but in a single statement so before going to learn ternary operator let us do a small program using ifelse let us consider a program to divide bigger number by a smaller number let us import 0 duck within dots connect cash this chromium stringer elements let us assign to variables to take input for dividing and then 1/5 touring the result so let us stick to variables in type int X comma Y and then let's do double Q is Q getting object for scanner class then printing segment prompting enter in my missing leg so let X Asian photo obj dot next int R + 1 let us take another input also let this one be play then now we need to divide bigger number by a smaller number so let us have a condition here if X is greater than Y then Q is equal to X divided by Y X Q is equal to Y divided by X see now you can see all these codes if condition and the else condition these all statements can be written in a single statement using ternary operator how see the variable Q is going to get the result right so we say Q is equal to the condition given yes checking whether X is greater than Y so we say X is greater than Y the condition is given after that we give a question mark that is conditional operator and then we say if this is true and the first statement now the x / y is going to be executed yes the next one Y divided by X is going to be executed that means the value of x divided by Y is storing Q if it is false then Y divided by X value stored in Q so all this code is replaced by a single statement here it is easy isn't it let us simply keep this for a while let's print no system back out back plenty enough tell you Pentecost is employable plus Q let us execute this compare this no syntax errors process let us run this program so let us do 24 and small number to suggest well so in case of test we give Mullingar and then we give big number as for people it will scan t1 so however the bigger number they will be smaller number is then so let us modify this program with turn aerial photography let it not be there click this and then let it be the code company so let us compile no syntax errors so it will do as before we did fortify them a so this Phi you asked the quotient then if you do in the other way 65 and then hundred and thirty said yes to so now we came to know that a conditional operator is a single line statement for if else condition then this is easy method to do any program in short way so this question mark is the conditional operator I hope you enjoyed this session and learn trade away Thank You Lawrence
