hello everyone in this class we are going to learn about mathematical functions in python to use mathematical functions we need math module that means math module provides access to the mathematical functions now you may have a question that what is the module module is nothing but python file which is having the extension dot py there are several modules available in python library some are available by default some we need to import to use mathematical functions math model to be important statement to import math module is very simple import a keyword and math is the module name so these two words you need to write before using the mathematical functions of pytha i have listed here most commonly used mathematical functions first one math dot sqrt and then one argument is given so this will be returning the square root of number given for example here math dot sqrt of 49 so the square root of 49 is 7 the output will be given using the floating point data type that is 7.0 next we are having math dot see love this will be returning the nearest integer by rounding up that means for example if we are having two point two see point two is lesser than five though it is lesser than five it will not consider to go to nearest integer as 2 it will go to the highest integer that means 3 on the number line next we are having floor this will be returning the integer by rounding down the number any decimal part will be just neglected and only the integer will be returned here these two are having integer data type as output you can easily remember these two functions by remembering our day to day life ceiling which is above us floor which is below us next we are having pow that means it gives the power two arguments one is the base and the other one is the power that means it returns x raised to the power y for example 2 comma 3 is there that means 2 into 2 into 2 that is 8 the output will be as floating data type next we are having math.exp this will be giving the power raised to e each value is a constant which is given here for example if we are having math dot exp of 5 then it will be returning the value which you see here next math dot f a b s that is absolute value absolute value is nothing but the position of the number from 0 on the number line either it may be left side or the right side so that means it doesn't look for the negative or positive just it sees only the position so this will be used to convert a negative value into positive value most of the time here for example minus 23 will be giving 23 as the result in floating point data type next math dot log of here you can have either one argument or two arguments if you are giving one argument and then it will be giving the natural logarithm of a number to the base e otherwise you can also give the base math dot log of 12 so that is natural logarithm of 12 will be returning next we are having log 10 of x that means it will be returning the base 10 logarithm of x so it will be more accurate than if you are giving x comma 10 in the previous one next we are having two angle related functions first one is degrees so it will be converting radians to degrees for example math dot degrees of 0.62 will be returning the value which you see here to convert from degrees to radians we use this convert angle x from degrees to radians for example radians of 40 is given there next we are also having the trigonometric function sine cos and tan sine x will be returning the sine of x radians it is not degrees remember this is radians math dot sine of 90 will be returning the value which you see here and then cos of x which returns the cosine of x radians example is given then similarly math dot tan is also there with the example we can also get the constants for example we are having math dot pi so this will be returning the constant value of pi up to 15 decimal places similarly math dot e so that is ease value it will be returning up to 15 decimal places let us check all these functions using python to use mathematical functions we need to import math module so we write first import math once we import the math module we don't need to write again and again every time we use mathematical function until the end of this session this import math statement will work in case in the program it is been imported from the point of this statement until the end of the program any mathematical functions can be used basically if you decide to use mathematical function in a program and then in the beginning itself importing is good now let us start with sqrt math dot sqrt that is square root of a number for example i am giving 81 and then nine nines are 81 so 9.0 will be returning next i have math dot floor of 90.9 iq see floor is the lower one so it will be rounding to 90 though 0.9 is higher than 0.5 mathematically it will be rounding as 91 but when we are using floor it will round down so 90 will be the answer next math dot seal of i am using 50.2 see 0.2 is lesser comparing to 0.5 though it is lesser it will be rounding to higher integer that is 51. next power math dot pow i can have two arguments for example i am giving 5 comma 3 so 5 into 5 into 5 5 is 25 25 phaser 125 next i have exp math dot exp of 2 if i give e to the power 2 this is the value it returns next math dot f a b s that is absolute value as i said it is mostly used to convert from negative value to positive value for example i am giving minus 45 so position from 0 though it is left side it is just getting the position so 45 it is returning note down the output data type also except floor and seal all these are returning floating point data type next we will see logarithmics math dot log of 25 if i give it gives natural logarithmic of 25 if i need a base if i mention base as 10 math dot log of 25 comma 10 this is the value to return we are also having math dot log 10 it is same as previous one with base 10 we have given but here this will be having more accurate value than previous one same 25 if i give so you can see at last it is giving little better value math dot log of 100 comma 2 so that is base i give 2 then this is the value which it returns next related to angles math dot degrees of say 2.2 radians 2.2 will be converted into degrees so that is 126.050 and so on degrees converting from degrees to radians math dot radians of say 45 so this is the radian of 45 degree now trigonometric functions math dot sine of say 3.5 radians so the argument is in radians not degrees so this is the value which returns next math dot cosine that is cos of for example like you 90 here so this is the value which it gives and then math dot tan of 25 so to get the constants that is math dot pi math dot pi if i give it gives the value of pi up to 15 decimal places similarly math dot e as i said these are only the common mathematical functions there are still lots of mathematical functions available i have made as a document and then given the link in the description if you want to check all the mathematical functions please download the document and then you can know about more mathematical functions available in python keep watching my videos and learn more thank you you
