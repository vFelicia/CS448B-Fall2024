dear students any language you take it will have its own advantages as well as disadvantages similarly we are going to see advantages and disadvantages of python language now advantages python is object oriented programming language a programming language that can model a real world which focuses on object and combines data and functions object oriented programming models complex things as reproducible simple structures easy to use hence it is a high level language don't need to remember system architecture it is programmer friendly learning python syntax is very easy it is interpreted language interpreted mean language which executes line by line so it becomes very easy for finding the errors even it becomes very easy for learner as it checks line by line the error can be caught by the learner in very easy manner it is expressive language countless constructs are available that help in rather than focusing on syntax it is productive the languages simplicity extensive libraries render programmers more productive than language like java c and c it is portable that means once a code is written in any platform that can be taken to other platform to run or to execute so we call it as write once run anywhere free and open source it is freely available that means you don't need to pay for downloading and installing and then even the source code is also available that means you can edit the language according to your convenient and then you can also raise distribute with the own name it is extensible that means a python can be extended to other languages you can write some of your code in language like c plus plus rc in python similarly it is also embeddable that means it is also possible to put your python code in your source code of a different language like c plus plus etc if you see the usage and applications python can be used to web applications create graphical user interfaces database applications system administrations and scripting now let us discuss about disadvantages speed as we already discussed the program is executed line by line so it will be taking lot of time if it is very big program so it is slower than the language which compiles the program full type binding so that means here we are talking about data type python is dynamically typed that means that you don't need to declare the type of variable while writing the code for example say s is equal to computer that is a string again you will be able to change the value of yes with some other data type for example it is given here float value then it becomes very difficult to find the error in the program testing time takes more conversion most of the languages have the strong syntax but python does not this results in difficulty while translating a program into another programming language libraries available in python language does not competent with other programming languages i would like to conclude by saying this there may be some disadvantages but always the popularity speaks python has become more popular nowadays thank you
