dear students today we are going to see switch case statement this is a multiple branch selection statement this selection statement tests the expression against a list of integer R character constants when the math is found the statements associated with the constant are executed let us see a example program switch case program to take the first letter of the color and print a color according to it to take a input let us import the order to fill the scanner class switch case main method complex pancake point of string of arguments let us declare a character data type to take a character input character see it's our option we hope you can take that make this so let us create an object from the scanner class and obj is equal to new scanner of stem Dalton close this let us intimately use a double pumper printing love you the first rapper dolphin color let us create a method to take input so we assign what P is equal to the object name will be J dot next of dot character character at 0 so this will take input of a single character so now water we have taken the input is for the switch case to match the option switch SW o ET CH all in small so you are going to write the option there inside o P then open up bracket so here we are going to write KS as we are going to take a character so we should give inside the single quotation so way for violet and then we have a colon here it is not a semicolon we should be very careful that this is a colon and then write the statement what it is going to say it is going to print violet so system dot out dot print line of say let's print Wireless 050 then we have to write break surplus right next case case number holdback clink leg off we go then so let us copy and paste for that and just modify this e I D be in the sense blue blue g g agree then let us again copy this paste why is yellow it is alright so we know this vector so this is power and then set and when it doesn't find any match then the default is been executed what is default where there is no match form so we write x default and then we write maybe wrong input invalid input let us compile and this give the first letter of the process I say I chase integral so now if we give the value which is not matching then it should say invalid so I owe you so it says invalid input so in case of no break there it will not break and then automatically it falls to the next case also and then that code also it X you can let us see I have deleted two breaks from V and I so let us consider this program compare this now while you V as a input so what happens if I do we even violet indigo and blue also comes because there is no break after violet and after indigo so this is called fall through let us see near one more example program which says how many days in a month so for that we just modify this program so program to say the number of days in a month so when we want to take token then we will take the input as integer so we make you then number of a month so let us take a CN and then let it be and so when we take input for one as a integer we give next int off and then we delete this switch notice en so what we supposed to both case is going to be one okay and then 3 so that means the month which all having 31 days so case 5 K 7 K 8 case 10 case 12 so when all these cases are this we don't give any other statement that our class we have not given break also so we give only one statement here number of days in this month is 31 so it is going to print 31 number of days in this month is 31 so then we will just copy and paste few ports so the months which are having 30 days fourth month sixth month ninth month then laminate so it says number of base in multis 30 then in the case of case two we say number of base in this map is 28 hi are 30 side 29 if we leave here so let us give this so in case if I say 50 month so this runs we have forgotten to give the break here so this is the case where we don't do the case it takes us everything break and then after this awesome place so after this again break so for these many cases one statement is given and then we break it and then 4 6 9 and 11 case we are given 30 days to print and then it well break and then for case 2 we are given will get our protein if it is lip here and then click so default where there is no match for 80 excuse invalid input offset printing station compare now rightclick so if I say five okay so the number of days in this meant is 13 1 clear this let's execute again per month to number of days in this man taste rotate our code in any flipping so let us see fog maybe 731 far for plate 30 nice Thank You students I hope you enjoyed learning suitcase in this class let us meet in next class and
