welcome back everyone in this class we are going to discuss about working of nested for loop in python what is nested loop when a loop is applied inside another loop it becomes a nested loop the loop which is inside the body of other loop is called inner loop and the first loop which is given outside that is called outer loop loops can be nested multiple times inside one another different types of loop also can be nested inside one another nested for loop for loop placed inside another for loops body let us understand working of this using a flowchart here one for loop is given this for loop first time it is given in the program it becomes the outer follow we know for loop works for every element of its sequence when element is available it executes the body the statements are given these statements are executed in this body itself another for loop is given this is the inner for loop now now here again elements in the sequence will be there when the elements are available it executes the statements it checks for the next element and then it will be executing again the statements once all the elements of the sequence get completed then it goes to the outer for loop for the next turn to check the next element whether it is available or not if it is available again the outer for loop executes its statement and then enters inside the inner loop again it keeps executing these many times and then once this get over it goes again to the outer loop similar way it keeps cycling like this once all the elements of this outer loop get over then it comes out of the loop it executes the other part of the program for example i made a bigger wheel and a smaller wheel bigger one is three times then the smaller if i have one cycle of this bigger wheel the smaller will run three times this you can take an example outer loop having one count and the inner loop having three count if the outer loop is having three counts then inner loop will run totally nine times let us see one example coding here for i in range one print outer loop that is i so range of one means it is going to take from zero by default 0 and then 1 is not included so only 1 for 0 it is going to run in the body of this another for loop called j here 3 times it runs j is getting printed so the output will be like this outer loop 0 inner 0 inner one inner two let us execute through the python program let me write for loop the same example as one print outer loop comma i now here i give far j in range i have three here and then i print here inner and then i give j so let us run this so you can see for router one time that is zero time inner runs three times zero one two if i increase this to 5 let me check what happens every one time of i runs j will run 3 times you can see here 0 1 2 3 4 that is 5 times every outer loop one time it runs inner loop runs three times range of five i am going to change this list here i will be giving roman letter one two three i want to run every time this one five times so what happens here i becomes this one i becomes this one i becomes this one let us check see outer loop 1 outer loop 2 outer loop 3 it looks like the roman numbers in case if i change 1 gamma 6 and then it is going to run 1 to 5 times if i need little more gap here i just give some gap so you can see that little gap is there so this is just for understanding let us meet in the next class with more programs the pattern programs i will discuss those programs in very easy manner to understand so keep watching my channel until then bye thank you
