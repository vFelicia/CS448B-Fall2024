hello everyone in this session we are going to see how to take input from the user if we talk about taking input there are various ways to take input the standard way is giving input through the keyboard if you see the graphical user interface then we will be having mouse pointer to click on the icons here we are going to see only the standard input method input is a value provided to the system by the user python has input of function to get the input from the user here is the syntax for that input and then you can give the argument inside as a string that is to prompt the user what to be given for example we can have like this a variable is equal to input of then enter your name so that means whatever you enter the name it will be referenced through n let me demonstrate using the ideally let me create the new file so new file is here example program to take the input from the user so if i want to take the input from the user i will have one reference to put it in that is a variable so for example i give name is equal to input so this will take the input but we won't have anything to mention to the user so they will have a blank screen just let me show here print name i say okay so that means it is going to take the input and then print i just save this on the desktop saying test 2 or maybe i overwrite this let me run this but user does not know what to do that blank screen has come but i will be knowing that i am a programmer here so i give here my name is jiva so it printed again to prompt the user we can use argument that is a string argument so that means i am here writing enter your name and then i give one colon and one space to bifurcate that so it looks good so here also i will use a reference line your name is and then one comma here right so now i run this you can see enter your name i say jiva so it says your name is jiva when you are using input off anything given there as a input will be taken as a string in case if you need as a value what shall we do we already know how to change the data type right one data type to another data type if you are not aware of that you can please go to my previous video and learn the conversion of data type i am using here integer of okay int off the string whatever is given so the value given by the user will be converted into integer so you will give here as a reference you your age for example is in numeric so ages i also will change the variable which gives a right meaning for it so just i say a so now i run this so enter your age in numeric i say 15 so your age is 50 okay so how do we know whether it has been converted into integer just for an example i can just add with this one here your age after your birthday is the next age right so now i say 16 it says 17 so that means it is added so it is no longer a string it has been converted to integer using this function so in case i need as a float number and then i can change it here as float and then instead of age i say enter your percentage of marks so here your percentage so whatever it is maybe a again so if i give 95.6 so it takes right now i will tell you one more thing see if i need multiple inputs say for example a comma b comma c is equal to you can also give 3 comma 4 comma 6 like this so that means it will accept a as 3 b as 4 and c as 6. so let me just print and show you c so i take away this reference from here then it will be printing here so i am not taking any input for now i make this as comment line so it will not take it as a programming code so now just i give here so you can see that 3 4 6 is taken as input okay similarly what we can do here if you want many inputs like this we can also give many inputs here say for example a comma b only let me give enter two numbers separated by space two numbers separated by space okay so if i take like this i need to split that into two different words so i will be using dot split off okay you will be learning this when you are learning the string but however we are using for input so you can remember this dot split will split the input whatever is given there that means string dot split off so there are only two i may add this and print i give a reference here sum is equal to okay so a plus b see this float will not be working with this now so i take away this i will take as a input so as a string later i can convert this after splitting it i can have int off here into a similarly in top b so i run this now 25 space 100 so you can see that has been converted into integer and then it is added so similarly way we can take many inputs like this on single statement in case the string and values are mixed doesn't matter you can also take like this you can take name here age okay and then i split this name as here name okay so i just print here name and then next if i want to print so i can put it in the next line your age after your birthday is i say here comma age plus 1 here only i will make this as integer so i take sorry i take as a string but i convert this as integer the name i don't need to convert as right so that is a string itself so let me keep like that so you can use multiple input in single statement like this so i say here my name is jiva and then one space my age is 15. okay there was n comma so that come also has appeared there it was extra we will do a small program where we take two inputs from the user and perform all the arithmetic operators so i will be changing this program to perform all the artifactic operations by using user input okay so i will be taking two input here say a comma b so i will be asking to split it i say a is equal to integer of a and then b b is equal to integer of b if you don't like this way like this i will have here integer of directly i take convert to integer now so now i will have only yes value and then for these values similarly i will have the same statement but saying b so b is equal to integer input okay so we can say enter a number and then here enter the second number okay so now i say print sum is equal to comma a plus b okay so i will make many statement of this so i make this this is a difference difference i say here product and then i give here as multiplication symbol here i make this as quotient so i will be giving here division symbol and then here i make reminder i will be saying here percentage symbol and then even i need one more there is power right so using power i can say 2 star so what i can say a raise to the power b right so all we can just perform like this if you want you can also take this as a float number so let me make both as float number so there are two equal to mark so that was an error so now you can see enter a number 10.5 second number maybe 2 iq you can see some difference product quotient remainder and then a raise to the power b i hope this is very clear to you keep watching my channel and learn thank you
