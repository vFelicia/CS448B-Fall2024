welcome back students today we are going to see unity operators before seeing unary operators let me explain what is operator let us have an example five plus six here we have two values five and six which is being operated by the symbol which is plus here the plus symbol is called an operator then five and six this both are operands so the operator operates two operands then it is binary operator okay so that is plus is a binary operator in this case same like this division and multiplication also can be binary operators if it is a unary operator then it will operate only one operand how let us see with an example program class unity public static void main string of our Nets let us have two variables here int X comma Y so I am initially Singh wise value as serving the X X is equal to Y so the wise value is going to be stored in the variable called yes let us print this well yeah yes photo plus yes so instead of Y I just u plus y so which is a unary operator here so will there be any change no there won't be any change because if plus operator proceeds the value does not change compile this so the value of X is 7 let us have minus instead of plus so the unary minus so which is going to change the value if precedes an operand operator inverts the value of n of tangle like 7 is there for y then minus 7 means ultimately it becomes minus 7 so x value is going to be minus 7 let us see here so you can see the axis minus seven the next we have increment operator and decrement operator let us see the increment operator so increment operator is given by plus plus symbol I mean we have two subtype of it that is plus plus y are y plus plus what is the difference between these two the plus plus y is called pre increment so that means before evaluating the expression the values incremented and then it is evaluated in case if it is y plus plus first the value is substituted to that variable and then after evaluating then only the value increases let us have first plus plus and then execute so the value of y is 7 it is pre increment pre means before no so the value of y becomes 8 and then it is substituted to X let us print the value of y also here so we will be clearly understanding it here the x value is 8 then wise value also it it incremented before the evaluation of only compile this so you can see X also 8 and the noise is also let us change this to post increment post increment is y plus plus see here the wise value seven the seven values first substituted are stored in X so that is x value is going to be 7 after evaluating the expression twice value is going to be changed so that is incremented by 1 that becomes 8 so Y will be 8 when it prints so X is going to be 7 after evaluating Y becomes 8 see the value of x is equal to 7 value of y is equal to 8 so this is increment the same like this decrement is also there predecrement and postdeployment predecrement is so what happens if minus y so as it is free the value of y first going to be 6 then it evaluates that means 6 is substituted to X so it is going to be Y X values 6 and then Y is value it remains 6 compile this so let us change this to post decrement so that is y minus minus C post means after evaluating right so the Y is value seven here the seven is substituted in X so there is it is stored in X so the X values seven after evaluating this expression the Y's value is decremented by 1 so that is 6 let us compile this so the value of x is 7 when your boy is six students let me again summarize this we have unary operators here that is for unary operators that is plus unary minus unary in plus unity we can't see the changes in unity we can see the change but it negates the value then increment when we come to increment part there are two types pre increment and post environment pre increment it increases the value and evaluates the expression post increments it evaluates the expression then increments same like that we have decrement operator that is so pre in predecrement it decreases the value then evaluates the expression in case of post decrement it evaluates the value and then decrease the value of the variable students I hope you understood unary operator very well let me explain some example some theoretically for your exams in next video so please watch my videos and if you subscribe this you will have an intimation whenever I upload you will get the intimation so better you subscribe and keep watching Thank You strengths
