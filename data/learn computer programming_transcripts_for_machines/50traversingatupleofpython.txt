[Laughter] hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to learn traversing a tle let us directly learn from the python ideal e let us consider this stle v w which is having all the Ws now if we want to Traverse from left to right that is a to U we will be writing a far Loop for I in we can directly give the tle there v w now every time far Loop prints I becomes an element of the tle so first time it runs I is equal to a second time e like that it will be continuing until youu when there is no element there it stops let us just print this if we run this AE IOU one below other will be displayed this can also be done using the range function when we use range function I becomes 0 to the 1 before the stop so range Len of v w we can give so that automatically takes the length length will be 1 plus than the last index so automatically it will be stopping at last index that is use index now when we want to print this I is the integer there so so we will write v w in the square bracket I so that it takes that particular index value so this also will give the same result if we want to Traverse from right to left that is u i e a like that then we shall give here it should be starting from the index minus one which is rightmost and then it should be stopping at minus the length so if we give minus Len of it will not take a it will stop at e so we subtract one more from that it goes up to a then the step is must because it is traversing from right to left so here minus one now this will be running from right to left same thing also can be used using the while loop for that we need to create I say index I and D is equal to 0 here we will write while loop while I and is lesser than Len of v w now here instead of I I and D I have given so I change this and then every time we need to increase the index it will not automatically increase as in the for Loop we will increment this I and D+ equal to 1 so this is from left to right in case we need from right to left we shall give here 1 we shall make this greater than or equal to minus Len of v w and then here we will be decrementing as it is from right to left so I give minus here so this will Traverse from right to left if you need to put it in the same line we can give end equal to and then in the code one comma there and then even a space now it will be printing in the same line hope it was very clear to you all let us meet in the next class thank you
