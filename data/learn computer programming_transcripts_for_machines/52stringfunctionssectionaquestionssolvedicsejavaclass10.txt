welcome back students let us continue using string functions in a single statement convert the following such that the first letter is in uppercase and rest all are in lower case here string s is equal to Rama in are given in mixed case it is indicated to use only string functions so we have to take the first letter and then convert into uppercase to convert to uppercase we know string dot to uppercase we will give and then to change into lowercase leaving the first letter all other letter should be taken then dot to lowercase we supposed to you so how to extract the first letter using string functions we know that we have substring so we can you yes dot substring of 0 comma 1 so that will take only character at index 0 and rest it will not take dot to uppercase we can give and then we have to combine that one and other all lower cases so we will you dot concat now we can give yes dot substring of 1 so from starting one rest all will be taken dot to lower case of we terminate I will delete this code and paste that one and also the answer line so we have to print otherwise we will not get the out no I will close this so you can see that it is being converted as we need so we'll go to next question what is the output of the following Java code string M is equal to Mississippi so printing statement m dot last index of I yes so let us write the index number first so we are having index starting from zero to nine we are finding for a combination of I and s combination of I and s available in two places it has been asked to find the last index R so the second time it is available is starting from four so four will be the answer the first letters index only will be given compile this no syntax error so four is right answer let us go to next question what is the output of the following code yes one is given s Java yes two also given as Java string s 3 is equal to new string of s1 so here we can see object is Creator system dot out dot print enough s 1 equals s 2 so again yes 1 equals s 3 so yes 1 equal to equal to symbol is given that is relational operator and then s 2 is given in the nest 1 equal to equal to s 3 ok so here this is a string function it will check whether both are equal or not the output will be boolean type so this will be true both are same it will be true the next one s 1 equals s 3 so s 1 is stored so that is true here yes three is name of the object and then yes one equal to equal to s2 that is also true when it comes to yes one equal to equal to s 3 it will be false because yes 3 is name of the object only there so I will select this space that one compile no syntax error so you can see true true true false let us go to the next question what will be the output of the following code so printing statement page number that is a string plus 12 plus 2 so only one statement here so by seeing this numericals you will add both and then you will put page number 14 as the answer many times it happens but see page number is the string it cannot add page number under 12 so it will you page number beside that 12 again that with that 2 cannot be added so it will you just beside that so that is the plus symbol is here just concat so we will get page number 1 to 2 as the answer I want to recall about the operator precedence when operators are in the same precedence then associativity rules also there so it will be from left to right let me compile so you can see page number one next question which package should be imported in Java program to get input using scanner class inputstreamreader so we already used many times scanner classes in util package so we will write Java dot util and then input stream reader will be Java dot IO next question given a package computer not laptop write a Java statement to import a class named keyboard contained in this package so the package name is computer not laptop and the class contain is keyboard in it so to import this we should write the import statement import so this is the package so we write computer dot laptop then dot the name of the class so that is keyboard and then we terminate next question if character X is equal to M write a Java statement to check whether X is having character if not we have character class to check whether it is character or not so in that we will you character dot each letter of X so whatever is stored in X it will check whether it is letter that is a character so I will delete this yes that so we have to print and then we also need X system dot out dot print line off so we need the input for X so character X is equal to let us cue em here compile this no syntax error so we can also use digit let me show that also so if we have int type then we can check in p.m. for example if we check digit so it will be yum miss a character here it will say false so it will be false so if it is a number there for example if I give 8 it should be true now so it is true so here we have given XS integer type but we have enclosed in the single quotation s character still it is having the value of digit so it will you true only this is just for your clarification I showed you let us go to the next question given in PN is equal to 25 write a Java statement to convert en to string type to convert into string type from integer so we can give integer dot to string of so in the bracket we can use the integer variable I will copy now so the problem statement int n is equal to 25 was there so how do we know whether it is converted to string type not let us give a printing statement and then we will add something with that system dot out dot print line enough so with this let us add Phi U so if it is not converted then it will give 30 as the answer otherwise it will give 25 beside Phi that will become 255 compile this no syntax error you can see 255 as the answer so that is 25 string now then Phi has come beside that let us see next question if string s is equal to 20 write a statement to convert to parameter of double data type see here 20 is given inside the quotation that is string type yes to convert into double data type we can have double dot to value of so that is yes inside the bracket here so whatever the value available for that string it will be converted into double value so it will give 20 point 0 as the answer so I will paste so again we have to print this so instead of simply printing let us add something with this already 20 is that 30 I add double data type I'll use something 0.45 compile this it has an error because of this quotation here sometimes we copy from the other application the quotation becomes different so let us give straight quotation compile this no syntax error so fifty point four five so it is converted into double data type it is sure next question write a Java statement to input character using scanner class to use scanner class we know we have to create the object so we will write scanner obj is equal to new scanner system dot in and then to input a character we need first a variable for character vu any variable there is equal to obj dot next up it will take the string so to take only one character we suppose to you dot character at 0 so this will take one single character from the user so I will replace this core so compile this no syntax error so I will run this so here I give yell so you can see that it is taken one input students I hope many type of questions I have given you can also practice questions from other sources are you can also create your own questions to confirm the answer you can run on the Java program having more practice will lead you to get very high score in the exam keep watching my channel even share to others Thank You students
