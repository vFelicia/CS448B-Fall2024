dear students today we are going to see calling parameterised function new class calling class calling let us like that method this userdefined method so static our public static status wide let us find one you so wanting power so volume to find the P we need three variables right into length into breadth and intake so let us have a variable integer variable to store the result as B is equal to length into breadth into height let us print this system dot out dot print line up so what we are going to print is here volume is equal to plus e so now this program will run if you want to call this method let us have all mode method which is a main method public static void main string of arguments let us create a object for the class so to create object for the class we have to write the class name calling and then object name that is identified that can be anything so let us I will be there will be object itself object is equal to MU this is a keyword and then you're calling so after writing this we have to call using the object name so object dot whatever the name of the method so that is we were right we were Elif so you can see here three parameters which is given in the method prototype this parameter is called formal parameter and then when we use the parameter here in the method call this is called actual parameter we can give the values here so let us have value 15 20 and stay so these values is just given here is called actual parameter that's a we can run this program now compile no syntax error so let us run this program so you got the internal scrolling is equal to 3000 so here we wrote a method userdefined method which is volume and then we call this volume here in the next method which is a main method here I hope you understand how to call a method in another method please watch my next video for future reference Thank You students
