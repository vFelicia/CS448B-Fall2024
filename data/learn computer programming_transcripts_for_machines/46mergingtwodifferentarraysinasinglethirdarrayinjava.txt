welcome back students in this lesson we will see how to melt two arrays in n single array so let us consider array like this and the other away is also given the third array will be combination of both the arrays like this let us go to program will create in class to take inputs I will write import statement probably startup why may now finger arguments throws exception let me create a object far tougher reader to take the array let us take the size first so I am giving intimation to you the size system dot out dot print line off enter the size of first away Clint let us consider name of the array s X so that length of that array we will give X L so int x TL is equal to integer dot parse int our BR dot read right now now let us create a array integer type Y X is the name of the array is equal to nu into half the size is axial we will ask the user to enter the elements of that array so system dot out dot print line off enter the elements are there so we have to take a far loop for this far in pi is equal to zero is lesser then Excel I plus plus so we can go X of pi is equal to integer dot parse int of BR dot little enough in the parameter so now we have to take the second array we will repeat the process so I will copy and just make the changes so enter the size of second away here and then let us have Y as the length here also Y so Y L will be the length of the array Y will be the name of that array so enter the elements for array then here we will have y n then also here over here now we need a third array to combine both the above RS so length of the array will be length of both together so we will create in Sadoff is equal to new in half so that is length of EXR aplus linty weii otherwise we can also do like that that l is equal to these two together we can assay so now we can write here only Z del so that'll is the length of the arrays that we will write integer here now we will copy the elements of first array to the third array so we will write for loop for int I is equal to 0 the length of the first array will be Excel so until that whatever the element is available we will put it in side first so I is lesser than Excel then I plus plus so rosada ie will have the value of x of I so all the values of x array will put it into Z now so after this we will have another of a far int I is equal to so now we have already put all the elements of X into Z the last index of X will be the beginning index of next far loop so that wise value will be added in the next index so we will initialize is XL and then I is lesser than so del then I plus plus so now what we do we will say Z dot I is equal to yr J I take so here again we can't take ie because ice values starting from the XL so we will take a new variable called J then we will be Claire and initialize it so how do we declare in farlow picture we can do so that is J is equal to zero and then we will say here J plus plus so value at Z F I will be the first value of y z element so now we have merged both arrays let us just print the new array which is Z so far in I is equal to 0 I is lesser than the del I plus plus system dot out dot print za da hai plus we can give one tab space otherwise some space one stressor this is printing in the same line we will give the new line after this so that new output will be in the fresh line so I think we have already closed the method and class let us check once so here we have taken the input while copying let us see whether we changed everything this is fine this is fine just fine okay see here we suppose to write WiFi so that is the second of it and then so this is correct so this is for the third array so let us compile this no syntax errors so we can run now enter the size first array are you for the value is 10 20 30 40 then the size of second array you 5 are you 12 14 16 18 20 so you can see that both the Rays are combined to there Thank You students
