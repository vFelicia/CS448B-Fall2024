foreign in this class we will see all the remaining string functions string dot is title of this will check whether the given string is in the title case that means every first letter of a word supposed to be in capital in title case it is going to check that if it is correct and then it will be returning true for example James Bond you can notice that J and B both are in capital letters so it will be giving true as the result we can also check whether the string given is ending with a particular substring or character for that we are having ends with function for example James Bond dot ends with ND see you can notice that b o n d that is e n d is the last letter there so it is ending with ND it will be giving true as the result similar way we can also check whether the string is starting with some substring or a character for example James Bond dot starts with and then essay so here it is starting with j a not S A so it is going to be false we can also replace any character or a substring in the string with the new string or character for that we are having replace a function here we will have two arguments one is the old string which you want to replace and the second one is the substring or a character which you need to put it for that world for example James replace see I am giving here m e s to replace with k i e so j a k i e will be the result sometimes we may need to remove the character or a substring from the beginning of a string are in the end of the string for that we are having strip of function that we are having three different ways one of that is L strip and then the characters as the argument it will be removing the given character our substring from the left side of a string when I don't give the character it will be removing the white space character is optional when I demonstrate I will be showing that with the character now I have given here space for example so the white space before James is being removed being it is L strip L indicates left similar way we can also have R strip that means right strip the character given can be removed or else it will remove the white space you can notice that Bond and then some white spaces are there dot R strip it removes all the white space right side only bond is given as output if we want to remove from both the sides instead of giving l r r without indicating that we will give strip so string dot strip of will remove the white space when there is no argument when there is a character or substring argument it will remove that you can see here both the side white spaces are there with gems I have given strip of it gives James without any white spaces split is a function which will be returning the list putting all the words as its elements for example James Bond not not 7 dot split of each word that is James as an element Bond as an element not not seven as an element in a list string dot partition of a substring this returns a list but only with three elements that means whatever the substring given to partition will be an element before and after whatever is left over will be other elements for example James Bond not not seven partition here the partition is o n so y n is the middle element previous element will be whatever is before on so James space b and then the last element will be o n after that whatever is available that will be there string dot join off then argument is string iterable this will be joining each member of a stitching iterator after the string so it will be repeating until string iterator gets sent for example serial number is the string Join one two three so here one serial number then two serial number then 3. each character of a string will be appearing before the string until all the elements of string iterable get over let us understand all these string functions more clearly on python window I will demonstrate with different way of inputs so keep watching St 1 is equal to VR learning computer programming now I give ST1 dot is title of see title case means every first letter of the word supposed to be in capital letter here it is not there so it will be showing false cst2 is equal to W in capital e a in capital r e and then learning okay see L is not a capital s t 2 Dot is take love this is false now let us check for the right one st3 is equal to we are watching YouTube to learn now it is going to be true st3 dot is title of now let us check for ends with ST1 Dot ends with I give the argument here it ends with ing right I will give ing here true in case if I give St one dot ends with in even I can give a single letter it is going to be false now yes T1 Dot ends with IU learning so this is also not true let me give programming fully ST1 dot ends with foreign programming see actually there is a spelling mistake here I have written progo roaming so let me have the same spelling here so it is true let me check for starts with st2 Dot starts with that is we are learning right so let me give here which will be false now let me give the right one st2 dot starts with V is true we can also check whether the given string is available in the substring of the original string for example I have here we are learning Python programming Dot starts with I wanted to check whether it is starting with learn so I am checking from the substring that means I will be giving the range here the index number of L is 7 so I will be giving 7 the ending I will be giving us some 15. so this will be giving true as index number of L is 7 and then it has learn from there now I wanted to check by taking this range whether it ends with REM so I should be knowing that index number of starting and ending of this range I know the starting is 7 and the ending M I will be taking rhodi index I will copy this Dot index of that is the first M so it will be showing the index number of need area so it is 29 so now I will be checking ends with I give Ram Ram then I start from 7 see when we give ending number that is not included so we supposed to give 13 stuff 29. so it is true now let us check replace our we will replace the tst1 ST1 is with the error in the programming spelling so I wanted to replace to write one s t 1 Dot replace of g o is the wrong one and then instead of that I will be giving G here see it will be returning the new string it is not going to update the old string because it is immutable so we will check ST1 will be remaining as it is immutable now if we want to replace and store it in s t 1 itself we can also you like the ST1 is equal to so it is replacing and again rewriting into ST1 now it will be storing the new string so let us check now ST1 is with right spelling hope you understood this now if I want to strip for example I give programming Dot I will be using L strip of I wanted to just remove Pro so I give here Pro and then close So Pro will be removed and then the new string starts with gramming if I have space before the string like this I don't give anything in the argument so it will be removing the space similar way R strip works for the right side Python and I give some space there and then R strip sorry dot is missing there so now you could see that extra space is removed and only python is there as a string if I want to remove YN from there dot RS Tripp and then I wanted to remove on right so on IQ here it will be removed if I give generally strip without having lrr there it will be removing from both the ends for example I start on python Dot strip of on a u again here so you could see that when is removed from the beginning it starts from the space and also removed from the end let us check the split function string functions are good to learn Dot split off it will be splitting each and every word and put it into a list now partition off dot partition of I want to partition Pion from there before t i y and whatever is available it will be one element Pion is one Element and then remaining space r good will be one element in case if I give partitioning at the beginning itself for example string functions Dot partition of I give string here that is the starting itself so what will be the result of this the beginning will be empty string is the middle one and the ending will be remaining there was a spelling mistake again here so let me Rectify here you could see that beginning is empty and the string is the partition one which we have given and the ending on similar way if we are giving the ending as the partition here I give p i o n s again the faulty one I copied here so this is the right spelling so at the end it is empty now let us check the join function roll number I give then one space I give to bifurcate this Dot join off I give one two three for better understanding one two three so each character is a iterator now I will be seeing one roll number two roll number and then three if I give a space with one two three and then I will be getting 1 2 3 also with roll numbers so I give here one space there you could see that right let us check whether we have executed everything this title ends with starts with replace L strip R strip split partition joint yes we have done everything please keep watching this channel keep learning and also don't forget to share to others those we need so that they also learn thank you
