hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to learn break statement one of the jump statements jump statements are used to skip some lines of code in the loop there are two main jump statements one is break the other one is continue these statements are also called as loop control statements as it decides whether to continue or break the loop break statement using for loop for variable in sequence the statement 1 is executed and then here is a condition and then break when the condition becomes true and then it breaks the loop when the condition is not true it will be executing statement two statement three continuously when all the variable in the for loop get completed and then no more thing to execute and then it comes out of the loop at that time one more statement is there to execute this is the general format when this condition is true then what happens it breaks the loop and then statement 2 and 3 will not get executed immediately it jumps to the fourth statement i will demonstrate the same using the python so that it will be easy for you to understand just i write a for loop for i in range 7 comma 14 now just i wanted to print a statement maybe in the loop now let me also print the value of i print i when the loop get completely executed it will be coming out of the loop let me show one more message here that is outside the loop print loop successfully executed so here there is no break statement let me show you how the output is so in the loop 7 in the loop 8 so until 13 the 14 is not included you know that now let me introduce the break statement here with a condition i will give a condition when it is divisible by 10 then it breaks so if i mod 10 equal to 0 so there is no remainder then it should be breaking break so what happens then when it comes to 10 before this condition this will be printing but this condition is true for 10 it breaks without printing 10 number now let me change this as terminated by the break statement just for reference so now we can see when it is 10 it didn't print this 10 number here and then it jumped out of the loop so this is the break statement in for loop while loop while condition statement 1 if condition and break statement 2 statement 3 outside the loop statement 4 similar way when the if condition becomes true and then it breaks jumps out of the loop and then statement 4 is execute let me also show you through python program now for a while loop i need to initialize a variable so i give x is equal to 7 now while x is lesser than 14. now i print in the loop and also print x now outside the loop i print loop successfully executed before this we need to increment the x value x plus equal to 1. let me execute this so you could see the same output now let me introduce the condition if x mod 5 is equal to 0 i am just changing this however the result is going to be same as it start from 7 first number which is divisible 5 is going to be 10 only i just break this i change this also here terminated by break so you can see the similar output hope the concept is very clear to you let us meet in the next class with continue statement thank you
