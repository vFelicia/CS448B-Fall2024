foreign in this lesson we will see how to slice the strings in Python let us understand first what is slicing slicing is a way to access a part of string or substring we can say slicing is done using index range now let us know General format to slice a string string and then open the square bracket and then there can be maximum three numbers that is integer numbers given first one is the start that is the starting index number and the next one is the stop that is also a index number and step is the integer where how many steps to jump here please note the start is including the mention number but the stop is not included that means the mentioned number is not included previous to that it stops and the step by default it is one when it is not given please note that each one start stop and step is bifurcated using the colon let us see some examples now foreign let us take Str is equal to Learn Python here is the first example Str of one colon 4. so immediately we can just note down the index numbers for the string given it starts from 1. and then it ends at 4 but 4 is not included so that means stop minus 1 that is 3 so 1 2 3 ear is the output strf 2 is to 10 is to 3 remember the third option is not compulsory that means the steps either you can give or skip if you are not giving that is taken as 1 as default value here it starts at 2 and then ends at 10. that means 2 to 9 it will take but in that the step will be 3 so it will be taking 2 and then 5 that is 3 and 4 are skipped then 6 and 7 are skipped the third one is eight the output here we can see is a space t we also know that characters in this string are also mentioned using the reverse order that is with minus indexes let us see an example for that Str of minus 2 is to minus 7 is to minus 1. so let us write this string indexes in reverse order you need to remember this minus 1 is mentioned as it's from right to left the default value of step is 1 only it is plus one it is never minus one so in case you are mentioning or it is mentioned in the beginning that is the start is the bigger number and the stop is the smaller number then it should be from the right to left so now it starts from minus 2 and then it will be going up to 6 that is minus 7 is not included we know that so the output will be o h t y p let us see the next example both mixed and positive and negative indexes strf 1 is to minus 7. so we are having both the indexes here it starts from 1 and then ends at minus 7. so this minus 7 is not included it should be stopping at minus 8 so it will be from left to right so the step is plus one only so that is the reason it is not given here so the output will be e a r n let us understand little more if start index is not mentioned it assigns 0 as default value if stop index is not mentioned it takes up to the end of the string let us see some examples we will have same Str is equal to Learn Python only strf blank and 4 that is start is not mentioned it means it will take from 0. so from 0 index number 3 it will take 4 is not included there we know already so l e a r will be the output Str of 8 semicolon and blank that means the stop index is not mentioned in this case it will take from the start index and then the remaining up to the end whatever characters are there it includes everything so here y t h o n will be the output Str of blank is to blank is to minus one that means start and stop both are not mentioned here the step is minus 1 start from right side and ends at left side so that means it will be reversing the string it will take n to l let us execute all these on the python window let me take S1 s interface window I will slice 9 to 13 so that means yes or no 9 is to 13. so it will be taking 9 10 11 12 13 is not included let me check the indexes 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 so 9 is the space and then 10 11 12. so space w i n will be the answer right now I will give only the stop so yes one now let me give 9 here so it should be from the beginning to 9 so that is interface fully it should come yes 9 is not included so the space is not included it came until e now let me give without the stop yes one now from 10 I will start we know the space is 9 so that from 10 window fully it came now let us introduce this step here I will start S1 from 3 is to I will give up to 9 is to the step is 2 so that means it will be starting from 3 so that is 0 1 2 3 so 3 is e it will take R it is going to skip and then f it will take a it will Skip and then see it will take then later space is there that is 9 it is not going to be included so let us execute this so it is right let me give now minus index S1 of minus 12 is to minus 15 I'll give and then remember this is going from right to left the step is minus 1 so r e t so let us check this output 1 that is minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 minus 4 minus 5 minus 6 minus 7 minus a minus 9 minus 10 minus 11 minus 12 so it is minus 12 R is taken minus 13 minus 14 is not included so r e t it has come right now let me give S one of bigger to smaller I give 9 is to 2 but I am not giving the steps now see bigger to smaller means it will be from right side to left side that means it is going in reverse the step supposed to be 1 but I am not giving the steps so when the steps is not given it is taken as 1 by default one means it will be going from left to right so it cannot go like that then the output will be empty string similar way yes or now 2 is to 9 I give and the step is minus 1. see that this is also not possible because 2 to 9 is from left to right but minus 1 is right to left here also it will be giving the empty string now let me mix positive and negative both the index numbers S one of I start from 5 and then end at minus 8. so 5 is f here minus 8 is let us check minus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. so minus 8 is e which will not be included so fpsc should be the output now I am leaving yes or no minus 8 is to minus 1. I have given minus 8 so from right side it will be coming and then the end is not given so end is not given means it will be taking from minus 8 remaining until the beginning that means from right to left let us check what is the output here you can see that it is reversed interface if you give yes or no blank blank and minus 1 it will completely reverse so you could see that interface window now I will slice the string and put it into S2 that is S1 of let me give blank and then 5. now I am writing yes 3 is equal to yes or now five and blank see S2 is from the starting to the 5 and then S3 is from 5 to the end now if I join both we will be getting the same original string S2 Plus S3 even if we give the negative index like this it is going to be same let me take yes or now blank and then minus 6 Plus minus 6 and blank so it is the original string let me give this top as more than the last index we can take also the last index by calculating the length and 1 let us take lenov S1 so it is 16 the last index number will be 15. let me give more than this one now 7 is to 25 it will be going until the end of the string there won't be any problem in this but let me give yes or now minus 25 is to 25 so minus 16 supposed to be the first letter but I have given minus 25 the stop index number is more than the last index let us check what happens this also gives the full string so it is available from minus 16 it will take and then it takes until the end of the string now I give S one now the beginning is minus 1 is 2 and then ending I am not giving the step is minus 1. so this also will be reversing the string as end is not given it will reach until the beginning of the string now you will be having clear idea of slicing the strings in Python keep watching my channel keep learning keep sharing thank you
