[Laughter] hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to learn different ways to create a dictionary in Python first let us learn creating dictionary using parameters dict is a function or method which will convert the given argument into dictionary here we are going to give the default parameters if you don't know what is default parameters not to worry now we will learn when I we teaching user defined functions now if I have a key and value pair names and their age kirana is equal to 12 see here K is a parameter so we will not put that in the quotation it is not a string so it is a variable Pana is equal to 23 and then one more raka is equal to 16 see there you could see a dictionary creating a dictionary using list of tles n number of items can be created using tles in a list so I create a list here inside this I will be creating tles 5 comma 7 another one 3 comma Ravi another tle here Risha comma 35 see this is a list having many tles as a argument of dictionary so DCT off dictionary has been created we can also give the tle instead of list so let me just copy this same so instead of list it can also so be a tle that means a nested tle it is remember but whatever you give it's supposed to be a key and value pair there is only two elements available in each tle let us execute this creating a dictionary using zip function in a dictionary function we will have zip function here we will have two arguments as tles having equal length so I am creating a tle here 1 2 3 4 5 and then bated with comma another tle 10 20 30 40 50 see both are having the equal length I close the zip function I close the dictionary so now you could see a dictionary having first element is to first element second element is to Second element similar way n number of elements can be given in the tle what happens if it is not of equal length so let us try from the second tle I reduce two values here so now first having and the second having three it will match with the shortest length and then create the dictionary similar way even if it is first one is having lesser and the second one is having the more it will take the shortest creating a dictionary with many keys but with same value here I will be having di do from keys and then I will have many keys as a list for example 2 4 6 8 10 okay the next I need same value for all these keys right I say even then I close this so two is to even 4 is to even 6 is to even similar way it will be creating one value with many keys hope all these methods are very clear to you instead of this list we can also give the tle let us execute with that so I change this list into a tle this also does the same thing I hope all the methods are clearly understood keep watching my channel keep learning keep sharing thank you
