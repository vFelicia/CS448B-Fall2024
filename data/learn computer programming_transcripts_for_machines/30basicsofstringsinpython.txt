hello everyone welcome back in this class we are going to start learning strings in python a string is a sequence of characters in python it is not only in python most of the language it is same a string is mentioned inside the single or double quotes for example book which is inside the single quote similar way we can also put it into double quote computer language a string with multiple lines is written inside the triple quotes either using a single or double quotes for example a single quote three times it is given in the beginning we are learning string in python language and it is ended with single code three times similar way even we can use double quote three times in the beginning and the end even it may be a single line we can use triple quotes let us know how do we initialize the string general format is here variable that is an identifier assignment operator in the single quote a string example here str1 is equal to cell phone in single quote similar way it can also be given in the double quote variable is equal to string in double quote example string 2 is equal to change in double quote we can also use three times single quote str3 is equal to three times single quote different three times single quote similar way even we can use double quote three times str4 is equal to remote within three times of double quote remember here the code which you are giving in the beginning and the end it should be same you cannot mix single and double together the length of the string is the number of characters present in it for example length of str1 is 9 which is cell phone here note a string enclosed with triple quotes without referring a variable in the program is considered as comment line or comment lines hence it will not be taken as a programming code and get interpreted referring characters in the string for example i have str is equal to learn python each letter is referred with its index number the index number from left to right always starts with 0. here learn python is the example l will be having the index number as 0 e is with 1 and then so on when it comes to space that is also considered as one character so it will be indicated as 5 here and then p with 6 up to 11 here in python even the string in reverse having the index numbers so when it is from right to left it starts always with 1 here in example n will have minus 1 as the index number and then o as minus 2 and then so on so at last minus 12 will be the first index number for the example given so the index number of the last character is length of string minus 1 if you take from left to right so the total length will be 12 here 12 characters are present here the last index number is 11 as it starts from 0. if you are counting from right to left and then it will be minus 1 position of the character is index number of the character plus 1 that is considering index number from left to right note there is no character data type in the python language a single character inside the code is considered as a string with the length 1. let us understand more clearly by executing on python i am using here script mode let me initialize a string say str 1 is equal to python str 2 equal to i put it in single quote now computer language str 3 is equal to i enclosed this with 3 times of single quote 1 2 and 3 i write here we are learning and then in the next line i write python string now when i close this again three times of single quote let me print all this print str1 comma str 2 comma str 3 if you want to bifurcate into next next lines let me also add here a new line let me execute this so you could see here python computer language we are learning python string in case i mismatch this quote for example i have started with single quote i end with double quote three times so there is an error it shows otherwise i have one double quote and then one single quote which looks like three times of single quote this is also mismatch so you have to match this codes i am just removing all these from here now i will let you know two string functions see actually string functions elaborately we will learn in future classes but here just i wanted to show to understand the length of the string to get the length of the string we use len of the string name or directly string let me print it print len and then open the bracket the string name that is variable i can give str1 close this and then close the print one here six letters are there so it should be printing six as the result you can see the same thing now if i want to know the index numbers i have a function called index of print open the bracket the reference string name or string we need to give str1 dot index off whichever letters index you need that letter you can give in the quota for example i give h here so we know the index number of h is three three times code without referring to the variable it becomes the comment line so it will not be interpreted the rest of the things only will work you could see it is working as before thing i put it into a variable called a is equal to then i try to print a here it will be printing if i want to extract the particular character at some index number i just put in the print statement so that it displays print str1 open the square bracket and give the index number there for example i give 5 and then close this now at 5 n is there so the length of this str1 is 6 the last index is 5 let me take away these so you could see that n is printed there in case reverse or last character's index number will be minus it is again going to print n the length you take and just add minus to that we giving the first letter let me change this as 6 here so it is b hope the concept is very clear keep practicing and learning thank you
