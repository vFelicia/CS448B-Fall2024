00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to kind of
00:02 - the first official machine learning
00:04 - tutorial were actually gonna be writing
00:06 - code and reading in data so in this
00:08 - video essentially we're gonna be getting
00:10 - a big data set and we're gonna be
00:11 - minimizing that data set to use the
00:14 - valuable information out of it which is
00:16 - very important and is honestly probably
00:18 - the hardest thing with machine learning
00:19 - is getting your data in the right form
00:21 - and using proper and valid data and then
00:24 - we're gonna be actually in the next
00:26 - video implementing it's called a linear
00:28 - regression algorithm to predict grades
00:31 - based on kind of student behavior in
00:34 - student past grades so that's a data set
00:36 - we're going to be using it's actually
00:37 - what I have open here which I'm going to
00:38 - talk about in just a second but before I
00:40 - move into all of that I just want to say
00:42 - that if you'd like to follow along with
00:43 - the tutorials and see all of the code
00:44 - have all of the data go to my website
00:46 - tech with Tim net if you go to the
00:49 - tutorials page here you will see I I
00:51 - know you don't see it right now but
00:52 - it'll be a little box here that says
00:54 - machine learning with Python and if you
00:56 - click on that you'll find the tutorial
00:58 - series and you could go through and it's
01:00 - gonna have all the code all of the data
01:01 - everything that I write in kind of some
01:03 - descriptions as well it's not gonna be
01:05 - as extensive as the video but just in
01:07 - case you want to get all the code and
01:08 - stuff it'll be on the website so I
01:10 - recommend you follow along with that and
01:11 - that's gonna be for the future of all
01:13 - these machine learning videos as well ok
01:16 - so back to our data now with machine
01:18 - learning data is obviously the most
01:21 - important part by far now the algorithms
01:24 - are actually fairly easy to implement
01:25 - but we have to implement them on certain
01:28 - data and our data has to be in a correct
01:29 - form in a correct shape and it has to be
01:32 - well valid data like it has to make
01:34 - sense right so essentially what I'm
01:36 - doing is I'm just gonna download a data
01:37 - set off of this UCI machine learning
01:39 - repository website and they have a ton
01:42 - ton of ton of datasets so I just picked
01:45 - this one because I thought it was kind
01:46 - of interesting student performance data
01:48 - set and essentially you guys can read
01:49 - the data set information this link will
01:51 - be in the description and on my website
01:52 - as well and it goes through a bunch of
01:55 - things that I want to walk through them
01:56 - with you so that if you want to pick
01:58 - your own data sets off the website you
01:59 - kind of know how to do that and what all
02:01 - these different things mean so probably
02:04 - some of the more important things I
02:06 - guess actually I'm just gonna read
02:07 - through them all and I guess I'll talk
02:08 - about them as we go so data set
02:10 - characteristics here and I'll show you
02:12 - these all on the main page
02:13 - when you select datasets as well
02:15 - multivariate of just means it has I
02:17 - believe more than two variables so you
02:19 - don't just have like one variable
02:20 - corresponding to the other one there's a
02:22 - ton of different attributes that will
02:24 - apply to a certain label or
02:25 - classification characteristics don't
02:28 - worry about that attribute
02:29 - characteristics that's actually
02:30 - incorrect but associated tasks
02:32 - classification regression this is just
02:35 - what it's good for typically you can
02:36 - obviously use this data set with other
02:38 - kind of algorithms but that's what it
02:39 - recommend is number of instances is how
02:42 - many instances are like people or in
02:44 - this case students are actually in the
02:46 - data set number of attributes is how
02:48 - many attributes for every single
02:51 - instance okay quick sidenote
02:52 - if you guys hear me like coughing or
02:54 - notice I'm a little bit uh no that's
02:57 - good I usually am I am a little sick
02:58 - right now so if you notice my boys'll
03:00 - raspy please excuse me so it data set
03:03 - information essentially this is good to
03:06 - read kind of tells you how they got the
03:07 - data what it's from it's not crazy
03:10 - important but I mean kind of tells you
03:11 - what all these attributes are meant for
03:12 - and then attribute information this is
03:16 - like each property of a student right or
03:18 - attribute is obviously the best way to
03:19 - say it and it'll go through what the
03:21 - name of the attribute is and then all of
03:23 - the different values that could be
03:25 - associated with that so for us we're
03:27 - gonna want to deal with integer
03:28 - attributes so already anything that says
03:30 - like male female if we don't want to use
03:32 - these because unless we're going to
03:35 - transfer them transfer them into like a
03:37 - zero or one just can be more difficult
03:39 - later on there's stuff like study time
03:42 - failures like you can read through these
03:43 - and see what they all are and each data
03:45 - set will have astron information
03:46 - typically the most important attributes
03:49 - for us in this data set are gonna be the
03:50 - grades so grade 1 grade 2 and grade 3
03:52 - and pretty much we could just use these
03:55 - two grades to predict what a final grade
03:57 - would be and that would give us a fairly
03:59 - accurate result but I want to make sense
04:00 - some of these other attributes as well
04:02 - and see what we can do with them okay so
04:05 - what's the data we're gonna be using to
04:06 - download that go to data folder go to
04:09 - student zip it'll download the zip for
04:11 - you I already have a download so I'm not
04:12 - gonna do that and then when you open up
04:14 - the zip let's go to my downloads here
04:16 - alright it'll look something like this
04:18 - click on student match and then just
04:20 - drag that into whatever directory you're
04:22 - working ok because you can use this
04:24 - Portuguese one it'll be the exact same
04:25 - process
04:26 - except - PR instead of Matt when you
04:29 - were importing it but this is just a
04:31 - math class to support chi-chi's class
04:33 - I like the math class better personally
04:34 - so that's what I'm gonna use okay so now
04:37 - that we are actually we're in Python so
04:39 - I'm in what you call this here
04:42 - hi charm we're actually going to need to
04:43 - just set up a few things before we can
04:45 - actually start importing our data so in
04:47 - the last tutorial I installed some
04:49 - packages we need to actually install
04:51 - some more packages that I forgot about
04:52 - so excuse me for that but essentially
04:55 - we're gonna activate our environment
04:56 - again - a fresh reminder we can just do
04:59 - activate and then my case I called my
05:01 - tensor so we're gonna do that and I've
05:03 - already done that you can see I because
05:05 - I have tensor right here and we're gonna
05:06 - install some packages so the first thing
05:08 - we need to install is pimp install SK
05:13 - able to learn so I already have it
05:14 - installed but run through that we'll
05:17 - take a second we also need to install
05:18 - numpy and pandas so everyone install
05:21 - pandas this is gonna allow us just to
05:22 - read in our data frames really easily or
05:25 - data sets
05:27 - sorry not frames I gotta keep calling it
05:28 - frames anyways we'll do pip install
05:31 - numpy as well this is just a allows for
05:34 - a raise because all the stuff we do
05:36 - actually needs a raise not list and
05:38 - Python doesn't have general support for
05:41 - raise okay so once we have those
05:44 - installed we can close this terminal and
05:46 - by the way you could have done this from
05:47 - the command prompt as well just by
05:49 - running the terminal it just runs it in
05:51 - the main directory that you're already
05:52 - in so I don't know I just do that cuz
05:53 - it's easier in pycharm but yeah okay so
05:56 - first thing we need to do is read in our
05:58 - data sets you can see already have mine
05:59 - here so do this we're gonna say data
06:01 - equals pandas and I think I actually
06:04 - brought that in as PD so just copy these
06:07 - import statements here
06:08 - PD read CSV and of course that didn't
06:12 - work okay and we'll just do student -
06:15 - Matt dot CSV okay it's gonna read in all
06:19 - our data and since if you actually open
06:21 - this up here and I have it open here you
06:23 - can see that all of our attitudes are
06:25 - actually separated by semicolons now I
06:27 - don't know why they do this because well
06:29 - CSV file stands for comma separated
06:31 - values but to deal with this we're just
06:33 - gonna have to type a CP equals and this
06:36 - to Center separator or delimiter we're
06:39 - gonna do
06:39 - okay and that's what each attribute is
06:41 - separated by so that when we read in our
06:43 - data into a panda's data frame which is
06:46 - what this is actually gonna be called
06:47 - here it gets the correct values okay so
06:50 - now that we've done that what we're
06:52 - gonna do is we're going to set up we're
06:55 - gonna actually trim this data down to
06:57 - what we want it to be or what we need
06:59 - okay
06:59 - so essentially you saw we had those 33
07:02 - attributes I don't want all those 33
07:03 - attributes I only want to use some of
07:05 - them now you guys feel free and please I
07:08 - encourage you to do this mess around
07:10 - with the different attributes that
07:11 - you're using if you want to just test it
07:14 - out use the same ones as me first but
07:15 - then add some of your own remove some
07:17 - see if you can get your accuracy level
07:18 - up by using different ones maybe even
07:20 - use them all you know what I mean see
07:22 - what you can really do with them okay
07:24 - but essentially what we're gonna do here
07:25 - is I'm gonna say something called X
07:27 - actually no we're gonna say data equals
07:30 - data okay and then in here we're gonna
07:34 - put a another little list thing and
07:37 - we're just gonna type in the attribute
07:38 - so we actually want so in this case I'm
07:40 - gonna go G 1 G 2 G 3 I'm gonna do study
07:46 - time okay and what else should we do
07:50 - let's say here study time and I'm just
07:53 - gonna come out of the screen here see
07:54 - what else we had Oh absences and
07:56 - failures okay and these are you can see
07:58 - the list of attributes obviously if you
08:00 - go to that website that I was showing
08:01 - you unfortunately I closed it and then
08:04 - you can see what all of them actually
08:06 - mean try to pick ones that only have
08:07 - integer values associated with them
08:09 - because it'll make your life a bit
08:10 - easier but if you for some reason pick
08:12 - one that doesn't have an a value integer
08:14 - value you're gonna have to change all of
08:16 - the values within this data frame so
08:18 - that they're integer so they can
08:19 - actually work with the thing that we're
08:21 - gonna be using okay all right so these
08:23 - are our attributes and you know I'm
08:24 - actually just gonna show you what our
08:26 - data frame looks like when we print it
08:28 - out because I think it's kind of
08:29 - interesting so if you do data dot head
08:31 - this is gonna grab the first five
08:32 - elements of our data frame and print
08:34 - them out to the screen and just show us
08:36 - what they look like so before I change
08:38 - and manipulate the data I'm just gonna
08:39 - print the head out here so I'll just run
08:41 - this quick they already have a
08:42 - configuration set up and you can see
08:44 - that's showing us all these different
08:45 - attributes can't show us all of them
08:47 - because there's enough room in the
08:47 - console and then what their values
08:50 - actually are equal to okay that's kind
08:52 - of what our
08:53 - data frame looks like and then if I want
08:55 - to I can copy this and well paste this
08:57 - down here and you can see what the
08:58 - difference is now with our data frame so
09:01 - you can see we've cut down from five by
09:03 - thirty three columns - it doesn't say
09:05 - does it well it's anyways we've cut down
09:08 - to however many attributes this is which
09:10 - is six okay so now we're gonna define
09:13 - what we are trying to predict so what
09:16 - value is it that we actually want in
09:17 - this case we want G three and G three
09:19 - stands for their final grade it's really
09:21 - predict equals and then just in this
09:24 - case we'll type the attribute name which
09:25 - is G three and this is where I'm now
09:27 - gonna go into talking about attributes
09:29 - and labels see what time we're at nine
09:31 - minutes okay well go for another few
09:32 - minutes before I cut and go to the next
09:34 - video but essentially everything here is
09:37 - known as an attribute right it's part of
09:39 - a student and it's unique to each
09:42 - student like these attitudes right and
09:43 - labels are what we want to get based on
09:47 - attributes so in this case our label is
09:50 - actually going to be known as g3 because
09:52 - based on all these different attributes
09:54 - we want to determine what g3 is now yes
09:58 - I know I have g3 in here and it is still
10:00 - an attribute but we're gonna remove that
10:02 - when we are actually testing and
10:04 - training this data set okay so this
10:07 - predict is also known as a label you may
10:10 - hear people say that essentially label
10:12 - is what you're trying to get right what
10:14 - you're looking for and you could have
10:16 - multiple labels and you can predict
10:17 - multiple labels and you can also predict
10:19 - what do you call it you could have like
10:21 - a ton of different attributes you don't
10:23 - want attribute it's it's a you can
10:25 - change it around it's all variable okay
10:26 - so now that we've done that what I'm
10:27 - actually gonna do is I'm gonna set up
10:29 - two arrays and one array is going to
10:31 - define all of our attributes and one is
10:33 - going to be our label or it labels if we
10:35 - had multiple so and this case I'm going
10:36 - to say X is equal to and I think we're
10:39 - gonna do NP dot array so we're gonna set
10:42 - this up in an array because it's we're
10:43 - gonna have to use and we're gonna
10:44 - actually just do data dot drop and in
10:47 - this case I think this is what you do
10:49 - for it at least we're gonna drop g3 so
10:52 - essentially what this actually does for
10:55 - us and actually I need to do this I
10:58 - think based on what I'm looking at here
11:00 - so g3 but we actually just use predict
11:02 - so this is more optimized if we're gonna
11:05 - change what we're trying to predict
11:06 - but essentially what we're doing here
11:08 - right is this is gonna return to us a
11:09 - new data frame and these are what these
11:11 - are all called right it just doesn't
11:13 - have g3 in it because this is gonna be
11:15 - all our training data and then based on
11:17 - that training down we're gonna try to
11:18 - predict like another value right okay
11:20 - so X and then Y is gonna be all of our
11:23 - labels whereas this is all of our
11:25 - features or attributes okay so what
11:27 - we're gonna do now is gonna do MP dot
11:29 - array and then here it's going to go to
11:31 - data and between Fred data we're just
11:35 - gonna do data and then predict in here
11:39 - because we only care about the actual g3
11:42 - value here okay let me just check yeah
11:44 - that is correct
11:45 - okay so how do that X&Y now what we're
11:48 - gonna do is we're actually going to
11:50 - split these up into four variables we're
11:53 - gonna have X test Y test X train and why
11:57 - train okay and not in that order but
11:58 - you'll see in a second so when do X
12:00 - underscore train Y underscore the Train
12:05 - not equal so greater than side whatever
12:08 - that is and we'll have X underscore test
12:10 - and Y underscore test this is going to
12:13 - be equal to howdy
12:15 - what is this command SK learn dot linear
12:19 - model or model selection actually dot
12:23 - train test splits just give me all those
12:25 - which is very nice and in this case what
12:27 - we're gonna pass we're gonna pass XY and
12:29 - then for what is this value actually
12:32 - called
12:33 - just gotta have a look at my other
12:34 - screen test size that's what it is test
12:37 - underscore size is equal to zero point
12:40 - one okay so let's talk about what this
12:42 - is doing essentially we're taking our
12:44 - all of our attributes and all of our
12:46 - labels or whatever we're trying to
12:48 - predict and we're gonna split them up
12:50 - now into four different arrays so we
12:53 - have X train and Y Trina X train is
12:55 - gonna be a section of this array Y train
12:59 - is going to be a section of this array
13:00 - and then we're gonna have these test
13:02 - data then we're gonna use to test the
13:04 - accuracy of our model that we're gonna
13:06 - create or of our algorithm all right
13:08 - now the way this works essentially is
13:10 - because if we trained the model off of
13:13 - every single bit of data that we have
13:16 - and then it would simply just memorize
13:18 - patterns right because computers
13:20 - memorize things like amazingly so think
13:22 - about it kind of in a way say you like
13:25 - you're in class right and oh actually
13:28 - Kay that's about example but let's just
13:29 - say this right if we train the model off
13:31 - of the data we're gonna test it on it's
13:33 - already seen that information so it
13:35 - already knows what the answer to that
13:36 - question is or to that prediction so we
13:39 - can't train the model off of our testing
13:41 - data otherwise we're gonna get
13:43 - inaccurate results because it's gonna be
13:45 - able to pretty well get perfect because
13:46 - it's already seen that information so
13:47 - essentially what this does is we're
13:49 - splitting up 10% of our data into test
13:52 - samples so that when we test we can test
13:55 - off of that and it's never seen that
13:57 - information before hope that makes sense
13:59 - you and this is just what this whole
14:01 - mess of code is doing for us all right
14:02 - test size and X&Y is just taking our
14:05 - labels and features or attributes or
14:07 - whatever okay and I think I'm actually
14:09 - gonna cut the video here in the next
14:12 - video we're gonna go into actually
14:13 - applying this into an algorithm talking
14:14 - about how that algorithm works
14:16 - mathematically and then maybe I'm not
14:19 - sure if it'll be in the next video or
14:20 - the one after that we'll do predictions
14:21 - and so on with that okay so if you guys
14:23 - enjoyed the video please make sure you
14:24 - leave a like and subscribe and if you
14:25 - want exclusive updates on the next
14:27 - machine learning videos are coming out
14:28 - make sure to follow my Twitter tech with
14:30 - Tim can spare me posting pretty much all
14:32 - the information for this anyways I'll
14:34 - see you guys in the next video
14:35 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to kind of the first official machine learning tutorial were actually gonna be writing code and reading in data so in this video essentially we're gonna be getting a big data set and we're gonna be minimizing that data set to use the valuable information out of it which is very important and is honestly probably the hardest thing with machine learning is getting your data in the right form and using proper and valid data and then we're gonna be actually in the next video implementing it's called a linear regression algorithm to predict grades based on kind of student behavior in student past grades so that's a data set we're going to be using it's actually what I have open here which I'm going to talk about in just a second but before I move into all of that I just want to say that if you'd like to follow along with the tutorials and see all of the code have all of the data go to my website tech with Tim net if you go to the tutorials page here you will see I I know you don't see it right now but it'll be a little box here that says machine learning with Python and if you click on that you'll find the tutorial series and you could go through and it's gonna have all the code all of the data everything that I write in kind of some descriptions as well it's not gonna be as extensive as the video but just in case you want to get all the code and stuff it'll be on the website so I recommend you follow along with that and that's gonna be for the future of all these machine learning videos as well ok so back to our data now with machine learning data is obviously the most important part by far now the algorithms are actually fairly easy to implement but we have to implement them on certain data and our data has to be in a correct form in a correct shape and it has to be well valid data like it has to make sense right so essentially what I'm doing is I'm just gonna download a data set off of this UCI machine learning repository website and they have a ton ton of ton of datasets so I just picked this one because I thought it was kind of interesting student performance data set and essentially you guys can read the data set information this link will be in the description and on my website as well and it goes through a bunch of things that I want to walk through them with you so that if you want to pick your own data sets off the website you kind of know how to do that and what all these different things mean so probably some of the more important things I guess actually I'm just gonna read through them all and I guess I'll talk about them as we go so data set characteristics here and I'll show you these all on the main page when you select datasets as well multivariate of just means it has I believe more than two variables so you don't just have like one variable corresponding to the other one there's a ton of different attributes that will apply to a certain label or classification characteristics don't worry about that attribute characteristics that's actually incorrect but associated tasks classification regression this is just what it's good for typically you can obviously use this data set with other kind of algorithms but that's what it recommend is number of instances is how many instances are like people or in this case students are actually in the data set number of attributes is how many attributes for every single instance okay quick sidenote if you guys hear me like coughing or notice I'm a little bit uh no that's good I usually am I am a little sick right now so if you notice my boys'll raspy please excuse me so it data set information essentially this is good to read kind of tells you how they got the data what it's from it's not crazy important but I mean kind of tells you what all these attributes are meant for and then attribute information this is like each property of a student right or attribute is obviously the best way to say it and it'll go through what the name of the attribute is and then all of the different values that could be associated with that so for us we're gonna want to deal with integer attributes so already anything that says like male female if we don't want to use these because unless we're going to transfer them transfer them into like a zero or one just can be more difficult later on there's stuff like study time failures like you can read through these and see what they all are and each data set will have astron information typically the most important attributes for us in this data set are gonna be the grades so grade 1 grade 2 and grade 3 and pretty much we could just use these two grades to predict what a final grade would be and that would give us a fairly accurate result but I want to make sense some of these other attributes as well and see what we can do with them okay so what's the data we're gonna be using to download that go to data folder go to student zip it'll download the zip for you I already have a download so I'm not gonna do that and then when you open up the zip let's go to my downloads here alright it'll look something like this click on student match and then just drag that into whatever directory you're working ok because you can use this Portuguese one it'll be the exact same process except PR instead of Matt when you were importing it but this is just a math class to support chichi's class I like the math class better personally so that's what I'm gonna use okay so now that we are actually we're in Python so I'm in what you call this here hi charm we're actually going to need to just set up a few things before we can actually start importing our data so in the last tutorial I installed some packages we need to actually install some more packages that I forgot about so excuse me for that but essentially we're gonna activate our environment again a fresh reminder we can just do activate and then my case I called my tensor so we're gonna do that and I've already done that you can see I because I have tensor right here and we're gonna install some packages so the first thing we need to install is pimp install SK able to learn so I already have it installed but run through that we'll take a second we also need to install numpy and pandas so everyone install pandas this is gonna allow us just to read in our data frames really easily or data sets sorry not frames I gotta keep calling it frames anyways we'll do pip install numpy as well this is just a allows for a raise because all the stuff we do actually needs a raise not list and Python doesn't have general support for raise okay so once we have those installed we can close this terminal and by the way you could have done this from the command prompt as well just by running the terminal it just runs it in the main directory that you're already in so I don't know I just do that cuz it's easier in pycharm but yeah okay so first thing we need to do is read in our data sets you can see already have mine here so do this we're gonna say data equals pandas and I think I actually brought that in as PD so just copy these import statements here PD read CSV and of course that didn't work okay and we'll just do student Matt dot CSV okay it's gonna read in all our data and since if you actually open this up here and I have it open here you can see that all of our attitudes are actually separated by semicolons now I don't know why they do this because well CSV file stands for comma separated values but to deal with this we're just gonna have to type a CP equals and this to Center separator or delimiter we're gonna do okay and that's what each attribute is separated by so that when we read in our data into a panda's data frame which is what this is actually gonna be called here it gets the correct values okay so now that we've done that what we're gonna do is we're going to set up we're gonna actually trim this data down to what we want it to be or what we need okay so essentially you saw we had those 33 attributes I don't want all those 33 attributes I only want to use some of them now you guys feel free and please I encourage you to do this mess around with the different attributes that you're using if you want to just test it out use the same ones as me first but then add some of your own remove some see if you can get your accuracy level up by using different ones maybe even use them all you know what I mean see what you can really do with them okay but essentially what we're gonna do here is I'm gonna say something called X actually no we're gonna say data equals data okay and then in here we're gonna put a another little list thing and we're just gonna type in the attribute so we actually want so in this case I'm gonna go G 1 G 2 G 3 I'm gonna do study time okay and what else should we do let's say here study time and I'm just gonna come out of the screen here see what else we had Oh absences and failures okay and these are you can see the list of attributes obviously if you go to that website that I was showing you unfortunately I closed it and then you can see what all of them actually mean try to pick ones that only have integer values associated with them because it'll make your life a bit easier but if you for some reason pick one that doesn't have an a value integer value you're gonna have to change all of the values within this data frame so that they're integer so they can actually work with the thing that we're gonna be using okay all right so these are our attributes and you know I'm actually just gonna show you what our data frame looks like when we print it out because I think it's kind of interesting so if you do data dot head this is gonna grab the first five elements of our data frame and print them out to the screen and just show us what they look like so before I change and manipulate the data I'm just gonna print the head out here so I'll just run this quick they already have a configuration set up and you can see that's showing us all these different attributes can't show us all of them because there's enough room in the console and then what their values actually are equal to okay that's kind of what our data frame looks like and then if I want to I can copy this and well paste this down here and you can see what the difference is now with our data frame so you can see we've cut down from five by thirty three columns it doesn't say does it well it's anyways we've cut down to however many attributes this is which is six okay so now we're gonna define what we are trying to predict so what value is it that we actually want in this case we want G three and G three stands for their final grade it's really predict equals and then just in this case we'll type the attribute name which is G three and this is where I'm now gonna go into talking about attributes and labels see what time we're at nine minutes okay well go for another few minutes before I cut and go to the next video but essentially everything here is known as an attribute right it's part of a student and it's unique to each student like these attitudes right and labels are what we want to get based on attributes so in this case our label is actually going to be known as g3 because based on all these different attributes we want to determine what g3 is now yes I know I have g3 in here and it is still an attribute but we're gonna remove that when we are actually testing and training this data set okay so this predict is also known as a label you may hear people say that essentially label is what you're trying to get right what you're looking for and you could have multiple labels and you can predict multiple labels and you can also predict what do you call it you could have like a ton of different attributes you don't want attribute it's it's a you can change it around it's all variable okay so now that we've done that what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna set up two arrays and one array is going to define all of our attributes and one is going to be our label or it labels if we had multiple so and this case I'm going to say X is equal to and I think we're gonna do NP dot array so we're gonna set this up in an array because it's we're gonna have to use and we're gonna actually just do data dot drop and in this case I think this is what you do for it at least we're gonna drop g3 so essentially what this actually does for us and actually I need to do this I think based on what I'm looking at here so g3 but we actually just use predict so this is more optimized if we're gonna change what we're trying to predict but essentially what we're doing here right is this is gonna return to us a new data frame and these are what these are all called right it just doesn't have g3 in it because this is gonna be all our training data and then based on that training down we're gonna try to predict like another value right okay so X and then Y is gonna be all of our labels whereas this is all of our features or attributes okay so what we're gonna do now is gonna do MP dot array and then here it's going to go to data and between Fred data we're just gonna do data and then predict in here because we only care about the actual g3 value here okay let me just check yeah that is correct okay so how do that X&Y now what we're gonna do is we're actually going to split these up into four variables we're gonna have X test Y test X train and why train okay and not in that order but you'll see in a second so when do X underscore train Y underscore the Train not equal so greater than side whatever that is and we'll have X underscore test and Y underscore test this is going to be equal to howdy what is this command SK learn dot linear model or model selection actually dot train test splits just give me all those which is very nice and in this case what we're gonna pass we're gonna pass XY and then for what is this value actually called just gotta have a look at my other screen test size that's what it is test underscore size is equal to zero point one okay so let's talk about what this is doing essentially we're taking our all of our attributes and all of our labels or whatever we're trying to predict and we're gonna split them up now into four different arrays so we have X train and Y Trina X train is gonna be a section of this array Y train is going to be a section of this array and then we're gonna have these test data then we're gonna use to test the accuracy of our model that we're gonna create or of our algorithm all right now the way this works essentially is because if we trained the model off of every single bit of data that we have and then it would simply just memorize patterns right because computers memorize things like amazingly so think about it kind of in a way say you like you're in class right and oh actually Kay that's about example but let's just say this right if we train the model off of the data we're gonna test it on it's already seen that information so it already knows what the answer to that question is or to that prediction so we can't train the model off of our testing data otherwise we're gonna get inaccurate results because it's gonna be able to pretty well get perfect because it's already seen that information so essentially what this does is we're splitting up 10% of our data into test samples so that when we test we can test off of that and it's never seen that information before hope that makes sense you and this is just what this whole mess of code is doing for us all right test size and X&Y is just taking our labels and features or attributes or whatever okay and I think I'm actually gonna cut the video here in the next video we're gonna go into actually applying this into an algorithm talking about how that algorithm works mathematically and then maybe I'm not sure if it'll be in the next video or the one after that we'll do predictions and so on with that okay so if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and if you want exclusive updates on the next machine learning videos are coming out make sure to follow my Twitter tech with
