00:00 - in this video I'll be showcasing my top
00:02 - five choices for the best Python IDE and
00:04 - text editors now all of these choices
00:06 - have their different pros and their
00:08 - different cons in different use cases
00:09 - for them so that means that for me my
00:12 - favorite may not be yours and in that
00:14 - instance I'd love to see a comment down
00:15 - below maybe explaining why you disagree
00:17 - with me or why you think one of the
00:19 - editors on my list should be ranked
00:20 - somewhere else now before we go too far
00:22 - I will quickly mention the difference
00:24 - between an IDE and a text editor as that
00:26 - is important and IDE stands for an
00:29 - integrated development environment and
00:30 - essentially what that means is this is a
00:32 - much more feature-rich software tool it
00:35 - comes with things like a debugger and
00:37 - autocomplete and is a much heavier
00:39 - package with a lot more features well
00:41 - that also means is this is going to use
00:42 - more memory on your computer it's gonna
00:44 - be more system intensive it may be blag
00:46 - you may crash sometimes and on slower
00:48 - computers it's maybe not the best option
00:50 - whereas the text editor is a lighter
00:52 - weight version of this it comes with
00:54 - less features typically it'll have some
00:56 - plugins that you can install and really
00:58 - all it's meant for is some basic
00:59 - scripting and some lighter weight coding
01:01 - and is a great option when you don't
01:03 - have a very capable computer that can
01:05 - run one of these huge IDs so with that
01:08 - being said there is one commonality
01:09 - between all of these things and that is
01:11 - that they are all compatible with the
01:13 - sponsor of today's video which is kite
01:15 - now kite is the best Python autocomplete
01:17 - engine on the market and will help you
01:19 - save tons of keystrokes while you're
01:20 - programming it runs a deep learning
01:22 - model on your computer while you type to
01:24 - show you the best and most relevant
01:25 - completions for your Python code it's
01:28 - capable of completing entire lines and
01:30 - as a feature called intelligent snippets
01:31 - that will help you fill in arguments and
01:33 - Method calls with the variables you've
01:34 - defined earlier it also comes with a
01:36 - companion coding window called co-pilot
01:39 - the copilot window shows you relevant
01:41 - documentation while you type based on
01:43 - your cursor location now the best part
01:45 - of kite is that it's free and you can
01:47 - download it from the link in the
01:48 - description so coming in as my fifth
01:50 - favorite editor for Python we have vim
01:52 - now vim is an extremely lightweight
01:54 - editor that becomes very powerful when
01:57 - you know how to use it properly it works
01:59 - on pretty much every operating system
02:00 - and it's even capable of running solely
02:02 - in the command line vim is what many
02:04 - Python experts use because of its
02:06 - powerful keyboard shortcuts and
02:07 - unlimited customized ability and most of
02:10 - them users love how quickly they can
02:11 - develop with it and
02:12 - the vast amount of plugins that come
02:14 - with it I will warn you about that Bhim
02:16 - has a very very steep learning curve
02:19 - it's nothing compared to modern-day i
02:21 - des and it will likely take you a very
02:22 - long time to get used to the lack of UI
02:25 - features and even just remember the
02:27 - sheer volume of keyboard commands and
02:29 - shortcuts so in conclusion BIM is a very
02:31 - powerful tool and the only development
02:33 - environment that you'll ever need for
02:35 - Python assuming that you can figure out
02:37 - how to use it it's not for everyone I
02:39 - wouldn't recommend it for beginners but
02:40 - it's definitely something worth checking
02:41 - out especially if you've been developing
02:43 - in Python for a long time and now for my
02:45 - fourth pick we have Adam Adam is a sleek
02:48 - modern lightweight editor that has many
02:51 - Python developers tool of choice it was
02:53 - developed by github and contains many
02:55 - plugins that allow for IDE like features
02:57 - to be added of course it's integration
02:59 - with github and git is amazing it's free
03:02 - it's very easy to set up and get working
03:04 - and in my experience it requires the
03:06 - least amount of setup for any IDE or a
03:08 - text editor
03:08 - the UI is pretty nice and it's not too
03:10 - overwhelming and it doesn't use many
03:12 - system resources on its default settings
03:14 - Adam is designed to be hackable which
03:16 - means you can customize almost
03:17 - everything about it and it comes with a
03:19 - suite of optional plugins
03:21 - although do be wary as many users do
03:23 - report lag with too many packages or
03:25 - plugins installed Adam is editor I like
03:27 - to suggest the beginners and anyone
03:29 - looking for something that just works
03:31 - right out of the box it's a great choice
03:33 - I don't think you'll have any complaints
03:34 - using it unless you want some features
03:36 - like a debugger which won't come with
03:38 - anything other than a heavier weight IDE
03:40 - and now for the first IDE in our list
03:43 - coming in at number 3 we have vs code
03:46 - now vs code is maintained by Microsoft
03:48 - which means it's constantly getting a
03:50 - ton of new features and exciting
03:51 - additions and it's actually pretty new
03:53 - to the market being released in just
03:54 - 2016 it's known to be on the lighter
03:57 - side when comparing against other IDE s
03:59 - although it is still sometimes slow and
04:01 - of course it comes with all the features
04:02 - you'd expect like a debugger a massive
04:05 - advantage of using vs code is a built in
04:06 - compiler and interpreter and
04:08 - compatibility with pretty much every
04:10 - single programming language a lot of
04:12 - people prefer Villa's code for web
04:13 - development and heavier weight projects
04:15 - and the user interface I would say is
04:17 - pretty nice although some people may
04:19 - argue that it's a little bit overcrowded
04:20 - so this is actually where one of my
04:22 - favorite features of the tool comes in
04:23 - called Zen mode now Zen mode allows you
04:26 - to turn your
04:26 - alone IDE into a minimalist editor with
04:29 - a click of a button the only minor
04:31 - inconvenience when using vias code is
04:33 - that python is a not one of the default
04:35 - languages that comes with it this means
04:37 - you'll need to install it first before
04:38 - being able to run and use your Python
04:40 - code overall it's hard to find an editor
04:42 - that's much better than BS code when it
04:44 - comes to features and my only complaint
04:46 - is sometimes a speed and that can be a
04:48 - little bit less intuitive to get used to
04:50 - compared to some of the other options on
04:51 - our list and now for my number to pick
04:54 - we have sub line text sub line text is a
04:56 - lightweight editor that I personally
04:58 - love to use for smaller projects and
05:00 - some lighter weight scripting the UI is
05:02 - simple and minimalistic and I find it
05:04 - very intuitive and easy to get used to
05:05 - as sub line text is very lightweight
05:07 - it's extremely fast and it's unlikely
05:09 - we'll run into many issues with it
05:11 - however to get the most out of sub line
05:13 - you'll need to use one of its features
05:14 - called package control to install some
05:17 - plugins this allows you to pick the
05:18 - exact features and add-ons you want and
05:20 - not be distracted by the ones you don't
05:22 - use or the ones you don't need this does
05:24 - mean that this energy editor takes a
05:26 - little bit of time to get set up but I
05:28 - find that it's definitely a worthwhile
05:30 - investment opening new files and looking
05:32 - through folders is very fast and easy
05:34 - and can be enhanced even more with the
05:36 - right plugins overall sub-line is a
05:38 - great choice for anyone not doing
05:39 - anything too crazy
05:40 - they just wants a lightweight editor if
05:42 - you're willing to spend some time
05:43 - installing plugins you'll have an editor
05:45 - that has all the tools you want and only
05:47 - those it's my personal go-to for the
05:49 - most of my Python programming and as I'm
05:51 - sure you all have guessed
05:53 - coming in at number one we have pycharm
05:56 - now pycharm is an ide designed
05:58 - specifically for python development
05:59 - although it is compatible with other
06:01 - languages it's very powerful for working
06:03 - with Python code and different Python
06:05 - modules and frameworks like Django and
06:07 - includes pep 8 style recommendations
06:10 - on-the-fly coding verification and
06:12 - seamless integration with anaconda and
06:14 - other version control systems it has
06:16 - very similar features to be as code with
06:18 - a very capable debugger and of course
06:20 - the ability to install plugins and
06:21 - packages it has great features for
06:23 - connecting to databases and servers and
06:25 - the only real downfall to PyCharm is
06:27 - that it's a very heavyweight IDE
06:29 - compared to vs code and some of the
06:31 - other things we've talked about
06:32 - previously it uses a lot of system
06:34 - resources and oftentimes will stall on
06:37 - loading while it's indexing files now
06:39 - there is ways of brow
06:40 - this but as a beginner that's something
06:41 - that's annoying and something that I
06:43 - struggled with for a while when you
06:44 - using PI trim now it is worth noting
06:46 - that PyCharm does have a free community
06:48 - version which is very capable but also
06:50 - includes a professional version that has
06:52 - even more features but for a pretty
06:54 - hefty price
06:55 - so overall Pi drum is my go-to for large
06:57 - Python projects especially ones using
06:59 - web frameworks or handling database
07:01 - connectivity and it does have a slight
07:03 - learning curve for beginners but it's
07:04 - definitely something I recommend to all
07:06 - Python developers to at least give a
07:08 - shot so that has been my list for the
07:10 - top Python IDE s and text editors do you
07:13 - agree with me leave a comment down below
07:15 - don't forget to like the video subscribe
07:16 - and hopefully I will see you guys in
07:18 - another YouTube video

Cleaned transcript:

in this video I'll be showcasing my top five choices for the best Python IDE and text editors now all of these choices have their different pros and their different cons in different use cases for them so that means that for me my favorite may not be yours and in that instance I'd love to see a comment down below maybe explaining why you disagree with me or why you think one of the editors on my list should be ranked somewhere else now before we go too far I will quickly mention the difference between an IDE and a text editor as that is important and IDE stands for an integrated development environment and essentially what that means is this is a much more featurerich software tool it comes with things like a debugger and autocomplete and is a much heavier package with a lot more features well that also means is this is going to use more memory on your computer it's gonna be more system intensive it may be blag you may crash sometimes and on slower computers it's maybe not the best option whereas the text editor is a lighter weight version of this it comes with less features typically it'll have some plugins that you can install and really all it's meant for is some basic scripting and some lighter weight coding and is a great option when you don't have a very capable computer that can run one of these huge IDs so with that being said there is one commonality between all of these things and that is that they are all compatible with the sponsor of today's video which is kite now kite is the best Python autocomplete engine on the market and will help you save tons of keystrokes while you're programming it runs a deep learning model on your computer while you type to show you the best and most relevant completions for your Python code it's capable of completing entire lines and as a feature called intelligent snippets that will help you fill in arguments and Method calls with the variables you've defined earlier it also comes with a companion coding window called copilot the copilot window shows you relevant documentation while you type based on your cursor location now the best part of kite is that it's free and you can download it from the link in the description so coming in as my fifth favorite editor for Python we have vim now vim is an extremely lightweight editor that becomes very powerful when you know how to use it properly it works on pretty much every operating system and it's even capable of running solely in the command line vim is what many Python experts use because of its powerful keyboard shortcuts and unlimited

great choice for anyone not doing anything too crazy they just wants a lightweight editor if you're willing to spend some time installing plugins you'll have an editor that has all the tools you want and only those it's my personal goto for the most of my Python programming and as I'm sure you all have guessed coming in at number one we have pycharm now pycharm is an ide designed specifically for
