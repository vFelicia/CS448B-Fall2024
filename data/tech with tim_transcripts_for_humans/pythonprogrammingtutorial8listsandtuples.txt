00:00 - hey guys welcome back to the eighth
00:02 - video in my Python Programming Series
00:05 - today we're going to be talking about
00:06 - list Now list can be fairly complex uh
00:10 - but they are a very important part of
00:12 - python and they are very important to
00:14 - understand so a list is another data
00:17 - type so before we talked about strings
00:19 - integers booleans and floating decimal
00:22 - points so floats um and today we're
00:24 - going to talk about lists so lists again
00:25 - are their own data type so let's just
00:27 - start off by doing an example right now
00:29 - so pretty much uh a list which is
00:32 - denoted by the square brackets here uh
00:35 - is a collection of different data types
00:37 - it could be the same data types or it
00:38 - can be different data types so for an
00:40 - example I'm going to put a apple in here
00:43 - in my list I'm going to put a comma and
00:45 - I'm going to add another item so maybe
00:46 - we'll put a pair and then maybe we'll
00:49 - put a number as well okay so we have the
00:52 - list fruits and in the list we have
00:55 - three items um now everything here
00:57 - separated by a comma is known as an item
00:59 - item so for an example our apple is an
01:03 - item our pair is an item and the integer
01:06 - three is an item now you can see that
01:08 - they're all different data types or
01:09 - sorry there is different data types we
01:11 - have two strings and we have one integer
01:14 - value um now this is fine you can store
01:17 - um different data types in one
01:19 - list um okay so now let's just print the
01:22 - list to the console so we can see what
01:25 - it looks
01:26 - like print it out and you'll see we
01:29 - simply get what exactly what we've typed
01:31 - uh into the idle so we get apple pair
01:35 - and three now if we want to access an
01:38 - individual item in the list we need to
01:41 - do something um a little different so
01:44 - right now we just printed out the whole
01:45 - list but say we want to just print out
01:48 - pair um now what we're going to do is
01:50 - we're going to use the square brackets
01:52 - so we're going to do the list name so
01:54 - fruits and then we're going to put
01:55 - square brackets right beside it no
01:57 - spaces and then inside of the square
01:59 - bracket we're going to type in what's
02:01 - known as the indic of that item um so
02:04 - the way indices work in Python is when
02:06 - you create a list everything is
02:08 - automatically assigned in indic um so in
02:10 - this list we have indices 0 through two
02:13 - now it may seem weird that we start at Z
02:15 - instead of one but that's just the way
02:17 - that computers count um and the way that
02:19 - they work so we have to understand that
02:21 - apple is going to be assigned the
02:23 - integer value of zero so the indic zero
02:25 - meaning I would put zero in here if I
02:27 - wanted to access Apple because that's
02:30 - the first element in our list and then
02:33 - we have pair so that's the second
02:35 - element or item um now that's actually
02:37 - going to be represented by one here so
02:40 - fruits one will give us the value of
02:41 - pair and then fruits two will give us
02:44 - the value of three um now this is uh
02:48 - sometimes difficult for some people to
02:49 - understand but just really try to
02:51 - remember that the first item always is
02:53 - zero so if you would like to access the
02:56 - second item in your list you're going to
02:58 - type in one
03:00 - um into the indic thing here okay so I'm
03:03 - just going to run this and show you how
03:04 - this
03:04 - works and you see we get pair okay
03:07 - that's because um we have the first
03:10 - indic which represents the second item
03:13 - which is
03:14 - pair okay um now there's some other
03:17 - things we can do with list as well so if
03:20 - we want to add something to our list
03:22 - there's a few ways that we can do it um
03:25 - the first way uh which is the only one
03:27 - I'm going to show you right now is
03:29 - probably the easiest and simply what
03:31 - we're going to type is fruits followed
03:33 - by the dot uh so a DOT a period and then
03:36 - we're going to type a pen okay now this
03:39 - means to add to the end of the list so
03:43 - inside of a pend I'm going to put the
03:45 - element or the item that I'd like to add
03:47 - so say we want to add uh another fruit
03:50 - let's think of another fruit that we
03:52 - could add maybe a
03:54 - strawberry okay we want to add
03:56 - strawberry into the list I'm just going
03:57 - to get rid of three so it makes more
03:58 - sense okay so right now now in our list
04:00 - up here we have fruits which is a
04:02 - variable name um containing the list
04:05 - that has Apple and pear now we want to
04:07 - add strawberry to the list so let's
04:09 - start off by printing the list before we
04:11 - add it so we'll print off fruits and
04:15 - then we're going to print fruits one
04:16 - more time after we add this item to the
04:21 - list and you see we have the first list
04:24 - which is what we defined originally and
04:26 - then when we added or appended
04:28 - strawberry to the end of it it added it
04:30 - in just like this so that is a way that
04:34 - we are able to add things into a list um
04:37 - by using do append now there is another
04:40 - way um it's known as the slice operator
04:43 - using something called insert um but
04:45 - we're not going to do that right now
04:46 - we're going to talk about the slice
04:48 - operator in a later tutorial so stay
04:50 - tuned for that okay so fruits. aend
04:53 - we've added strawberry um now if we
04:55 - wanted to add another item we could do
04:56 - the same thing and we could do append
04:58 - again and we we could put in another
05:00 - fruit maybe we want to put in a
05:03 - blueberry okay just like that and again
05:06 - we'll see that it does the same thing we
05:08 - have apple pear and then apple pear
05:11 - strawberry blueberry okay um all right
05:14 - so that's it for adding to the list um
05:18 - now what about changing something in our
05:21 - list uh so let's just add right here at
05:24 - the beginning we'll put in Strawberry so
05:27 - we have three items and now let's say we
05:29 - want to change the middle item in our
05:31 - list to a different fruit say we don't
05:34 - like peirs we want to remove it we want
05:35 - to change that so what we're going to do
05:37 - is we're simply going to type the um the
05:39 - name again so fruits followed by the
05:41 - square brackets and then the indic of
05:43 - the item you want to change um so again
05:46 - remember if we want to change pair we're
05:47 - going to use the indic one um not two
05:50 - because this is the way that it works
05:51 - we're going to use one and then we're
05:53 - going to change it to whatever we' like
05:55 - to change it to so say I want to change
05:56 - it to Blueberry I can do that like like
05:59 - so and then again we can print out
06:03 - fruits and we'll see if it
06:07 - works okay so we get apple blueberry and
06:10 - strawberry that's because we've changed
06:13 - uh the item at indic one into blueberry
06:17 - and we've replaced that we replaced Paar
06:19 - with blueberry pretty
06:21 - much okay um so that's how that works
06:24 - for list for changing items again um we
06:28 - you lists are very useful for storing
06:31 - large amounts of information so this is
06:33 - a very small list but in many programs
06:36 - we use something called
06:37 - multi-dimensional list uh which I'm
06:39 - going to talk about again in another
06:41 - tutorial um and yeah so one more thing
06:44 - before we end it here uh there's another
06:46 - data type called a tupal so a tuple um
06:50 - it's kind of hard word to pronounce but
06:52 - it's used for coordinates and it's also
06:55 - used um for things like colors and
06:58 - rectangles angles um it can also be used
07:01 - just to hold information as well but
07:03 - it's a different type of data type um
07:05 - than a list so we're going to talk about
07:06 - it quickly uh okay so a tuple pretty
07:08 - much looks like this so if we set a
07:11 - position and we set it equal to
07:14 - something like this not in square
07:16 - brackets in the regular round brackets
07:19 - and then we simply put um the items in
07:22 - like this now we see we get um it looks
07:25 - very similar to a list the way that it
07:27 - works again we can use different data
07:28 - types so I could put some like hello in
07:30 - here as well um but it does function a
07:32 - little differently and again things like
07:34 - colors we would also store in a tupo so
07:36 - we would use like 255 255 255 that's
07:39 - simply white in uh red green blue colors
07:42 - and again if we print out the
07:45 - type of the
07:47 - color you can see that we get a class
07:52 - tupal okay so I'm not going to go too in
07:54 - depth with the tupal here I just wanted
07:55 - you to understand what they are because
07:57 - we may be using them in some later to
07:59 - tutorials okay so I hope you learned how
08:01 - to use lists and a little bit about
08:03 - tupal today they're going to be
08:04 - important in the next tutorial um so
08:07 - yeah I hope you enjoyed if you did
08:09 - please like And subscribe and I will see
08:11 - you in the next video

maybe we'll put a pair and then maybe we'll put a number as well okay so we have the list fruits and in the list we have three items um now everything here separated by a comma is known as an item item so for an example our apple is an item our pair is an item and the integer three is an item now you can see that they're all different data types or sorry there is different data types we have two strings and we have one integer value um now this is fine you can store um different data types in one list um okay so now let's just print the list to the console so we can see what it looks like print it out and you'll see we simply get what exactly what we've typed uh into the idle so we get apple pair and three now if we want to access an individual item in the list we need to do something

we want to add strawberry to the list so let's start off by printing the list before we add it so we'll print off fruits and then we're going to print fruits one more time after we add this item to

could do append again and we we could put in another fruit maybe we want to put in a blueberry okay just like that and again we'll see that it does the same thing we have apple pear and then apple pear strawberry blueberry okay um all right so that's it for adding to the list um now what about changing something in our list uh so let's just add right here at the beginning we'll put in Strawberry so we have three items and now let's say we want to change the middle item in our list to a different fruit say we don't like peirs we want to remove it we want to change that so what we're going to do is we're simply going to type the um the name again so fruits followed by the square brackets and then the indic of the item you want to change um so again remember if we want to change pair we're going to use the indic one um not two because this is the way that it works we're going to use one and then we're going to change it to whatever we' like to change it to so say I want to change it to Blueberry I can do that like like so and then again we can print out fruits and we'll see if it works okay so we get apple blueberry and strawberry that's because we've changed uh the item at indic one into blueberry and we've replaced that we replaced Paar with blueberry pretty much okay um so that's how that works for list for changing items again um we you lists are very useful
