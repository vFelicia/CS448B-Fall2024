00:00 - hey guys and welcome back so in today's
00:02 - PI QT 5 tutorial what we're going to be
00:04 - doing is making an application that can
00:07 - change between images so you can click
00:09 - image 1 or image 2 and it will show a
00:11 - different image on the screen so this is
00:14 - gonna teach us how to work with images
00:15 - and is something called queue pics map I
00:18 - think and then obviously how you know
00:21 - you can change those images using the
00:22 - button so let's go ahead and get started
00:25 - so the first thing that we need to do
00:26 - here is actually build our UI so we're
00:29 - gonna do that from just the designer
00:31 - right here so I'm gonna double click
00:32 - that load up I'm gonna create a new main
00:35 - window like we've been doing all along
00:37 - and now I'm gonna show you how we can
00:39 - actually create a little area to set a
00:41 - photo so what I can do is actually drag
00:44 - a label in believe it or not I know it's
00:46 - kind of a weird thing to use but I'm
00:48 - gonna bring a label I'm gonna just drag
00:50 - this to whatever the size of the images
00:52 - are that I want it to be and then what
00:55 - I'm actually gonna do is scroll down
00:56 - here I'm actually I'll change the name
00:57 - first of all to just be phone Oakes's
00:59 - we're gonna store our photo and I'll
01:01 - scroll down to where it says pixmap now
01:04 - here is where I can actually select a
01:06 - photo that I want to show using this
01:09 - label I know it's kind of like a weird
01:11 - thing we're using a label to show a
01:12 - photo but you can use different widgets
01:15 - to actually show this pixel map okay so
01:18 - if I want to show a specific photo and I
01:20 - don't want to change it or maybe I want
01:21 - to start at something I can go ahead and
01:23 - click on this little down arrow and
01:25 - click Choose file so I gotta choose file
01:27 - I go to where would I have it in here so
01:30 - maybe cat and I click open you can see
01:33 - it shows this cat now notice however
01:35 - though that it doesn't show the entire
01:37 - cat like I move it around and kind of
01:39 - cutting stuff off and it's keeping it on
01:41 - the original scale of the image now
01:43 - that's fine in some cases but maybe we
01:45 - want it to actually scale to be the size
01:47 - of our window so to do that what I'm
01:49 - gonna do is actually just click scaled
01:51 - contents and when it does that it's
01:53 - gonna stretch it or shrink it or
01:54 - whatever it needs to do to make sure it
01:56 - fits in that kind of constraint box that
01:58 - we've created so I'm just gonna leave
01:59 - that like that for now and what I'm
02:02 - gonna do next is um we'll just add some
02:05 - buttons in that are going to allow us to
02:06 - you know change this image so let's go
02:09 - with two buttons so we need to push push
02:11 - buttons I need one there I need another
02:13 - here now we can make these bigger if we
02:16 - want to show up you know a little bit
02:18 - larger on the screen maybe we'll do that
02:19 - make it look a bit nicer and I'm
02:21 - actually gonna make this one say cat and
02:24 - I'll make this other one say dog so that
02:28 - this way we know which button is going
02:29 - to go to which image now obviously you
02:31 - know you could do more than one button
02:33 - but in our case we will just do two here
02:36 - let's try to get these pretty even and
02:39 - you know what that is good with me okay
02:41 - so now I'm just gonna change the name of
02:42 - these so that it makes sense so I'm
02:44 - gonna say this one is dog and this one
02:46 - is cat and that's about all we need to
02:49 - do and yeah okay so let's go ahead and
02:53 - save this I'm gonna save this as test UI
02:56 - I'm gonna do that in my PI qt5 folder so
03:00 - we'll save that there and now we're
03:02 - going to need to convert that to the
03:04 - Python file which we've already done a
03:05 - bunch of times but I will show you guys
03:06 - once more so we're gonna go we're gonna
03:08 - find where this UI file is it's
03:11 - important that wherever this is your
03:12 - images are here as well so whatever
03:14 - image you might want to show on the
03:17 - screen or is gonna be a part of the UI
03:18 - needs to be kind of beside where the
03:20 - Python file is so that it can actually
03:21 - access it and what we're gonna do now is
03:24 - just go into CMD go python and in this
03:27 - case we'll go are not Python sorry pi
03:29 - UIC 5 - X and then test dot UI - OH
03:36 - tutorial 5 like that okay so run that
03:40 - now we have this tutorial 5 file and I
03:43 - did tutorial 5 not tutorial 5 PI so
03:46 - let's run that again tutorial 5 dot pi
03:48 - and now let's open that up in subline
03:51 - text which is right here
03:52 - ok so awesome so we can see that this is
03:55 - showing up and this is actually where we
03:57 - are creating the photo so it says self
03:59 - now photo dot set pic smack pixmap and
04:03 - then it says QT GUI q pixmap cat jpg so
04:07 - we're actually gonna copy this line
04:08 - because that's what we're gonna use to
04:10 - change the photo when we click on those
04:12 - buttons so let's go ahead and set up
04:14 - those buttons now so we know that our
04:16 - buttons are called dog and are called
04:18 - cat so what I'm actually gonna do is
04:19 - just create some methods and I'll just
04:21 - say show underscore dog and this will be
04:25 - self
04:27 - I'll create another one this is defined
04:28 - show on this word cat if I could spell
04:31 - that correctly and self now inside here
04:34 - I'm just gonna copy what I had there for
04:37 - this photo and what you can actually do
04:39 - here is just literally put the name of
04:41 - the file that you want to show so in
04:43 - this case you can see I have cat dot jpg
04:45 - here and dog jpg here as well so as long
04:48 - as they're in the same folder then you
04:50 - can show them just by typing it in like
04:52 - this otherwise I think you have to
04:54 - define a path you guys can try this out
04:56 - but I think if I have them in a folder
04:58 - maybe you had a folder called IMG's
05:00 - so let's actually try this and we'll see
05:02 - if it works or I don't know if I can
05:04 - drag them in then what you would do is
05:06 - just do IMG's slash cat jpg and then it
05:09 - would figure out where that actual image
05:11 - is anyway so we're gonna have cat dog a
05:13 - pig and I guess it should be other way
05:16 - around so cats is down here and dog is
05:19 - here and then what we're gonna do is
05:21 - just link up our buttons so that they
05:23 - actually call those methods so to do
05:25 - that again this is what we already done
05:27 - a bunch of times we'll do self dot dog
05:29 - clicked
05:30 - itzhak connect show underscore dog need
05:34 - to make sure we have a self before that
05:35 - and then same thing for cat so self dot
05:38 - cat
05:39 - dot clicked dot connect self dot show
05:44 - underscore cat so let's go ahead and run
05:47 - this so right now you see we start with
05:49 - a cat and if I go ahead and click dog it
05:52 - actually changes over to the dog and I
05:53 - can click cat and swap back and forth
05:56 - now let's do one last test here because
05:58 - this video is actually quite short right
05:59 - now and let's drag these images into
06:02 - this IMG folder and see if we can get
06:04 - them to work by doing IMG's like this so
06:07 - let's go IMG's IMG's let's run that and
06:11 - let's go cats dog cats dog cat dog and
06:15 - there you go that shows you how to do
06:17 - that so a quick reminder make sure all
06:19 - your images are in the same main root
06:21 - folder as this otherwise you're gonna
06:23 - have to create the path so like this
06:24 - images slash and then whatever the name
06:26 - of the file is alright so that has been
06:29 - it for this tutorial I know it's a bit
06:30 - shorter but that's kind of all I need to
06:32 - show you guys on how to display an image

needs to be kind of beside where the Python file is so that it can actually access it and what we're gonna do now is just go into CMD go python and in this case we'll go are not Python sorry pi UIC 5 X and then test dot UI OH tutorial 5 like that okay so run that now we have this tutorial 5 file and I did tutorial 5 not tutorial 5 PI so let's run that again tutorial 5 dot pi and now let's open that up in subline text which is right here ok so awesome so we can see that this is showing up and this is actually where we are creating the photo so it says self now photo dot set pic smack pixmap and then it says QT GUI q pixmap cat jpg so we're actually gonna copy this line because that's what we're gonna use to change the photo when we click on those buttons so let's go ahead and set up those buttons now so we know that our buttons are called dog and are called cat so what I'm actually gonna do is just create some methods and I'll just say show underscore dog and this will be self I'll create another one this is defined show on this word cat if I could spell that correctly and self now inside here I'm just gonna copy what I had there for this photo and what you can actually do

so we're gonna have cat dog a pig and I guess it should be other way around so cats is down here and dog is here and then what we're gonna do is just link up our buttons so that they actually call those methods so to do that again this is what we already done a bunch of times we'll do self dot dog clicked itzhak connect show underscore dog need to make sure we have a self before that and then same thing for cat so self dot cat dot clicked dot connect self dot show underscore cat so let's go ahead and run this so right now you see we start with a cat and if I go ahead and click dog it actually changes over to the dog and I can click cat and swap back and forth now let's do one last test here because this video is actually quite short right now and let's drag these images into this IMG folder and see if we can get them to work by doing IMG's like this so let's go IMG's IMG's let's run that and let's go cats dog cats dog cat dog and there you go that shows you how to do that so a
