00:00 - so this language that I'm going to
00:01 - recommend to you for this First Avenue
00:03 - is to learn go now go is a fairly new
00:05 - programming language it is statically
00:07 - typed it is extremely fast and highly
00:09 - performant and it's typically used in
00:11 - back-end applications for backend web
00:13 - services a lot of people really like go
00:15 - because it's extremely simple this is
00:17 - really a language that's going to be
00:18 - pretty easy to transition to from python
00:20 - but still give you a good perspective on
00:22 - the different aspects of coding you're
00:24 - missing in a dynamically typed language
00:26 - yet you're going to have this high
00:27 - performance language it's very In Demand
00:29 - right now A lot of people are looking
00:30 - for go programmers and personally this
00:32 - is the one I would recommend to most
00:34 - people if you really like python already
00:36 - you're going to like go I can promise
00:38 - you that
