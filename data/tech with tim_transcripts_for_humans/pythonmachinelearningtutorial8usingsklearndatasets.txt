00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - machine learning tutorial so in today's
00:04 - video we are moving out of KNN we're
00:06 - done with that now and we're gonna be
00:07 - going into something called SVM I just
00:09 - realize I put s MV in my working file
00:11 - anyways SVM which stands for support
00:14 - vector machine and I'm not really going
00:16 - to talk about exactly what it is in this
00:18 - video but I we are just gonna be
00:19 - importing our data again getting
00:21 - everything in we're gonna use SK learn
00:23 - some built-in data sets because that's
00:24 - the easiest way to do it and essentially
00:26 - the reason I haven't used these data
00:28 - sets which you'll see you're like really
00:29 - easy to use in earlier videos is because
00:32 - I want you guys to learn how to properly
00:34 - bring in your own data because
00:36 - realistically if you're doing this for
00:38 - any applications outside of just kind of
00:40 - playing around with it you're probably
00:42 - gonna use data that is not like
00:44 - formatted properly or is missing things
00:46 - or needs like titles or needs to be
00:48 - transformed into numeric data so I want
00:50 - to show you guys that in the earlier
00:52 - videos I also quickly just want to say
00:54 - thank you to everyone for all the
00:55 - amazing feedback I've been getting I'm
00:57 - trying to make this tutorial good enough
00:59 - that kind of everyone can follow along
01:01 - depending on your skill level and Python
01:04 - like if you're a beginner or not but I
01:05 - will say now this is where things are
01:07 - gonna start getting a bit more difficult
01:09 - in terms of understanding the
01:10 - mathematics are getting a bit more
01:12 - complex and as we move into neural
01:14 - networks that is gonna be getting even
01:16 - more complex so I'm gonna continue to
01:17 - try to explain it as best as I can but
01:20 - just a warning that I will be using or I
01:21 - will be assuming that you have some kind
01:23 - of math background probably like
01:25 - finishing high school math just because
01:27 - I can't really explain like super
01:28 - fundamental math concepts in these
01:31 - videos anyways before I keep going cuz
01:34 - this will be a shorter video in terms of
01:35 - importing the data I want to show you or
01:37 - just tell you guys what the series is
01:38 - gonna look like in the future cuz I know
01:39 - some of you been asking like what's next
01:41 - so essentially what I'm planning to do
01:42 - is SVM that'll be probably another two
01:45 - or three videos depending on how long it
01:47 - takes me to explain it and then after
01:49 - that we're gonna be getting into neural
01:50 - networks now I know how all you guys are
01:51 - really excited about neural networks and
01:53 - essentially what I'm gonna do is
01:54 - probably do like two or three projects
01:57 - with neural networks so the first one
01:59 - I'm gonna do with neural networks is
02:00 - gonna be if you saw my tutorial video or
02:03 - not really tutorial is it kind of like a
02:05 - showcase of how I had those handwritten
02:07 - digits and we were classifying them
02:08 - based on what I would bring in I'll
02:10 - leave a card to that in the corner
02:12 - if you want have a look at that but
02:13 - essentially I'm going to be teaching how
02:14 - we can do that and then we'll move into
02:16 - some more advanced things with no
02:17 - networks and hopefully at the end of
02:19 - this series I'm gonna make a new series
02:21 - and train like like a neural network to
02:23 - play a game or do something like that so
02:25 - let me know if you guys are excited
02:25 - about that last notes sorry I nose has
02:28 - been a very long kind of introduction
02:30 - but this is important if you guys want
02:32 - to join my discord server there's link
02:34 - below my Twitter is there as well that's
02:36 - a really good great place for you guys
02:37 - to connecting the ask some questions and
02:39 - just join a community we already have a
02:40 - ton of people on there and it's been
02:41 - awesome to kind of see the chats going
02:44 - on in the discord server so I welcome
02:45 - you guys to join so anyways let's get
02:47 - into the actual tutorial we're just
02:49 - gonna load in data this ship won't take
02:50 - us long so we're just gonna import SK
02:52 - learn from SK learn this is no we're
02:55 - gonna import datasets
02:56 - now essentially datasets is just holds
03:00 - like a ton of different datasets that
03:01 - are really easy to load in you'll see in
03:02 - a second we're also just going to from
03:05 - SK learn we're going to import SVM and
03:09 - SPM is going to be our classifier so
03:10 - that's what we're gonna be using okay so
03:13 - now that we've done that what we need to
03:14 - do is load in our data set so the table
03:16 - set i'm gonna be using is a cancer data
03:18 - set and that is a breast cancer when i
03:20 - believe and essentially there's just a
03:21 - bunch of different features and those
03:23 - point to a tumor that is either
03:25 - cancerous or non-cancerous correct me if
03:27 - I'm saying this incorrectly but a
03:29 - malignant or benign I believe is how you
03:31 - say that so to load in our data really
03:34 - easy all we have to do is just do cancer
03:35 - equals data sets dot load breast cancer
03:39 - now just look here at this all these
03:41 - autocorrects all you have to do to
03:43 - change the data set we're using is pick
03:45 - one of these other ones so irish is a
03:47 - popular one for svm breast cancers a
03:49 - popular one as well there's some other
03:51 - ones as well you can pick from but i
03:53 - don't guarantee they're gonna work
03:54 - because it has to be a classification
03:56 - data set because that's what SVM is used
03:58 - for classifying what do you call it just
04:02 - like points right classifying data to be
04:03 - a certain class so now that we do that
04:06 - we're gonna actually just print out our
04:08 - features and our labels just we know the
04:10 - names of them so essentially to do this
04:11 - all we do is we just print cancer dot
04:14 - label underscore names believe that's
04:17 - right we'll see and then we're gonna do
04:20 - cancer dot target underscore names
04:24 - I don't even know if these brackets need
04:26 - to be here but I guess we will see ya
04:28 - label names is apparently not a thing so
04:30 - one second sorry let me just have a look
04:32 - at my other file label names beetroot
04:35 - names my bad and I don't think we
04:38 - actually yeah we don't need these
04:39 - brackets here as well I don't think
04:40 - they'll make a difference but let's do
04:41 - this okay so you can see here we have
04:44 - all our features now mean radius mean
04:46 - texture it mean perimeter and then
04:48 - malignant and benign again don't really
04:50 - know you say that properly but anyways
04:52 - and so this is same thing whenever you
04:54 - load in like another data set and you
04:56 - call it something else to see all the
04:57 - different features you do not to see all
04:58 - the different labels or targets you do
05:01 - this okay now what I'm going to do is
05:03 - I'm going to set up my X and wireless
05:04 - here for a data so X is gonna be very
05:07 - simple it's just cancer data and Y is
05:09 - gonna be cancer dot target so pretty
05:14 - straightforward there and then to split
05:16 - up our data we're gonna use that split
05:17 - test train or train test split or
05:20 - whatever it is I'm gonna copy it in
05:21 - because I really don't a mess up typing
05:23 - and then have to correct myself but it
05:25 - something like this
05:25 - right so we have our extra X test Y
05:28 - train Y test and we're using SK learned
05:30 - model selection train test split I know
05:33 - what a mouthful and then we will put
05:35 - instead of cancer data and cancer on
05:37 - target which will work we'll just put x
05:39 - and y here and notice I just increased
05:42 - this size to 20% for our test size
05:45 - doesn't really matter I just wanted some
05:47 - more data to test with but again you
05:49 - guys can play around with this number I
05:50 - wouldn't really go any higher than 30%
05:52 - though okay so now we've got our data
05:54 - let's have a look at it make sure
05:55 - everything looks fine so let's just
05:57 - print X underscore train and let's just
06:01 - do one underscore train as well just to
06:04 - see what these look like
06:05 - okay so we've printed them out now and
06:08 - we can see we've got a bunch of like
06:09 - crazy decimal numbers right and then our
06:12 - woody call it here are labels or our
06:14 - targets are all gonna be one or zero
06:15 - where's your representative benign and
06:18 - one represents or what am I saying
06:21 - zero represents malignant one represents
06:23 - benign so what I'm actually gonna do is
06:25 - I'm going to copy this list here cuz I'm
06:27 - gonna use this later and what I'm gonna
06:29 - just do is do classes like this is equal
06:31 - to and I'm just gonna copy this in here
06:34 - so that when we get those zeros and ones
06:36 - later and we want to print
06:37 - to print out the actual answer we can
06:39 - just index them in this list so I know
06:41 - this video has been short and it's been
06:42 - a lot more just kind of about the series
06:44 - than actually loading in data but this
06:46 - is all I'm doing for right now the next
06:47 - video will be going over how SVM's work
06:49 - that's gonna be a pretty detailed
06:51 - explanation and then we're gonna get
06:52 - into obviously implementing the
06:53 - algorithm doing some stuff with that and
06:55 - then moving into neural networks if you
06:57 - guys are excited for the rest of the
06:58 - videos please make sure you leave a like
06:59 - and subscribe and I will see you again
07:00 - in the other ones
07:02 - [Music]
