00:00 - the fastest way to make a lot of money
00:01 - coding is to focus on a lucrative Niche
00:04 - being well-rounded is great but when you
00:06 - want to stand out in a competitive
00:07 - market being able to present yourself as
00:09 - a niche Authority is critical and this
00:12 - video is going to help you do exactly
00:14 - that so with that said let's break down
00:16 - the five highest paying coding niches
00:18 - that you can get into first up we have
00:20 - artificial intelligence and machine
00:22 - learning Ai and ml involve creating
00:24 - algorithms that allow computers to learn
00:26 - from data and to make decisions
00:29 - applications range from self-driving
00:31 - cars to Advanced Voice assistance to
00:33 - fraud detection systems we're seeing
00:35 - Mass adoption of AI across various
00:37 - sectors like Finance Healthcare and
00:39 - Retail and overall AI becoming more and
00:42 - more integrated in our daily lives now
00:44 - this Mass adoption is leading to ass
00:46 - Surge and AI developers and huge
00:48 - compensation packages especially from
00:51 - large companies for example software
00:53 - engineers at open aai are making between
00:55 - 500 and
00:56 - $950,000 per year and the average AI
01:00 - developer is making over
01:02 - $130,000 per year despite the looming
01:04 - narrative AI is predicted to create over
01:07 - 2.3 million jobs by 2025 while only
01:10 - replacing 1.8 leading to a net gain of
01:14 - 500,000 jobs now I know we hear all over
01:16 - the place that AI is replacing
01:18 - programmers and getting rid of all of
01:20 - the jobs that couldn't be further from
01:21 - the truth is actually creating a lot of
01:23 - opportunities that you can take
01:25 - advantage of right now that said if you
01:27 - want to become an AI developer here's
01:29 - exactly what you need to learn to break
01:31 - into this field starting with
01:33 - mathematics we have linear algebra
01:35 - calculus and statistics and some more
01:37 - advanced mathematical Concepts you
01:39 - learned in something like University or
01:41 - computer science degree then you're
01:43 - obviously going to need to know
01:44 - programming languages so something like
01:45 - Python and R are going to be the most
01:47 - popular for machine learning in AI
01:50 - moving into Frameworks there's a bunch
01:51 - of different ones you could learn but
01:53 - the most popular would probably be
01:54 - tensorflow pytorch or scikit learn then
01:58 - you're also going to want to know a lot
01:59 - of concept ceps related to Ai and ML and
02:01 - some of the popular algorithms
02:03 - understanding things like neural
02:05 - networks computer vision natural
02:07 - language processing your fundamental
02:09 - machine learning algorithm say like
02:11 - linear regression there's a lot of
02:12 - different topics you can get into here
02:14 - but you probably want to take a few
02:15 - machine learning or AI courses where you
02:17 - really get all of the fundamentals down
02:20 - and you understand the mathematical
02:21 - Concepts behind some of the core
02:23 - algorithms that are used to build some
02:25 - of those more advanced models lastly
02:27 - there's a few tools you may want to know
02:29 - things like Jupiter notebooks or a
02:31 - python versioning system like Anaconda
02:33 - there's a lot of stuff we could get into
02:35 - here but that is really just scratching
02:36 - the surface of the types of things
02:38 - you'll need to learn if you want to dive
02:40 - into Ai and ml now the next Niche on my
02:43 - list is data science data science is all
02:45 - about extracting meaningful insights
02:47 - from large data sets it involves data
02:50 - cleaning processing analyzing and even
02:52 - visualizing to allow businesses to make
02:55 - data driven decisions now in the current
02:57 - market AI is actually being used a ton
02:59 - for data analysis and if you want to
03:01 - learn more about that you can check out
03:03 - this free resource from a good friend of
03:05 - the channel HubSpot this resource
03:07 - discusses how to use AI for data
03:09 - analysis and goes over the impact of AI
03:12 - how to integrate it into your workflow
03:14 - and the impact it can have on your
03:15 - efficiency it even has a curated list of
03:18 - 30 plus AI tools to use specifically to
03:21 - enhance your analytical capabilities
03:23 - that's actually my favorite part of this
03:25 - resource a really useful list of tools
03:27 - that I can actually mess around with and
03:29 - see value from in my workflow I've left
03:32 - a link to this in the description so
03:33 - make sure you check it out now with AI
03:36 - becoming more and more powerful it's
03:37 - important to embrace it and really lean
03:39 - into these tools now a massive thank you
03:42 - to HubSpot for providing this resource
03:44 - and tons of others completely for free
03:46 - and for sponsoring today's video now
03:48 - data science has experienced tremendous
03:50 - growth over the past few years and this
03:52 - has really been driven by the importance
03:54 - of data in decisionmaking processes
03:57 - across various Industries job postings
03:59 - for data scientists have skyrocketed
04:01 - year-over-year showing a strong and
04:03 - sustained demand for these types of
04:05 - professionals like artificial
04:07 - intelligence data science is being
04:09 - adopted across a ton of different
04:10 - Industries even those that aren't
04:12 - typically considered that modern even
04:14 - your older School businesses are
04:16 - realizing the importance of utilizing
04:18 - data and because of that they need data
04:20 - scientists so many businesses today are
04:23 - running based on datadriven decisions
04:25 - and they need a way to analyze clean and
04:27 - visualize that data which is where where
04:29 - a data scientist comes in this leads the
04:32 - average salary of data scientists to be
04:34 - over
04:35 - $113,000 per year according to glass
04:37 - door where the more experienced data
04:39 - scientists and the managerial roles can
04:41 - earn significantly more than that really
04:44 - displaying the value placed on their
04:46 - skills now unlike artificial
04:47 - intelligence data science can be a
04:49 - little bit easier of a field to break
04:51 - into and although it does require a lot
04:53 - of education and practice is not nearly
04:55 - as complicated as something like machine
04:57 - learning or artificial intelligence with
04:59 - that said if you want to stand out as a
05:00 - data scientist here's a list of skills
05:02 - you probably should know just like Ai
05:04 - and ml you're probably going to want to
05:06 - know Python and R as those are the most
05:08 - popular when it comes to data
05:09 - manipulation and data visualization next
05:12 - you'll want to know some other tools and
05:13 - languages you'll need to know something
05:15 - like SQL so you can understand how to
05:16 - interact with a database and run various
05:19 - queries maybe tools like Tableau map
05:22 - plot lib something like Seaborn you also
05:24 - want to understand libraries to do data
05:26 - manipulation so things like pandas or
05:29 - num Pi if you're working in something
05:30 - like python beyond that it will be good
05:32 - to know about some basic machine
05:34 - learning algorithms and also some
05:35 - statistical methods things like
05:37 - regression analysis obviously there is a
05:40 - lot more that you need to learn but
05:41 - hopefully that gives you a little bit of
05:42 - an idea of what you'll be doing as a
05:44 - data scientist now let's get into
05:47 - blockchain development blockchain
05:49 - technology ensures secure transparent
05:51 - and tamperproof transactions it's used
05:54 - in cryptocurrencies Supply Chain
05:56 - management and even voting systems as
05:58 - blockchain is a relative atively New
06:00 - Field there's a high demand for skilled
06:02 - developers that have experience with
06:04 - this technology now that leads to
06:06 - lucrative opportunities where the
06:07 - average blockchain developers making
06:09 - over
06:10 - $150,000 per year this Technology's
06:13 - novelty really means there's a lack of
06:15 - experienced developers that understand
06:17 - topics like distributed systems
06:19 - cryptography and smart contract
06:21 - programming this means there's a huge
06:23 - opportunity to have really lucrative
06:25 - jobs in the blockchain field because
06:27 - companies are desperate to hire
06:29 - Developers that actually have these
06:30 - skills this is still a really good time
06:32 - to get into blockchain development
06:34 - despite what you might be hearing
06:36 - because we really are just getting
06:37 - started in this field there's so much
06:39 - more growth to come and I think if you
06:41 - learn blockchain development now you're
06:43 - not going to regret it in the future
06:45 - especially in a few years as blockchain
06:47 - continues to become more mainstream and
06:49 - its use cases broaden I really think
06:51 - we're going to see more and more growth
06:53 - and again if you can get in now I think
06:55 - you're really going to set yourself up
06:56 - for a lucrative career with really high
06:59 - pay with that said if you want to be
07:00 - competitive in this Niche then here are
07:02 - the things that you need to know
07:04 - starting with programming languages
07:05 - you're definitely going to need to know
07:07 - solidity but there are a few other
07:09 - options for example learning something
07:10 - like rust and you also probably want to
07:12 - know things like Python and JavaScript
07:15 - for actually interacting with your smart
07:17 - contracts and taking data from onchain
07:19 - and presenting it in some kind of web
07:21 - app or maybe in a backend service now
07:23 - you also need to know about various
07:25 - Concepts and theories like cryptography
07:27 - distributed systems smart contracts how
07:30 - different cryptocurrencies exist and
07:32 - what the differences are between them uh
07:34 - consensus mechanisms like proof of work
07:36 - proof of stake there's a lot of
07:38 - different things you'll want to learn so
07:39 - you actually understand what a
07:41 - cryptocurrency is and what blockchain
07:43 - technology is really used for now in
07:45 - terms of tools you'll want to know about
07:47 - things like truffle ganache and metamask
07:50 - and you'll want to look at different
07:51 - development Frameworks like using hardh
07:53 - hat and open Zeppelin there's a lot of
07:55 - stuff to discover in this world of
07:57 - blockchain but that's just a taste of
07:59 - what you'll need to learn if you want to
08:00 - get good in this field now fourth on my
08:02 - list is cyber security with the increase
08:05 - in cyber threats cyber security has
08:07 - become increasingly important to protect
08:10 - sensitive data and maintain privacy it
08:13 - involves defending against attacks
08:14 - ensuring data integrity and mitigating
08:17 - risks in 2023 there was a reported gap
08:20 - of 3.5 million cyber Security
08:23 - Professionals a gap that's expected to
08:25 - persist through 2025 now this highlights
08:28 - the immense demand for qual qualified
08:29 - cyber Security Professionals especially
08:32 - as Industries like Finance Healthcare
08:34 - and infrastructure become Prime targets
08:36 - for cyber attacks in fact 67% of
08:40 - organizations reported staff shortages
08:42 - because they couldn't find qualified
08:44 - candidates to address their cyber
08:46 - security issues now cyber Security
08:48 - Professionals are some of the highest
08:50 - paid in the tech industry really
08:51 - reflecting the specialized skills
08:53 - required and how critical and important
08:55 - their role is the average salary of
08:57 - cyber security Specialists ranges is
08:59 - from $12,000 to
09:02 - $150,000 per year depending on
09:04 - experience and location this is really a
09:07 - very lucrative role that has extreme
09:09 - demand and something I definitely
09:11 - recommend getting into if you're willing
09:13 - to learn all of the specialized skills
09:15 - now because I'm someone who doesn't have
09:16 - a ton of experience in cyber security
09:18 - I'm not going to give you a list of
09:20 - things to learn here I'm going to
09:21 - recommend you go and do your own
09:22 - research and learn from people more
09:24 - experienced than me what I will say is I
09:26 - know this is definitely a field that's
09:28 - very lucrative and constantly growing in
09:30 - demand we're seeing more and more cyber
09:33 - threats this is becoming more of an
09:34 - issue and more companies are really
09:36 - taking this seriously I think this is a
09:38 - great field to get into and if I was
09:40 - just starting out in Tech again this
09:42 - would probably be one of the number one
09:43 - ones that I would dive into just because
09:45 - of the potential and how much you can
09:47 - get paid and how important your role is
09:50 - so last but not least we have devops
09:52 - devops combines software development and
09:55 - it operations to improve deployment
09:57 - speed and quality devops has become a
10:00 - critical component of modern software
10:02 - development and the need for developers
10:04 - with this specialized set of skills is
10:06 - continually increasing as a devops
10:09 - engineer you need to know about software
10:10 - development but you'll be more
10:12 - responsible for building out continuous
10:14 - integration and continuous deployment
10:16 - pipelines while also handling things
10:18 - like monitoring and logging and dealing
10:21 - with kind of that bridge between the
10:22 - development side and actually putting
10:24 - things into production there's a lot of
10:26 - different things that you need to know
10:28 - and your role is really critical to make
10:30 - sure that you can actually have software
10:32 - that users can use the global devops
10:34 - market is expected to grow from about 10
10:36 - billion in 2023 to over $25 billion in
10:41 - 2028 representing a compound annual
10:44 - growth rate of over 20% this is really
10:47 - showing the increase in demand for
10:49 - devops engineers in this type of
10:51 - practice and getting into the devops
10:53 - field can lead to really lucrative
10:54 - salaries and really important roles with
10:57 - increasing demand the average salary of
10:59 - a devops engineer ranges but those that
11:01 - have 1 to 3 years of experience earn
11:04 - about
11:05 - $977,000 per year whereas those with
11:07 - four to six years of experience earn
11:09 - over
11:10 - $135,000 per year obviously you can make
11:12 - a lot more than this but this is a
11:14 - pretty competitive salary and something
11:16 - that's quite high if you compare it to a
11:17 - lot of the other regular development
11:19 - roles now if you want to be competitive
11:21 - in the devops field there's a lot of
11:23 - different things that you need to know
11:24 - and you also need to be good at regular
11:26 - software development before you start
11:28 - jumping into this more Advanced field
11:30 - regardless let me give you a list of
11:31 - things you might want to consider if you
11:33 - are going to become a devops engineer so
11:35 - in terms of programming languages we
11:37 - have python Java C++ Ruby you don't need
11:41 - to know all of them but knowing one or
11:42 - two of them can be good especially
11:44 - because you'll probably do some
11:45 - scripting as a devops engineer now next
11:48 - you'll want to know continuous
11:49 - integration tools so maybe things like
11:51 - Jenkins apachi Maven aachi ant then
11:54 - containerization and orchestration so
11:56 - things like Docker or kubernetes various
11:59 - Cloud platform so we have AWS Azure
12:02 - Google Cloud bunch of different options
12:04 - out there next Automation and
12:06 - configuration management so things like
12:08 - ansible shaft puppet and then we have
12:11 - monitoring and logging so things like
12:13 - Prometheus grafana elk stack I don't
12:16 - even know what half these things are I'm
12:17 - just listing them off because I found
12:18 - them in various job requirements and
12:20 - then security skills so things like Dev
12:22 - SEC Ops practices there's a ton of
12:25 - different things you need to know here
12:26 - and really what you're doing is Bridging
12:28 - the Gap from development to deployment
12:30 - which involves so many different steps
12:32 - and so many various tools I am not a
12:34 - devops engineer or an expert in this
12:36 - field I highly recommend if you want to
12:38 - get into this field then do your own
12:40 - research and find a better Mentor than
12:42 - me but I do know this is a niche that's
12:44 - up and coming where you can get paid a
12:45 - lot of money and there is a lot of
12:47 - growth expected so those are the five
12:49 - highest paying and in my opinion best
12:51 - coding niches to get into with that said
12:54 - there are so many other niches you can
12:56 - get into especially in 2024 and Beyond
12:59 - some of them may even pay more these are
13:01 - just the ones that made my list if you
13:03 - disagree with me I'd love to hear what
13:04 - you think in the comments down below if
13:06 - you enjoyed the video make sure to leave
13:07 - a like subscribe to the channel and I
13:09 - will see you in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

the fastest way to make a lot of money coding is to focus on a lucrative Niche being wellrounded is great but when you want to stand out in a competitive market being able to present yourself as a niche Authority is critical and this video is going to help you do exactly that so with that said let's break down the five highest paying coding niches that you can get into first up we have artificial intelligence and machine learning Ai and ml involve creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and to make decisions applications range from selfdriving cars to Advanced Voice assistance to fraud detection systems we're seeing Mass adoption of AI across various sectors like Finance Healthcare and Retail and overall AI becoming more and more integrated in our daily lives now this Mass adoption is leading to ass Surge and AI developers and huge compensation packages especially from large companies for example software engineers at open aai are making between 500 and $950,000 per year and the average AI developer is making over $130,000 per year despite the looming narrative AI is predicted to create over 2.3 million jobs by 2025 while only replacing 1.8 leading to a net gain of 500,000 jobs now I know we hear all over the place that AI is replacing programmers and getting rid of all of the jobs that couldn't be further from the truth is actually creating a lot of opportunities that you can take advantage of right now that said if you want to become an AI developer here's exactly what you need to learn to break into this field starting with

HubSpot this resource discusses how to use AI for data analysis and goes over the impact of AI how to integrate it into your workflow and the impact it can have on your efficiency it even has a curated list of 30 plus AI tools to use specifically to enhance your analytical capabilities that's actually my favorite part of this resource a really useful list of tools that I can actually mess around with and see value from in my workflow I've left a link to this in the description so make sure you check it out now with AI becoming more and more powerful it's important to embrace it and really lean into these tools now a massive thank you to HubSpot for providing this resource and tons of others completely for free and for sponsoring today's video now data science has experienced tremendous growth over the past few years and this has really been driven by the importance of data in decisionmaking processes across various Industries job postings for data scientists have

through 2025 now this highlights the immense demand for qual qualified cyber Security Professionals especially as Industries like Finance Healthcare and infrastructure become Prime targets for cyber attacks in fact 67% of organizations reported staff shortages because they couldn't find qualified candidates to address their cyber security issues now cyber Security Professionals are some of the highest paid in the tech industry really reflecting the specialized skills required and how critical and important their role is the average salary of cyber security Specialists ranges is from $12,000 to $150,000 per year depending on experience and location this is really a very lucrative role that has extreme demand and something I definitely recommend getting into if you're willing to learn all of the specialized skills now because I'm someone who doesn't have a ton of experience in cyber security I'm not going to give you a list of things to learn here I'm going to recommend you go and do your own research and learn from people more experienced than me what I will say is I know this is definitely a field that's very lucrative and constantly growing in demand we're seeing more and more cyber threats this is becoming more of an issue and more companies are really taking this seriously I think this is a great field to get into and if I was just starting out in Tech again this would probably be one of the number one ones that I would dive into just because of the potential and how much you can get paid and how important your role is so last but not least we have devops devops combines software development and it operations to improve deployment speed and quality devops has become a critical component of modern software development and the need for developers with this specialized set of skills is continually increasing as a devops engineer you need to know about software development but you'll be more responsible for building out continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines while also handling things like monitoring and logging and dealing with kind of that bridge between the development side and actually putting things into production there's a lot of different things that you need to know and your role is really critical to make sure that you can actually have software that users can use the global devops market is expected to grow from about 10 billion in 2023 to over $25 billion in 2028 representing a compound annual growth rate of over 20% this is really showing the increase in demand for devops engineers in this type of practice and getting into the devops field can lead to really lucrative salaries and really important roles with increasing demand the average salary of a devops engineer ranges but those that have 1 to 3 years of experience earn about $977,000 per year whereas those with four to six years of experience earn over $135,000 per year obviously you can make a lot more than this but this is a pretty competitive salary and something that's quite high if you compare it to a lot of the other regular development roles now if you want to be competitive in the devops field there's a lot of different things that you need to know and you also need to be good at regular software development before you start jumping into this more Advanced field regardless let me give you a list of things you might want to consider if you are going to become a devops engineer so in terms of programming languages we have python Java C++ Ruby you don't need to know all of them but knowing one or two of them can be good especially because you'll probably do some scripting as a devops engineer now next you'll want to know continuous integration tools so maybe things like Jenkins apachi Maven aachi ant then containerization and orchestration so things like Docker or kubernetes various Cloud platform so we have AWS Azure Google Cloud bunch of different options out there next Automation and configuration management so things like ansible shaft puppet and then we have monitoring and logging so things like Prometheus grafana elk stack I don't even know what half these things are I'm just listing them off because I found them in various job requirements and then security skills so things like Dev SEC Ops practices there's a ton of different things you need to know here and really what you're doing is Bridging the Gap from development to deployment which involves so many different steps and so many various tools I am not a devops engineer or an expert in this field I highly recommend if you want to get into this field then do your own research and find a better Mentor than me but I do know this is a niche that's up and coming where you can get paid a lot of money and there is a lot of growth expected so those are the five highest paying and in my opinion best coding niches to get into with that said there are so many other niches you can get into especially in 2024 and Beyond some of them may even pay more these are just the ones that made my list if you disagree with me I'd love to hear what you think in the comments down below if you enjoyed the video make sure to leave a like
