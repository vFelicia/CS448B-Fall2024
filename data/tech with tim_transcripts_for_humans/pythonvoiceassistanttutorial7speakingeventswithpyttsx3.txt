00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back so in
00:01 - the last video what we did is
00:03 - essentially make it so we can speak to
00:04 - the computer asking about any day that
00:06 - we have in our Google Calendar and see
00:09 - what events we have on that day so I'll
00:10 - give a quick demo here by running the
00:14 - program if I can actually run it what do
00:18 - I have on November 5th and you can see
00:23 - it actually prints out my entire
00:24 - schedule here saying I have a lecture
00:25 - lab lab and another lecture so this is
00:28 - how this works now it's gonna be really
00:30 - nice to actually get this assistant to
00:32 - speak back to us rather than us having
00:34 - to read through this like we would do if
00:36 - we just had you know our Google Calendar
00:38 - so what we're gonna do is modify this
00:40 - function get events so that it does
00:42 - exactly that and it speaks this back to
00:44 - us now the first thing I'm gonna start
00:46 - by doing is making an L state in here so
00:50 - it's actually saying if not event so
00:52 - there's nothing there we're gonna print
00:53 - no upcoming events otherwise what we're
00:56 - gonna do is we are going to actually
01:01 - instead of printing this we're going to
01:02 - speak this because we're gonna have the
01:05 - assistant speak that and otherwise we
01:08 - will have an F string in here for what
01:09 - the assistants gonna speak and it is
01:11 - gonna speak you have in here the Len of
01:17 - events event on this day so essentially
01:23 - it's gonna tell us how like we have you
01:25 - know six events on this day or we have
01:27 - three events on this day we're gonna
01:28 - start by speaking that out now what
01:31 - we're gonna do next is we're actually
01:32 - going to loop through all these events
01:34 - here and we're gonna print out the
01:36 - events like what it is as well as the
01:40 - time that it starts at so we're gonna
01:41 - say you have you know CSI to ten lecture
01:44 - on at 7:00 p.m. or whatever it is that's
01:47 - what I'm gonna be printing out so to do
01:49 - this we actually need to do a little bit
01:51 - of kind of weird manipulation with this
01:53 - date/time object that we get from this
01:55 - start variable here and we need to
01:57 - figure out the hour at which we have the
02:00 - event so to do this is a little
02:02 - convoluted I'll try to explain this but
02:04 - we're gonna say start underscore time
02:07 - equals string I guess it starts dot
02:11 - split at T like this one dot split at I
02:20 - think it's : and then zero now or sorry
02:24 - not : actually this is a - I'm gonna
02:27 - walk you through exactly what this just
02:28 - did this is actually going to give us
02:30 - the hour at which our event starts so if
02:33 - you look here at the string it's on the
02:35 - bottom of my screen I wish let's see if
02:36 - I can make it a bit bigger there we go
02:37 - you can see down here we have like 2019
02:40 - 11:05 T and that's how this date string
02:44 - comes it comes with it T so when I start
02:46 - by doing is splitting this whole string
02:48 - by T so what that means is we're gonna
02:49 - take this half and this half and split
02:53 - them so once I split this by this T I
02:56 - take the first index which is gonna give
02:58 - me all of this so 10 to 5 now what I do
03:03 - after this now is I split by this - so
03:07 - now I just get this 10 and that's
03:10 - exactly what I want because you know it
03:12 - starts at 10 now this - 5 is actually
03:15 - just like the UTC time zone so yours
03:17 - might be different here depending on
03:18 - what you have you can see you know mine
03:19 - starts at 10 then it starts at 1 then I
03:23 - guess 5 and then 7 so that's kind of how
03:26 - that works so that's how we split it so
03:28 - now that we split that with the start
03:30 - time we're gonna do next is add either
03:33 - an AM or a PM to our what is it is like
03:37 - string so what we're gonna say is if
03:40 - start underscore time we're gonna say
03:44 - actually if int start underscore time
03:47 - dot splits by : 0 is less than 12 then
03:55 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna say
03:57 - start mmm yes for as they start
04:00 - underscore time people start underscore
04:03 - time plus in this case a.m. because this
04:07 - means that the events happening in the
04:09 - a.m. so we want to say you know you have
04:11 - this at 10:00 a.m. now otherwise what
04:14 - will do is will say start on your square
04:16 - time people start on your square time +
04:20 - yeah now this is pretty straightforward
04:22 - what we're gonna say is you know we're
04:24 - gonna find this time so we're gonna find
04:25 - whatever it is we're gonna check if it's
04:27 - less than 12 because if it's less than
04:28 - 12 that means it's in the morning and we
04:30 - add an a.m. otherwise it's in the
04:32 - afternoon with the p.m. and then we add
04:33 - that to the end of this string because
04:35 - you know start time is a string and then
04:37 - read it out so now what we're gonna do
04:39 - is gonna say speak and then here we're
04:41 - gonna say event summary which is this
04:46 - part here so the CSI 2110 lecture that's
04:49 - gonna be the summary and we're gonna say
04:51 - plus at in this case and then our start
04:58 - underscore time so we're gonna say we
05:00 - have whatever the actual event summary
05:02 - so CSI lecture at and then maybe in this
05:04 - case 10:00 a.m. that's what we're gonna
05:06 - do and that should hopefully work let me
05:08 - just do a quick look through here to
05:09 - make sure I didn't mess anything up too
05:10 - badly it looks to be ah one second I
05:15 - need to fix this bracket here so we're
05:17 - gonna split at t then we put the square
05:19 - bracket so just make sure you didn't
05:20 - mess up those brackets like I did but
05:23 - that looks to be right now so let's run
05:24 - this and test it out what do I have on
05:28 - Monday you have to this day 21:36 ledger
05:35 - at 10:00 a.m. so see 2109 919 p.m. and
05:40 - there we go
05:41 - that is how that works now what we can
05:43 - also do is if we want it to say like
05:45 - 7:00 p.m. instead of you know like 19
05:47 - p.m. because that doesn't really make
05:48 - sense what we'll say here is we'll just
05:51 - take like this here and subtract 12 from
05:54 - it so it'll actually tell us the correct
05:56 - time so I'm gonna just copy this
05:57 - actually I'm gonna put this here and I'm
05:59 - gonna say start
06:01 - underscore time equals string of this
06:06 - minus 12 so let's run this now and we'll
06:09 - say the same thing and see we get 7 p.m.
06:11 - because what this is doing is just
06:12 - getting rid of that 24 hour time and
06:14 - giving us because we have the AM and PM
06:16 - s right what do I have on Monday 21:36
06:24 - ledger at 10 a.m.
06:26 - 21 at 7:00 p.m. and there we go that is
06:30 - how that works now this is correct this
06:32 - is actually what my schedule is
06:33 - that is pretty much how we get this to
06:35 - speak it out now the next thing that I'm
06:37 - going to add here because this video is
06:38 - kind of short he's just making it so we
06:40 - only actually call this you know get
06:42 - events function in this get date
06:44 - function if we say something that you
06:47 - know makes sense for that so like I'm
06:49 - only gonna call get events or get date
06:52 - if we say something to that requires
06:56 - getting that because right now we're
06:57 - always gonna do that so whether I say
06:59 - like hello will still call get events
07:00 - will still call get date so I'm just
07:02 - gonna create a list here which is
07:05 - actually just gonna stand for all the
07:06 - things that we could say to trigger us
07:09 - to want to tell the person their
07:11 - calendar or the events they have on that
07:13 - day so I'm gonna call this like I guess
07:16 - calendar underscore strings I don't know
07:20 - you call it whatever you want and then
07:22 - here I'm just gonna put a bunch of kind
07:23 - of phrases that someone might say before
07:26 - they're gonna ask about what they have
07:27 - or like they're gonna ask about their
07:28 - plans so you guys will understand I'm
07:30 - gonna say what do I have like if that's
07:34 - in the string someone's probably asking
07:36 - like what do I have on Tuesday or what
07:38 - do I have on November 3rd so then we're
07:40 - gonna give that information to them you
07:42 - can say do I have plans if someone says
07:45 - that then they're probably gonna be
07:47 - talking about a day and they probably
07:48 - gonna want to know what they have on
07:49 - that day you might say am i busy so if
07:53 - you say am i busy then that might you
07:55 - know you might add like am i busy on
07:57 - Wednesday so we can add all kinds of
07:58 - stuff here I might just say do I have
08:02 - plans as another one and oh I already
08:05 - have do I have plans okay we'll just
08:06 - leave it at 3 for now but I mean you
08:07 - guys can add a ton of these that you
08:10 - think someone might say when they want
08:11 - to ask about their calendar so what
08:13 - we're gonna do now is we're gonna
08:15 - actually loop through all of these see
08:17 - if this is a part of whatever text we
08:19 - got here and if it is then you know
08:21 - we'll call get events we'll get the date
08:23 - from that text and we'll tell them what
08:25 - they have on that day so we're gonna say
08:26 - for I guess I don't know let's just go
08:31 - hmm what should it be
08:33 - let's say for parades in calendar
08:37 - strings if phrase like this in text so
08:44 - essentially if we see one of these in
08:46 - the tech
08:46 - then what we will do is exactly this
08:49 - will get the events and to say that to
08:52 - the person now what we're actually going
08:54 - to do here that was split this up into
08:55 - two variables so we're gonna say date
08:57 - equals get date text now we're gonna do
09:00 - a quick thing here and we're going to
09:02 - say if date which essentially means if
09:05 - it's not none then we'll pass that into
09:09 - here and actually get the plans that we
09:10 - have on that day now this is just to
09:12 - prevent us from possibly you know
09:14 - running into an era where we return none
09:16 - from yet date because I actually didn't
09:18 - talk about a specific day and then we
09:20 - call to get events function you know
09:21 - with that none and we run into an error
09:23 - so that's what this is gonna do but if
09:25 - let's say you know they say what do I
09:27 - have
09:27 - and then they don't continue and they
09:29 - don't say anything we should probably
09:31 - tell them you know like I don't
09:32 - understand what you're saying or this
09:33 - doesn't make sense so I'm just gonna
09:35 - speak please try again now the very last
09:43 - thing I'm gonna add here before I test
09:44 - this out is I just want to print a thing
09:47 - here that says start after we
09:48 - authenticate Google because sometimes if
09:51 - you just start speaking immediately when
09:52 - you run the bot it's still
09:54 - authenticating your like information for
09:57 - Google Calendar and all of that so we're
09:59 - gonna wait for it to say start and then
10:00 - that's actually one will start speaking
10:01 - and let's try this now what do I have on
10:06 - Friday uh and unfortunately what do I
10:12 - have
10:13 - ah that's this is what I need to do I
10:15 - forgot I used to say if phrase in
10:17 - textile or need to turn the text into
10:19 - dog lower okay so if phrase in textile
10:22 - lower because you see this eye here it
10:24 - was it wasn't being caught in that
10:26 - phrase so let's try this now wait for it
10:31 - to start to see that message let's run
10:33 - this one more time what do I have on
10:38 - Friday
10:40 - you have my events on this day six
10:43 - twenty one to live richer eleven Here I
10:45 - am and there we go so you can see that
10:48 - is how that works and now we can
10:50 - essentially speak to the computer asking
10:52 - about any day and it will tell us what
10:54 - we have on that day now I think this is
10:57 - really cool it's actually pretty useful
10:59 - we're gonna obviously make this more
11:00 - advanced and add some more features but
11:02 - as always if you guys have any ideas or
11:03 - you think that I did anything wrong in
11:05 - this video please don't hesitate to
11:06 - leave a comment down below I do read
11:08 - them all what would that being said I
11:09 - will see you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome back so in the last video what we did is essentially make it so we can speak to the computer asking about any day that we have in our Google Calendar and see what events we have on that day so I'll give a quick demo here by running the program if I can actually run it what do I have on November 5th and you can see it actually prints out my entire schedule here saying I have a lecture lab lab and another lecture so this is how this works now it's gonna be really nice to actually get this assistant to speak back to us rather than us having to read through this like we would do if we just had you know our Google Calendar so what we're gonna do is modify this function get events so that it does exactly that and it speaks this back to us now the first thing I'm gonna start by doing is making an L state in here so it's actually saying if not event so there's nothing there we're gonna print no upcoming events otherwise what we're gonna do is we are going to actually instead of printing this we're going to speak this because we're gonna have the assistant speak that and otherwise we will have an F string in here for what the assistants gonna speak and it is gonna speak you have in here the Len of events event on this day so essentially it's gonna tell us how like we have you know six events on this day or we have three events on this day we're gonna start by speaking that out now what we're gonna do next is we're actually going to loop through all these events here and we're gonna print out the events like what it is as well as the time that it starts at so we're gonna say you have you know CSI to ten lecture on at 700 p.m. or whatever it is that's what I'm gonna be printing out so to do this we actually need to do a little bit of kind of weird manipulation with this date/time object that we get from this start variable here and we need to figure out the hour at which we have the event so to do this is a little convoluted I'll try to explain this but we're gonna say start underscore time equals string I guess it starts dot split at T like this one dot split at I think it's and then zero now or sorry not actually this is a I'm gonna walk you through exactly what this just did this is actually going to give us the hour at which our event starts so if you look here at the string it's on the bottom of my screen I wish let's see if I can make it a bit bigger there we go you can see down here we have like 2019 1105 T and that's how this date string comes it comes with it T so when I start by doing is splitting this whole string by T so what that means is we're gonna take this half and this half and split them so once I split this by this T I take the first index which is gonna give me all of this so 10 to 5 now what I do after this now is I split by this so now I just get this 10 and that's exactly what I want because you know it starts at 10 now this 5 is actually just like the UTC time zone so yours might be different here depending on what you have you can see you know mine starts at 10 then it starts at 1 then I guess 5 and then 7 so that's kind of how that works so that's how we split it so now that we split that with the start time we're gonna do next is add either an AM or a PM to our what is it is like string so what we're gonna say is if start underscore time we're gonna say actually if int start underscore time dot splits by 0 is less than 12 then what we're gonna do is we're gonna say start mmm yes for as they start underscore time people start underscore time plus in this case a.m. because this means that the events happening in the a.m. so we want to say you know you have this at 1000 a.m. now otherwise what will do is will say start on your square time people start on your square time + yeah now this is pretty straightforward what we're gonna say is you know we're gonna find this time so we're gonna find whatever it is we're gonna check if it's less than 12 because if it's less than 12 that means it's in the morning and we add an a.m. otherwise it's in the afternoon with the p.m. and then we add that to the end of this string because you know start time is a string and then read it out so now what we're gonna do is gonna say speak and then here we're gonna say event summary which is this part here so the CSI 2110 lecture that's gonna be the summary and we're gonna say plus at in this case and then our start underscore time so we're gonna say we have whatever the actual event summary so CSI lecture at and then maybe in this case 1000 a.m. that's what we're gonna do and that should hopefully work let me just do a quick look through here to make sure I didn't mess anything up too badly it looks to be ah one second I need to fix this bracket here so we're gonna split at t then we put the square bracket so just make sure you didn't mess up those brackets like I did but that looks to be right now so let's run this and test it out what do I have on Monday you have to this day 2136 ledger at 1000 a.m. so see 2109 919 p.m. and there we go that is how that works now what we can also do is if we want it to say like 700 p.m. instead of you know like 19 p.m. because that doesn't really make sense what we'll say here is we'll just take like this here and subtract 12 from it so it'll actually tell us the correct time so I'm gonna just copy this actually I'm gonna put this here and I'm gonna say start underscore time equals string of this minus 12 so let's run this now and we'll say the same thing and see we get 7 p.m. because what this is doing is just getting rid of that 24 hour time and giving us because we have the AM and PM s right what do I have on Monday 2136 ledger at 10 a.m. 21 at 700 p.m. and there we go that is how that works now this is correct this is actually what my schedule is that is pretty much how we get this to speak it out now the next thing that I'm going to add here because this video is kind of short he's just making it so we only actually call this you know get events function in this get date function if we say something that you know makes sense for that so like I'm only gonna call get events or get date if we say something to that requires getting that because right now we're always gonna do that so whether I say like hello will still call get events will still call get date so I'm just gonna create a list here which is actually just gonna stand for all the things that we could say to trigger us to want to tell the person their calendar or the events they have on that day so I'm gonna call this like I
