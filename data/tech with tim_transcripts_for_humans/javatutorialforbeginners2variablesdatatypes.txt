00:00 - hello and welcome to video 2 in our Java
00:03 - programming tutorial series for
00:05 - beginners so you can see where we are
00:08 - right where we left off with printing
00:09 - two lines hello world - hello world - to
00:11 - the screen and in this video I'm gonna
00:13 - be going over variables and data types
00:15 - the absolute fundamentals we have to
00:17 - understand before we can move on to
00:18 - anything more complex so let's talk
00:22 - about what a variable is now a variable
00:24 - just like in mathematics is something
00:27 - that holds a value now in our case that
00:29 - doesn't have to be just a number it
00:30 - could be a string it could be a boolean
00:33 - an integer like we're gonna talk about
00:35 - the different values and those are what
00:37 - are known as datatypes or objects so
00:41 - let's start by just creating a variable
00:43 - to create a variable we need to first
00:46 - figure out what type our variable is
00:48 - gonna be in this case I'm going to start
00:50 - with an integer and then we're going to
00:52 - go through all the different types and
00:53 - talk about the differences so to start
00:56 - we're gonna type int declaring that this
00:58 - variable that we're about to type out is
01:00 - going to be an integer we're then going
01:02 - to give a variable name now the variable
01:05 - name should contain typically just
01:07 - letters and underscores now I believe
01:10 - you can use numbers as long as it's at
01:11 - the end but our purpose we're not gonna
01:13 - do that when we create a variable name
01:15 - you have to make sure you do not use any
01:16 - spaces and you don't use any special
01:19 - characters as well so I'll go through a
01:20 - few examples of valid variable names and
01:21 - invalid variable names so a valid
01:23 - variable name for example could be hello
01:26 - that's valid because we don't have any
01:28 - spaces we don't have any special
01:30 - characters and there's no numbers and
01:31 - okay now an invalid variable name would
01:34 - be something like hello name okay this
01:37 - whole thing as our variable name is
01:39 - invalid because it contains a space now
01:42 - if I try to put like a what do you call
01:46 - it % like this or I try to put like an
01:48 - asterisks that is not a valid variable
01:50 - name so don't use any special characters
01:52 - you can end with an underscore you could
01:55 - start with an underscore if you want to
01:56 - but we're not going to be doing that in
01:58 - this case typically when you create a
02:00 - variable if you want to make a name be
02:02 - like two words the way you do it is you
02:05 - type like hello and then you would do a
02:07 - capital and then the next word or you
02:09 - would do an underscore representing a
02:10 - space
02:12 - then next word okay so that's enough
02:14 - about valid variable names not super
02:15 - important right now
02:16 - so I'm gonna create my first variable
02:18 - into hello world and that's gonna be
02:20 - equal to by participating an equal sign
02:22 - whatever integer I want so in this case
02:24 - I'm going to say five and then remember
02:26 - in Java whenever we end the line so this
02:28 - is just saying my integer HelloWorld is
02:30 - equal to five we need to terminate with
02:32 - a semicolon so there we go
02:34 - and we see we get int our variable name
02:36 - is now highlighted in yellow and there's
02:39 - no issues so if I hi let's just see what
02:41 - it says this very is never used
02:43 - okay that's fine so we've officially
02:45 - created a variable the variable name
02:48 - hello world now points to the integer
02:51 - five so to prove this to you I am simply
02:55 - going to print out the value of hello
02:57 - world like this okay I'm gonna say
03:01 - system dot out its a comma isn't it
03:04 - system.out.println and what we're gonna
03:07 - do is we're gonna say okay so hello
03:08 - underscore world that's our variable
03:11 - name and that variable holds five so
03:14 - when we print this we should be printing
03:15 - five the way this works in the computer
03:17 - right is it says okay hello world let's
03:19 - see where hello world is it's up here
03:21 - alright hello world is equal to 5 so we
03:22 - print that ok so there we go and we get
03:25 - 5 printed down here in the bottom of the
03:27 - screen now I want to show you something
03:29 - quickly and this is just gonna go this
03:31 - is a really important fundamental thing
03:32 - a lot of people don't talk about in
03:33 - programming tutorials and it's kind of
03:36 - like order of operations or execution so
03:38 - I am going to now put my variable
03:41 - underneath my system dot out dot println
03:45 - ok so I'm first gonna print hello world
03:47 - and then I'm gonna set hello world is
03:49 - equal to 5 hopefully you guys have
03:52 - realized what the issue might be here if
03:54 - not I'll talk about it really quickly
03:56 - and the problem is that I am trying to
03:59 - print the value of hello world before
04:00 - I've declared it because the in
04:03 - programming the way things work is
04:04 - unless you otherwise specify we're gonna
04:07 - be reading from top to bottom and left
04:10 - to right just the way you'd read a book
04:11 - right so we first read this line system
04:14 - dot out dot println a hello world and
04:16 - then we create hello world so here we
04:19 - don't know what hole the world is so if
04:21 - we try to do this you can see it warns
04:24 - me there's an error
04:25 - okay you know what there's Nair let's
04:26 - proceed anyways and you can see that
04:28 - down here we get a bunch of red text and
04:29 - it says we call it hello world cannot be
04:33 - resolved to a variable because we
04:35 - haven't yet declared that variable so we
04:38 - have to make sure whenever we're
04:39 - referencing or using variables that we
04:41 - first have them declared somewhere above
04:44 - our like the line that we're using them
04:47 - in okay so there we go we've created a
04:49 - variable hello world we print that to
04:51 - the screen now let's create a few
04:53 - different variables and talk about what
04:55 - these types are so in case I didn't
04:56 - really specify int stands for integer
04:58 - and that pretty much stands for any
05:01 - number that does not have a decimal
05:03 - point so as soon as I put a decimal like
05:05 - this like 5.0 this actually becomes a
05:08 - new data type and that data type is
05:10 - called a float now float stands for a
05:13 - floating decimal point which means any
05:15 - number that has a floating decimal point
05:17 - so I'm going to say float
05:19 - let's see num2 is gonna be my variable
05:23 - name is equal to and in this case I'm
05:25 - going to say 5.0 what's the issue here
05:30 - add casts from double to okay one second
05:33 - where is it double okay sorry I made a
05:35 - mistake there we're just gonna type
05:36 - double here as the name okay not float
05:38 - don't worry about float right now we'll
05:40 - talk about that later so anyways we have
05:41 - double num 2 equals 5.0 now double is
05:45 - exactly what I was explaining before
05:46 - anything that has a floating decimal
05:48 - point so even though this is still the
05:50 - exact same values this in terms of
05:52 - mathematics because it has a floating
05:54 - decimal point in our computer isn't
05:56 - referenced as a double okay now there's
06:01 - some other data types as well that we're
06:03 - gonna talk about so we have int we have
06:05 - double we also have something called
06:06 - boolean now boolean is true or false and
06:11 - these are gonna be really important in
06:12 - the next few videos that we talked about
06:13 - so boolean I'm just gonna say B as my
06:16 - variable name is going to be equal to
06:18 - and in this case I'm going to say true
06:20 - and again make sure I'm putting my
06:22 - semicolon now there's only two values
06:24 - that a that your a boolean data type can
06:28 - have that is true or false
06:31 - now why these are important is because
06:33 - based on the value of a boolean type
06:35 - we're gonna be doing things later in our
06:37 - program
06:38 - like if B was equal to true we're gonna
06:39 - print something otherwise we won't print
06:40 - something so that's really important
06:42 - another data type that we have is known
06:45 - as char now char is any character okay
06:50 - so this is a little bit different from
06:52 - string that I talked about in the last
06:53 - video but I'm going to talk about string
06:54 - as well so I'm gonna say char C is equal
06:57 - to and whenever we create a character
06:59 - there's two ways that we can do it we
07:01 - can do it with Unicode which you
07:02 - probably don't know what that is or we
07:04 - could do it with single quotation marks
07:06 - so by just simply hitting the single
07:08 - quotation marks we can put one letter in
07:10 - the single quotation marks and that is a
07:12 - character because that's what char
07:13 - stands for a character so like something
07:15 - on your keyboard in quotation marks now
07:18 - a character could be for example 9 in
07:21 - quotation marks so that's still a valid
07:22 - character because it's in quotation
07:25 - marks it's different than the number
07:26 - like 9 if you're if I were to type that
07:28 - up here ok so any letter or character
07:32 - that goes in quotation marks is a char
07:35 - now we have to be careful because chars
07:38 - can only be one one character if I try
07:40 - to do like 0 3 you can see that we're
07:42 - getting read text and job is yelling at
07:44 - us and it's saying no that's not allowed
07:45 - because we can only have one thing all
07:48 - right now I just want to show you I want
07:50 - to go over again really quickly what the
07:51 - main differences between this 9 and this
07:54 - 9 up here we've declared we're gonna
07:56 - have an integer name Tolo world and it's
07:59 - set equal to 9 okay that's what it is
08:01 - this is a character and since this is in
08:04 - quotation marks this is not the same
08:06 - thing as 9 the way like the datatypes
08:08 - really do matter in this sense okay so
08:11 - I'm just gonna change this back to like
08:13 - H something for now ok char c equal to H
08:16 - so that is extremely important now
08:19 - string this is another data type it's a
08:21 - different kind of data type which we'll
08:23 - talk about in a second but to make a
08:24 - string we do string I believe with a
08:26 - capital we'll see and then we give a
08:30 - name so for our variable in this case
08:31 - I'm gonna say STR is equal to and then
08:35 - at this time for a string we used double
08:37 - quotation marks okay and I'm just gonna
08:39 - say Tim in here so chars single
08:42 - quotation marks and strings are double
08:45 - quotation marks okay and strings can
08:47 - contain anything in them so I could have
08:49 - like six seven and three
08:51 - underscore star that's a completely
08:53 - valid string we can put any characters
08:56 - as long as they're with inside of these
08:58 - quotation marks okay same thing with the
09:00 - character if you put a nine in a string
09:02 - this is different than a nine like this
09:04 - okay so these are our main datatypes
09:08 - there are a few other ones but I'm not
09:10 - going to go into them right now because
09:12 - they they're a bit more complex than
09:15 - then we can handle right now so pretty
09:17 - much though you might notice that this
09:19 - string is highlighted as a different
09:21 - color than these and see int as orange
09:24 - doubles Orange boolean's Orange chars
09:25 - Orange
09:26 - why is string blue now the reason it's
09:29 - blue it's because it's a different type
09:31 - of data type these four dog types I
09:34 - talked about up top here are known as
09:37 - primitive and wow I really just did that
09:41 - I'm used to typing Python primitive data
09:43 - types okay and what that stands for is
09:46 - not changeable okay and we're gonna talk
09:49 - more about primitive data types and not
09:51 - primitive data types later on but just
09:53 - know that these ones I talked about here
09:54 - are known as primitive in Java and this
09:57 - one is not primitive okay so anyways
10:01 - let's just see now torrenting out like
10:04 - some of these data types like what we
10:05 - get when we print them to the screen
10:06 - right so if I print for example C to the
10:08 - screen well you should guess what we're
10:10 - gonna get we get H cuz that's C if we
10:13 - print STR we get 9 and so on now last
10:19 - thing I want to show you with variables
10:20 - is that we can actually make variables
10:22 - equal to other variables and we can add
10:24 - variables and we can subtract variables
10:26 - and this we're gonna be doing a lot in
10:27 - the next video but I want to just
10:28 - quickly introduce you so for example I
10:30 - want to create a new integer K let me
10:32 - say new integer and I'm gonna call it
10:34 - let's just call it Tim why not now I
10:37 - want this integer to be equal to 9 okay
10:40 - but I don't want to type nine out what
10:42 - I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna type
10:44 - hello on your screen
10:46 - underscore world like this now what
10:49 - we've essentially done is we've taken
10:51 - the value from hello world and we've
10:52 - assigned it to Tim so now if we were to
10:55 - print Tim to the screen we get the value
10:58 - 9 now if I want to print hello world to
11:02 - the screen
11:04 - you can see that we are still getting
11:06 - the value of nine so now Tim points to
11:09 - hello world which points a nine right so
11:11 - Tim is equal to nine and hello world is
11:12 - equal to nine and we can do that and we
11:15 - can add variables together we can
11:16 - subtract variables we can do all kinds
11:18 - of cool things and that's really the
11:20 - point of variables right so we just have
11:22 - to make sure when we're doing this for
11:23 - example that we don't do something like
11:24 - this string Tim equals hello world you
11:29 - can see here now it says cannot convert
11:31 - from int to string because the data type
11:33 - string is obviously not the same as nine
11:35 - so we can't do that until we learn about
11:37 - something called typecasting which will
11:39 - be in a future video so anyways that has
11:41 - been it for this video I hope you now
11:44 - understand what variables are how they
11:46 - work and how we can create them in Java
11:49 - in the next video we're gonna be talking
11:51 - about operations so adding variable
11:53 - subtracting dividing doing stuff like
11:55 - that and then we'll be moving on to some
11:57 - more advanced stuff as always if you
11:59 - guys liked the video please make sure
12:00 - you leave a like and subscribe to the
12:02 - channel I will see you again in the next
12:03 - one

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to video 2 in our Java programming tutorial series for beginners so you can see where we are right where we left off with printing two lines hello world hello world to the screen and in this video I'm gonna be going over variables and data types the absolute fundamentals we have to understand before we can move on to anything more complex so let's talk about what a variable is now a variable just like in mathematics is something that holds a value now in our case that doesn't have to be just a number it could be a string it could be a boolean an integer like we're gonna talk about the different values and those are what are known as datatypes or objects so let's start by just creating a variable to create a variable we need to first figure out what type our variable is gonna be in this case I'm going to start with an integer and then we're going to go through all the different types and talk about the differences so to start we're gonna type int declaring that this variable that we're about to type out is going to be an integer we're then going to give a variable name now the variable name should contain typically just letters and underscores now I believe you can use numbers as long as it's at the end but our purpose we're not gonna do that when we create a variable name you have to make sure you do not use any spaces and you don't use any special characters as well so I'll go through a few examples of valid variable names and invalid variable names so a valid variable name for example could be hello that's valid because we don't have any spaces we don't have any special characters and there's no numbers and okay now an invalid variable name would be something like hello name okay this whole thing as our variable name is invalid because it contains a space now if I try to put like a what do you call it % like this or I try to put like an asterisks that is not a valid variable name so don't use any special characters you can end with an underscore you could start with an underscore if you want to but we're not going to be doing that in this case typically when you create a variable if you want to make a name be like two words the way you do it is you type like hello and then you would do a capital and then the next word or you would do an underscore representing a space then next word okay so that's enough about valid variable names not super important right now so I'm gonna create my first variable into hello world and that's gonna be equal to by participating an equal sign whatever integer I want so in this case I'm going to say five and then remember in Java whenever we end the line so this is just saying my integer HelloWorld is equal to five we need to terminate with a semicolon so there we go and we see we get int our variable name is now highlighted in yellow and there's no issues so if I hi let's just see what it says this very is never used okay that's fine so we've officially created a variable the variable name hello world now points to the integer five so to prove this to you I am simply going to print out the value of hello world like this okay I'm gonna say system dot out its a comma isn't it system.out.println and what we're gonna do is we're gonna say okay so hello underscore world that's our variable name and that variable holds five so when we print this we should be printing five the way this works in the computer right is it says okay hello world let's see where hello world is it's up here alright hello world is equal to 5 so we print that ok so there we go and we get 5 printed down here in the bottom of the screen now I want to show you something quickly and this is just gonna go this is a really important fundamental thing a lot of people don't talk about in programming tutorials and it's kind of like order of operations or execution so I am going to now put my variable underneath my system dot out dot println ok so I'm first gonna print hello world and then I'm gonna set hello world is equal to 5 hopefully you guys have realized what the issue might be here if not I'll talk about it really quickly and the problem is that I am trying to print the value of hello world before I've declared it because the in programming the way things work is unless you otherwise specify we're gonna be reading from top to bottom and left to right just the way you'd read a book right so we first read this line system dot out dot println a hello world and then we create hello world so here we don't know what hole the world is so if we try to do this you can see it warns me there's an error okay you know what there's Nair let's proceed anyways and you can see that down here we get a bunch of red text and it says we call it hello world cannot be resolved to a variable because we haven't yet declared that variable so we have to make sure whenever we're referencing or using variables that we first have them declared somewhere above our like the line that we're using them in okay so there we go we've created a variable hello world we print that to the screen now let's create a few different variables and talk about what these types are so in case I didn't really specify int stands for integer and that pretty much stands for any number that does not have a decimal point so as soon as I put a decimal like this like 5.0 this actually becomes a new data type and that data type is called a float now float stands for a floating decimal point which means any number that has a floating decimal point so I'm going to say float let's see num2 is gonna be my variable name is equal to and in this case I'm going to say 5.0 what's the issue here add casts from double to okay one second where is it double okay sorry I made a mistake there we're just gonna type double here as the name okay not float don't worry about float right now we'll talk about that later so anyways we have double num 2 equals 5.0 now double is exactly what I was explaining before anything that has a floating decimal point so even though this is still the exact same values this in terms of mathematics because it has a floating decimal point in our computer isn't referenced as a double okay now there's some other data types as well that we're gonna talk about so we have int we have double we also have something called boolean now boolean is true or false and these are gonna be really important in the next few videos that we talked about so boolean I'm just gonna say B as my variable name is going to be equal to and in this case I'm going to say true and again make sure I'm putting my semicolon now there's only two values that a that your a boolean data type can have that is true or false now why these are important is because based on the value of a boolean type we're gonna be doing things later in our program like if B was equal to true we're gonna print something otherwise we won't print something so that's really important another data type that we have is known as char now char is any character okay so this is a little bit different from string that I talked about in the last video but I'm going to talk about string as well so I'm gonna say char C is equal to and whenever we create a character there's two ways that we can do it we can do it with Unicode which you probably don't know what that is or we could do it with single quotation marks so by just simply hitting the single quotation marks we can put one letter in the single quotation marks and that is a character because that's what char stands for a character so like something on your keyboard in quotation marks now a character could be for example 9 in quotation marks so that's still a valid character because it's in quotation marks it's different than the number like 9 if you're if I were to type that up here ok so any letter or character that goes in quotation marks is a char now we have to be careful because chars can only be one one character if I try to do like 0 3 you can see that we're getting read text and job is yelling at us and it's saying no that's not allowed because we can only have one thing all right now I just want to show you I want to go over again really quickly what the main differences between this 9 and this 9 up here we've declared we're gonna have an integer name Tolo world and it's set equal to 9 okay that's what it is this is a character and since this is in quotation marks this is not the same thing as 9 the way like the datatypes really do matter in this sense okay so I'm just gonna change this back to like H something for now ok char c equal to H so that is extremely important now string this is another data type it's a different kind of data type which we'll talk about in a second but to make a string we do string I believe with a capital we'll see and then we give a name so for our variable in this case I'm gonna say STR is equal to and then at this time for a string we used double quotation marks okay and I'm just gonna say Tim in here so chars single quotation marks and strings are double quotation marks okay and strings can contain anything in them so I could have like six seven and three underscore star that's a completely valid string we can put any characters as long as they're with inside of these quotation marks okay same thing with the character if you put a nine in a string this is different than a nine like this okay so these are our main datatypes there are a few other ones but I'm not going to go into them right now because they they're a bit more complex than then we can handle right now so pretty much though you might notice that this string is highlighted as a different color than these and see int as orange doubles Orange boolean's Orange chars Orange why is string blue now the reason it's blue it's because it's a different type of data type these four dog types I talked about up top here are known as primitive and wow I really just did that I'm used to typing Python primitive data types okay and what that stands for is not changeable okay and we're gonna talk more about primitive data types and not primitive data types later on but just know that these ones I talked about here are known as primitive in Java and this one is not primitive okay so anyways let's just see now torrenting out like some of these data types like what we get when we print them to the screen right so if I print for example C to the screen well you should guess what we're gonna get we get H cuz that's C if we print STR we get 9 and so on now last thing I want to show you with variables is that we can actually make variables equal to other variables and we can add variables and we can subtract variables and this we're gonna be doing a lot in the next video but I want to just quickly introduce you so for example I want to create a new integer K let me say new integer and I'm gonna call it let's just call it Tim why not now I want this integer to be equal to 9 okay but I don't want to type nine out what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna type hello on your screen underscore world like this now what we've essentially done is we've taken the value from hello world and we've assigned it to Tim so now if we were to print Tim to the screen we get the value 9 now if I want to print hello world to the screen you can see that we are still getting the value of nine so now Tim points to hello world which points a nine right so Tim is equal to nine and hello world is equal to nine and we can do that and we can add variables together we can subtract variables we can do all kinds of cool things and that's really the point of variables right so we just have to make sure when we're doing this for example that we don't do something like this string Tim equals hello world you can see here now it says cannot convert from int to string because the data type string is obviously not the same as nine so we can't do that until we learn about something called typecasting which will be in a future video so anyways that has been it for this video I hope you now understand what variables are how they work and how we can create them in Java in the next video we're gonna be talking about operations so adding variable subtracting dividing doing stuff like that and then we'll be moving on to some more advanced stuff as always if you guys liked the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe to the channel I will see you again in the next one
