00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - react tutorial for beginners
00:12 - in this video i'm going to be showing
00:13 - you how we can actually filter
00:15 - our data so in previous videos we've set
00:17 - all this stuff up
00:18 - we've done the styling but our search
00:20 - bar doesn't work right when we actually
00:22 - search for something it doesn't do
00:23 - anything
00:24 - so in this video i'm going to show you
00:25 - how we can make that work so filter the
00:27 - different items that we have
00:28 - in our data this will be a shorter video
00:30 - but that's all we need to do
00:31 - all right so let's go ahead and get
00:32 - started we can see here that we already
00:34 - have our filters right
00:35 - we've set this up already such that when
00:37 - you press the search button it passes
00:39 - the filters back to app.js
00:40 - so kind of the hard part there is
00:42 - actually done all we need to do here is
00:44 - use these filters to actually filter our
00:47 - data
00:47 - so we have two options here we could and
00:50 - ignore this i was
00:51 - working on this previously ignore that
00:52 - function call pretend you didn't see
00:54 - that so we have two options here is
00:55 - where i was saying
00:56 - we could filter the data inside of items
00:59 - display
01:00 - so we could pass the items to items
01:01 - display we could also pass the filters
01:04 - and then inside of here we could do the
01:05 - filter
01:06 - that makes sense we could do that that's
01:07 - fine nothing wrong with that but i would
01:09 - prefer
01:10 - to not have to pass the filters to this
01:12 - component
01:13 - and to instead filter the data inside of
01:15 - this app component
01:16 - and only pass the data that i want to be
01:18 - displayed to the items display component
01:21 - so two different options here again you
01:22 - can use whatever you want but i kind of
01:24 - prefer to not have a ton of props being
01:26 - passed around because it gets kind of
01:27 - confusing and instead use the prompt
01:29 - where i have it right so in this case i
01:31 - have filters sorry which is a state
01:33 - and so what i can do is just use it to
01:35 - filter the data and then i can pass my
01:36 - filter data as
01:38 - items so rather than passing all of the
01:40 - items then filtering it i'm just passing
01:42 - the items i actually want to display
01:44 - again you can make arguments for which
01:45 - one is better or worse but for now we're
01:47 - going to do this
01:48 - so i'm going to make a function here i'm
01:49 - going to say const and you already
01:51 - guessed what this is it's going to be
01:52 - filter
01:53 - data like that this will be equal to an
01:56 - arrow function
01:57 - this will take in some data and what
01:59 - this is going to return will be an array
02:01 - with all of my filtered data so all the
02:03 - items that i actually want to display
02:06 - so i'm going to start by saying const
02:08 - and i'll say filtered
02:10 - data like that is equal to and this will
02:12 - just be an array
02:13 - so it will actually return here will be
02:15 - our filtered data
02:17 - but now we need to fill this array with
02:19 - that data so what i'll do here
02:21 - is i'll loop through all of the items in
02:23 - my data
02:24 - and then i will check if these items
02:27 - match the criteria in my filters
02:29 - so let's look at filters if we go to
02:30 - search bar we can see we have name
02:32 - price type and brand that's what our
02:34 - filters are going to be
02:36 - but some of these filters could be their
02:38 - default value
02:39 - they could be an empty string it could
02:40 - be 0 for example and so before i
02:43 - actually apply this filter
02:44 - i want to make sure it's not its default
02:46 - value because i don't want to filter
02:48 - based on say an empty string because
02:50 - that was just the default value the user
02:51 - didn't actually type something in there
02:53 - so let's go ahead and do that so if we
02:55 - go here filter data i'm going to start
02:57 - by looping through all my items so i'm
02:58 - going to say 4
02:59 - and i'll say const and this will be item
03:02 - of
03:03 - data now just so we're clear on what
03:05 - data will be
03:06 - data will just be a list so what we'll
03:08 - actually do here is we'll call
03:11 - filter data as you saw i did previously
03:14 - and we will pass a list of the items we
03:16 - want to filter so we'll pass
03:18 - data and the key items because we're
03:19 - holding a uh what is it
03:21 - an actual object here it has the key
03:23 - items and the key items has an array
03:25 - okay so we pass the array to filter data
03:28 - and then we're going to loop through it
03:29 - so go through all of the items now we're
03:32 - going to check
03:33 - if the field in our filter is actually
03:35 - not the default value and if it's not
03:37 - we'll
03:37 - kind of apply that filter so we're going
03:39 - to say if
03:40 - and this will be filters dot name
03:43 - does not equal an empty string so
03:45 - filters.name does not equal an empty
03:47 - string
03:48 - we want to apply that filter so then
03:49 - inside of here we'll have another if
03:51 - statement
03:51 - and we'll say if item dot name
03:55 - does not equal and this will be filters
03:58 - dot name then what we can do is we can
04:02 - simply
04:04 - continue we don't actually need all
04:06 - these curly braces but i'll just leave
04:07 - them
04:08 - in here for now because i think it makes
04:09 - sense i'm trying to see if there's a way
04:11 - that we
04:12 - can actually combine these together
04:15 - i think i can do something like this so
04:18 - i'm going to say
04:19 - if filters.name does not equal empty
04:21 - string and item.name does not equal
04:23 - filters.name continue okay so that's
04:25 - good that's the expression that we want
04:27 - here
04:27 - so the reason for this is we need to
04:28 - first check to make sure it's not an
04:30 - empty string
04:30 - if it's not an empty string and the name
04:33 - of our item
04:34 - does not equal the filter that we have
04:35 - then we're going to continue which means
04:37 - we're not going to add this item
04:39 - into our filtered data and so we're kind
04:40 - of skipping it in that sense okay so
04:42 - let's copy this
04:43 - and now we're going to do the same thing
04:45 - except this time we're going to check
04:46 - price so it'll be a little bit different
04:47 - we'll say
04:47 - filters.price does not equal equal zero
04:51 - and item.price and remember this is the
04:53 - maximum price
04:55 - if item.price is we'll say greater than
04:59 - and then this will be filters.price then
05:01 - same thing we want to continue because
05:03 - we're above the maximum price we don't
05:04 - want to add this item in
05:06 - okay so same thing now except instead of
05:08 - name we're going to have
05:09 - type okay so now we'll just change these
05:11 - to be type
05:12 - and this will all work because type is
05:14 - just going to be a string
05:16 - okay and then lastly we had
05:19 - name price type and brand so let's make
05:23 - this brand
05:24 - okay brand and
05:27 - brand and by the way continue will just
05:29 - automatically move us back to the next
05:31 - item
05:31 - so we'll just skip this item essentially
05:33 - when we hit continue so we'll go to the
05:34 - next iteration of the for loop
05:36 - and then at the very bottom here we will
05:38 - say filter data
05:40 - dot push and we'll push on this item
05:43 - if of course it made it to this stage
05:45 - alright so let's quickly recap what
05:47 - we're doing here
05:47 - we're just going to check all of the
05:49 - filters the first thing we're checking
05:50 - for all these filters is to make sure
05:51 - they're not equal to their default value
05:53 - if they're not equal to their default
05:55 - value then we'll actually check if this
05:56 - filter applies to the object that we are
05:59 - on
05:59 - and if it does not then that means we'll
06:01 - continue we'll skip this
06:02 - item because only if we get down here to
06:04 - the very bottom do we actually
06:06 - push this item into the filtered data so
06:08 - it has to pass
06:09 - all four of these checks before it gets
06:11 - in if any one of these checks does not
06:13 - come up true
06:13 - or i guess in this case does come up
06:15 - true because we're doing it in kind of
06:16 - the opposite
06:17 - that means we won't add this item into
06:19 - the filtered data
06:20 - okay so that should theoretically work
06:22 - and that's really all we actually need
06:23 - to do to get this to work
06:25 - so let me just see if my website is
06:27 - running i believe it is okay let me
06:28 - refresh here
06:29 - let's add an item and let's see if we
06:30 - can filter it so we'll say name tim
06:32 - price 499 type person
06:36 - brand great okay so add it in add item
06:39 - and for some reason it didn't show up
06:41 - okay so i think we're gonna have we're
06:42 - having a problem sorry here
06:44 - uh with our filter data function because
06:46 - that's the only thing that could make
06:47 - this
06:48 - not work so let me have a quick look
06:49 - here and see what's going wrong and then
06:50 - i'll be right back
06:51 - all right so we will continue in one
06:53 - second we need to quickly thank the
06:54 - sponsor of this video and the series
06:56 - which is algo
06:57 - expert algo expert is the best platform
06:59 - to use from preparing for your software
07:00 - engineering interviews they have algo
07:02 - expert the product that i've been
07:03 - talking about this whole time
07:05 - they also have systems expert to help
07:06 - you prepare for your systems design
07:08 - interviews and now they have machine
07:10 - learning expert
07:11 - check them out from the link in the
07:12 - description and use the discount code
07:14 - tech with tim for a discount on the
07:15 - platform
07:16 - all right so i was just doing some
07:17 - debugging here you can see i'm just
07:19 - printing out what the filters are and i
07:20 - have
07:21 - found the errors let me refresh and show
07:22 - you actually how i came about finding
07:24 - this error because i think this is
07:25 - useful
07:26 - so if you can look here in the console
07:29 - when i press
07:30 - let's say add item here you can see that
07:33 - we're calling
07:35 - this filters function right and so we're
07:37 - going to console.log the filters now
07:38 - that's what's being printed right here
07:40 - this is the filters notice how this is
07:42 - an empty object
07:43 - now the reason this is an empty object
07:45 - is because i haven't pressed search yet
07:47 - when i press search notice this changes
07:49 - now it says name
07:50 - brand and then it shows this kind of
07:51 - empty object right that i have
07:53 - so the reason why we were getting this
07:55 - error where it wasn't showing us that
07:56 - item is because by default
07:58 - the state here is holding just an empty
08:00 - object that has no keys
08:02 - and so when i go inside of here
08:04 - filters.name is not equal to an empty
08:06 - string it's undefined
08:08 - an undefined is not equal to an empty
08:10 - string and so we immediately skipped our
08:13 - item
08:14 - hopefully that's clear but since we
08:15 - didn't have any filters
08:17 - this just broke it didn't work the way
08:18 - that we wanted to and so what we'll do
08:20 - inside of here for filter data
08:22 - is we'll just have one line here we'll
08:24 - say if
08:26 - filters is equal to an object like that
08:30 - then what we can do is we can just
08:31 - return our data again because if we
08:33 - don't have any filters there's nothing
08:34 - that we need to filter
08:36 - so now if i go here and again sorry so
08:38 - you can see that i don't want to go too
08:39 - quickly for you guys
08:40 - and i just refresh this let's add an
08:42 - item so let's say name
08:43 - 299 person test okay
08:47 - add item and of course it's not showing
08:50 - up
08:50 - okay that's interesting okay so it turns
08:52 - out that this line actually doesn't work
08:54 - i'm assuming that you simply cannot
08:55 - compare an empty object
08:57 - to another empty object and get true in
08:59 - javascript
09:00 - maybe i'm wrong on that but i'm pretty
09:02 - sure that this comparison is just
09:03 - invalid this just doesn't work we can't
09:04 - do that
09:05 - and so instead what i'm going to do here
09:07 - is i'm going to check if we have the
09:08 - name
09:09 - property in our filters so if we do not
09:12 - have the name
09:13 - property in our filters that means that
09:15 - we haven't yet filtered anything because
09:16 - we will always get a name that's
09:18 - going to be one of our filters we'll
09:20 - always have one of those and so in that
09:21 - case we can just return data
09:23 - so let's do that and let's see if this
09:24 - works now i'm going to go here okay and
09:26 - now this is working it's actually
09:27 - showing the correct items
09:29 - so let me just refresh this and let's
09:30 - restart so let's add a new
09:32 - an item tim 299 type
09:35 - person brand test okay so let's add item
09:38 - and now this is working it's showing up
09:41 - and now let's try to filter it so let's
09:42 - make the name
09:43 - tim and let's search and okay that works
09:46 - but if we change the type to say
09:48 - not a person and now we search notice it
09:50 - goes away
09:51 - right but if i remove this and now i
09:53 - press search
09:54 - it shows up again because now this
09:56 - reaches the filter but if i change this
09:58 - to 399
09:59 - uh this is still working okay oh it's
10:02 - because max price is above
10:03 - what it should be uh okay let's make
10:06 - this lower so let's make this
10:07 - 2 90 and search and then it goes away
10:10 - okay that makes sense
10:12 - all right so the filtering is now
10:13 - working now let's add another item in
10:15 - here
10:15 - we'll just make this one tim again price
10:17 - will be 5.99
10:20 - type person brand test add
10:23 - item okay now we'll press this to filter
10:26 - okay so max price 290 of course is not
10:28 - showing up now if we go
10:29 - three dollars and search we get this
10:32 - item but what if we go to
10:34 - 5.99 search okay it is showing up now
10:37 - let's filter by the brand test okay
10:39 - still showing up and there you go
10:41 - everything is indeed working
10:42 - all right so the filters are working
10:44 - again let's just have a look at this
10:45 - function this is really the meat of what
10:47 - we've done here
10:48 - we said filter data we're taking in some
10:49 - data we're defining our empty list this
10:52 - is what we'll return
10:53 - with our filtered data we're checking if
10:55 - we've called this
10:56 - or if we set our filters already if
10:59 - we've not set our filters and it's equal
11:00 - to an
11:01 - empty object like this so we do not have
11:03 - this name key
11:04 - that means we can just return the same
11:05 - data there's no filtering that we need
11:07 - to do
11:08 - otherwise we get a loop through all of
11:09 - our data here and then we're going to
11:12 - check all of the following things right
11:13 - and i've already walked through this so
11:14 - i won't walk through it again
11:16 - okay so that is really all we need to do
11:18 - to get the filtering working
11:19 - hopefully that was helpful there is a
11:21 - way to do this using the dot
11:22 - filter command or i guess syntax method
11:26 - function whatever you want to call it
11:28 - but i think it's always helpful to write
11:29 - out manually just so you understand
11:30 - exactly
11:31 - how you would do this if you weren't
11:32 - allowed to use something like
11:34 - dot filter all right so hopefully you
11:36 - guys enjoyed this video if you did make
11:37 - sure to leave a like
11:38 - subscribe to the channel and i will see
11:39 - you in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another react tutorial for beginners in this video i'm going to be showing you how we can actually filter our data so in previous videos we've set all this stuff up we've done the styling but our search bar doesn't work right when we actually search for something it doesn't do anything so in this video i'm going to show you how we can make that work so filter the different items that we have in our data this will be a shorter video but that's all we need to do all right so let's go ahead and get started we can see here that we already have our filters right we've set this up already such that when you press the search button it passes the filters back to app.js so kind of the hard part there is actually done all we need to do here is use these filters to actually filter our data so we have two options here we could and ignore this i was working on this previously ignore that function call pretend you didn't see that so we have two options here is where i was saying we could filter the data inside of items display so we could pass the items to items display we could also pass the filters and then inside of here we could do the filter that makes sense we could do that that's fine nothing wrong with that but i would prefer to not have to pass the filters to this component and to instead filter the data inside of this app component and only pass the data that i want to be displayed to the items display component so two different options here again you can use whatever you want but i kind of prefer to not have a ton of props being passed around because it gets kind of confusing and instead use the prompt where i have it right so in this case i have filters sorry which is a state and so what i can do is just use it to filter the data and then i can pass my filter data as items so rather than passing all of the items then filtering it i'm just passing the items i actually want to display again you can make arguments for which one is better or worse but for now we're going to do this so i'm going to make a function here i'm going to say const and you already guessed what this is it's going to be filter data like that this will be equal to an arrow function this will take in some data and what this is going to return will be an array with all of my filtered data so all the items that i actually want to display so i'm going to start by saying const and i'll say filtered data like that is equal to and this will just be an array so it will actually return here will be our filtered data but now we need to fill this array with that data so what i'll do here is i'll loop through all of the items in my data and then i will check if these items match the criteria in my filters so let's look at filters if we go to search bar we can see we have name price type and brand that's what our filters are going to be but some of these filters could be their default value they could be an empty string it could be 0 for example and so before i actually apply this filter i want to make sure it's not its default value because i don't want to filter based on say an empty string because that was just the default value the user didn't actually type something in there so let's go ahead and do that so if we go here filter data i'm going to start by looping through all my items so i'm going to say 4 and i'll say const and this will be item of data now just so we're clear on what data will be data will just be a list so what we'll actually do here is we'll call filter data as you saw i did previously and we will pass a list of the items we want to filter so we'll pass data and the key items because we're holding a uh what is it an actual object here it has the key items and the key items has an array okay so we pass the array to filter data and then we're going to loop through it so go through all of the items now we're going to check if the field in our filter is actually not the default value and if it's not we'll kind of apply that filter so we're going to say if and this will be filters dot name does not equal an empty string so filters.name does not equal an empty string we want to apply that filter so then inside of here we'll have another if statement and we'll say if item dot name does not equal and this will be filters dot name then what we can do is we can simply continue we don't actually need all these curly braces but i'll just leave them in here for now because i think it makes sense i'm trying to see if there's a way that we can actually combine these together i think i can do something like this so i'm going to say if filters.name does not equal empty string and item.name does not equal filters.name continue okay so that's good that's the expression that we want here so the reason for this is we need to first check to make sure it's not an empty string if it's not an empty string and the name of our item does not equal the filter that we have then we're going to continue which means we're not going to add this item into our filtered data and so we're kind of skipping it in that sense okay so let's copy this and now we're going to do the same thing except this time we're going to check price so it'll be a little bit different we'll say filters.price does not equal equal zero and item.price and remember this is the maximum price if item.price is we'll say greater than and then this will be filters.price then same thing we want to continue because we're above the maximum price we don't want to add this item in okay so same thing now except instead of name we're going to have type okay so now we'll just change these to be type and this will all work because type is just going to be a string okay and then lastly we had name price type and brand so let's make this brand okay brand and brand and by the way continue will just automatically move us back to the next item so we'll just skip this item essentially when we hit continue so we'll go to the next iteration of the for loop and then at the very bottom here we will say filter data dot push and we'll push on this item if of course it made it to this stage alright so let's quickly recap what we're doing here we're just going to check all of the filters the first thing we're checking for all these filters is to make sure they're not equal to their default value if they're not equal to their default value then we'll actually check if this filter applies to the object that we are on and if it does not then that means we'll continue we'll skip this item because only if we get down here to the very bottom do we actually push this item into the filtered data so it has to pass all four of these checks before it gets in if any one of these checks does not come up true or i guess in this case does come up true because we're doing it in kind of the opposite that means we won't add this item into the filtered data okay so that should theoretically work and that's really all we actually need to do to get this to work so let me just see if my website is running i believe it is okay let me refresh here let's add an item and let's see if we can filter it so we'll say name tim price 499 type person brand great okay so add it in add item and for some reason it didn't show up okay so i think we're gonna have we're having a problem sorry here uh with our filter data function because that's the only thing that could make this not work so let me have a quick look here and see what's going wrong and then i'll be right back all right so we will continue in one second we need to quickly thank the sponsor of this video and the series which is algo expert algo expert is the best platform to use from preparing for your software engineering interviews they have algo expert the product that i've been talking about this whole time they also have systems expert to help you prepare for your systems design interviews and now they have machine learning expert check them out from the link in the description and use the discount code tech with tim for a discount on the platform all right so i was just doing some debugging here you can see i'm just printing out what the filters are and i have found the errors let me refresh and show you actually how i came about finding this error because i think this is useful so if you can look here in the console when i press let's say add item here you can see that we're calling this filters function right and so we're going to console.log the filters now that's what's being printed right here this is the filters notice how this is an empty object now the reason this is an empty object is because i haven't pressed search yet when i press search notice this changes now it says name brand and then it shows this kind of empty object right that i have so the reason why we were getting this error where it wasn't showing us that item is because by default the state here is holding just an empty object that has no keys and so when i go inside of here filters.name is not equal to an empty string it's undefined an undefined is not equal to an empty string and so we immediately skipped our item hopefully that's clear but since we didn't have any filters this just broke it didn't work the way that we wanted to and so what we'll do inside of here for filter data is we'll just have one line here we'll say if filters is equal to an object like that then what we can do is we can just return our data again because if we don't have any filters there's nothing that we need to filter so now if i go here and again sorry so you can see that i don't want to go too quickly for you guys and i just refresh this let's add an item so let's say name 299 person test okay add item and of course it's not showing up okay that's interesting okay so it turns out that this line actually doesn't work i'm assuming that you simply cannot compare an empty object to another empty object and get true in javascript maybe i'm wrong on that but i'm pretty sure that this comparison is just invalid this just doesn't work we can't do that and so instead what i'm going to do here is i'm going to check if we have the name property in our filters so if we do not have the name property in our filters that means that we haven't yet filtered anything because we will always get a name that's going to be one of our filters we'll always have one of those and so in that case we can just return data so let's do that and let's see if this works now i'm going to go here okay and now this is working it's actually showing the correct items so let me just refresh this and let's restart so let's add a new an item tim 299 type person brand test okay so let's add item and now this is working it's showing up and now let's try to filter it so let's make the name tim and let's search and okay that works but if we change the type to say not a person and now we search notice it goes away right but if i remove this and now i press search it shows up again because now this reaches the filter but if i change this to 399 uh this is still working okay oh it's because max price is above what it should be uh okay let's make this lower so let's make this 2 90 and search and then it goes away okay that makes sense all right so the filtering is now working now let's add another item in here we'll just make this one tim again price will be 5.99 type person brand test add item okay now we'll press this to filter okay so max price 290 of course is not showing up now if we go three dollars and search we get this item but what if we go to 5.99 search okay it is showing up now let's filter by the brand test okay still showing up and there you go everything is indeed working all right so the filters are working again let's just have a look at this function this is really the meat of what we've done here we said filter data we're taking in some data we're defining our empty list this is what we'll return with our filtered data we're checking if we've called this or if we set our filters already if we've not set our filters and it's equal to an empty object like this so we do not have this name key that means we can just return the same data there's no filtering that we need to do otherwise we get a loop through all of our data here and then we're going to check all of the following things right and i've already walked through this so i won't walk through it again okay so that is really all we need to do to get the filtering working hopefully that was helpful there is a way to do this using the dot filter command or i guess syntax method function whatever you want to call it but i think it's always helpful to write out manually just so you understand exactly how you would do this if you weren't allowed to use something like dot filter all right so hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in the next one
