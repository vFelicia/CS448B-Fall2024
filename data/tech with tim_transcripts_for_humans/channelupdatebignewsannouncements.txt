00:00 - hey guys and welcome back today's video
00:03 - is gonna be a bit different so since
00:06 - we're almost reaching about 5k now and I
00:08 - haven't really done one of these before
00:10 - I'm gonna be kind of giving you guys a
00:12 - general channel update and overview
00:14 - talking about what I have planned for
00:16 - the future and what's coming to the
00:18 - channel since we're almost hit that 5k
00:20 - milestone I figured it was about time
00:22 - and I just wanted to let all the
00:24 - subscribers know and all the people that
00:25 - all you guys that are watching right now
00:27 - that have helped me to grow to this
00:30 - point what's coming next and what you
00:32 - can expect so first of all I have to
00:34 - give a massive thank you to everyone
00:35 - who's watched any my videos who
00:38 - subscribe to the channel who's watching
00:40 - this video right now because obviously I
00:41 - couldn't do this without you guys and
00:42 - the amount of positive feedback that I
00:44 - get every day is really what motivates
00:47 - me to keep going I'm gonna post some
00:48 - little comments here here and there
00:50 - throughout the video it's just like a
00:52 - time-lapse of some coding I do but
00:54 - really like every day when I wake up and
00:56 - I read these comments it just motivates
00:58 - me to go and make more videos and help
01:00 - people out and that's really the goal of
01:01 - this channel you guys know that it's
01:02 - small it doesn't make too much money but
01:05 - every time when I wake up and I see like
01:07 - these positive comments and people are
01:08 - saying keep it up man good work this
01:10 - video really helped me out well that
01:12 - means a lot to me and I'm really
01:15 - grateful that my content is able to help
01:17 - you guys out and help you learn
01:18 - programming because this is some of the
01:19 - stuff that I would have wanted to see
01:21 - when I was younger in trying to learn
01:23 - myself so in terms of what's coming next
01:26 - and what to expect from the channel I
01:28 - have massive plans so I know we're still
01:30 - small and we have to grow scalable but
01:33 - there's a lot of things that I'm
01:34 - planning on doing I don't want to
01:35 - release all of them yet cuz I want
01:36 - someone to be surprised but for now at
01:38 - least one of the good things that I've
01:40 - kind of been working on for the past
01:41 - week or so is a discord server so I have
01:44 - absolutely no experience with discord I
01:45 - use it to chat when I was at least a
01:47 - game like once in a while but that's
01:48 - about it
01:49 - so I created like kind of like a really
01:51 - like low level discord server and I
01:54 - invite you guys to join that pretty much
01:56 - what you can do on there is you can chat
01:57 - with me you can chat with other people
01:59 - in the community tech with Tim community
02:00 - and I can help you guys out with any
02:02 - problems you might have and that's kind
02:03 - of the main goal why I made it because a
02:05 - lot of people comment things on my
02:07 - videos and say like can you help me with
02:08 - this can you help me with this and I
02:09 - always try my best at respond to you
02:11 - guys and read your code but
02:12 - really difficult to do that throughout
02:14 - the comment section of a YouTube video
02:16 - especially if the codes really long so
02:18 - now on the discord server you guys can
02:20 - send me files I can have a look at them
02:21 - we can work on stuff together we can
02:23 - chat and that's really one of the main
02:25 - reasons that happen also on there I have
02:27 - like some different channels I'm so like
02:29 - video ideas just like general chat PI
02:32 - game he'll Python help and that's kind
02:35 - of the start of the way that I want to
02:37 - help you guys outside of just the
02:38 - YouTube channel in just the comment
02:40 - section now to go along with that I've
02:42 - also just started up a patreon page or
02:44 - your patreon account I think that's how
02:46 - you say it at least and this is to give
02:47 - you guys a chance if you want to support
02:49 - the channel and support myself to do so
02:52 - so I don't ask for any large donations I
02:54 - don't ask for any donations at all in
02:55 - fact if you don't want to the discord
02:57 - server is completely free but if you do
02:59 - donate I believe it's ten dollars a
03:00 - month then you're gonna have access to
03:02 - kind of like a donor what do you call it
03:05 - permission or like role I think it's
03:07 - called in discord yeah a rule where you
03:09 - you can just gonna have your name like
03:11 - highlighted and you'll have a few
03:12 - commands you can use you can join the
03:14 - voice chats there's a few like specific
03:15 - channels just to give you a bit of a
03:17 - perk for donating to the channel because
03:19 - I really do appreciate it but that's
03:21 - just a way if you guys want to help out
03:22 - and I'd really appreciate it any
03:24 - donations that that do come because you
03:26 - guys know this is a small Channel it
03:27 - doesn't make too much money okay in
03:30 - terms of what I'm gonna be posting in
03:31 - the future I know you guys really love
03:33 - the PI game stuff so recently I've been
03:35 - working on making a few different games
03:37 - now I'm not sure which one I want to do
03:38 - tutorial on first because I have them
03:40 - coded pretty much they are right now I
03:43 - have Simon done and I have Tetris done
03:45 - so let me know which one you guys want
03:47 - to see first the Simon one is more of a
03:49 - beginner level and the tetris one is
03:51 - pretty advanced so if you watched on my
03:53 - previous prime stuff you'd probably be
03:55 - able to do the tetris one but other than
03:56 - that it might be a little bit difficult
03:57 - for you also in the future some of you
04:00 - guys know I'm a first year computer
04:02 - science student so I'm just like all my
04:04 - own time doing some machine learning
04:06 - stuff and AI so once I get good at that
04:09 - and I feel confident enough with it I'm
04:10 - gonna start teaching that on the channel
04:12 - as well so that you guys can understand
04:13 - it it's actually not too difficult and I
04:15 - think a lot of you would like that so
04:17 - let me know in terms of other stuff I
04:19 - can always think of things to post like
04:21 - programming tutorials but I want to know
04:23 - what you guys want to see on the channel
04:24 - because this is really about you it's
04:26 - about
04:26 - community and I don't want to post stuff
04:28 - just because I think it'd be interesting
04:29 - I want to know what you guys want so
04:31 - that's why I want you to join the
04:32 - discord server to let me know some
04:34 - videos you want to see cuz I really am
04:36 - going to take that information seriously
04:38 - that you guys post on there and I also
04:40 - want you just leave a comment down below
04:41 - if you don't want to go join the discord
04:43 - server and just let me know what you
04:45 - want to see in the future like what do
04:47 - you want this channel to look like
04:48 - because I want to mold this towards what
04:50 - you guys want to see so anyways I think
04:53 - that's kind of it for a channel update I
04:56 - have something special planned for 5k I
04:58 - you guys will see that when we hit that
05:01 - number which should be in just a few
05:03 - days when this video comes out I'll you
