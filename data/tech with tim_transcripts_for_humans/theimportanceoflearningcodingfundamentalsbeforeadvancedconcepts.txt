00:20 - the fundamentals of programming now
00:22 - that's my opinion but this is a huge
00:24 - mistake I see and what discourages a lot
00:27 - of people from getting into programs
00:28 - like you do so much fundamental
00:30 - programming solving really basic
00:32 - problems making sure you understand all
00:34 - these Concepts that are built into the
00:36 - standard language you're learning before
00:38 - you go ahead and start working with
00:40 - Frameworks and modules and more advanced
00:42 - things that assume you have this
