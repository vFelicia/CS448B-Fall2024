00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so what
00:02 - I'm gonna be doing in this video is
00:03 - walking you through my remote work setup
00:05 - now this is an absolutely ridiculously
00:08 - overkill setup I'm valuing it at
00:10 - probably about twenty five thousand
00:12 - Canadian dollars just because I've been
00:14 - accumulating all these items which you
00:15 - guys gonna see throughout the video for
00:17 - the past probably five years and just
00:19 - keep in mind that this setup that I'm
00:21 - about to show you is for my remote work
00:23 - which I'm actually gonna be doing at
00:24 - Microsoft this summer as a remote intern
00:26 - software engineering intern as well as
00:28 - for filming YouTube videos this is the
00:30 - YouTube set and any other work that I
00:32 - would need to do at home I pretty much
00:34 - live in this setup which I'm gonna show
00:36 - you right now and that is why I've
00:37 - invested so much time and so much money
00:39 - into building it so with that being said
00:41 - let's go ahead and get into my remote
00:43 - work setup alright so what I'm gonna do
00:52 - is just walk around my setup and just
00:55 - talk about things as we get to it's
00:56 - gonna be very casual informal video I
00:58 - really have anything planned so you know
01:00 - I might miss some things but let me know
01:02 - in the comments if you guys have any
01:03 - questions so you gotta see that this is
01:05 - the main set we got some nice foam on
01:07 - the wall I've got a little workstation
01:09 - in the right-hand corner here this is
01:11 - kind of my filming set so like this kind
01:13 - of angle here when I'm talking in a
01:14 - video and this is actually the setup for
01:16 - my new podcast called time out with Tim
01:19 - so if you're watching this video the
01:20 - first episode of my new podcast is live
01:22 - it's on a second YouTube channel in
01:24 - video format and it's also on Spotify
01:26 - Apple music anchor like any other
01:29 - platform you can think of it's available
01:30 - on there so please do go check that out
01:33 - I think you guys gonna find it
01:34 - interesting it's just talking about
01:35 - programming technology how I got into
01:38 - coding how I am you know tech with Tim
01:40 - the full-time student working at
01:42 - Microsoft running this YouTube channel
01:43 - and just have some interesting guests on
01:45 - there as well so please do go subscribe
01:47 - to that second youtube channel even if
01:49 - you guys don't plan on watching it and
01:50 - just support me because this is
01:51 - something that i'm quite excited about
01:53 - starting so this is the podcast set up
01:55 - so i'll go through the first most
01:57 - important thing which is the audio
01:58 - interface so say quad-channel audio
02:00 - interface which takes input from this
02:03 - XLR microphone from this XLR microphone
02:06 - and from this computer when we have any
02:09 - guests on so I am planning on having
02:10 - some guests from the tech space maybe
02:13 - from
02:13 - some other fields as well it's not just
02:14 - gonna be tacky it's gonna talk about
02:16 - like work ethic life finance like things
02:18 - like that as well and the idea here is
02:20 - that we have this kind of connector that
02:22 - goes into the Mac so that we can send
02:24 - audio to the Mac and get audio from the
02:26 - Mac and this is a 20-19 MacBook Pro so
02:30 - this is the 16 inch version really nice
02:32 - the display is just gorgeous and the
02:34 - keyboard they did a way better job on it
02:36 - than the previous models so definitely
02:37 - recommend if you guys want to get a new
02:39 - laptop then I have a GoPro up here so
02:42 - this film's my brother if he's gonna be
02:44 - talking on the podcast so the idea is
02:46 - like if you guys watched Joe Rogan he's
02:47 - gonna be like the Jaime of the podcast
02:49 - so he's gonna sit here and do all the
02:52 - technical stuff look some stuff up if we
02:53 - need him to anyways let's get away from
02:55 - that now and go over here so this is my
02:58 - main kind of workstation slash YouTube
03:00 - filming area this is a custom ell desk
03:03 - that we built specifically for this room
03:05 - so this used to be a theater room you
03:07 - can see there's a projector here this
03:08 - little couch that used to be actually on
03:10 - this wall here and obviously the big
03:14 - projector screen so this is usually
03:16 - where we'd watch movies and stuff but we
03:18 - just decided that we don't really use it
03:19 - enough so let's convert this to the tech
03:21 - whatin studio so this is yeah custom L
03:23 - desk we finished it stained it built it
03:25 - by hands in here just went out and
03:27 - bottled the wood for it my dad's pretty
03:29 - handy so he pretty much did that for us
03:31 - you can see this is the road microphone
03:33 - we're gonna use for the podcast
03:35 - this is rode nt1 some of you may
03:37 - appreciate what this is it's on an a
03:39 - shock mount you can see again that's on
03:41 - the swivel so this like PS something
03:44 - rode swivel that's spring-loaded so the
03:47 - headphones again used for the podcast
03:50 - you can see the tripod this is usually
03:51 - where I'll have the camera kind of
03:53 - facing this way when we're filming a
03:56 - YouTube video so anyways let's go over
03:58 - to the workstation now which I'm sure
03:59 - some of you are more interested in so
04:01 - this is my big PC this is a custom-built
04:03 - PC I'll talk about that in a little bit
04:05 - but I built that in like 2017 so it's
04:07 - getting outdated now then you can see I
04:09 - have a 27-inch main monitor and a
04:12 - 24-inch secondary monitor this is a 4k
04:16 - LG monitor I don't know the exact model
04:17 - of it and this one is an msi which is
04:20 - 1080p but it's 144 Hertz so I used to
04:22 - use that for gaming but then I put this
04:24 - one in the middle because I don't really
04:25 - do that
04:26 - much gaming anymore in terms of
04:28 - peripherals the main stuff obviously we
04:30 - have keyboard and mouse so this is my
04:32 - keyboard this is a bass keyboard for Q
04:34 - this actually has a Cherry MX brown
04:36 - switches in it really nice keyboard
04:38 - would really recommend it it's fully
04:40 - programmable so you can actually change
04:42 - the backlighting of every single one of
04:44 - these keys and you can set it up with
04:45 - different API so that like you can have
04:47 - for example these 10 keys up here
04:50 - representing the usage of your CPU you
04:52 - can have like the Escape key flash if
04:54 - you get a new email really cool keyboard
04:56 - I'm gonna do a review on that later
04:58 - probably in the month this is my mouse
04:59 - this is a SteelSeries rival 300 black or
05:03 - something like that
05:04 - zoom in and see if you can get that
05:05 - focused and that's on a full-length
05:08 - SteelSeries mouse pad just figure out to
05:09 - stay consistent with that so let's talk
05:11 - about the computer then I'll go through
05:13 - some other peripherals this is again
05:15 - custom built so this is on a Corsair
05:17 - crystal series case it's tempered glass
05:19 - on for science and it's rocket an i-5
05:22 - 7600 K so that's overclocked with this
05:24 - dual rowdy dual radiator water cooler
05:26 - and a 1066 gigabyte graphics card so
05:30 - this was an older build this about 2017
05:32 - that I made this can see we have 16 gigs
05:34 - of ram it actually has four hard drives
05:37 - in it so two actual hard drives that are
05:39 - 4 terabytes and then 2 solid-state
05:41 - drives for my abun 2 and Windows
05:43 - operating systems so I can do a boot on
05:45 - there so these are RGB fans obviously
05:48 - probably my favorite part of the build
05:49 - is this front it looks really nice you
05:51 - can change what the fans do so there's
05:53 - some settings up here to do that and a
05:55 - power button and USBs and all that
05:57 - check out kind of the cable management
05:59 - I'll try to give you a sneak peek here
06:01 - you can see this monitors on a wall
06:02 - mount and now we'll talk about some of
06:04 - the other peripherals and items that I
06:05 - have so this is my beats pill this is
06:08 - kind of just my main speaker sounds
06:10 - really good I like listening to music
06:11 - when I'm programming so I usually have
06:13 - that on although now I can actually use
06:15 - the sound system from this theater so
06:17 - that's typically what I do so that's why
06:19 - I've got Spotify up here on my second
06:20 - monitor you can see it says listening on
06:23 - so knows which is the system we use for
06:25 - my house so I also have some ear pods I
06:27 - don't really use these anymore but I
06:29 - used to when I'm loose at school and
06:30 - actually walking around that's on a
06:32 - samsung wireless charger how ironic and
06:35 - then we have two lamps which are what
06:37 - I'm going to talk about now cuz these
06:38 - are really cool
06:40 - so this is a BenQ I believe it's called
06:42 - screen bar Plus and this is the control
06:45 - for it so you can see it goes on and off
06:46 - like that you actually change the
06:48 - brightness and the temperature of that
06:50 - lamp so let's change the temperature now
06:52 - to be like warmer or cooler and it just
06:54 - makes it easier to look at your monitor
06:56 - and gives you some light on the actual
06:58 - desk surface this is called the BenQ
07:00 - reading lamp so this lamp is similar to
07:03 - this the screen bar plus of course
07:06 - obviously it's bigger and it can swivel
07:07 - out and has a lot more adjustment but
07:09 - this does the same thing so you can
07:11 - actually hit this touch bar to turn on
07:12 - it off and then if I can get here you
07:16 - can do the brightness and temperature of
07:17 - the lamp as well so yeah I think we're
07:20 - getting temperature yet that's the
07:21 - temperature so then there's an auto
07:22 - setting you can hold it down it changes
07:24 - it automatically so I guess that leads
07:26 - me to the webcam here this is just a
07:28 - 1080p webcam it's what I use when I'm
07:29 - doing a facecam for any tutorial videos
07:31 - and other than that I guess all that's
07:33 - really left to talk about is this vigil
07:35 - spinner and my metal pen so these are my
07:38 - two kind of like fidget items that I
07:39 - always have on my desk they go with me
07:41 - everywhere I go
07:41 - when I need to focus I'll literally just
07:43 - pick this bad boy up and spin it around
07:45 - you can see how worn out it is I really
07:47 - need to get a new one and then I have
07:49 - this pen that I like to spin around it's
07:51 - like a metal pen so it's nice it has a
07:53 - nice weight to it when you're holding it
07:54 - obviously a coaster so I'm not getting
07:56 - any coffee stains or anything on my desk
07:58 - and then I'll walk you through kind of
07:59 - the bottom area here so I have this
08:02 - headset
08:02 - let's say Corsair gaming headset this is
08:05 - usually what I use just if I'm gaming
08:07 - I've been using it a little bit more now
08:08 - during this quarantine stuff but it's
08:10 - kind of old although is good headset it
08:12 - has like 5.1 surround sound or something
08:14 - on it
08:15 - there's a drawing tablet down here it's
08:17 - not too exciting but that's just what I
08:19 - use if I'm doing like some explaining
08:21 - videos like in whiteboard style and
08:23 - other than that I don't really know what
08:25 - else to talk about here I mean I have
08:26 - this lamp I have my tech with Tim mug
08:29 - you guys can purchase that from
08:31 - teespring there should be a thing
08:32 - underneath the video and then I'll just
08:34 - walk you through the underneath of my
08:35 - desk a little bit of cable management so
08:38 - trying to power all the stuff that I
08:40 - have is always very difficult I need to
08:42 - put like power bars inside of power bi
08:44 - bars inside of power bars you can see
08:45 - there's one there there's one that
08:47 - extends there that actually comes is
08:49 - this green cable that runs all the way
08:52 - over here to where
08:53 - other kind of extra random tech items
08:54 - are and then obviously I'm using blue
08:57 - outlets here and I'm using the power
08:59 - from underneath that desk to try not to
09:02 - short anything in my house so there is
09:04 - another power bar there you can see the
09:05 - cable management going on here and there
09:08 - is actually a network switch back there
09:10 - so that I can have all my different
09:11 - devices hardwired right into the the
09:14 - router of the modem so I'll do than that
09:15 - I think that's pretty much it for my
09:18 - text setup I mean I'll kind of just pan
09:19 - around here so you guys can continue to
09:21 - look at it but I hope this video gave
09:23 - you some motivation maybe some ideas for
09:25 - what you want to put in your text setup
09:27 - again keep in mind I've been collecting
09:29 - these items for the past five years so
09:31 - as much as this stuff is very expensive
09:33 - I'm valuing it at probably just over
09:35 - 20,000 Canadian all of the little things
09:37 - I have combined I mean remember I have
09:40 - like another laptop there an iPhone 8
09:42 - another speaker a mini laptop here like
09:45 - an iPad like all that stuff it's because
09:47 - I've been collecting it for a long time
09:48 - and this is a business expense like
09:50 - these are investments to me to be able
09:51 - to make videos so ways that is pretty
09:53 - much been it OBS enjoyed the video if
09:55 - you did make sure they like subscribe to
09:57 - the channel and I will see you guys in
09:58 - another YouTube

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so what I'm gonna be doing in this video is walking you through my remote work setup now this is an absolutely ridiculously overkill setup I'm valuing it at probably about twenty five thousand Canadian dollars just because I've been accumulating all these items which you guys gonna see throughout the video for the past probably five years and just keep in mind that this setup that I'm about to show you is for my remote work which I'm actually gonna be doing at Microsoft this summer as a remote intern software engineering intern as well as for filming YouTube videos this is the YouTube set and any other work that I would need to do at home I pretty much live in this setup which I'm gonna show you right now and that is why I've invested so much time and so much money into building it so with that being said let's go ahead and get into my remote work setup alright so what I'm gonna do is just walk around my setup and just talk about things as we get to it's gonna be very casual informal video I really have anything planned so you know I might miss some things but let me know in the comments if you guys have any questions so you gotta see that this is the main set we got some nice foam on the wall I've got a little workstation in the righthand corner here this is kind of my filming set so like this kind of angle here when I'm talking in a video and this is actually the setup for my new podcast called time out with Tim so if you're watching this video the first episode of my new podcast is live it's on a second YouTube channel in video format and it's also on Spotify Apple music anchor like any other platform you can think of it's available on there so please do go check that out I think you guys gonna find it interesting it's just talking about programming technology how I got into coding how I am you know tech with Tim the fulltime student working at Microsoft running this YouTube channel and just have some interesting guests on there as well so please do go subscribe to that second youtube channel even if you guys don't plan on watching it and just support me because this is something that i'm quite excited about starting so this is the podcast set up so i'll go through the first most important thing which is the audio interface so say quadchannel audio interface which takes input from this XLR microphone from this XLR microphone and from this computer when we have any guests on so I am planning on having some guests from the tech space maybe from some other fields as well it's not just gonna be tacky it's gonna talk about like work ethic life finance like things like that as well and the idea here is that we have this kind of connector that goes into the Mac so that we can send audio to the Mac and get audio from the Mac and this is a 2019 MacBook Pro so this is the 16 inch version really nice the display is just gorgeous and the keyboard they did a way better job on it than the previous models so definitely recommend if you guys want to get a new laptop then I have a GoPro up here so this film's my brother if he's gonna be talking on the podcast so the idea is like if you guys watched Joe Rogan he's gonna be like the Jaime of the podcast so he's gonna sit here and do all the technical stuff look some stuff up if we need him to anyways let's get away from that now and go over here so this is my main kind of workstation slash YouTube filming area this is a custom ell desk that we built specifically for this room so this used to be a theater room you can see there's a projector here this little couch that used to be actually on this wall here and obviously the big projector screen so this is usually where we'd watch movies and stuff but we just decided that we don't really use it enough so let's convert this to the tech whatin studio so this is yeah custom L desk we finished it stained it built it by hands in here just went out and bottled the wood for it my dad's pretty handy so he pretty much did that for us you can see this is the road microphone we're gonna use for the podcast this is rode nt1 some of you may appreciate what this is it's on an a shock mount you can see again that's on the swivel so this like PS something rode swivel that's springloaded so the headphones again used for the podcast you can see the tripod this is usually where I'll have the camera kind
