00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - video so in today's video what I'm gonna
00:04 - be talking about is my top programming
00:06 - tips for beginners now I get the same
00:08 - questions asked all the time Tim I'm a
00:10 - beginner programmer I need some help
00:12 - what should I do
00:13 - how can I move from those beginner
00:15 - levels to the intermediate levels what
00:18 - kind of projects should I work on what
00:19 - should I be focusing on and hopefully I
00:21 - can answer some of those questions here
00:22 - for you guys today so before I get too
00:24 - far into the video let me just tell you
00:26 - guys a little bit about myself so you
00:28 - know where I'm getting some of these
00:29 - tips and some of this information from
00:30 - so my name is Tim I'm 18 years old and I
00:33 - just finished my first year of computer
00:35 - science now I've been teaching and just
00:37 - doing programming videos on this YouTube
00:39 - channel tech with Tim for probably about
00:41 - the past two years and I've interacted
00:43 - with hundreds if not thousands of you
00:46 - guys throughout the comments or a
00:47 - discord Twitter and Instagram and I see
00:49 - a ton of beginners that want tips and
00:51 - need some help in terms of improving
00:53 - their programming ability other than
00:55 - that I actually teach programming in a
00:56 - classroom to kids aged between 11 and 15
00:59 - years old so I just teach them the
01:01 - basics of Python and throughout a week
01:03 - we create a very basic game but those
01:05 - are where I see a lot of beginner
01:06 - programmers as well and where I'm going
01:08 - to be grabbing a lot of my tips from now
01:10 - other than that I also do some private
01:12 - tutoring on the side and some
01:13 - consultations and stuff like that so I
01:15 - have a lot of experience not only just
01:17 - with like friends and knowing people
01:19 - that program but actually teaching it as
01:21 - well and this is where I'm gonna come in
01:23 - to some of the tips here and hopefully
01:24 - allow you guys to you know improve your
01:27 - programming from that beginner level to
01:29 - the intermediate level and the steps you
01:31 - need to take to get there so programming
01:33 - tip number one do not be afraid to make
01:36 - mistakes and to experiment with things
01:38 - you don't know now this is the most
01:40 - important by far on my list of
01:43 - programming tips and it's something that
01:44 - I see so commonly with beginner
01:46 - programmers are that is that they're
01:48 - really afraid or even upset or
01:50 - embarrassed when they make mistakes with
01:51 - their code something you got to learn
01:53 - and that you will realize quickly in
01:54 - programming is no one really knows what
01:56 - they're doing when we get down to things
01:58 - any program you write is gonna have bugs
02:00 - there's gonna be mistakes and there's
02:01 - gonna be errors ask any programmer that
02:04 - you look up to even myself maybe and say
02:06 - how many times you make a mistake when
02:08 - you're coding and if you expect that
02:09 - answer to be zero you're gonna be wildly
02:11 - surprised when they tell
02:12 - that almost half the time probably more
02:14 - than their coding their fixing their
02:16 - mistakes and trying to figure out where
02:17 - they went wrong now the wonderful thing
02:19 - about making mistakes is if you actually
02:21 - really care about learning programming
02:24 - and figuring out what is wrong if you go
02:26 - through and you analyze that mistake and
02:28 - take your time and figure out what you
02:30 - did wrong and fix it not only the kind
02:33 - of joy and feeling you get for fixing
02:35 - that mistake and being like all right
02:36 - finally after two hours I found that bug
02:38 - but you're never gonna forget that again
02:40 - or if you do you're gonna slightly
02:42 - remember the steps you took to fix that
02:44 - mistake and if it happens again in
02:46 - another program you're gonna be like hey
02:48 - I remember this this one I was stuck on
02:49 - for a long time this was the issue or
02:51 - this is kind of what I did to get to
02:53 - that issue so maybe this will help me
02:55 - here and that's personally one of the
02:56 - ways that I learned new modules in
02:58 - Python or just code in general what I do
03:00 - is literally go in my Python console and
03:02 - just start typing stuff and seeing what
03:04 - happens I would much rather see read
03:06 - text that confirms you know you don't
03:08 - know what you're doing go back and fix
03:10 - it then type a few lines and not really
03:12 - know what I'm doing and have the output
03:13 - come out okay so please guys don't be
03:16 - afraid to see those error messages if
03:18 - you do see one rather than just copying
03:20 - and pasting your code into Stack
03:21 - Overflow why don't you go look at that
03:23 - error message analyze it and figure out
03:25 - what's going wrong with your program
03:26 - because I guarantee you if you do that
03:28 - you're gonna remember that mistake and
03:30 - in the future you're gonna be like oh I
03:31 - came out I saw this one before and
03:33 - you'll know how to fix that so that's
03:35 - programming tip number one please please
03:37 - please if you get one thing from that
03:38 - video don't be afraid to make mistakes
03:40 - that's the only way you're truly gonna
03:42 - learn and be able to validate whether
03:43 - you know what you're doing or not okay
03:45 - programming tip number two and this one
03:47 - comes really nicely from the last tip we
03:49 - talked about please read your error
03:51 - messages that is programming tip number
03:54 - two now for some reason beginners think
03:57 - that when they click the f5 button to
03:59 - run their code or whatever it is and
04:01 - they see red text they're done they say
04:03 - okay well I guess I got to go back right
04:05 - back to the code and start trying things
04:07 - until eventually I see the output that I
04:09 - want which is just working some print
04:11 - statements whatever it is no no no when
04:13 - you click f5 and you run the code and
04:15 - that error message pops up you better
04:17 - read every line of that error message
04:19 - and make sure you understand what
04:21 - mistake you made and why you made it now
04:24 - not only our error mess
04:26 - is super useful and actually designed to
04:28 - help programmers and to help you figure
04:30 - out what's wrong with your code but
04:31 - learning to read error messages is a
04:33 - skill that you have to master if you
04:35 - ever want to go beyond a beginner
04:37 - programming level now I say this in a
04:39 - really frustrated way just because
04:41 - teaching I see so often especially the
04:44 - younger kids that I teach in the
04:45 - classroom that just come to me with
04:46 - their laptop they go Tim it doesn't work
04:48 - and I say before I even look at their
04:51 - laptop I say okay so what have we tried
04:52 - like what's the goal of the program and
04:54 - I break it down with them and usually
04:55 - after about a minute or two of me
04:57 - talking and saying okay so let's get
04:59 - into this error message and actually
05:00 - analyze it together they figure out on
05:03 - their own without me telling them
05:04 - whatsoever what the air is in their code
05:07 - and I say look I'm happy to help you
05:09 - guys out but please just read the error
05:11 - messages before you come up because if
05:13 - you do that you're probably gonna be
05:14 - able to figure out what's wrong with
05:15 - your code and you're gonna save both of
05:17 - us a lot of time now that's what I'm
05:19 - saying as a tip here please read your
05:21 - error messages well some of them are
05:23 - complicated and I understand that as a
05:24 - beginner you'll see some words in there
05:26 - that you don't really know what they
05:27 - mean or you're kind of confused by them
05:29 - but even at the minimal just seeing what
05:30 - line numbers something went wrong at and
05:32 - taking a quick peek maybe at your code
05:34 - at that line and seeing if you can find
05:36 - the bug because many times especially in
05:38 - simple programs the errors are very very
05:41 - simple maybe a typo maybe forgot a
05:42 - bracket and you can really easily go
05:45 - back and fix them and save yourself a
05:46 - lot of time rather than having to do it
05:48 - a stack overflow and copy it in and get
05:49 - someone else to help you with that
05:51 - question so please do yourself a favor
05:53 - read your error messages even if you
05:55 - don't understand them read every single
05:56 - one because you will start to learn from
05:59 - those error messages and when you see
06:00 - similar ones well you're gonna know how
06:02 - to fix them because you already came up
06:04 - with that solution by learning from
06:06 - making mistakes and all that all right
06:07 - programming tip number three work on
06:10 - projects now I know a lot of people get
06:13 - very upset when I tell them to work on
06:15 - projects because the first thing they
06:16 - say to me is well I don't know what to
06:17 - work on I don't have enough skills
06:19 - there's no projects I can do guys it
06:21 - doesn't matter what project you work on
06:23 - it doesn't matter if your project makes
06:25 - any sense whatsoever it doesn't matter
06:26 - if your project is printing two lines of
06:28 - code when I say work on projects I mean
06:31 - do something by yourself where you're
06:34 - not referring to a video guide or a
06:36 - website or a tutorial of some sorts
06:38 - don't get me wrong I
06:40 - we make a living by making Python and
06:42 - programming tutorial videos so if you
06:44 - guys don't stop watching my tutorials
06:45 - then that's really gonna suck that's not
06:47 - what I'm saying
06:48 - I'm saying go learn the basics get the
06:50 - fundamentals down understand what's
06:52 - happening and then as soon as you're
06:54 - comfortable stop maybe for a day or for
06:56 - an hour or 20 minutes and work on
06:58 - something by yourself and try to program
07:00 - something and see if you really
07:02 - understand it it's really easy even for
07:04 - someone like me to go on a really
07:05 - advanced programming tutorial just copy
07:08 - down the code with them and be like this
07:09 - guy's explaining it well it makes sense
07:11 - and then as soon as I'm actually on my
07:12 - own and I have to apply those concepts
07:14 - by myself I'm like hmm I don't really
07:17 - understand it that well and then I have
07:19 - to go back and watch the video again or
07:21 - I have to try to figure out you know
07:22 - where my understanding is lacking so
07:25 - please don't do the one month a stretch
07:28 - of just going through tutorial videos
07:29 - and copying down all the projects and
07:31 - being like this is what I made this is
07:33 - cool
07:33 - that's great and falling along with
07:35 - project videos that's awesome it's
07:36 - literally how I make a living but I
07:38 - would love for you guys you know to do
07:40 - your own projects where you can validate
07:42 - really what you know and what you don't
07:43 - know and I'll tell you right now if you
07:45 - start working on your own projects
07:46 - something that a lot of youtubers and
07:48 - personally me myself do is I cut out
07:51 - where I make like massive mistakes in a
07:52 - video so if I'm recording a video and I
07:54 - make some like pretty critical errors
07:56 - that take up a lot of time in the video
07:57 - I'll just cut them and go to the next
07:59 - part where I fix the mistake now that is
08:01 - a really valuable part of programming
08:03 - that obviously is not entertaining to
08:05 - watch but it's something that you should
08:06 - definitely be experiencing and if you
08:08 - can work on your own projects you're
08:10 - gonna realize really quickly how many
08:11 - mistakes you're running into and
08:13 - learning from those mistakes again by
08:16 - not being afraid to make mistakes
08:17 - is gonna help you improve your
08:18 - programming ability tremendously
08:20 - especially being able to do your own
08:22 - research and look things up and just you
08:24 - know doing programming on your own is
08:26 - something you definitely need to do as a
08:27 - beginner and you're not gonna get
08:29 - anywhere from just simply watching
08:31 - programming videos online alright guys
08:33 - so my final tip and this one should
08:35 - really go without saying have fun with
08:38 - what you're doing I see so many people
08:40 - that get caught up in the stress and the
08:42 - debugging and kind of the negative
08:44 - aspects of coding maybe and they forget
08:46 - about why they're doing it in the first
08:48 - place the whole reason that I code is
08:50 - because I love to do it I'm not doing it
08:52 - so I can go get a nice
08:53 - my paying job or so I can show off to my
08:55 - friends or have the killer resume all
08:57 - those things are great but at the end of
08:59 - the day you shouldn't be programming and
09:01 - putting as much time as you do into it
09:03 - if you don't absolutely love what you're
09:05 - doing so try to pick areas of
09:07 - programming that you enjoy try to go
09:09 - into routes that you're passionate about
09:10 - and doing that is not only gonna make
09:13 - you even better because you're gonna be
09:15 - so passionate about learning and just
09:16 - figuring out new things and solving
09:19 - problems but it's just a way better use
09:21 - of your time why sit in front of a
09:22 - computer eight hours a day if you do
09:24 - something that you hate so if you're a
09:25 - beginner programmer and you're starting
09:27 - to realize that you really don't enjoy
09:28 - it you know don't feel like you have to
09:31 - keep going with that route I would
09:32 - encourage you to try different things
09:34 - and find areas where maybe you might
09:36 - enjoy them a bit more before you give it
09:37 - up but if you're really at the point
09:39 - where you don't like what you're doing
09:40 - then just stop there's nothing telling
09:42 - you to keep going and I know that the
09:44 - starting salaries for computer
09:45 - scientists or software engineers are
09:47 - very high compared to other fields but
09:49 - it's not worth it if you're not gonna be
09:50 - enjoying what you're doing and the
09:52 - opposite as well if you enjoy what
09:53 - you're doing double down keep going
09:56 - don't think that just because you're a
09:57 - beginner you can't create some awesome
09:59 - stuff and make some cool projects and
10:00 - try different things and build AI and do
10:03 - all this awesome stuff if you enjoy it
10:04 - keep doing it and keep working towards
10:06 - it and you're gonna notice really
10:07 - quickly that that passion shows off and
10:09 - you can tell in any video see Watchers
10:12 - people you see whether they're
10:13 - passionate about what they do and what
10:15 - they're not and typically the people
10:17 - that like what they do are the best at
10:19 - it at least in my opinion
10:20 - so anyways that has kind of been this
10:23 - we're gonna go into a quick recap here
10:24 - but I'd love to know you guys thoughts
10:25 - in the comments down below so please you
10:27 - know communicate with me down there so
10:29 - with that being said let's do a quick
10:31 - recap here at the end of the video just
10:32 - to tell you guys the tips one more time
10:34 - so tip number one do not be afraid to
10:37 - make mistakes and to experiment with
10:38 - things super important if you only get
10:41 - one tip from the video that's the one
10:42 - you should definitely be listening to
10:43 - tip number two read your error messages
10:47 - again super important this goes right
10:49 - with the first point if you actually
10:51 - want to progress in programming you have
10:52 - to make sure you understand where you're
10:54 - going wrong and how you can fix that and
10:57 - maybe do a little bit more work on that
10:58 - tip number three work on projects and
11:01 - just do your own coding without falling
11:04 - online tutorials online tutorials are
11:06 - great and they help
11:07 - learn a ton but once you've been through
11:09 - enough of them it's time to sit down by
11:11 - yourself for even just half an hour and
11:12 - try to create something on your own and
11:14 - very quickly you'll realize how much you
11:16 - know and how much you don't and the
11:18 - final tip and you know what this one
11:19 - they say at the end of every sports game
11:21 - right have fun
11:22 - the end of the day why are we
11:24 - programming if your answer is just to
11:26 - get a job you should really consider
11:27 - switching your profession or doing
11:29 - something else because programming is
11:31 - such a rewarding field when you enjoy
11:33 - what you're doing and personally for me
11:34 - a lot of people look at me like I'm
11:36 - insane when I go program for like six
11:38 - seven hours at a time I love doing that
11:40 - and there's nothing honestly that I'd
11:42 - rather be doing in a lot of cases so
11:44 - please pick something that you're having
11:45 - fun with if you don't like web
11:47 - development try game development if you
11:48 - don't like game development try
11:50 - something else
11:51 - try doing AI and just taste a bunch of
11:53 - different stuff until you figure out
11:54 - what you enjoy and then stick with that
11:56 - because at the end of the day the whole
11:58 - point of this at least for me is to have
12:00 - fun and to challenge myself mentally
12:02 - because I really enjoy programming and
12:04 - coding and that's what you guys should
12:05 - be doing as well especially if you're a
12:06 - beginner just getting into the field so
12:09 - anyways I apologize if I rambled a
12:11 - little bit in this video I just really
12:12 - do and impassionate about this because I
12:15 - see so many people that are young
12:16 - programmers with such amazing potential
12:19 - that don't follow kind of some of the
12:21 - tips that I outlined here and end up
12:22 - either not pursuing programming we're
12:24 - not going as far as I know they can so
12:26 - anyways I hope you guys enjoyed the
12:28 - video if you did make sure to LIKE the
12:29 - video and share it and subscribe to the
12:32 - channel with that being said I will see
12:33 - you guys

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back to another video so in today's video what I'm gonna be talking about is my top programming tips for beginners now I get the same questions asked all the time Tim I'm a beginner programmer I need some help what should I do how can I move from those beginner levels to the intermediate levels what kind of projects should I work on what should I be focusing on and hopefully I can answer some of those questions here for you guys today so before I get too far into the video let me just tell you guys a little bit about myself so you know where I'm getting some of these tips and some of this information from so my name is Tim I'm 18 years old and I just finished my first year of computer science now I've been teaching and just doing programming videos on this YouTube channel tech with Tim for probably about the past two years and I've interacted with hundreds if not thousands of you guys throughout the comments or a discord Twitter and Instagram and I see a ton of beginners that want tips and need some help in terms of improving their programming ability other than that I actually teach programming in a classroom to kids aged between 11 and 15 years old so I just teach them the basics of Python and throughout a week we create a very basic game but those are where I see a lot of beginner programmers as well and where I'm going to be grabbing a lot of my tips from now other than that I also do some private tutoring on the side and some consultations and stuff like that so I have a lot of experience not only just with like friends and knowing people that program but actually teaching it as well and this is where I'm gonna come in to some of the tips here and hopefully allow you guys to you know improve your programming from that beginner level to the intermediate level and the steps you need to take to get there so programming tip number one do not be afraid to make mistakes and to experiment with things you don't know now this is the most important by far on my list of programming tips and it's something that I see so commonly with beginner programmers are that is that they're really afraid or even upset or embarrassed when they make mistakes with their code something you got to learn and that you will realize quickly in programming is no one really knows what they're doing when we get down to things any program you write is gonna have bugs there's gonna be mistakes and there's gonna be errors ask any programmer that you look up to even myself maybe and say how many times you make a mistake when you're coding and if you expect that answer to be zero you're gonna be wildly surprised when they tell that almost half the time probably more than their coding their fixing their mistakes and trying to figure out where they went wrong now the wonderful thing about making mistakes is if you actually really care about learning programming and figuring out what is wrong if you go through and you analyze that mistake and take your time and figure out what you did wrong and fix it not only the kind of joy and feeling you get for fixing that mistake and being like all right finally after two hours I found that bug but you're never gonna forget that again or if you do you're gonna slightly remember the steps you took to fix that mistake and if it happens again in another program you're gonna be like hey I remember this this one I was stuck on for a long time this was the issue or this is kind of what I did to get to that issue so maybe this will help me here and that's personally one of the ways that I learned new modules in Python or just code in general what I do is literally go in my Python console and just start typing stuff and seeing what happens I would much rather see read text that confirms you know you don't know what you're doing go back and fix it then type a few lines and not really know what I'm doing and have the output come out okay so please guys don't be afraid to see those error messages if you do see one rather than just copying and pasting your code into Stack Overflow why don't you go look at that error message analyze it and figure out what's going wrong with your program because I guarantee you if you do that you're gonna remember that mistake and in the future you're gonna be like oh I came out I saw this one before and you'll know how to fix that so that's programming tip number one please please please if you get one thing from that video don't be afraid to make mistakes that's the only way you're truly gonna learn and be able to validate whether you know what you're doing or not okay programming tip number two and this one comes really nicely from the last tip we talked about please read your error messages that is programming tip number two now for some reason beginners think that when they click the f5 button to run their code or whatever it is and they see red text they're done they say okay well I guess I got to go back right back to the code and start trying things until eventually I see the output that I want which is just working some print statements whatever it is no no no when you click f5 and you run the code and that error message pops up you better read every line of that error message and make sure you understand what mistake you made and why you made it now not only our error mess is super useful and actually designed to help programmers and to help you figure out what's wrong with your code but learning to read error messages is a skill that you have to master if you ever want to go beyond a beginner programming level now I say this in a really frustrated way just because teaching I see so often especially the younger kids that I teach in the classroom that just come to me with their laptop they go Tim it doesn't work and I say before I even look at their laptop I say okay so what have we tried like what's the goal of the program and I break it down with them and usually after about a minute or two of me talking and saying okay so let's get into this error message and actually analyze it together they figure out on their own without me telling them whatsoever what the air is in their code and I say look I'm happy to help you guys out but please just read the error messages before you come up because if you do that you're probably gonna be able to figure out what's wrong with your code and you're gonna save both of us a lot of time now that's what I'm saying as a tip here please read your error messages well some of them are complicated and I understand that as a beginner you'll see some words in there that you don't really know what they mean or you're kind of confused by them but even at the minimal just seeing what line numbers something went wrong at and taking a quick peek maybe at your code at that line and seeing if you can find the bug because many times especially in simple programs the errors are very very simple maybe a typo maybe forgot a bracket and you can really easily go back and fix them and save yourself a lot of time rather than having to do it a stack overflow and copy it in and get someone else to help you with that question so please do yourself a favor read your error messages even if you don't understand them read every single one because you will start to learn from those error messages and when you see similar ones well you're gonna know how to fix them because you already came up with that solution by learning from making mistakes and all that all right programming tip number three work on projects now I know a lot of people get very upset when I tell them to work on projects because the first thing they say to me is well I don't know what to work on I don't have enough skills there's no projects I can do guys it doesn't matter what project you work on it doesn't matter if your project makes any sense whatsoever it doesn't matter if your project is printing two lines of code when I say work on projects I mean do something by yourself where you're not referring to a video guide or a website or a tutorial of some sorts don't get me wrong I we make a living by making Python and programming tutorial videos so if you guys don't stop watching my tutorials then that's really gonna suck that's not what I'm saying I'm saying go learn the basics get the fundamentals down understand what's happening and then as soon as you're comfortable stop maybe for a day or for an hour or 20 minutes and work on something by yourself and try to program something and see if you really understand it it's really easy even for someone like me to go on a really advanced programming tutorial just copy down the code with them and be like this guy's explaining it well it makes sense and then as soon as I'm actually on my own and I have to apply those concepts by myself I'm like hmm I don't really understand it that well and then I have to go back and watch the video again or I have to try to figure out you know where my understanding is lacking so please don't do the one month a stretch of just going through tutorial videos and copying down all the projects and being like this is what I made this is cool that's great and falling along with project videos that's awesome it's literally how I make a living but I would love for you guys you know to do your own projects where you can validate really what you know and what you don't know and I'll tell you right now if you start working on your own projects something that a lot of youtubers and personally me myself do is I cut out where I make like massive mistakes in a video so if I'm recording a video and I make some like pretty critical errors that take up a lot of time in the video I'll just cut them and go to the next part where I fix the mistake now that is a really valuable part of programming that obviously is not entertaining to watch but it's something that you should definitely be experiencing and if you can work on your own projects you're gonna realize really quickly how many mistakes you're running into and learning from those mistakes again by not being afraid to make mistakes is gonna help you improve your programming ability tremendously especially being able to do your own research and look things up and just you know doing programming on your own is something you definitely need to do as a beginner and you're not gonna get anywhere from just simply watching programming videos online alright guys so my final tip and this one should really go without saying have fun with what you're doing I see so many people that get caught up in the stress and the debugging and kind of the negative aspects of coding maybe and they forget about why they're doing it in the first place the whole reason that I code is because I love to do it I'm not doing it so I can go get a nice my paying job or so I can show off to my friends or have the killer resume all those things are great but at the end of the day you shouldn't be programming and putting as much time as you do into it if you don't absolutely love what you're doing so try to pick areas of programming that you enjoy try to go into routes that you're passionate about and doing that is not only gonna make you even better because you're gonna be so passionate about learning and just figuring out new things and solving problems but it's just a way better use of your time why sit in front of a computer eight hours a day if you do something that you hate so if you're a beginner programmer and you're starting to realize that you really don't enjoy it you know don't feel like you have to keep going with that route I would encourage you to try different things and find areas where maybe you might enjoy them a bit more before you give it up but if you're really at the point where you don't like what you're doing then just stop there's nothing telling you to keep going and I know that the starting salaries for computer scientists or software engineers are very high compared to other fields but it's not worth it if you're not gonna be enjoying what you're doing and the opposite as well if you enjoy what you're doing double down keep going don't think that just because you're a beginner you can't create some awesome stuff and make some cool projects and try different things and build AI and do all this awesome stuff if you enjoy it keep doing it and keep working towards it and you're gonna notice really quickly that that passion shows off and you can tell in any video see Watchers people you see whether they're passionate about what they do and what they're not and typically the people that like what they do are the best at it at least in my opinion so anyways that has kind of been this we're gonna go into a quick recap here but I'd love to know you guys thoughts in the comments down below so please you know communicate with me down there so with that being said let's do a quick recap here at the end of the video just to tell you guys the tips one more time so tip number one do not be afraid to make mistakes and to experiment with things super important if you only get one tip from the video that's the one you should definitely be listening to tip number two read your error messages again super important this goes right with the first point if you actually want to progress in programming you have to make sure you understand where you're going wrong and how you can fix that and maybe do a little bit more work on that tip number three work on projects and just do your own coding without falling online tutorials online tutorials are great and they help learn a ton but once you've been through enough of them it's time to sit down by yourself for even just half an hour and try to create something on your own and very quickly you'll realize how much you know and how much you don't and the final tip and you know what this one they say at the end of every sports game right have fun the end of the day why are we programming if your answer is just to get a job you should really consider switching your profession or doing something else because programming is such a rewarding field when you enjoy what you're doing and personally for me a lot of people look at me like I'm insane when I go program for like six seven hours at a time I love doing that and there's nothing honestly that I'd rather be doing in a lot of cases so please pick something that you're having fun with if you don't like web development try game development if you don't like game development try something else try doing AI and just taste a bunch of different stuff until you figure out what you enjoy and then stick with that because at the end of the day the whole point of this at least for me is to have fun and to challenge myself mentally because I really enjoy programming and coding and that's what you guys should be doing as well especially if you're a beginner just getting into the field so anyways I apologize if I rambled a little bit in this video I just really do and impassionate about this because I see so many people that are young programmers with such amazing potential that don't follow kind of some of the tips that I outlined here and end up either not pursuing programming we're not going as far as I know they can so anyways I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did make sure to LIKE the video and share it and subscribe to the channel with that being said I will see you guys
