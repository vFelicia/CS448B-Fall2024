00:00 - so why should you not Learn Python well
00:02 - there's many reasons here but most of
00:04 - them stem from the fact that python is a
00:06 - very general language so for example you
00:08 - can make a game with python but it's not
00:09 - going to be the best performing game and
00:11 - you'd probably be better off using
00:12 - something like c-sharp and unity but you
00:14 - can do let's say a mobile app with
00:17 - python but again you'd probably be
00:18 - better off using a native language like
00:20 - Swift you can do something like a
00:22 - website with python or a back end with
00:23 - python but you might be better off using
00:25 - something like go or rust so you see
00:27 - that although python can be used for so
00:29 - many different things if you're going to
00:30 - be a specialist in one specific area a
00:33 - lot of times employers are going to look
00:34 - for someone who knows the best language
00:36 - or the best Frameworks in that area
