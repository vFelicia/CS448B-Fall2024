00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:02 - this video I'm going to be sharing with
00:03 - you 18 Python modules you need to know
00:06 - now I've split these modules up into
00:08 - four different categories to make things
00:09 - a little bit easier for us and those
00:11 - categories are web development data
00:13 - science machine learning and AI and
00:15 - graphical user interfaces near the end
00:18 - of the video I also share my personal
00:19 - favorite Python module so make sure you
00:21 - stay tuned to see what that is
00:23 - also make sure to share with me in the
00:24 - comments down below your favorite Python
00:26 - module and we'll get into the content in
00:28 - just a second after a word from our
00:30 - sponsor I need to thank simply line for
00:32 - sponsoring this video and introduce you
00:33 - to their machine learning certification
00:35 - course in this course you will explore
00:36 - the necessary skills and techniques to
00:38 - become a machine learning engineer and
00:40 - unlock the power of this emerging field
00:42 - through 58 hours of online and
00:44 - instructor-led training you'll work on
00:46 - four industry based course projects and
00:48 - develop your skills through interactive
00:49 - coding activities and labs and Jupiter
00:51 - notebooks a few of the topics you'll
00:53 - learn include supervised and
00:55 - unsupervised machine learning time
00:57 - series modeling linear and logistic
00:59 - regression decision trees random forests
01:02 - classifiers deep learning and many other
01:04 - topics this course comes with a hundred
01:06 - percent money-back guarantee and you can
01:07 - get started today by hitting the link in
01:09 - the description the first category of
01:11 - modules that I'd like to discuss is
01:13 - those that deal with web development and
01:15 - HTTP requests now Python is heavily
01:17 - known for back-end web development and
01:19 - therefore you could assume that there's
01:21 - a lot of different modules available to
01:22 - make enterprise level websites in Python
01:25 - now the first module I want to talk
01:26 - about is actually the requests module
01:28 - now the request module is used to send
01:31 - HTTP requests with ease
01:33 - it's very simple it's easy to use and is
01:35 - the most downloaded Python package today
01:37 - pulling in around 14 million downloads a
01:40 - week and according to github it's
01:41 - actually dependent upon by about three
01:43 - hundred and sixty seven thousand
01:45 - repositories now this next one that I'm
01:48 - going to talk about is actually more of
01:49 - a framework than it is a module although
01:51 - you do install it and that is called
01:53 - Django now Django is a web framework for
01:56 - Python it's very heavy weights and it's
01:57 - actually used by companies like
01:59 - Instagram and tinder or originally was
02:01 - used by them to make their websites so
02:03 - Django is a completely Python back-end
02:06 - web framework you can use other
02:07 - languages with it you can connect it
02:09 - with other framework
02:10 - and it comes with a whole ton of tools
02:11 - and complex developer features that
02:14 - allow you to make well enterprise-level
02:15 - websites now the next module that I want
02:18 - to talk about is flask now flask is kind
02:20 - of a competitor of Django they're both
02:22 - web frameworks although they do have
02:24 - some fundamental differences so Django
02:26 - and flask work similarly for basic web
02:29 - sites although flask is much easier and
02:31 - faster to get set up it's a much lighter
02:33 - weight web framework and it doesn't come
02:36 - with all of the tools and crazy things
02:38 - that come with Django so if you want to
02:40 - know which one to pick if you're using
02:42 - Django or flask for web development if
02:43 - you were trying to make a very serious
02:45 - website do everything properly have
02:47 - serious authentication and things like
02:49 - that you probably use Django but if
02:51 - you're doing more of a side project or
02:53 - something a little bit smaller then you
02:54 - would likely want to pick flask is
02:56 - that's a much easier module to get
02:57 - running and working with now the next
02:59 - module I want to talk about is twisted
03:01 - now I don't know too much about this one
03:03 - but I did want to throw it on my list
03:04 - because this is actually used for doing
03:06 - online game development now you can do
03:08 - other things with it as well but
03:09 - essentially this allows communication
03:11 - between clients and servers very easily
03:13 - and it'll just make your life a lot
03:14 - easier than having to program out your
03:16 - own socket server so check that out if
03:18 - you're trying to do any kind of online
03:20 - interaction or you know real-time games
03:22 - or something like that with Python
03:24 - now the next module on our list is
03:26 - beautiful soup for now I believe there's
03:28 - some other versions of this as well you
03:30 - know there's likely three two and one
03:31 - but beautiful soup is a great module for
03:34 - scraping the web so if you're doing web
03:35 - scraping you're trying to grab HTML data
03:38 - beautiful soup can do that for you and
03:40 - it's pretty easy to get that working and
03:42 - the last module on my list for web
03:44 - development is selenium now selenium is
03:46 - used to do automation on websites so
03:48 - essentially allowing you to either test
03:50 - your websites or to make some kind of
03:52 - bot that will interact with other
03:53 - websites so you could do things like
03:55 - access HTML fields you can move your
03:57 - mouse cursor around you can click you
03:59 - can access buttons that's what a
04:01 - selenium allows you to do cool module I
04:02 - haven't played with it too much
04:03 - although definitely something worth
04:05 - mentioning on this web development list
04:06 - so the next category to dive into here
04:09 - is data science now python is very
04:11 - popular for data science and one of the
04:13 - reasons for that is all of the different
04:14 - modules that are available that make a
04:16 - data scientist life much easier for
04:19 - example the first module on my list is
04:21 - not
04:21 - hi now numpy is an amazing module for
04:24 - doing any kind of mathematical
04:26 - operations in Python so essentially what
04:28 - it allows you to do is work with array
04:30 - like objects of multiple dimensions
04:32 - so like matrices for example and do all
04:34 - kind of complicated three dimension four
04:37 - dimension five dimensional math very
04:38 - fast and one of the reasons it's so fast
04:40 - actually is because a lot of the
04:42 - operations are implemented in C which
04:44 - means using numpy will actually make
04:46 - your program a lot faster than if you
04:48 - were to say not use that module and
04:50 - implement those operations in standard
04:52 - Python now the next module to discuss in
04:54 - this data science category is pandas now
04:57 - pandas is great for reading and working
04:59 - with data frames and just data in
05:01 - general makes it very easy to manipulate
05:03 - data work with data clean data get rid
05:06 - of columns and everything that you
05:07 - pretty much would want to do with data
05:09 - now the next module that works with
05:12 - these two very nicely is a map plot lip
05:14 - now matplotlib is used for doing data
05:16 - visualizations so it's really good for
05:19 - visualizing your data making plots
05:21 - making charts and it's also really good
05:23 - for working with machine learning models
05:25 - and visualizing things like say a loss
05:27 - function or the amount of accuracy that
05:29 - your machine learning model is getting
05:31 - over a certain amount of epochs per se
05:32 - so now we move on to the last two
05:34 - modules in my list the first of which is
05:36 - NLT k now NLT K stands for natural
05:39 - language toolkit and it's used for doing
05:41 - any kind of data processing or text
05:44 - processing so if you have textual data
05:46 - and you want to remove things like
05:48 - punctuation or spaces or tokenize your
05:51 - data for example natural language
05:53 - toolkit can help you do that as a ton of
05:55 - tools for working with text-based data
05:57 - and well natural language processing and
05:59 - for the last module on our list we have
06:02 - open CV now open CV is an extremely
06:04 - powerful module that's used for many
06:06 - different things wherever its main focus
06:08 - is on image and video data processing so
06:11 - we can do things like feature detection
06:13 - and description it actually does object
06:15 - recognition and detection as well and as
06:17 - some machine learning models built into
06:19 - the module that you can use to
06:20 - manipulate data work with images you can
06:23 - draw things on images it's just an
06:24 - extremely powerful module for really
06:26 - doing anything with image or video data
06:28 - now this transitions us nicely into the
06:30 - next category which is machine learning
06:32 - an AI and the first module I have in
06:34 - this case
06:35 - Gauri is tensorflow now tensorflow is by
06:38 - far the most powerful module in this
06:40 - section it's maintained and supported by
06:42 - Google and you can do some extremely
06:44 - powerful things with it without really
06:46 - having a great understanding of how all
06:48 - the math works and that's the benefit of
06:49 - tensorflow is it allows you to do very
06:51 - powerful things like you can do neural
06:53 - networks you can run standard machine
06:55 - learning algorithms you can create
06:56 - convolutional neural networks you can do
06:58 - things like neuro style transfers and
07:00 - there's all kinds of tutorials and
07:02 - guides on that tensorflow website that
07:04 - can help you get started learning how to
07:05 - use this module now this transitions are
07:08 - sent to Kara's so caris is a module as
07:10 - well in Python that is actually a
07:12 - higher-level API for tensorflow
07:14 - so you can do some pretty cool things
07:16 - with tensorflow it is maintained and
07:18 - supported by Google and that means that
07:20 - there's some great technologies and some
07:21 - innovations that have been done and used
07:23 - in tensorflow
07:24 - but for some of us that are more
07:25 - beginners we'd probably want to be
07:27 - working with Kara's now what Kara's
07:29 - allows us to do is access some of these
07:31 - tensorflow features in an easier way you
07:33 - can almost think of it as like a wrapper
07:34 - for tensorflow where it just makes it
07:36 - much easier to make models and do things
07:38 - quickly and that's kind of when we would
07:40 - use Kara's then that leads us into PI
07:43 - torch now I don't know much about PI
07:44 - torch so I'll refrain from talking about
07:46 - it a ton although I do know that it is
07:48 - another leading module in terms of
07:50 - machine learning and AI in Python I
07:52 - believe it's a little bit behind
07:53 - tensorflow but definitely something
07:54 - worth checking out and finally we
07:57 - conclude with scikit-learn now
07:59 - scikit-learn is another great module in
08:01 - Python this one is definitely not as
08:03 - powerful as the previous mentioned
08:04 - modules but that's okay it's a little
08:06 - bit lighter weight and allows us to work
08:08 - with some things like clustering
08:09 - algorithms linear regressions support
08:11 - vector machines and some simpler things
08:13 - that yes you could do in tensorflow
08:15 - but maybe you don't want to use a module
08:16 - that massive you'd rather use something
08:18 - like scikit-learn the next modules that
08:21 - I'd like to discuss but those that are
08:22 - aimed towards building graphical user
08:24 - interfaces in Python so the first option
08:26 - here is Kibby now queue is a great
08:29 - module for actually building
08:30 - applications that will scale to all
08:32 - different platforms so any Kibby op that
08:34 - you build will work on Linux it will
08:36 - work on Mac it will work on Windows
08:37 - it'll work on iOS and it should work on
08:40 - Android now it's a little bit harder
08:42 - than that to actually get those
08:43 - applications on the device but the idea
08:45 - is that Kibby is pretty simple it's
08:47 - pretty easy to use
08:48 - and that anything you make will work for
08:50 - all different devices now the next
08:52 - framework or the next option on our list
08:54 - is PI QT 5 now PI QT 5 in my opinion is
08:57 - the best graphical user interface
08:59 - builder for Python it has the most
09:01 - options and flexibility in terms of what
09:03 - you can actually do with it you can even
09:05 - use CSS styling - well style your
09:08 - application and in fact an example of
09:10 - something that's built in PI QT 5 is
09:12 - actually the Spyder IDE so I believe
09:14 - most of that if not all of that is
09:16 - actually built using purely PI QT 5 with
09:19 - an entire Python back-end so that should
09:21 - prove to you that if you want to make a
09:23 - more complex desktop application with
09:24 - Python this should be the module that
09:26 - you pick it's a little bit more capable
09:28 - than the next one on my list which is
09:30 - tkinter so tkinter is an older module it
09:33 - is also used for building graphical user
09:35 - interfaces it's fairly similar to PI QT
09:37 - 5 in terms of how the interfaces look
09:39 - although it's definitely not as capable
09:41 - but I would say it's a little bit easier
09:42 - for beginners and people that are just
09:44 - looking to get something whipped up
09:46 - pretty fast and pretty easily now before
09:48 - I wrap up the video I want to tell you
09:50 - about my favorite module and python that
09:52 - hasn't fit any of the categories
09:53 - mentioned before and that is Pi game now
09:56 - Pi game is the first Python module that
09:58 - I ever learned and it's what really got
10:00 - me into Python programming and why I
10:02 - recommend it to any beginners or people
10:03 - that maybe aren't as motivated to
10:05 - program to use it's not very practical
10:08 - in terms of building actual large games
10:10 - but if you want to build some simple 2d
10:12 - games or just work on your skills and
10:14 - build something fun then you can
10:15 - definitely do that in PI game and if you
10:17 - want some inspiration for some things
10:18 - that you can work with in PI game I
10:20 - should be flashing some on the screen
10:21 - right now but I've made all kinds of
10:23 - tutorial series on how to make things
10:25 - like Tetris how to make snake how to
10:28 - make other random platformer games and
10:30 - if you know what you're doing with PI
10:31 - game you can make some pretty powerful
10:32 - and impressive things so that has been
10:34 - it for the 18 python modules you need to
10:37 - know now do you think I forgot any
10:39 - modules definitely let me know in the
10:40 - comments down below and as always if you
10:42 - liked the video make sure to leave a
10:43 - like subscribe to the channel and
10:45 - hopefully I will see you again in
10:46 - another youtube video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so in this video I'm going to be sharing with you 18 Python modules you need to know now I've split these modules up into four different categories to make things a little bit easier for us and those categories are web development data science machine learning and AI and graphical user interfaces near the end of the video I also share my personal favorite Python module so make sure you stay tuned to see what that is also make sure to share with me in the comments down below your favorite Python module and we'll get into the content in just a second after a word from our sponsor I need to thank simply line for sponsoring this video and introduce you to their machine learning certification course in this course you will explore the necessary skills and techniques to become a machine learning engineer and unlock the power of this emerging field through 58 hours of online and instructorled training you'll work on four industry based course projects and develop your skills through interactive coding activities and labs and Jupiter notebooks a few of the topics you'll learn include supervised and unsupervised machine learning time series modeling linear and logistic regression decision trees random forests classifiers deep learning and many other topics this course comes with a hundred percent moneyback guarantee and you can get started today by hitting the link in the description the first category of modules that I'd like to discuss is those that deal with web development and HTTP requests now Python is heavily known for backend web development and therefore you could assume that there's a lot of different modules available to make enterprise level websites in Python now the first module I want to talk about is actually the requests module now the request module is used to send HTTP requests with ease it's very simple it's easy to use and is the most downloaded Python package today pulling in around 14 million downloads a week and according to github it's actually dependent upon by about three hundred and sixty seven thousand repositories now this next one that I'm going to talk about is actually more of a framework than it is a module although you do install it and that is called Django now Django is a web framework for Python it's very heavy weights and it's actually used by companies like Instagram and tinder or originally was used by them to make their websites so Django is a completely Python backend web framework you can use other languages with it you can connect it with other framework and it comes

it's a much lighter weight web framework and it doesn't come with all of the tools and crazy things that come with Django so if you want to know which one to pick if you're using Django or flask for web development if you were trying to make a very serious website do everything properly have serious authentication and things like that you probably use Django but if you're doing more of a side project or something a little bit smaller then you would likely want to pick flask is that's a much easier module to get running and working with now the next module I want to talk about is twisted now I don't know too much about this one but I did want to throw it on my list because this is actually used for doing online game development now you can do other things with it as well but essentially this allows communication between clients and servers very easily and it'll just make your life a lot easier than having to program out your own socket server so check that out if you're trying to do any kind of online interaction or you know realtime games or something like that with Python now the next module on our list is beautiful soup for now I believe there's some other versions of this as well you know there's likely three two and one but beautiful soup is a great module for scraping the web so if you're doing web scraping you're trying to grab HTML data beautiful soup can do that for you and it's pretty easy to get that working and the last module on my list for web development is selenium now selenium is used to do automation on websites so essentially allowing you to either test your websites or to make some kind of bot that will interact with other websites so you could do things like access HTML fields you can move your mouse cursor around you can click you can access buttons that's what a selenium allows you to do cool module I haven't played with it too much although definitely something worth mentioning on this web development list so
