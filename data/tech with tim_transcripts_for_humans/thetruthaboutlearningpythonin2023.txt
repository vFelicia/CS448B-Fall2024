00:03 - foreign
00:15 - brand new year and already there's a ton
00:18 - of stuff affecting the tech industry
00:20 - we've got tools like chat GPT all kinds
00:23 - of tech layoffs just the economy in
00:25 - general and if you're a software
00:26 - engineer or programmer you're rightfully
00:28 - probably a little bit worried and
00:30 - concerned and thinking about how you can
00:31 - best prepare for what may happen in the
00:34 - next 6 12 18 months Etc now I'm not here
00:37 - to worry you I think that if you're in
00:38 - the tech industry you're going to be
00:40 - completely fine really what I would be
00:42 - doing now is just working on your skills
00:44 - getting as good as you possibly can and
00:46 - proving to either your current employer
00:47 - that you're worth keeping around or to a
00:49 - new employer that you're worth taking on
00:51 - even though the hiring is kind of slowed
00:53 - down a little bit right now so kind of
00:55 - summary here don't be too concerned I
00:57 - think everything is going to be fine and
00:59 - what I'm going to do in this video is
01:00 - talk to you about python specifically
01:02 - and if I think you should be learning
01:04 - that in 2023 based on everything that's
01:06 - going on obviously you guys know this a
01:09 - python Focus Channel I'm sure many of
01:11 - you are beginners just getting into
01:12 - python fun and maybe you're a little bit
01:14 - scared with what's going on right now
01:15 - and wondering should I kind of be
01:16 - learning this should I keep going into
01:18 - this field and many of you are probably
01:20 - intermediate or Advanced python
01:22 - programmers and thinking about should I
01:23 - change languages should I diversify a
01:25 - bit and that's what I'm hopefully going
01:27 - to answer here specifically I'm going to
01:29 - tell you why I think you should learn
01:30 - python why I think you shouldn't Learn
01:32 - Python and then other languages I'd
01:34 - recommend if you're going to be moving
01:35 - away from the Python language with that
01:38 - said let's get into the video after a
01:40 - quick word from our sponsor before we
01:42 - get started I need to thank lenode for
01:44 - sponsoring this video I've been using
01:46 - and working with lenode for nearly three
01:48 - years now and they've consistently been
01:50 - my go-to choice for hosting my
01:51 - applications and servers in fact right
01:54 - now I'm using the node to host the
01:55 - official Tech with Tim Discord bot a
01:58 - website multiple of my domains and a
02:00 - kubernetes cluster now lenode was just
02:02 - recently acquired by Akamai and as a
02:04 - part of this acquisition they're going
02:05 - to be adding more than a dozen new data
02:07 - centers around the world in the next
02:09 - year lenode makes it super easy to spin
02:11 - up servers with their one Click app
02:13 - Marketplace and have tons of written
02:15 - guides and YouTube videos on their
02:16 - channel to help you get started now if
02:18 - you're having any issues you can reach
02:20 - out to the 24 7 support team and
02:22 - actually talk with a real human being
02:24 - now the nodes pricing is simple with no
02:26 - hidden fees and full transparency and
02:28 - you can test out the node services for
02:30 - free by using the link in the
02:32 - description and claiming a 100.60 day
02:34 - credit for any new accounts it's been an
02:37 - absolute pleasure to work with lenode
02:38 - over the past few years and one last
02:40 - thank you to them for sponsoring this
02:42 - video
02:44 - foreign
02:49 - so just as a mini preface here before I
02:51 - get into the main points of the video if
02:53 - you're someone who's just getting into
02:54 - python you're just getting into software
02:56 - engineering I think you should still
02:57 - continue down this path this is
02:59 - definitely something that's going to
03:01 - give you a ton of opportunities it's a
03:02 - great skill to have in general even if
03:04 - you're not employed as like a programmer
03:06 - or a software engineer and I don't think
03:08 - you need to be overly concerned that's
03:10 - my opinion obviously everyone has their
03:12 - own but I'm still working on new skills
03:14 - right now I'm learning new languages and
03:16 - I'm improving constantly no matter what
03:18 - kind of the market looks like with that
03:20 - said if you guys do want to get a
03:21 - comprehensive overview of python just
03:23 - software engineering skills in general I
03:25 - do have a course it's called
03:26 - programmingexpert.io I will leave that
03:28 - link in the description
03:31 - foreign
03:36 - so let's get into the bulk of the video
03:37 - here and discuss why you should learn
03:39 - python or continue learning it so first
03:42 - of all python is a general purpose
03:44 - programming language it's extremely
03:46 - popular used by tens of millions of
03:48 - people typically ranked one of the most
03:49 - popular programming languages in the
03:51 - world based on use case as well as
03:53 - demand for developers there is tons of
03:56 - different jobs and you can really do
03:58 - anything you want with python with that
04:00 - said python is not always the best best
04:03 - language story for a specific task but
04:05 - since it is so General you can pretty
04:07 - much do anything you could imagine so if
04:10 - You Learn Python you have the ability to
04:11 - do machine learning you can make a
04:13 - website you can make a game you can make
04:15 - a back-end server or API you can mess
04:17 - around with databases pretty much
04:19 - anything you can imagine you can write
04:21 - in Python so as a first language it's
04:23 - very good because it gives you a lot of
04:25 - different Avenues and allows you to
04:27 - explore a bunch of different options
04:28 - before maybe learning a more specific
04:30 - language for the specific path that you
04:33 - want to go down with that said python is
04:35 - also a very beginner friendly language
04:37 - it's typically very fast to learn if you
04:39 - already know a language it's going to be
04:41 - very fast you can probably pick it up in
04:43 - a few weeks or maybe even a month and
04:46 - it's something that's very easy to read
04:47 - and fast to write coding so if you're
04:50 - someone who's maybe not thinking about
04:52 - being a career software engineer you're
04:54 - just kind of learning programming to
04:55 - pick up a little bit of a side skill
04:57 - maybe it's something that interests you
04:58 - definitely a language I would recommend
05:00 - because of the general purpose aspect of
05:02 - it and the fact that it's going to be
05:04 - very fast to learn and it's not super
05:06 - complicated there's a lot of other
05:08 - programming languages that may be better
05:10 - suited for a specific task but are a bit
05:12 - more complex there's more Theory more
05:14 - logic that you need to learn and it can
05:16 - be a bit discouraging whereas python I
05:18 - find people typically build a lot of
05:20 - confidence with it very quickly start
05:22 - building apps projects Etc then that
05:24 - accelerates them into a second third
05:26 - fourth language you know beyond that so
05:29 - hopefully that's kind of a general
05:30 - overview of python now relating python
05:32 - to the current situation I think python
05:35 - is a great language to learn especially
05:37 - if you're going to be interviewing so if
05:39 - you're going to be interviewing I like
05:40 - doing it in Python because it's a very
05:42 - fast language to write just in terms of
05:44 - the syntax it's very simple it's very
05:46 - easy for your interviewer to read it and
05:48 - it has a lot of helpful like functions
05:51 - methods Etc that can save you quite a
05:53 - bit of time when you're doing a coding
05:55 - interview so something to consider doing
05:57 - a coding interview in Python I would say
05:59 - is way easier than doing it in like Java
06:01 - or C plus plus or c-sharp or something
06:03 - else that you may know personally I did
06:06 - all of my coding interviews in Python
06:07 - and even if someone doesn't know python
06:10 - since it's just such a simple language
06:12 - uh like kind of with the syntax of it
06:14 - it's very easy for them to read and
06:15 - understand what you're doing now going
06:17 - beyond that I will mention that python
06:19 - does have a ton of jobs typically python
06:21 - is going to be some kind of requirement
06:23 - or you're going to have to be at least
06:24 - familiar with the language and that's
06:26 - because it really is used everywhere and
06:29 - you're gonna find it in a lot of code
06:30 - bases even if it's not the core language
06:32 - for different scripts or kind of smaller
06:35 - aspects of the code code and a lot of
06:36 - employers want to know that you have
06:38 - some comfort and some familiarity with
06:40 - it so even though it's not always going
06:41 - to be the primary language you need to
06:43 - know to get a job it's typically some
06:45 - kind of prerequisite and there is a lot
06:47 - of just straight python jobs so with
06:49 - that said that's why I think you should
06:51 - learn python now let's talk about why
06:53 - you shouldn't Learn Python
07:00 - so why should you not Learn Python well
07:03 - there's many reasons here but most of
07:05 - them stem from the fact that python is a
07:07 - very general language now that's good in
07:09 - some instances but in this case it's bad
07:11 - because that means that python is not
07:13 - the best language for a lot of different
07:15 - specific tasks so for example you can
07:18 - make a game with python but it's not
07:19 - going to be the best performing game and
07:21 - you'd probably be better off using
07:22 - something like c-sharp and unity for
07:25 - example you can do let's say a mobile
07:27 - app with python but again you'd probably
07:29 - be better off using a native language
07:31 - like Swift or kotlin you can do
07:33 - something like a website with python or
07:35 - a backend with python but you might be
07:37 - better off using something like go or
07:39 - rust so you see that although python can
07:41 - be used for so many different things if
07:43 - you're going to be a specialist in one
07:44 - specific area a lot of times employers
07:47 - are going to look for someone who knows
07:48 - the best language or the best Frameworks
07:50 - in that area now that's not always the
07:52 - case there is a lot of just pure python
07:54 - jobs where companies use only python
07:57 - where they have their website or their
07:58 - game or whatever in Python on like I
08:00 - mentioned before but in a lot of other
08:02 - cases you have companies that may have
08:04 - python as a second or third language
08:06 - that you need to know and before that
08:08 - they want you to be a pro at whatever
08:10 - the main languages for the kind of
08:12 - domain or task that you're going to be
08:13 - completing so if you're going to be a
08:15 - game developer you probably want to know
08:16 - unity and C sharp if you're going to be
08:18 - a website designer you probably want to
08:20 - know JavaScript hopefully you get where
08:22 - I'm going here but since python is so
08:24 - General you lose out on a lot of really
08:26 - specific jobs and kind of tasks if
08:29 - that's the only thing that you know so
08:32 - that's the main reason why I wouldn't
08:33 - Learn Python or if I already know it I
08:36 - might transition into something else
08:37 - just to make myself a bit more
08:39 - well-rounded and have more experience in
08:41 - a specific Niche or more knowledge in a
08:43 - specific area so really the main point
08:45 - there is that python is more of a
08:47 - general language you're going to be more
08:48 - of a generalist with that whereas with
08:50 - another language you're typically going
08:51 - to be more of a specialist and maybe
08:53 - have some better prospects maybe some
08:55 - higher paying jobs or some more
08:57 - opportunity just because you know a
08:59 - language that maybe not not everyone
09:00 - knows whereas python kind of a lot of
09:02 - people know that and we consider
09:04 - themselves kind of fluent or competent
09:06 - in that area something worth considering
09:08 - going beyond that I will also mention
09:10 - that if python is currently the language
09:12 - that you know and you're good at python
09:14 - it's probably a good idea to Branch out
09:16 - and learn a second or third language
09:17 - rather than just kind of diving into
09:19 - becoming an expert in Python that's
09:22 - because again you've already picked up
09:23 - that General language and now it's going
09:25 - to be worth it to pick up something more
09:27 - special where you can actually build you
09:29 - know more real production applications
09:31 - or stuff that's going to be better
09:32 - performing than what you might do with
09:34 - python there's a whole bunch of reasons
09:36 - here python is also a very slow
09:38 - programming language and I could go on
09:40 - and on on why you should and why you
09:41 - shouldn't Learn Python but I wanted to
09:43 - try to give you both perspectives here
09:45 - before I now move into the next section
09:47 - where I talk to you about what I would
09:48 - learn if you're not going to Learn
09:50 - Python
09:55 - foreign so let's say at this point
09:58 - you've decided that you're not going to
09:59 - be picking up python I'm not going to
10:01 - tell you that's the right or wrong
10:02 - decision depends on what you want to do
10:04 - and what field you're going to be
10:05 - getting into or what you're interested
10:07 - in again to recap if you're a beginner
10:09 - I'd probably go with python learn that
10:11 - first build up some confidence if you're
10:12 - a bit more experienced or you're someone
10:14 - who already knows what field you want to
10:15 - go into directly then I would pick up
10:17 - maybe a different language regardless if
10:20 - you're not going to be learning python
10:21 - here are the languages I would recommend
10:22 - in 2023 these are ones that I'm
10:25 - personally learning and I'll go through
10:26 - a kind of a brief rationale for each so
10:29 - first I might recommend doing some
10:30 - blockchain and web 3 development now I
10:32 - know that market is kind of Tanked just
10:34 - a lot lower than it was before but I
10:36 - still think that this is going to be the
10:38 - future of programming and of the
10:40 - internet and there is still a lot of
10:41 - money in this space and a lot of people
10:43 - hiring it's actually very difficult to
10:45 - find web3 Engineers I work with a few
10:47 - web 3 companies and they're constantly
10:49 - looking for talent sometimes they're
10:50 - even hiring people that don't know any
10:52 - web 3 skills and then training them and
10:54 - paying them on the job if you want to
10:56 - learn that I do have a blockchain expert
10:58 - course I'll link that in the description
11:00 - you can learn everything you need to
11:01 - know about web3 and blockchain
11:03 - technology so that's one thing I might
11:04 - consider beyond that I would probably
11:06 - learn a language like JavaScript
11:08 - JavaScript is again a more General
11:10 - language but it's really good
11:11 - specifically for web development so it's
11:14 - a relatively easy language to learn kind
11:16 - of similar to python but it's really
11:18 - good for building front-end user
11:19 - interfaces for building websites even
11:21 - for working on the back end sometimes as
11:23 - well if you want to do it like that you
11:25 - have options like react native view
11:28 - angular react there's all kinds of
11:30 - different Frameworks you can use with it
11:31 - and it's super high in demand it's
11:33 - typically kind of tied or similar
11:35 - placing with python in terms of the most
11:37 - popular programming languages so I don't
11:39 - think you'd be poorly served by learning
11:41 - JavaScript especially if you want to get
11:43 - into web development it's pretty much a
11:45 - must if you want to get into the web
11:46 - development space continuing I might
11:48 - recommend something like go go is a
11:51 - newer and more modern programming
11:52 - language also referred to as golang it's
11:55 - a language that I personally really like
11:56 - kind of combines the performance of a
11:58 - language like C plus plus with the
12:01 - Simplicity and kind of speed to write of
12:04 - a language like python so if you do like
12:06 - python you like the style of writing
12:08 - python code but you want something maybe
12:09 - a bit more Enterprise ready a bit more
12:12 - performant than I look at go and that is
12:14 - taught in my programming expert course
12:16 - now lastly I'd say you might want to
12:18 - consider learning something like rust I
12:20 - don't have a ton of experience in this
12:22 - language but I did work on it a little
12:24 - bit and posted kind of like a mini
12:25 - series on the channel for it a lot of
12:27 - you guys really seem to like the
12:29 - language it's growing rapidly in
12:30 - popularity there's a ton of demand for
12:32 - rust developers and even though it's not
12:34 - the most popular language out there I
12:37 - think that in a few years it might be
12:38 - there and it's something worth taking a
12:40 - look at because if you could learn it
12:42 - now and be one of the earlier rust
12:43 - developers I think you're going to have
12:45 - a lot of opportunity kind of in the next
12:47 - few years so those would be my
12:48 - recommendations here if you're not going
12:50 - to be learning python regardless I think
12:52 - you should still continue programming
12:54 - still improve your skills check out
12:55 - products I have like Pro programming
12:57 - expert and blockchain expert if you want
12:59 - a more kind of tailored way to do that
13:01 - obviously I do have hundreds of videos
13:02 - on this channel too that can help you
13:04 - learn those skills with that said I hope
13:06 - you enjoyed if you did make sure to
13:07 - leave a like subscribe the channel and I
13:09 - will see you in the next one
13:18 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

foreign brand new year and already there's a ton of stuff affecting the tech industry we've got tools like chat GPT all kinds of tech layoffs just the economy in general and if you're a software engineer or programmer you're rightfully probably a little bit worried and concerned and thinking about how you can best prepare for what may happen in the next 6 12 18 months Etc now I'm not here to worry you I think that if you're in the tech industry you're going to be completely fine really what I would be doing now is just working on your skills getting as good as you possibly can and proving to either your current employer that you're worth keeping around or to a new employer that you're worth taking on even though the hiring is kind of slowed down a little bit right now so kind of summary here don't be too concerned I think everything is going to be fine and what I'm going to do in this video is talk to you about python specifically and if I think you should be learning that in 2023 based on everything that's going on obviously you guys know this a python Focus Channel I'm sure many of you are beginners just getting into python fun and maybe you're a little bit scared with what's going on right now and wondering should I kind of be learning this should I keep going into this field and many of you are probably intermediate or Advanced python programmers and thinking about should I change languages should I diversify a bit and that's what I'm hopefully going to answer here specifically I'm going to tell you why I think you should learn python why I think you shouldn't Learn Python and then other languages I'd recommend if you're going to be moving away from the Python language with that said let's get into the video after a quick word from our sponsor before we get started I need to thank lenode for sponsoring this video I've been using and working with lenode for nearly three years now and they've consistently been my goto choice for hosting my applications and servers in fact right now I'm using the node to host the official Tech with Tim Discord bot a website multiple of my domains and a kubernetes cluster now lenode was just recently acquired by Akamai and as a part of this acquisition they're going to be adding more than a dozen new data centers around the world in the next year lenode makes it super easy to spin up servers with their one Click app Marketplace and have tons of written guides and YouTube videos on their channel to help you get started now if you're having any issues you can reach out to the 24 7 support team and actually talk with a real human being now the nodes pricing is simple with no hidden fees and full transparency and you can test out the node services for free by using the link in the description and claiming a 100.60 day credit for any new accounts it's been an absolute pleasure to work with lenode over the past few years and one last thank you to them for sponsoring this video foreign so just as a mini preface here before I get into the main points of the video if you're someone who's just getting into python you're just getting into software engineering I think you should still continue down this path this is definitely something that's going to give you a ton of opportunities it's a great skill to have in general even if you're not employed as like a programmer or a

it's very easy for your interviewer to read it and it has a lot of helpful like functions methods Etc that can save you quite a bit of time when you're doing a coding interview so something to consider doing a coding interview in Python I would say is way easier than doing it in like Java or C plus plus or csharp or something else that you may know personally I did all of my coding interviews in Python and even if someone doesn't know python since it's just such a simple language uh like kind of with the syntax of it it's very easy for them to read and understand what you're doing now going beyond that I will mention that python does have a ton of jobs typically python is going to be some kind of requirement or you're going to have to be at least familiar with the language and that's because it really is used everywhere and you're gonna find it in a lot of code bases even if it's not the core language for different scripts or kind of smaller aspects of the code code and a lot of employers want to know that you have some comfort and some familiarity with it so even though it's not always going to be the primary language you need to know to get a job it's typically some kind of prerequisite and there is a lot of just straight python jobs so with that said that's why I think you should learn python now let's talk about why you shouldn't Learn Python so why should you not Learn Python well there's many reasons here but most of them stem from the fact that python is a very general language now that's good in some instances but in this case it's bad because that means that python is not the best language for a lot of different specific tasks so for example you can make a game with python but it's not going to be the best performing game and you'd probably be better off using something like csharp and unity for example you can do let's say a mobile app with python but again you'd probably be better off using a native language like Swift or kotlin you can do something like a website with python or a backend with python but you might be better off using something like go or rust so you see that although python can be used for so many different things if you're going to be a specialist in one specific area a lot of times employers are going to look for someone who knows the best language or the best Frameworks in that area now that's not always the case there is a lot of just pure python jobs where companies use only python where they have their website or their game or whatever in Python on like I mentioned before but in a lot of other cases you have companies that may have python as a second or third language that you need to know and before that they want you to be a pro at whatever the main languages for the kind of domain or task that you're going to be completing so if you're going to be a game developer you probably want to know unity and C sharp if you're going to be a website designer you probably want to know JavaScript hopefully you get where I'm going here but since python is so General you lose out on a lot of really specific jobs and kind of tasks if that's the only thing that you know so that's the main reason why I wouldn't Learn Python or if I already know it I might transition into something else just to make myself a bit more wellrounded and have more experience in a specific Niche or more knowledge in a specific area so really the main point there is that python is more of a general language you're going to be more of a generalist with that whereas with another language you're typically going to be more of a specialist and maybe have some better prospects maybe some higher paying jobs or some more opportunity just because you know a language that maybe not not everyone knows whereas python kind of a lot of people know that and we consider themselves kind of fluent or competent in that area something worth considering going beyond that I will also mention that if python is currently the language that you know and you're good at python it's probably a good idea to Branch out and learn a second or third language rather than just kind of diving into becoming an expert in Python that's because again you've already picked up that General language and now it's going to be worth it to pick up something more special where you can actually build you know more real production applications or stuff that's going to be better performing than what you might do with python there's a whole bunch of reasons here python is also a very slow programming language and I could go on and on on why you should and why you shouldn't Learn Python but I wanted to try to give you both perspectives here before I now move into the next section where I talk to you about what I would learn if you're not going to Learn Python foreign so let's say at this point you've decided that you're not going to be picking up python I'm not going to tell you that's the right or wrong decision depends on what you want to do and what field you're going to be getting into or what you're interested in again to recap if you're a beginner I'd probably go with python learn that first build up some confidence if you're a bit more experienced or you're someone who already knows what field you want to go into directly then I would pick up maybe a different language regardless if you're not going to be learning python here are the languages I would recommend in 2023 these are ones that I'm personally learning and I'll go through a kind of a brief rationale for each so first I might recommend doing some blockchain and web 3 development now I know that market is kind of Tanked just a lot lower than it was before but I still think that this is going to be the future of programming and of the internet and there is still a lot of money in this space and a lot of people hiring it's actually very difficult to find web3 Engineers I work with a few web 3 companies and they're constantly looking for talent sometimes they're even hiring people that don't know any web 3 skills and then training them and paying them on the job if you want to learn that I do have a blockchain expert course I'll link that in the description you can learn everything you need to know about web3 and blockchain technology so that's one thing I might consider beyond that I would probably learn a language like JavaScript JavaScript is again a more General language but it's really good specifically for web development so it's a relatively easy language to learn kind of similar to python but it's really good for building frontend user interfaces for building websites even for working on the back end sometimes as well if you want to do it like that you have options like react native view angular react there's all kinds of different Frameworks you can use with it and it's super high in demand it's typically kind of tied or similar placing with python in terms of the most popular programming languages so I don't think you'd be poorly served by learning JavaScript especially if you want to get into web development it's pretty much a must if you want to get into the web development space continuing I might recommend something like go go is a newer and more modern programming language also referred to as golang it's a language that I personally really like kind of combines the performance of a language like C plus plus with the Simplicity and kind of speed to write of a language like python so if you do like python you like the style of writing python code but you want something maybe a bit more Enterprise ready a bit more performant than I look at go and that is taught in my programming expert course now lastly I'd say you might want to consider learning something like rust I don't have a ton of experience in this language but I did work on it a little bit and posted kind of like a mini series on the channel for it a lot of you guys really seem to like the language it's growing rapidly in popularity there's a ton of demand for rust developers and even though it's not the most popular language out there I think that in a few years it might be there and it's something worth taking a look at because if you could learn it now and be one of the earlier rust developers I think you're going to have a lot of opportunity kind of in the next few years so those would be my recommendations here if you're not going to be learning python regardless I think you should still continue programming still improve your skills check out products I have like Pro programming expert and blockchain expert if you want a more kind of tailored way to do that obviously I do have hundreds of videos on this channel too that can help you learn those skills with that said I hope you enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe the channel and I will see you in the next one
