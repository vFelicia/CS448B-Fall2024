00:08 - in this video i will share with you how
00:10 - to survive a computer science degree now
00:12 - computer science can be a difficult
00:14 - degree i know many people that struggle
00:16 - in this i know many people that change
00:17 - degrees or disciplines and actually
00:19 - dropped out of the program i myself
00:21 - actually did drop out of computer
00:23 - science about two years ago not because
00:25 - i had bad marks but because i wanted to
00:26 - pursue youtube business and a few other
00:28 - things that i was doing and at the time
00:30 - that i dropped out i had honors i had a
00:33 - 9.2 out of 10 gpa i believe that makes
00:35 - it around kind of a low to mid 80
00:38 - average and this was me pretty much
00:40 - doing no work in the degree and just
00:42 - barely getting by that's the great point
00:44 - that i was able to achieve by just
00:45 - really sitting back and relaxing now i
00:47 - don't say that to brag but to hopefully
00:49 - give myself some credibility here as i
00:51 - go through these tips i promise you that
00:53 - this degree does not need to be as hard
00:54 - as you're probably making it for
00:56 - yourself i'm hopefully going to share
00:57 - with you some ways to make it easier in
00:59 - this video so before we get into these
01:00 - tips i just want to ask you what you
01:02 - guys think of my new camera angle i just
01:04 - got a new camera so i've set it up here
01:06 - as kind of a side angle obviously i have
01:08 - my main camera as well do you guys like
01:10 - this one better this one does one of
01:12 - them look better than the other let me
01:13 - know in the comments and with that said
01:16 - let's get into the video after a quick

02:06 - in the description thanks again design
02:08 - now for sponsoring this video alright so
02:10 - let's dive into it with tip number one
02:12 - which is to learn on your own now i know
02:15 - this seems obvious but especially in a
02:17 - computer science degree you cannot rely
02:19 - on your professor or really anyone else
02:21 - to teach you the course content you need
02:23 - to learn it on your own and even if you
02:25 - do learn a bit from your professor or
02:27 - the tas or whoever is instructing you a
02:30 - majority of what you're actually going
02:31 - to need to know you're going to have to
02:32 - learn on your own and you're going to
02:33 - have to practice on your own so i just
02:35 - want to make this clear because a lot of
02:36 - people seem to think that they're going
02:38 - to get all of the knowledge they need by
02:40 - going to a bunch of lectures reading the
02:42 - textbook and just following the basic
02:44 - thing that most people do in other
02:46 - degrees most people that i know that are
02:48 - in like arts degrees or history degrees
02:50 - a majority of what they learn is from
02:52 - the lecture or from reading a textbook
02:54 - in computer science that's probably not
02:56 - how you're going to learn a lot of the
02:57 - content you're probably going to be
02:59 - watching videos like mine you're going
03:00 - to be going and searching stuff up on
03:02 - stack overflow you're going to be
03:03 - looking at code examples a lot of stuff
03:05 - you're going to learn is just not going
03:06 - to come from a lecture so you need to
03:08 - kind of change your perspective around
03:10 - okay my professor is going to teach this
03:11 - to me to i'm going to have to learn this
03:13 - on my own it's great if my professor
03:15 - helps me learn this that's how i kind of
03:17 - approached university okay this is the
03:19 - topic this is the curriculum all right
03:21 - i'm gonna have to figure out a way to
03:22 - learn this if the professor's good
03:24 - that's great but the chance they're
03:25 - gonna be good is pretty small at least
03:27 - from my experience and even if they are
03:29 - again they just don't teach a lot of the
03:30 - stuff that you need to know and it's
03:32 - really really difficult to teach
03:33 - programming especially in a lecture
03:35 - environment so hopefully this is coming
03:37 - through a bit but you need to learn a
03:39 - lot of stuff on your own for me by the
03:41 - time i was actually in my second year of
03:43 - university i only went to about 20 of my
03:46 - lectures i just stayed at home pretty
03:48 - much all day and studied on my own it
03:50 - was a much better use of my time to
03:52 - spend 30 or 45 minutes going through the
03:54 - same material that would be covered in
03:55 - the lecture i could then focus on what i
03:57 - found difficult rather than what other
03:59 - people found difficult and i just was
04:00 - much more efficient and learned a lot
04:02 - more when i did it on my own rather than
04:04 - relying on my professors alright so tip
04:07 - number two i know this is another basic
04:09 - one but this is to make friends now i
04:12 - know that everyone tells this to you
04:13 - that you've heard this a million times
04:15 - but it is very very important to have a
04:17 - few resources other than a professor
04:19 - that you can go to and ask for help ask
04:21 - for the homework ask when an assignment
04:23 - is due and just get some general
04:25 - information from the amount of time that
04:27 - my computer science friends saved me and
04:29 - that i was able to save them was just
04:31 - unbelievable because some of them were
04:33 - really good at this math topic and i was
04:35 - really good at the programming topic so
04:36 - we would exchange notes or we would help
04:38 - each other sometimes we even have you
04:39 - know a 20-minute tutoring session where
04:41 - i would teach them something they would
04:43 - teach me something those are the kind of
04:44 - friends you want to look for where you
04:46 - can get some benefit from them and they
04:47 - can give an equal benefit to you then
04:49 - alternatively you already know who
04:51 - you're going to be partners with or in a
04:53 - group with whenever something like that
04:55 - comes up you don't have to deal with
04:56 - kind of the horrible gamble of getting a
04:58 - really bad teammate or someone who's
05:00 - just not going to show up or doesn't do
05:02 - any work you already know who you're
05:04 - going to be working with and it just
05:05 - makes everything a lot easier and
05:07 - honestly a lot more enjoyable as well a
05:09 - lot of times i didn't want to study for
05:11 - something i didn't want to be writing
05:12 - this code but i knew that my teammate
05:14 - depended on me or i had agreed with my
05:16 - friend that he was going to do this
05:17 - portion of the homework and i was going
05:18 - to do the other portion of the homework
05:19 - so i had to get the stuff done because
05:21 - he was relying on me and i was relying
05:23 - on him and it kind of forced us to do a
05:25 - bit more work and just made it a bit
05:26 - more fun as well we're kind of chatting
05:28 - along the way we're in a discord call
05:29 - etc so i would highly encourage you to
05:31 - try to make a few friends it's not that
05:34 - difficult to do everyone in these
05:35 - courses wants someone else to talk to or
05:38 - to get some help with a specific topic
05:40 - or exchange notes etc so just strike up
05:43 - a conversation ask someone what laptop
05:45 - they have that's the easiest way that i
05:46 - would make friends and say oh what you
05:48 - know what computer is that is that brand
05:49 - new and then all of a sudden you know
05:50 - all the nerds in the class are talking
05:52 - about it and we've just made a few
05:53 - friends moving on to the next tip
05:55 - alright so tip number three is to be
05:57 - extremely pragmatic with your time now
05:59 - i've talked about this in a lot of
06:01 - videos but i have to say it here because
06:02 - it's just super important you need to
06:04 - make sure that you are evaluating your
06:06 - time and you understand how much time
06:08 - you're putting into something and what
06:10 - you're getting out from that task so
06:12 - when it comes to studying or trying to
06:15 - complete a project or an assignment etc
06:17 - you have to really ask yourself is my x
06:20 - number of hours giving me a sufficient
06:22 - reward for me to justify actually
06:24 - putting in that many hours now the
06:26 - example i always use is going to
06:27 - lectures for a lot of people an hour and
06:29 - a half in a lecture is worth their time
06:31 - they're going to learn something from
06:32 - that lecture and it's going to be better
06:33 - than if they were to sit at home and
06:34 - play video games because they know if
06:36 - they don't go to the lecture they're not
06:37 - going to study for me i know i have the
06:39 - discipline to study on my own so it was
06:41 - not worth an hour and a half for me to
06:43 - go to a lecture instead i would learn
06:45 - the same content on my own and usually
06:47 - half the time or only 30 minutes so now
06:49 - i can kind of do three or four lectures
06:51 - in the span of two hours two and a half
06:53 - hours at home rather than my whole day
06:55 - being spent out in a lecture hall where
06:57 - i can't do other types of work where i
06:59 - can't film a youtube video or i can't do
07:01 - other tasks that i want to complete in
07:03 - the day so you just have to be very
07:04 - careful where you are putting your time
07:07 - not just in computer science but in
07:08 - other tasks as well you have to ask
07:10 - yourself what am i getting back from
07:12 - that now another example i like to use
07:14 - is rewriting notes i know a lot of
07:16 - people that do this and my theory behind
07:18 - why people do tasks like this is because
07:21 - it makes them feel productive and it's a
07:23 - relatively simple thing to do so it's
07:25 - pretty hard to go and learn a new topic
07:27 - on your own or to go do a ton of
07:29 - practice questions or write a practice
07:31 - exam that's a more mentally stimulating
07:33 - or challenging task whereas reading a
07:36 - textbook or rewriting notes feels like
07:38 - you're getting a lot done because you're
07:39 - writing you know seven or eight pages of
07:41 - the same notes you've already written
07:42 - but are you really getting that much out
07:44 - of that task for some people they might
07:46 - be but for me it would never be worth it
07:48 - to rewrite a note i've never done that
07:50 - and i will never do that i can promise
07:52 - you right now because it doesn't help me
07:54 - even though i would think you know it
07:55 - give me some more retention i think i'm
07:57 - going to learn a lot better if i really
07:59 - understand the topic well and if i go
08:01 - look at multiple resources or hear
08:03 - multiple people that are explaining it
08:04 - in different ways or i do practice
08:06 - questions and actually simulate what
08:08 - it's going to be like in an exam or in a
08:10 - test that's what works for me you have
08:12 - to figure out what works for you but
08:13 - just be very careful where you're
08:15 - putting your time if you're getting an
08:17 - adequate reward back for that time so
08:19 - moving on here to tip number four is to
08:21 - take advantage of three marks what i
08:24 - mean by this is that any mark that is
08:26 - relatively easy to obtain so like an
08:28 - attendance mark something like
08:30 - completing a lab doing an assignment
08:32 - maybe doing a small project sometimes
08:34 - large projects can be difficult or maybe
08:36 - you're not going to get 100 on them but
08:38 - anything that's a pretty simple thing
08:40 - for you to do that really just requires
08:42 - a bit of effort and a bit of time but
08:43 - it's gonna give you five percent ten
08:45 - percent two percent whatever it is
08:46 - towards your mark you absolutely need to
08:49 - do that uh because that's just gonna
08:51 - make it way easier on yourself when you
08:53 - come to the final exam i saw so many
08:56 - people that just didn't do any of the
08:57 - assignments didn't do any of the labs
08:59 - and now all of a sudden they get to the
09:00 - final exam which is worth 50 percent of
09:02 - their mark and if they don't get a 90 on
09:04 - the final exam they're going to fail the
09:06 - course or if they don't get a 75 they're
09:08 - gonna fail that puts an immense amount
09:10 - of pressure on them in my opinion that
09:12 - almost always makes them perform worse
09:14 - than if they didn't have the pressure
09:15 - and they can kind of chill a little bit
09:17 - and it just really is not a good
09:19 - scenario to be in where you're at the
09:21 - end of the course and now all of a
09:22 - sudden your entire grade is riding on a
09:24 - final exam
09:25 - now you switch right to the person who
09:28 - did all the assignments did all of the
09:29 - project earned all of these free marks
09:31 - by putting in a little bit of effort now
09:33 - they're at the end of the course and
09:34 - they only need a 33 on the exam to pass
09:36 - the course i know a lot of exams you
09:38 - need to get 50 but even if that's the
09:40 - minimum they only need to get 50 on the
09:42 - exam to pass the course or to get a
09:44 - decent grade i was in a lot of scenarios
09:47 - when i was writing final exams where the
09:49 - worst possible grade i was going to get
09:50 - in the course would be something
09:52 - realistically like an 80 because i know
09:54 - i'm going to get 50 or 60 on the exam i
09:56 - know i'm going to study that much so as
09:58 - long as i do that i'm locking in an 80
10:00 - in this course right that's the scenario
10:02 - you want to be in makes it way easier
10:04 - for yourself reduces a lot of stress and
10:06 - again why wouldn't you take these free
10:08 - marks why would you wait until the end
10:10 - where you're getting quizzed on all of
10:11 - the content you're going to have to
10:12 - spend countless hours studying you just
10:14 - put a ton of pressure on yourself and
10:16 - now you're really stressed out and
10:18 - worried about the final exam and you
10:19 - probably have four other final exams
10:21 - that you've done the same thing so just
10:23 - balance your workload out throughout the
10:24 - year spend a few hours each week earning
10:26 - these free marks then you can chill at
10:28 - the end of the year and you know you're
10:29 - going to be fine no matter what happens
10:31 - and you can study a little bit rather
10:33 - than a lot for the final or for the
10:34 - midterm or whatever it's going to end up
10:36 - being so last point here is to balance
10:38 - your workload now i know you've heard
10:40 - this before but it's important to be
10:41 - reminded and kind of get a fresh
10:43 - perspective so you can remember why this
10:45 - is so important so for me i have this
10:47 - general kind of philosophy in life that
10:49 - i would rather work a few hours every
10:51 - day than work like three or four 10 or
10:54 - 12 hour days each week i would much
10:56 - rather do a bunch of six hour days than
10:58 - do like three 14 hour days right however
11:02 - in university i find that this is kind
11:04 - of flipped for most people they would
11:05 - rather have like three days off and then
11:07 - do like four ten hour days as opposed to
11:10 - just spending maybe four or five hours
11:11 - every single day doing some work now i
11:13 - don't know if my math adds up adds up
11:15 - there sorry but you get the point so for
11:17 - me i always like to spread out my tasks
11:19 - kind of create a schedule for a week or
11:21 - two weeks in advance and say i'm gonna
11:23 - get this done today this done tomorrow
11:25 - i'm gonna do this and this that day and
11:27 - give myself a manageable amount of work
11:29 - to handle every single day now if
11:31 - there's a scenario where i don't finish
11:33 - something that's okay because it's a
11:34 - small task i can carry it to the next
11:36 - day and i'm not building up this massive
11:38 - amount of work that i'm just like oh i'm
11:40 - gonna spend saturday all day and sunday
11:42 - all day doing this i don't want to do
11:44 - that i feel miserable when i have to do
11:46 - that amount of work and it's just really
11:47 - stressful because now you're in a
11:48 - scenario where you can't even afford to
11:50 - take an hour break you can't even afford
11:52 - to go out with your friends if some plan
11:54 - comes up that you want to be a part of
11:55 - you're just in this like locked in place
11:57 - where you have to do all of this work or
11:59 - you don't do it and then you lose all of
12:01 - the marks right and in university i
12:03 - lived with a bunch of guys i saw a bunch
12:04 - of people i knew many people in
12:05 - university and this is what almost all
12:08 - of them did they did not balance any of
12:10 - their work they just cranked it all out
12:12 - on like the weekend or thursday or a
12:14 - wednesday um you know they spent 16 hour
12:16 - nights doing stuff or
12:18 - cramming for exams and i saw how
12:20 - stressed they were how much of a toll
12:22 - this took on them mentally whereas me i
12:24 - was just sitting there chill oh it's
12:25 - night for the exam i don't really need
12:27 - to study that's okay i've been doing it
12:28 - for the past two weeks oh you guys want
12:30 - to go out yeah i'll come out with you
12:31 - that's fine i don't have to do anything
12:32 - because i've already done a lot of my
12:34 - work or if i don't do it it's fine i can
12:36 - complete it tomorrow i'll just add an
12:37 - extra hour to my day rather than
12:39 - spending you know 20 hours doing a bunch
12:41 - of work so hopefully this is resonating
12:42 - a little bit just a much better head
12:45 - space to be in when you slowly do stuff
12:47 - as opposed to let it all build up and
12:49 - try to finish it in one day i also find
12:51 - you do a lot better work when you spend
12:53 - a few hours per day as opposed to just
12:55 - you know these marathons of trying to
12:56 - get a ton of stuff done
12:58 - so with that said i think i'm gonna wrap
13:00 - up the video here i hope you guys found
13:02 - this helpful hopefully some of this
13:03 - resonated with you and can get you some
13:05 - better grades in computer science or
13:06 - make it a little bit more manageable let
13:08 - me know what you thought in the comments
13:09 - down below and i will see you in another
13:11 - youtube video
13:14 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

in this video i will share with you how to survive a computer science degree now computer science can be a difficult degree i know many people that struggle in this i know many people that change degrees or disciplines and actually dropped out of the program i myself actually did drop out of computer science about two years ago not because i had bad marks but because i wanted to pursue youtube business and a few other things that i was doing and at the time that i dropped out i had honors i had a 9.2 out of 10 gpa i believe that makes it around kind of a low to mid 80 average and this was me pretty much doing no work in the degree and just barely getting by that's the great point that i was able to achieve by just really sitting back and relaxing now i don't say that to brag but to hopefully give myself some credibility here as i go through these tips i promise you that this degree does not need to be as hard as you're probably making it for yourself i'm hopefully going to share with you some ways to make it easier in this video so before we get into these tips i just want to ask you what you guys think of my new camera angle i just got a new camera so i've set it up here as kind of a side angle obviously i have my main camera as well do you guys like this one better this one does one of them look better than the other let me know in the comments and with that said let's get into the video after a quick word from our sponsor before we get started i need to thank sign now for sponsoring this video sign now lets you sign documents online generate agreements negotiate

api trial today and get 250 free signature invites by clicking the link in the description thanks again design now for sponsoring this video alright so let's dive into it with tip number one which is to learn on your own now i know this seems obvious but especially in a computer science degree you cannot rely on your professor or really anyone else to teach you the course content you need to learn it on your own and even if you do learn a bit from your professor or the tas or whoever is instructing you a majority of what you're actually going to need to know you're going to have to learn on your own and you're going to have to practice on your own so i just want to make this clear because a lot of people seem to think that they're going to get all of the knowledge they need by going to a bunch of lectures reading the textbook and just following the basic thing that most people do in other degrees most people that i know that are in like arts degrees or history degrees a majority of what they learn is from the lecture or from reading a textbook in computer science that's probably not how you're going to learn a lot of the content you're probably going to be watching videos like mine you're going to be going and searching stuff up on stack overflow you're going to be looking at code examples a lot of stuff you're going to learn is just not going to come from a lecture so you need to kind of change your perspective around okay my professor is going to teach this to me to i'm going to have to learn this on my own it's great if my professor helps me learn this that's how i kind of approached university okay this is the topic this is the curriculum all right i'm gonna have to figure out a way to learn this if the professor's good that's great but the chance they're gonna be good is pretty small at least from my experience and even if they are again they just don't teach a lot of the stuff that you need to know and it's really really difficult to teach programming especially in a lecture environment so hopefully this is coming through a bit but you need to learn a lot of stuff on your own for me by the time i was actually in my second year of university i only went to about 20 of my lectures i just stayed at home pretty much all day and studied on my own it was a much better use of my time to spend 30 or 45 minutes going through the same material that would be covered in the lecture i could then focus on what i found difficult rather than what other people found difficult and i just was much more efficient and learned a lot more when i did it on my own rather than relying on my professors alright so tip number two i know this is another basic one but this is to make friends now i know that everyone tells this to you that you've heard this a million times but it is very very important to have a few resources other than a professor that you can go to and ask for help ask for the homework ask when an assignment is due and just get some general information from the amount of time that my computer science friends saved me and that i was able to save them was just unbelievable because some of them were really good at this math topic and i was really good at the programming topic so we would exchange notes or we would help each other sometimes we even have you know a 20minute tutoring session where i would teach them something they would teach me something those are the kind of friends you want to look for where you can get some benefit from them and they can give an equal benefit to you then alternatively you already know who you're going to be partners with or in a group with whenever something like that comes up you don't have to deal with kind of the horrible gamble of getting a really bad teammate or someone who's just not going to show up or doesn't do any work you already know who you're going to be working with and it just makes everything a lot easier and honestly a lot more enjoyable as well a lot of times i didn't want to study for something i didn't want to be writing this code but i knew that my teammate depended on me or i had agreed with my friend that he was going to do this portion of the homework and i was going to do the other portion of the homework so i had to get the stuff done because he was relying on me and i was relying on him and it kind of forced us to do a bit more work and just made it a bit more fun as well we're kind of chatting along the way we're in a discord call etc so i would highly encourage you to try to make a few friends it's not that difficult to do everyone in these courses wants someone else to talk to or to get some help with a specific topic or exchange notes etc so just strike up a conversation ask someone what laptop they have that's the easiest way that i would make friends and say oh what you know what computer is that is that brand new and then all of a sudden you know all the nerds in the class are talking about it and we've just made a few friends moving on to the next tip alright so tip number three is to be extremely pragmatic with your time now i've talked about this in a lot of videos but i have to say it here because it's just super important you need to make sure that you are evaluating your time and you understand how much time you're putting into something and what you're getting out from that task so when it comes to studying or trying to complete a project or an assignment etc you have to really ask yourself is my x number of hours giving me a sufficient reward for me to justify actually putting in that many hours now the example i always use is going to lectures for a lot of people an hour and a half in a lecture is worth their time they're going to learn something from that lecture and it's going to be better than if they were to sit at home and play video games because they know if they don't go to the lecture they're not going to study for me i know i have the discipline to study on my own so it was not worth an hour and a half for me to go to a lecture instead i would learn the same content on my own and usually half the time or only 30 minutes so now i can kind of do three or four lectures in the span of two hours two and a half hours at home rather than my whole day being spent out in a lecture hall where i can't do other types of work where i can't film a youtube video or i can't do other tasks that i want to complete in the day so you just have to be very careful where you are putting your time not just in computer science but in other tasks as well you have to ask yourself what am i getting back from that now another example i like to use is rewriting notes i know a lot of people that do this and my theory behind why people do tasks like this is because it makes them feel productive and it's a relatively simple thing to do so it's pretty hard to go and learn a new topic on your own or to go do a ton of practice questions or write a practice exam that's a more mentally stimulating or challenging task whereas reading a textbook or rewriting notes feels like you're getting a lot done because you're writing you know seven or eight pages of the same notes you've already written but are you really getting that much out of that task for some people they might be but for me it would never be worth it to rewrite a note i've never done that and i will never do that i can promise you right now because it doesn't help me even though i would think you know it give me some more retention i think i'm going to learn a lot better if i really understand the topic well and if i go look at multiple resources or hear multiple people that are explaining it in different ways or i do practice questions and actually simulate what it's going to be like in an exam or in a test that's what works for me you have to figure out what works for you but just be very careful where you're putting your time if you're getting an adequate reward back for that time so moving on here to tip number four is to take advantage of three marks what i mean by this is that any mark that is relatively easy to obtain so like an attendance mark something like completing a lab doing an assignment maybe doing a small project sometimes large projects can be difficult or maybe you're not going to get 100 on them but anything that's a pretty simple thing for you to do that really just requires a bit of effort and a bit of time but it's gonna give you five percent ten percent two percent whatever it is towards your mark you absolutely need to do that uh because that's just gonna make it way easier on yourself when you come to the final exam i saw so many people that just didn't do any of the assignments didn't do any of the labs and now all of a sudden they get to the final exam which is worth 50 percent of their mark and if they don't get a 90 on the final exam they're going to fail the course or if they don't get a 75 they're gonna fail that puts an immense amount of pressure on them in my opinion that almost always makes them perform worse than if they didn't have the pressure and they can kind of chill a little bit and it just really is not a good scenario to be in where you're at the end of the course and now all of a sudden your entire grade is riding on a final exam now you switch right to the person who did all the assignments did all of the project earned all of these free marks by putting in a little bit of effort now they're at the end of the course and they only need a 33 on the exam to pass the course i know a lot of exams you need to get 50 but even if that's the minimum they only need to get 50 on the exam to pass the course or to get a decent grade i was in a lot of scenarios when i was writing final exams where the worst possible grade i was going to get in the course would be something realistically like an 80 because i know i'm going to get 50 or 60 on the exam i know i'm going to study that much so as long as i do that i'm locking in an 80 in this course right that's the scenario you want to be in makes it way easier for yourself reduces a lot of stress and again why wouldn't you take these free marks why would you wait until the end where you're getting quizzed on all of the content you're going to have to spend countless hours studying you just put a ton of pressure on yourself and now you're really stressed out and worried about the final exam and you probably have four other final exams that you've done the same thing so just balance your workload out throughout the year spend a few hours each week earning these free marks then you can chill at the end of the year and you know you're going to be fine no matter what happens and you can study a little bit rather than a lot for the final or for the midterm or whatever it's going to end up being so last point here is to balance your workload now i know you've heard this before but it's important to be reminded and kind of get a fresh perspective so you can remember why this is so important so for me i have this general kind of philosophy in life that i would rather work a few hours every day than work like three or four 10 or 12 hour days each week i would much rather do a bunch of six hour days than do like three 14 hour days right however in university i find that this is kind of flipped for most people they would rather have like three days off and then do like four ten hour days as opposed to just spending maybe four or five hours every single day doing some work now i don't know if my math adds up adds up there sorry but you get the point so for me i always like to spread out my tasks kind of create a schedule for a week or two weeks in advance and say i'm gonna get this done today this done tomorrow i'm gonna do this and this that day and give myself a manageable amount of work to handle every single day now if there's a scenario where i don't finish something that's okay because it's a small task i can carry it to the next day and i'm not building up this massive amount of work that i'm just like oh i'm gonna spend saturday all day and sunday all day doing this i don't want to do that i feel miserable when i have to do that amount of work and it's just really stressful because now you're in a scenario where you can't even afford to take an hour break you can't even afford to go out with your friends if some plan comes up that you want to be a part of you're just in this like locked in place where you have to do all of this work or you don't do it and then you lose all of the marks right and in university i lived with a bunch of guys i saw a bunch of people i knew many people in university and this is what almost all of them did they did not balance any of their work they just cranked it all out on like the weekend or thursday or a wednesday um you know they spent 16 hour nights doing stuff or cramming for exams and i saw how stressed they were how much of a toll this took on them mentally whereas me i was just sitting there chill oh it's night for the exam i don't really need to study that's okay i've been doing it for the past two weeks oh you guys want to go out yeah i'll come out with you that's fine i don't have to do anything because i've already done a lot of my work or if i don't do it it's fine i can complete it tomorrow i'll just add an extra hour to my day rather than spending you know 20 hours doing a bunch of work so hopefully this is resonating a little bit just a much better head space to be in when you slowly do stuff as opposed to let it all build up and try to finish it in one day i also find you do a lot better work when you spend a few hours per day as opposed to just you know these marathons of trying to get a ton of stuff done so with that said i think i'm gonna wrap up the video here i hope you guys found this helpful hopefully some of this resonated with you and can get you some better grades in computer science or make it a little bit more manageable let me know what you thought in the comments down below and i will see you in another youtube video
