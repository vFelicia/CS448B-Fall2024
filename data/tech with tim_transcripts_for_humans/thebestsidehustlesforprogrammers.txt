00:08 - I will share with you the best side
00:11 - hustles for programmers all of the
00:13 - activities on this list are low effort
00:15 - low barrier to entry and things that
00:18 - every single one of you can do
00:19 - regardless of your age or of your skill
00:21 - level now I say that confidently because
00:24 - I did these activities myself especially
00:26 - when I was 14 15 16 years old before I
00:30 - was making any kind of real money and I
00:31 - was in high school and just trying to
00:33 - make any kind of money I could I would
00:35 - do these activities for twenty dollars
00:37 - thirty dollars a hundred dollars
00:38 - whatever it may be and I would do all of
00:40 - them at the exact same time just to try
00:43 - to make as much money as I possibly
00:44 - could even before I was considered say
00:46 - good at programming or kind of an expert
00:49 - in a specific field so I know you can do
00:51 - these activities listen through the
00:52 - video I guarantee at least one of them
00:54 - will apply to you and with that said
00:56 - let's get into them
01:00 - all right so the first and probably
01:02 - easiest side hustle to get into is
01:04 - tutoring now tutoring is something that
01:06 - is so great to do as a programmer
01:08 - because not only does it make you better
01:10 - because you have to explain your thought
01:11 - process and really understand a topic
01:14 - before you can articulate it well to
01:15 - someone that you're teaching but it's
01:17 - something you can do at pretty much any
01:19 - level of skill so you can do it when
01:21 - you're a complete beginner you can do it
01:22 - when you're an intermediate you can do
01:23 - it when you're an expert and obviously
01:25 - you adjust your prices and your clients
01:27 - based on what skill level you have now a
01:29 - lot of you may be saying well I can't
01:30 - tutor I'm just a beginner program blah
01:32 - blah that's not true at all no matter
01:34 - what level you're at in your programming
01:36 - Journey there's always going to be
01:37 - someone who's kind of behind you and
01:39 - that could use a little bit of personal
01:40 - assistance and almost just encouragement
01:42 - to kind of get through a project or an
01:45 - assignment I'll tell you that in most
01:47 - tutoring sessions I've done really my
01:49 - value is that I'm encouraging someone
01:52 - I'm helping them I'm asking them to
01:53 - repeat themselves I'm kind of explaining
01:55 - something or breaking it down slower or
01:58 - more times than their teacher would have
01:59 - done I'm giving them that personal
02:01 - assistance or that personal help that
02:04 - they wouldn't get in a classroom and
02:05 - even if I'm not necessarily teaching
02:07 - them a specific topic it really helps
02:09 - them to get through an assignment or get
02:11 - through a project or even just
02:12 - understand the topic on their own so
02:15 - especially at a beginner level that's
02:16 - really where you can provide a lot of
02:18 - value and obviously as you tutor more
02:20 - and more you get better and better and
02:21 - you increase your prices based on who it
02:23 - is you're tutoring and what topics
02:25 - you're teaching so to give you a very
02:27 - concrete and real example of how you can
02:28 - do this if you're a student especially
02:30 - if you're in high school or if you're in
02:32 - University then what you can do is go to
02:34 - any Professor that you have or any
02:35 - teacher that you have assuming you do
02:37 - okay in their class then you can say Hey
02:39 - you know I'm looking to be a tutor do
02:41 - you have any references for me is there
02:43 - any students that are struggling for
02:44 - example that maybe could use some help
02:46 - in fact when I was in high school
02:48 - teachers would actually approach me
02:49 - because they know I did a bit of
02:50 - tutoring and they'd say hey I have this
02:52 - student do you mind you know doing an
02:53 - hour after school with them Etc back
02:55 - then I would have charged 20 an hour
02:57 - maybe I would have done it three or four
02:59 - times per week and if I I can make 80
03:01 - bucks a week that would be a fantastic
03:03 - week if I did two hour sessions oh
03:04 - that's great I just made 40 at 40 bucks
03:06 - for that session right then as I got
03:08 - older and better I charged 25 an hour
03:11 - thirty dollars an hour 35 dollars an
03:13 - hour and I just continued tutoring all
03:15 - the way from probably when I was 16 up
03:18 - until I was about 19 and then I got to
03:20 - the point where I didn't really want to
03:21 - tutor anymore but this is a really
03:23 - really good side hustle anybody can do
03:25 - this again it doesn't matter how good
03:26 - you are you can always find someone
03:28 - who's a little bit behind you in the
03:29 - journey and if you're teaching a more
03:30 - complex topic you can charge a lot of
03:33 - money for tutor if you're an expert in
03:35 - some specific area of programming and
03:37 - there's not a lot of tutors for that you
03:38 - can easily charge a hundred dollars an
03:40 - hour 150 an hour someone having an
03:43 - hour-long conversation with you and
03:44 - being able to pick your brain on so many
03:46 - different topics and learn pretty much
03:48 - everything you know about whatever
03:49 - they're asking is really valuable and
03:51 - you'd be surprised how much people are
03:53 - willing to pay for them so just wanted
03:54 - to throw that out there tutoring great
03:56 - side hustle I highly encourage you to do
03:58 - it not only does it make you a better
04:00 - community later you can make some extra
04:01 - cash and if you're really good and get
04:03 - to say a level like I'm at right now you
04:05 - can easily be charging 250 an hour for a
04:07 - tutoring session I know that seems
04:09 - insane but trust me it's happened I've
04:10 - been paid that countless times to tutor
04:13 - people
04:16 - so the next side hustle I have for you
04:18 - is consultant now this is a really
04:20 - really good side hustle because of how
04:22 - easy and lucrative it is however it is
04:25 - very challenging to get Consulting
04:27 - clients especially if you're not like a
04:29 - known presence right if you don't have
04:30 - some kind of social media you don't have
04:32 - a website you're not like an expert in a
04:34 - specific field so for me Consulting has
04:36 - been really really effective and a very
04:37 - easy way to make money because I have a
04:39 - massive online presence I understand
04:41 - many of you don't have that but I want
04:43 - to mention this because it's something
04:44 - to think about especially as you get
04:46 - better in a field a lot of people will
04:48 - be willing to pay you to access the
04:50 - knowledge that you have and all you have
04:52 - to do is sit there and just answer the
04:55 - questions that they have for you and
04:56 - that can be very very valuable to a
04:59 - client depending on what kind of project
05:00 - they're working on or why they're
05:02 - seeking your advice so I'll just tell
05:04 - you when I do a Consulting session
05:05 - depending on what I'm Consulting on I'll
05:07 - charge anywhere from 250 an hour to 500
05:10 - an hour obviously I'm not charging you
05:12 - know the 16 year old kid that kind of
05:14 - money if if he wants me to do a tutoring
05:15 - session or something but a company
05:17 - someone who's well established someone
05:19 - who's working on a big project that's
05:21 - very reasonable to charge that kind of
05:22 - money so what is Consulting let me just
05:24 - kind of give you a quick brief here
05:26 - really what Consulting is is someone
05:28 - paying you to access your knowledge they
05:31 - want to know what you know they want
05:33 - Direction they want to save time so that
05:35 - they don't have to go through the same
05:36 - research and struggle that you had to go
05:38 - through you are just kind of giving them
05:40 - the answer or at least pointing them in
05:41 - the right direction to save them
05:43 - countless amount of time now if you
05:45 - think about this from their perspective
05:46 - is it worth 500 a thousand dollars even
05:49 - five thousand dollars for them to sit
05:51 - with you and you to save them 40 hours
05:53 - of research or 40 hours of studying or
05:56 - whatever it may be in my opinion
05:57 - absolutely it's 100 worth that
05:59 - especially depending on what their time
06:01 - is worth so oftentimes people will
06:03 - consult with me and say hey I'm working
06:04 - on this project what tech stack do you
06:06 - think I should use what's going to be
06:08 - the simplest to get started with do you
06:10 - think this is the right approach how
06:11 - would you solve this problem what
06:13 - problems do you think I'm going to have
06:14 - if I go down this line and sometimes
06:17 - these people are programmers sometimes
06:19 - these people have no programming
06:20 - experience at all and they're looking to
06:22 - hire someone who can do this job so they
06:24 - say hey who should I be looking for
06:25 - who's the right person you know what is
06:28 - my criteria for this job I need this
06:31 - done who do I look for what do I need or
06:33 - I want to do this myself what's the
06:34 - fastest way for me to learn this
06:36 - technology those are the kind of
06:37 - Consulting sessions I usually have so
06:39 - anyways very lucrative you can make a
06:41 - lot of money Consulting I think it's a
06:42 - very very good side hustle I still do it
06:44 - today even though I don't do a ton of
06:46 - consulting or a ton of tutoring stuff
06:48 - but again it is more difficult but
06:50 - definitely something you want to think
06:51 - about if you're getting into that you
06:53 - know expert level status if you're
06:54 - getting really good at a specific topic
06:56 - people are always looking for domain
06:58 - experts or you know module experts or
07:01 - framework experts or language experts or
07:03 - whatever it may be
07:05 - foreign
07:07 - so the next best side hustle in my
07:10 - opinion is web development or redoing
07:12 - existing websites now today most people
07:15 - do have websites so it's probably going
07:16 - to be more taking a really old website
07:18 - or a website on an outdated platform
07:20 - moving it over to another platform you
07:22 - know adding some nice animations making
07:24 - it a bit smoother fixing the mobile
07:26 - usability whatever it's usually taking
07:29 - existing website modifying it making it
07:32 - look a little bit more modern and then
07:33 - getting paid to do that now there's a
07:35 - lot of ways to gain clients in this
07:37 - space and I will also mention that you
07:40 - don't have to be a programmer to do this
07:41 - most people that make websites nowadays
07:43 - are not programmers right they use Wix
07:45 - they use Squarespace right they use
07:47 - WordPress whatever the platform is so if
07:49 - you know a bit of programming that makes
07:50 - you so much more valuable because you
07:52 - can add custom touches to the website
07:54 - that other people might not be able to
07:55 - you can do a really cool CSS animation
07:57 - you can add some custom embedded code
07:59 - right you can go a little bit above and
08:01 - beyond and that obviously adds value
08:03 - what you do here to gain clients is you
08:05 - either cold email right maybe you put up
08:07 - a gig on Fiverr or upwork or you find a
08:10 - local business a place that you can call
08:11 - a place that you can drive to you say
08:14 - hey these are all the issues with your
08:15 - website let me fix them for you let me
08:18 - make you a new landing page you know I
08:19 - guarantee this is going to help Drive
08:21 - some more clients and all you need to do
08:23 - is get five people in the door 10 people
08:25 - in the door depending on what they're
08:27 - selling and you're gonna make back the
08:28 - 200 you charge or yeah that I charge you
08:31 - charged for the website you know what
08:33 - I'm saying so it's very easy if you
08:34 - present it in that way you say hey all
08:36 - you need is two people to come in here
08:37 - and buy a jacket or buy a shirt or
08:39 - whatever it is that you're selling and
08:40 - you've just made back all of the money
08:42 - that you paid me to redo your website do
08:44 - you think that having a killer website
08:46 - is gonna give you an extra five clients
08:48 - right absolutely it's very reasonable
08:50 - and as long as you're not charging a
08:51 - massive amount of money and you're doing
08:53 - something you know relatively
08:54 - straightforward then definitely worth it
08:56 - so think about it hopefully this is
08:57 - giving you some cool ideas I'm not
08:59 - saying this is easy to do this does come
09:01 - down to sales you know how you actually
09:03 - can been someone to pay you to redo a
09:05 - website for them or to make a website
09:06 - for them but if you can master that
09:08 - skill and you can get okay with being
09:10 - rejected by a lot of people then you
09:12 - will definitely make a fair amount of
09:13 - money doing some basic web development
09:16 - [Music]
09:18 - alright so my next side hustle idea is
09:21 - freelancing but not just any freelancing
09:23 - freelancing in an extremely specific
09:25 - Niche the only way to make money
09:27 - freelancing unless you're really an
09:29 - expert and you've been doing this a
09:30 - really long time is if you pick
09:32 - something extremely extremely specific
09:34 - you have to be one of the only people on
09:37 - the internet offering the service
09:39 - otherwise you're just not going to get
09:40 - clients now the reason this is the case
09:42 - is that there's so many people around
09:44 - the world especially people that are
09:46 - living in very low cost of living areas
09:48 - that can just undercut the crap out of
09:50 - you on prices when you're doing
09:51 - freelance right so if I were to offer a
09:54 - freelancing gig for 20 bucks as soon as
09:55 - I put that gig up there's going to be a
09:57 - hundred people that are offering it for
09:59 - five dollars right and for them five
10:01 - dollars in their country is going to
10:02 - equate to about 20 here in terms of what
10:04 - they could buy so obviously you're going
10:06 - to pay the guy who can do it for five
10:07 - bucks if he can do the same level of job
10:09 - so unless you're a really like an expert
10:12 - level person like you're someone who's
10:13 - charging a ton of money you're really
10:15 - good at what you do you're one of the
10:16 - only people that can accomplish a task
10:18 - then you can make a lot of money with
10:20 - General freelancing otherwise if you're
10:22 - just starting out you need to pick a
10:24 - specific topic now I've made a video on
10:25 - this in the past where what I used to do
10:27 - when I was freelancing is I would just
10:29 - do PI game where I would just make games
10:30 - in pie game believe it or not back then
10:32 - when I was doing that it was really
10:34 - really Niche and there was only let's
10:36 - say 10 other people right that were kind
10:37 - of doing the same thing that I was doing
10:39 - and I looked at all their gigs I had
10:40 - better examples and I just kind of out
10:42 - marketed them uh in terms of what I
10:44 - would do for pie game I also had my
10:46 - YouTube channel it was way smaller back
10:48 - then it was like a few thousand
10:49 - subscribers but obviously that helped me
10:51 - get a few clients now though there's
10:53 - like hundreds or thousands of people
10:54 - doing this because they watched my video
10:56 - and they copied my gig anyways if you
10:58 - want to make money in freelancing as I
11:00 - was saying you got to pick a specific
11:01 - Niche so maybe you're the pi QT expert
11:04 - right maybe you're really good at KIVI
11:06 - maybe you're really really good at a
11:08 - specific python library right maybe
11:10 - you're an absolute expert when it comes
11:12 - to excel automation right if you can be
11:15 - one of the best people in a specific
11:16 - field you will 100 get client clients
11:18 - and you can charge way more for what
11:21 - you're doing than if you're just like
11:22 - I'm gonna do a python script for you or
11:24 - I'll do your homework or I'll finish
11:25 - your project you have to be specific so
11:27 - I can't tell you what to learn or what
11:29 - to do but you just need to understand
11:30 - the strategy is as niche as possible and
11:33 - then of course you need to Market
11:34 - yourself right maybe you have a website
11:36 - maybe you have a portfolio maybe you do
11:37 - a little bit of paid advertising if you
11:39 - wanted to do this more at scale up to
11:41 - you how you want to try to obtain
11:42 - clients but I'm telling you you have to
11:44 - do it Niche and if you do it Niche you
11:46 - can make money when I was freelancing I
11:48 - made a few thousand bucks probably and
11:50 - just you know very kind of half-assed I
11:52 - wasn't doing this very seriously I would
11:53 - just kind of let my gig sit and every
11:55 - once in a while I'd get a client right
11:57 - I'd make 50 bucks I'd make 100 bucks and
11:59 - for me back then that was fantastic
12:01 - money
12:04 - all right so another side hustle idea
12:06 - here is to sell a programming course or
12:09 - to teach people programming on mass now
12:11 - this could be in like a live class right
12:13 - maybe you rent out a classroom in a
12:14 - university and you have I don't want to
12:16 - call it a seminar but maybe like a
12:17 - lesson where you're teaching you know 20
12:19 - people you're doing some exam prep
12:20 - something like that that's something
12:22 - I've thought about doing in the past and
12:23 - that a lot of people have done
12:24 - successfully you also could make a
12:26 - course right you could make a video
12:27 - course now if you make a video course
12:29 - this is hard to sell especially if it's
12:32 - not a very Niche or specific thing or if
12:34 - you don't have millions of followers
12:35 - like I do on YouTube the only reason I'm
12:38 - successful with my programming expert
12:39 - course so programmingexpert.io check it
12:42 - out is because I have this Mass
12:44 - following so I can actually advertise
12:46 - more General programming course however
12:48 - if you're not someone who's known if you
12:50 - have no presence that's probably going
12:51 - to be a little bit more difficult so
12:52 - maybe you do something in person maybe
12:54 - you're doing a group lesson maybe you're
12:56 - doing a video course but it's really
12:58 - really expensive and really specific and
13:00 - you only need to sell it to 10 people or
13:01 - 20 people to actually make money from it
13:03 - all kinds of different strategies and
13:05 - different routes you can go down but
13:07 - this can be the most lucrative depending
13:09 - on the course that you build the price
13:11 - of the course and the amount of people
13:12 - you sell to I'll tell you guys my course
13:14 - makes me the most amount of money from
13:16 - anything that I've done and again that's
13:18 - because I have so many people that
13:20 - follow me and of course is really good
13:21 - value it's very inexpensive and I can
13:23 - sell it to a ton of different people
13:25 - anyways that was uh let's say idea
13:28 - number five
13:31 - all right so now that we've mentioned
13:33 - that I'll leave you with one last bonus
13:35 - item here obviously this is very hard to
13:37 - do but this is to start your own company
13:39 - make your own business have your own app
13:41 - your own service your own website
13:43 - whatever it is you can make with your
13:45 - coding skills a lot of you know this is
13:47 - what I've now transitioned most of my
13:49 - time into I'm working for startup it's
13:51 - called velocity I'm the co-founder of
13:53 - that company I'm going to be talking
13:54 - more about that on this channel um kind
13:56 - of in the future giving you some startup
13:58 - blogs and information about how that's
14:00 - going so you can kind of see that
14:01 - journey in that process but this is
14:03 - obviously the most lucrative if this
14:05 - does well but the highest risk because
14:07 - it's a lot of time and it could very
14:09 - likely fail right the company I'm
14:10 - working for has a very high probability
14:12 - of failure however if it does well it's
14:14 - gonna do extremely well so it's really
14:16 - up to your risk tolerance and how much
14:18 - time you have but you could definitely
14:19 - work on some kind of side project some
14:22 - kind of side business you know spend an
14:23 - hour or two every day kind of putting in
14:25 - some time on it and at the end of the
14:26 - day even if it doesn't succeed you have
14:28 - a great resume project that you can put
14:30 - well on your resume show off to
14:32 - recruiters and hopefully that would help
14:33 - you get a high paying job if that's what
14:35 - you're gunning for so with that said I
14:37 - think I'm going to wrap up the video
14:38 - here hopefully you guys got some value
14:39 - from this I know that you can all do at
14:42 - least one of the things on this list you
14:43 - can all make a bit of money on the side
14:45 - I promise you it is possible you just
14:47 - have to go out there and start and try

foreign I will share with you the best side hustles for programmers all of the activities on this list are low effort low barrier to entry and things that every single one of you can do regardless of your age or of your skill level now I say that confidently because I did these activities myself especially when I was 14 15 16 years old before I was making any kind of real money and I was in high school and just trying to make any kind of money I could I would do these activities for twenty dollars thirty dollars a hundred dollars whatever it may be and I would do all of them at the exact same time just to try to make as much money as I possibly could even before I was considered say good at programming or kind of an expert in a specific field so I know you can do these activities listen through the video I guarantee at least one of them will apply to you and with that said let's get into them all right so the first and probably easiest side hustle to get into is tutoring now tutoring is something that is so great to do as a programmer because not only does it make you better because you have to explain your thought process and really understand a topic before you can articulate it well to someone that you're teaching but it's something you can do at pretty much any level of skill so you can do it when you're a complete beginner you can do it when you're an intermediate you can do it when you're an expert and obviously you adjust your prices and your clients based on what skill level you have now a lot of you may be saying well I can't tutor I'm just a beginner program blah blah that's not true at all no matter what level you're at in your programming Journey there's always going to be someone who's kind of behind you and that could use a little bit of personal assistance and almost just encouragement to kind of get through a project or an assignment I'll tell you that in most tutoring sessions I've done really my value is that I'm encouraging someone I'm helping them I'm asking them to repeat themselves I'm kind of explaining something or breaking it down slower or more times than their teacher would have done I'm giving them that personal assistance or that personal help that they wouldn't get in a classroom and even if I'm not necessarily teaching them a specific topic it really helps them to get through an assignment or get through a project or even just understand the topic on their own so especially at a beginner level that's really where you can provide a lot of value and obviously as you tutor more and more you get better and better and you increase your prices based on who it is you're tutoring and what topics you're teaching so to give you a very concrete and real example of how you can do this if you're a student especially if you're in high school or if you're in University then what you can do is go to any Professor that you have or any teacher that you have assuming you do okay in their class then you can say Hey you know I'm looking to be a tutor do you have any references for me is there any students that are struggling for example that maybe could use some help in fact when I was in high school teachers would actually approach me because they know I did a bit of tutoring and they'd say hey I have this student do you mind you know doing an hour after school with them Etc back then I would have charged 20 an hour maybe I would have done it three or four times per week and if I I can make 80 bucks a week that would be a fantastic week if I did two hour sessions oh that's great I just made 40 at 40 bucks for that session right then as I got older and better I charged 25 an hour thirty dollars an hour 35 dollars an hour and I just continued tutoring all the way from probably when I was 16 up until I was about 19 and then I got to the point where I didn't really want to tutor anymore but this is a really really good side hustle anybody can do this again it doesn't matter how good you are you can always find someone who's a little bit behind you in the journey and if you're teaching a more complex topic you can charge a lot of money for tutor if you're an expert in some specific area of programming and there's not a lot of tutors for that you can easily charge a hundred dollars an hour 150 an hour someone having an hourlong conversation with you and being able to pick your brain on so many different topics and learn pretty much everything you know about whatever they're asking is really valuable and you'd be surprised how much people are willing to pay for them so just wanted to throw that out there tutoring great side hustle I highly encourage you to do it not only does it make you a better community later you can make some extra cash and if you're really good and get to say a level like I'm at right now you can easily be charging 250 an hour for a tutoring session I know that seems insane but trust me it's happened I've been paid that countless times to tutor people so the next side hustle I have for you is consultant now this is a really really good side hustle because of how easy and lucrative it is however it is very challenging to get Consulting clients especially if you're not like a known presence right if you don't have some kind of social media you don't have a website you're not like an expert in a specific field so for me Consulting has been really really effective and a very easy way to make money because I have a massive online presence I understand many of you don't have that but I want to mention this because it's something to think about especially as you get better in a field a lot of people will be willing to pay you to access the knowledge that you have and all you have to do is sit there and just answer the questions that they have for you and that can be very very valuable to a client depending on what kind of project they're working on or why they're seeking your advice so I'll just tell you when I do a Consulting session depending on what I'm Consulting on I'll charge anywhere from 250 an hour to 500 an hour obviously I'm not charging you know the 16 year old kid that kind of money if if he wants me to do a tutoring session or something but a company someone who's well established someone who's working on a big project that's very reasonable to charge that kind of money so what is Consulting let me just kind of give you a quick brief here really what Consulting is is someone paying you to access your knowledge they want to know what you know they want Direction they want to save time so that they don't have to go through the same research and struggle that you had to go through you are just kind of giving them the answer or at least pointing them in the right direction to save them countless amount of time now if you think about this from their perspective is it worth 500 a thousand dollars even five thousand dollars for them to sit with you and you to save them 40 hours of research or 40 hours of studying or whatever it may be in my opinion absolutely it's 100 worth that especially depending on what their time is worth so oftentimes people will consult with me and say hey I'm working on this project what tech stack do you think I should use what's going to be the simplest to get started with do you think this is the right approach how would you solve this problem what problems do you think I'm going to have if I go down this line and sometimes these people are programmers sometimes these people have no programming experience at all and they're looking to hire someone who can do this job so they say hey who should I be looking for who's the right person you know what is my criteria for this job I need this done who do I look for what do I need or I want to do this myself what's the fastest way for me to learn this technology those are the kind of Consulting sessions I usually have so anyways very lucrative you can make a lot of money Consulting I think it's a very very good side hustle I still do it today even though I don't do a ton of consulting or a ton of tutoring stuff but again it is more difficult but definitely something you want to think about if you're getting into that you know expert level status if you're getting really good at a specific topic people are always looking for domain experts or you know module experts or framework experts or language experts or whatever it may be foreign so the next best side hustle in my opinion is web development or redoing existing websites now today most people do have websites so it's probably going to be more taking a really old website or a website on an outdated platform moving it over to another platform you know adding some nice animations making it a bit smoother fixing the mobile usability whatever it's usually taking existing website modifying it making it look a little bit more modern and then getting paid to do that now there's a lot of ways to gain clients in this space and I will also mention that you don't have to be a programmer to do this most people that make websites nowadays are not programmers right they use Wix they use Squarespace right they use WordPress whatever the platform is so if you know a bit of programming that makes you so much more valuable because you can add custom touches to the website that other people might not be able to you can do a really cool CSS animation you can add some custom embedded code right you can go a little bit above and beyond and that obviously adds value what you do here to gain clients is you either cold email right maybe you put up a gig on Fiverr or upwork or you find a local business a place that you can call a place that you can drive to you say hey these are all the issues with your website let me fix them for you let me make you a new landing page you know I guarantee this is going to help Drive some more clients and all you need to do is get five people in the door 10 people in the door depending on what they're selling and you're gonna make back the 200 you charge or yeah that I charge you charged for the website you know what I'm saying so it's very easy if you present it in that way you say hey all you need is two people to come in here and buy a jacket or buy a shirt or whatever it is that you're selling and you've just made back all of the money that you paid me to redo your website do you think that having a killer website is gonna give you an extra five clients right absolutely it's very reasonable and as long as you're not charging a massive amount of money and you're doing something you know relatively straightforward then definitely worth it so think about it hopefully this is giving you some cool ideas I'm not saying this is easy to do this does come down to sales you know how you actually can been someone to pay you to redo a website for them or to make a website for them but if you can master that skill and you can get okay with being rejected by a lot of people then you will definitely make a fair amount of money doing some basic web development alright so my next side hustle idea is freelancing but not just any freelancing freelancing in an extremely specific Niche the only way to make money freelancing unless you're really an expert and you've been doing this a really long time is if you pick something extremely extremely specific you have to be one of the only people on the internet offering the service otherwise you're just not going to get clients now the reason this is the case is that there's so many people around the world especially people that are living in very low cost of living areas that can just undercut the crap out of you on prices when you're doing freelance right so if I were to offer a freelancing gig for 20 bucks as soon as I put that gig up there's going to be a hundred people that are offering it for five dollars right and for them five dollars in their country is going to equate to about 20 here in terms of what they could buy so obviously you're going to pay the guy who can do it for five bucks if he can do the same level of job so unless you're a really like an expert level person like you're someone who's charging a ton of money you're really good at what you do you're one of the only people that can accomplish a task then you can make a lot of money with General freelancing otherwise if you're just starting out you need to pick a specific topic now I've made a video on this in the past where what I used to do when I was freelancing is I would just do PI game where I would just make games in pie game believe it or not back then when I was doing that it was really really Niche and there was only let's say 10 other people right that were kind of doing the same thing that I was doing and I looked at all their gigs I had better examples and I just kind of out marketed them uh in terms of what I would do for pie game I also had my YouTube channel it was way smaller back then it was like a few thousand subscribers but obviously that helped me get a few clients now though there's like hundreds or thousands of people doing this because they watched my video and they copied my gig anyways if you want to make money in freelancing as I was saying you got to pick a specific Niche so maybe you're the pi QT expert right maybe you're really good at KIVI maybe you're really really good at a specific python library right maybe you're an absolute expert when it comes to excel automation right if you can be one of the best people in a specific field you will 100 get client clients and you can charge way more for what you're doing than if you're just like I'm gonna do a python script for you or I'll do your homework or I'll finish your project you have to be specific so I can't tell you what to learn or what to do but you just need to understand the strategy is as niche as possible and then of course you need to Market yourself right maybe you have a website maybe you have a portfolio maybe you do a little bit of paid advertising if you wanted to do this more at scale up to you how you want to try to obtain clients but I'm telling you you have to do it Niche and if you do it Niche you can make money when I was freelancing I made a few thousand bucks probably and just you know very kind of halfassed I wasn't doing this very seriously I would just kind of let my gig sit and every once in a while I'd get a client right I'd make 50 bucks I'd make 100 bucks and for me back then that was fantastic money all right so another side hustle idea here is to sell a programming course or to teach people programming on mass now this could be in like a live class right maybe you rent out a classroom in a university and you have I don't want to call it a seminar but maybe like a lesson where you're teaching you know 20 people you're doing some exam prep something like that that's something I've thought about doing in the past and that a lot of people have done successfully you also could make a course right you could make a video course now if you make a video course this is hard to sell especially if it's not a very Niche or specific thing or if you don't have millions of followers like I do on YouTube the only reason I'm successful with my programming expert course so programmingexpert.io check it out is because I have this Mass following so I can actually advertise more General programming course however if you're not someone who's known if you have no presence that's probably going to be a little bit more difficult so maybe you do something in person maybe you're doing a group lesson maybe you're doing a video course but it's really really expensive and really specific and you only need to sell it to 10 people or 20 people to actually make money from it all kinds of different strategies and different routes you can go down but this can be the most lucrative depending on the course that you build the price of the course and the amount of people you sell to I'll tell you guys my course makes me the most amount of money from anything that I've done and again that's because I have so many people that follow me and of course is really good value it's very inexpensive and I can sell it to a ton of different people anyways that was uh let's say idea number five all right so now that we've mentioned that I'll leave you with one last bonus item here obviously this is very hard to do but this is to start your own company make your own business have your own app your own service your own website whatever it is you can make with your coding skills a lot of you know this is what I've now transitioned most of my time into I'm working for startup it's called velocity I'm the cofounder of that company I'm going to be talking more about that on this channel um kind of in the future giving you some startup blogs and information about how that's going so you can kind of see that journey in that process but this is obviously the most lucrative if this does well but the highest risk because it's a lot of time and it could very likely fail right the company I'm working for has a very high probability of failure however if it does well it's gonna do extremely well so it's really up to your risk tolerance and how much time you have but you could definitely work on some kind of side project some kind of side business you know spend an hour or two every day kind of putting in some time on it and at the end of the day even if it doesn't succeed you have a great resume project that you can put well on your resume show off to recruiters and hopefully that would help you get a high paying job if that's what you're gunning for so with that said I think I'm going to wrap up the video here hopefully you guys got some value from this I know that you can all do at least one of the things on this list you can all make a bit of money on the side I promise you it is possible you just have to go out there and start and try with that said thank you guys for watching hope you enjoyed and I will see you in another YouTube video thank you
