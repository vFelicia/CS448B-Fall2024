00:00 - hey guns and welcome back to another
00:02 - Kibby tutorial so in today's video I'm
00:04 - gonna be showing you how to create
00:05 - pop-up windows which is actually very
00:07 - useful and it's super simple to do this
00:09 - as well so I'm just gonna start and kind
00:11 - of build a very basic interface
00:13 - I like GUI and then we're gonna get to
00:15 - actually using those pop-ups putting
00:17 - them on the screen some of the different
00:18 - options how you can add different
00:19 - widgets to it and all that so
00:21 - essentially I have all these things
00:23 - imported we've talked about them before
00:24 - a widget object property label import
00:27 - float layout so I also need to just
00:28 - import pop-up so I'm going to do is
00:30 - Kavita uix top pop up and we'll import
00:34 - pop up like that now what I'll actually
00:37 - start by doing it just show you guys
00:38 - right away how to make the pop and then
00:40 - I'll work into how we can actually
00:41 - display it onto the screen and like
00:43 - trigger that event and whatnot so I'm
00:45 - gonna create a function I'm just gonna
00:46 - call this show underscore pop-up like
00:49 - this okay it doesn't need any parameters
00:52 - and all we're gonna do in here is we're
00:53 - gonna create a pop-up window and show it
00:57 - and that way whenever we want to create
00:58 - a pop-up all we have to do is just
01:00 - simply call this function and it'll do
01:02 - that for us so you could put this as a
01:04 - method Sapor inside your widget class or
01:07 - inside your my app I'm just gonna leave
01:09 - it as a function obviously feel free to
01:12 - do whatever you want so to create a
01:13 - pop-up what we need to do is need to
01:15 - have some content for that pop-up so
01:18 - actually that leads me do we need to
01:19 - create another class so I'm gonna create
01:20 - a class I'm just gonna call this P
01:22 - standing for pop-up and all I'm gonna do
01:25 - is pass in here and I'm just gonna come
01:27 - to my my dog f K V final sorry that's
01:29 - already empty and what I'm gonna do in
01:30 - here is I'm just going to define a few
01:32 - widgets that I want to go inside of my
01:35 - what do you call it my pop-up or whatnot
01:38 - so what I'm actually gonna do sir is go
01:39 - back here I'm getting sidetracked and
01:41 - I'm just gonna make this inherit from
01:43 - float layout because what I want my
01:45 - pop-up window to be is a float layout
01:47 - that contains a few different widgets so
01:50 - this is this to be nice you as I'll see
01:51 - how this works essentially we have a
01:52 - class P inherits from float layout and
01:55 - now we have P and what we're gonna do
01:56 - here is on a few widgets and since this
01:58 - inherits from float layout we can use
01:59 - the size pause and or what am I saying
02:02 - size pause size hint and pause hints
02:04 - that we've used before so let's just
02:06 - start off with a label I will just say
02:07 - the label has a text and the text will
02:11 - just say like you
02:12 - you pressed the button hello that okay
02:17 - and then we'll do size underscore hint
02:19 - and for size underscore hint it can be
02:21 - honestly whatever you want it does
02:22 - really matter I'm just gonna do 0.6 0.2
02:24 - and 4 pause underscore hints this one
02:27 - will be a bit different I want this to
02:28 - be at the top of the screen
02:30 - so we'll do X and we'll do 0.2 just so
02:33 - we get that centered and then we'll do
02:35 - why I should not why let's do top of one
02:39 - so we go right up to the top now I'll
02:41 - copy this I'm just going to do the same
02:42 - or a similar thing with a button
02:44 - so we'll just change this to B button
02:46 - and you guys can see how this works so
02:48 - the button instead of going for 0.6
02:51 - let's go 0.8
02:52 - let's go X 0.1 and we'll change this to
02:55 - Y and 0.1 so now if we actually use P it
03:00 - should have like a label up top and then
03:02 - a button slightly below it and that's
03:04 - all we need and obviously you guys know
03:05 - how to add things into like your classes
03:07 - and float layouts and whatnot okay so we
03:09 - have our float layout here we have
03:11 - widgets we'll do something that in a
03:13 - second but let's get into pop-up down so
03:15 - essentially the content for our pop-up
03:17 - is going to be P right so what we need
03:19 - to do is I'm just going to say show is
03:21 - equal to and we'll create a new instance
03:23 - of P and that's just so that we can use
03:25 - this in what we're gonna do in a second
03:27 - so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to
03:28 - say pop should we say let's just say
03:32 - pop-up window I don't want to name it
03:35 - the same thing as the class that's why
03:37 - I'm okay so pop-up window equals pop-up
03:40 - and then in here we have a few things we
03:42 - can use we can use first of all title
03:43 - now obviously the title is gonna be
03:45 - what's at the top of your box in this
03:46 - case I'm just gonna say pop-up window
03:49 - okay we have content now the content
03:53 - remember is gonna be equal to P because
03:55 - that's what we set here so say content
03:56 - is or not P it's show because that's
03:59 - where we're storing P and then what else
04:01 - do we have well we have a we can there's
04:02 - a bunch of other parameters that we can
04:04 - use as well but we're gonna use a size
04:06 - hint and pause hint as well so I believe
04:09 - actually it might just be size I gotta
04:11 - check no its size is size handicapped so
04:14 - size hint and the here I'm just gonna
04:16 - type none none because I don't want this
04:18 - to dynamically resize I want to just be
04:20 - equal to these same size no matter what
04:22 - so size hint equals sorry none none and
04:25 - then we're gonna do
04:26 - sighs for a static size is going to be
04:28 - equal to 400 400 now you can change the
04:32 - position as well but by default it's
04:34 - gonna come in the middle of the screen
04:35 - which is probably what you want so if
04:38 - you want to read the dog since you don't
04:39 - do that feel free but essentially this
04:40 - is what you usually will want to do now
04:43 - to actually show this window you don't
04:45 - have to add it to a widget or anything
04:47 - like that
04:47 - all you have to do is literally just do
04:48 - pop-up window dot show I want to say or
04:52 - is it dot huh let's see open that's what
04:55 - this sir I have it open on my other
04:57 - screen sighs forget ok so dot open so
04:59 - once you've created this pop-up window
05:00 - you have the content you've set the
05:02 - sizes here the reason we do this is just
05:05 - so that we override it with this like
05:07 - absolute size so it doesn't try to
05:09 - dynamically resize and then we just
05:11 - opening it up and it'll just go on top
05:13 - of whatever window we already have
05:14 - created which is really nice and saves
05:15 - us a lot of time now we have this pop-up
05:19 - window now but how do we actually
05:20 - trigger this and get it to run what what
05:22 - we need to do is create a widget inside
05:24 - of our widgets class ideally a button
05:27 - and when we press that button we're
05:28 - gonna trigger this function so first of
05:30 - all I'm just gonna say well we're
05:31 - already here in this widgets class I'm
05:33 - just gonna say define BTN okay and BTN
05:36 - will do this is just simply gonna call
05:39 - popup window so we'll just do this
05:41 - pop-up window don't know why that's not
05:45 - showing for me anyways this should work
05:48 - pop-up window Oh show underscore pop-up
05:51 - is what I called it my bad show
05:53 - underscore pop-up
05:56 - okay so now we're just going to call
05:58 - this function whenever this method is
06:01 - called so to call this method well first
06:03 - of all we need to create something for
06:04 - widgets so like we've done before we'll
06:06 - just do widgets and then in here we can
06:09 - just simply create a button and I'm not
06:11 - gonna worry about really sizing this or
06:12 - anything I'm just gonna simply make a
06:13 - button it'll say text and the text will
06:16 - just be equal to press me okay and then
06:20 - we'll say on underscore release all
06:23 - we're gonna do is gonna do route BTN and
06:25 - remember root is gonna call this widget
06:27 - class which just means it's gonna call
06:29 - this method okay
06:30 - awesome so let's run this and see if
06:32 - everything's working okay so you see a
06:34 - button we say press me and when we press
06:36 - press me it pops up a window that says
06:39 - pop-up when
06:39 - you press the button and then there is
06:41 - obviously another button in here that
06:43 - says you press the button now if you
06:45 - want to add more things to this you
06:46 - could go ahead and do that you know how
06:48 - to now that we've created this little
06:49 - class for it now to get out in this
06:51 - pop-up you just click anywhere else on
06:53 - the screen you can see it disappears and
06:55 - this is really nice and I don't know I
06:56 - think this pop-up looks pretty clean and
06:58 - you can really you can dynamically
06:59 - change the size and do a lot of things
07:01 - with it I think it's very useful um so
07:03 - anyway so that's gonna be it for this
07:04 - video if you guys enjoy please make sure
07:05 - you leave a like and subscribe and I
07:07 - will see you again in another one
07:09 - [Music]

called it my bad show underscore popup okay so now we're just going to call this function whenever this method is called so to call this method well first of all we need to create something for widgets so like we've done before we'll just do widgets and then in here we can just simply create a button and I'm not gonna worry about really sizing this or anything I'm just gonna simply make a

that you know how to now that we've created this little class for it now to get out in this popup you just click anywhere else on the screen you can see it disappears and this is really nice and I
