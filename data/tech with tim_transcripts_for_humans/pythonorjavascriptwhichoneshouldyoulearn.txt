With timestamps:

00:00 - python or JavaScript which should you
00:02 - learn let me break it down for you as
00:05 - simply as possible ultimately what's
00:07 - going to determine the language you pick
00:09 - comes down to what you want to build or
00:11 - what area of development you want to
00:12 - specialize in both languages are great
00:15 - choices but what they're best at differs
00:17 - quite a bit so let's start with what's
00:19 - the same for both languages they're both
00:21 - beginner friendly relatively easy to
00:24 - learn in extreme demand and can lead you
00:26 - quite quickly into a career in Tech
00:29 - either is a great choice to start with
00:31 - and if you're already learning one I'd
00:32 - recommend stick it out get the basics
00:35 - down and then you can easily switch to
00:36 - another language afterwards in fact most
00:39 - developers I know including myself will
00:41 - learn one of these languages first then
00:43 - very quickly after learn the other one
00:45 - they're great compliments to each other
00:47 - so if you're already learning JavaScript
00:48 - stick it out if you're already learning
00:50 - python stick it out and then later on
00:52 - you can very quickly pick up the other
00:54 - language now another thing you need to
00:56 - know is that both of these languages are
00:57 - dynamically typed now to put it simp
00:59 - simply what that means is they're a
01:01 - little bit more flexible to write code
01:02 - in but they may not be the best choice
01:04 - for really large applications or
01:07 - anything that's performance critical but
01:09 - what that does mean is that learning one
01:10 - of these languages is not going to teach
01:12 - you a drastically different set of
01:14 - features than the other one so rest
01:16 - assured if you pick JavaScript almost
01:18 - everything you know is probably going to
01:20 - apply to python same with python most of
01:22 - what you learn there is going to apply
01:24 - to JavaScript the main difference will
01:26 - be some specific syntax features that
01:28 - you can pick up pretty quick quickly so
01:30 - picking the wrong language is not a
01:32 - massive mistake and at the end of the
01:34 - day you just want to get started but
01:35 - I'll give you some information that can
01:36 - help you make that decision so now let's
01:38 - get into the main differences keeping in
01:40 - mind what I said before that you want to
01:42 - focus on the outcomes and the type of
01:44 - projects you can build so with
01:46 - JavaScript you're going to be working a
01:47 - lot more on the front end it's going to
01:49 - be a lot more Visual and you're going to
01:51 - be able to create user interfaces make
01:53 - websites and immediately just make more
01:55 - Visual and interactable applications
01:58 - compared to a language like python if
02:00 - you're someone who wants to land a job
02:02 - and you're looking at frontend developer
02:04 - positions or full stack developer
02:05 - positions JavaScript is 100% the
02:08 - language that you should be learning it
02:10 - very quickly allows you to interact with
02:12 - HTML and CSS and by learning JavaScript
02:15 - as a product of that you're probably
02:16 - going to learn a bit more about HTML CSS
02:19 - and front-end web development in general
02:22 - now to compare that with python Python's
02:24 - a lot more focused on the back end and
02:26 - with data it's really big for data
02:28 - analysis so if you're someone who's
02:30 - interested in AI automation machine
02:33 - learning backend web development
02:35 - automation tasks or scripting Python's
02:37 - going to be your go-to it's definitely
02:40 - not as easy to create front-end or
02:42 - visual applications with python however
02:44 - the tasks that I listed it's really
02:46 - really good at and you'll find it a
02:48 - little bit easier to make those type of
02:50 - applications with a language like python
02:52 - compared to something like JavaScript
02:54 - now at this point we definitely need to
02:55 - discuss Frameworks and libraries which
02:57 - kind of go hand inand with the language
02:59 - what you're learning when you're just
03:01 - starting out picking either python or
03:03 - JavaScript isn't going to make a huge
03:04 - difference the curriculum is going to be
03:06 - very similar you're going to be learning
03:08 - pretty much the same topics and the main
03:10 - thing that's going to differ is the
03:11 - syntax and really the way in which you
03:13 - write code but that's something you can
03:15 - learn pretty quickly and going between
03:17 - different languages you'll very easily
03:19 - pick up the differences in syntax the
03:21 - major differences are going to come when
03:22 - you want to actually start building out
03:24 - large applications and you'll realize
03:26 - you need to use some external tools now
03:28 - these are typically your referred to as
03:30 - Frameworks libraries or packages they
03:32 - all have kind of a slightly different
03:33 - meaning but in this case we'll group
03:35 - them together now each language that I
03:37 - mentioned here Python and JavaScript
03:39 - have a different set of very popular
03:41 - Frameworks and libraries that are used
03:43 - to create applications for example with
03:45 - JavaScript we have things like react
03:48 - view uh angular right these are really
03:51 - popular front-end web Frameworks that
03:52 - make it really easy to build large
03:54 - scalable applications and they're
03:56 - typically in demand as their own skill
03:59 - alongside ins JavaScript so if you want
04:01 - to be a front-end web developer you're
04:02 - probably going to need to know something
04:04 - like react and that means well you would
04:05 - have had to know JavaScript right to be
04:08 - able to work with react now with python
04:10 - we have popular Frameworks specifically
04:12 - for data science or for automation tasks
04:15 - so things like pandas numpy scikit learn
04:18 - we have uh natural language toolkits all
04:21 - of these types of things are really more
04:23 - ingrained in Python and they don't
04:24 - necessarily exist for JavaScript or if
04:27 - they do they're not quite as Specialized
04:29 - or as in demand so what this leads me to
04:31 - recommend is that if you already know
04:32 - the type of projects you want to build
04:34 - or the jobs you might be interested in
04:36 - go and look at the languages Frameworks
04:39 - Packages Etc that are being used for
04:41 - those projects or that are required for
04:43 - that job and then see the base language
04:45 - that's required to use those specific
04:47 - tools a lot of times you'll need to know
04:50 - JavaScript as a prerequisite to learn
04:52 - this framework or you'll need to know
04:53 - python to learn this package so that's
04:55 - where I would go and that's really
04:57 - what's going to be the major difference
04:58 - for you the tooling you have access to
05:01 - and the type of things that you can
05:02 - build now with all of that said both of
05:04 - these languages are still very general
05:07 - purpose knowing one of these languages
05:09 - allows you to build so many different
05:10 - types of applications and just because
05:12 - it's not the best at it doesn't mean you
05:14 - can't do it for example you can make an
05:16 - entire website using purely python and a
05:19 - little bit of HTML and CSS Now is it
05:22 - going to be the best way to do that
05:24 - probably not you're likely going to want
05:25 - to know some JavaScript and use that in
05:27 - your project however you can still do it
05:30 - with python it's possible to create user
05:32 - interfaces it is even possible to make
05:33 - things like mobile apps using python
05:36 - you're just not recommended or what it's
05:38 - really meant for now with JavaScript
05:40 - same thing you can go and build machine
05:42 - learning applications you can do data
05:44 - analysis you can graph all kinds of
05:46 - numbers but it's not going to be the
05:47 - best with JavaScript compared to
05:49 - something like python where python is
05:51 - more designed for that type of task at
05:53 - the end of the day all programming
05:55 - languages are are tools to help you
05:57 - achieve something so you need to pick
05:59 - the best tool for the job and that's why
06:01 - it's difficult when you're starting out
06:02 - to make this decision because you might
06:04 - not even know the type of jobs that you
06:06 - want to perform now what will mostly end
06:08 - up happening is you'll learn JavaScript
06:10 - and then you'll realize hey there's this
06:11 - thing I want to do that's kind of better
06:13 - in Python you might try to do it in
06:15 - JavaScript but at this point you're
06:17 - probably good enough of a programmer
06:18 - that you can go and learn a bit of
06:20 - python and you can achieve that task
06:22 - same thing other way around you might be
06:24 - really good at python but you want to
06:25 - implement some frontend user interfaces
06:27 - in your application in that case you may
06:29 - just go and decide to learn a little bit
06:31 - of JavaScript exactly what you need to
06:33 - achieve that goal and this goes for all
06:36 - different types of programming languages
06:38 - that's why my advice is figure out the
06:40 - type of things you want to build or the
06:42 - type of jobs you want start learning
06:44 - that first language that's most suited
06:46 - towards kind of what you think you want
06:48 - to do and as you start learning it
06:49 - you'll realize it's relatively easy to
06:51 - transition into other languages and
06:53 - you'll pick up the different tools that
06:55 - you need for the type of jobs that
06:57 - you're doing now at this point if you're
06:58 - still unsure what I would encourage you
07:00 - to do is simply pick one of the
07:01 - languages get started learn the basics
07:04 - and then you can easily change to the
07:06 - other language if you decide that it's
07:07 - not right for you if you're looking for
07:09 - some resources to learn these languages
07:11 - I have all kinds of videos on my channel
07:13 - that you can check out completely for
07:15 - free but if you want a more premium
07:16 - resource you're a bit more serious and
07:18 - you're really committed then I do
07:20 - actually have a software development
07:21 - course with course careers we've already
07:23 - had some people graduate that course and
07:25 - land jobs quite quickly and what we do
07:27 - in there is teach you the fundamentals
07:29 - of programming and then allow you to
07:31 - pick your specialization track once
07:33 - you've gone through that so if you're
07:34 - not sure you go through you learn all
07:36 - the fundamentals then you can pick
07:37 - whether you want to specialize in front
07:38 - end backend or devops and there's an
07:41 - additional course taught by an industry
07:43 - expert free of charge you simply pick it
07:46 - once you graduate the fundamentals which
07:47 - is taught by me anyways you guys can
07:49 - check that out from the link in the
07:50 - description if you enjoyed the video
