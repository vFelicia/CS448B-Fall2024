00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:02 - this video what I want to do is talk to
00:03 - you about why I think right now is a
00:05 - great time to get started with a YouTube
00:06 - channel a personal brand a blog anything
00:09 - if you have any desire to do this right
00:12 - now this is the time that you want to do
00:14 - it what I'm gonna do in this video is
00:15 - talk to you not only about why that's
00:17 - the case but but about the opportunities
00:19 - that you're gonna get by doing this now
00:21 - obviously I have this YouTube channel
00:23 - tech with Tim and when I started this I
00:25 - was only about 16 or 17 years old I
00:27 - could have never imagined that it would
00:29 - have grown to something like this and
00:30 - even just a year ago I had no clue that
00:32 - I was gonna be sitting here today
00:33 - talking to an actual camera and giving
00:35 - you guys advice about this specific
00:37 - topic the amount of opportunities that
00:39 - come from some kind of social social
00:41 - media platform or a personal brand or
00:44 - just having some kind of platform to
00:45 - express your opinions and views and
00:47 - share value with your audience is
00:49 - remarkable and to be honest I couldn't
00:51 - even dream that some of the things that
00:52 - I'm able to do today because of this
00:54 - YouTube channel one of those things
00:56 - being telling you guys about my beginner
00:57 - Python programming course which is now
00:59 - on sale for only $9 if you use the code
01:01 - code bid 19 now I've listed this or nine
01:04 - dollars and not free because I do
01:06 - actually need to make sure I can keep up
01:08 - with the demand from students as I share
01:09 - a private email where you can ask
01:11 - questions and send a final project to
01:13 - but if you would like to get started
01:14 - with Python and have some free time you
01:16 - can check this out there's a link in the
01:17 - description so why I think right now is
01:19 - a great opportunity to do this is
01:21 - because I'm going to go on a limb and
01:22 - say that you have a lot of free time
01:24 - with this coronavirus going around and a
01:27 - lot of people being told to stay home
01:28 - business is closing you know shops kind
01:31 - of shutting down in just the streets
01:33 - being emptier and emptier I can bet the
01:35 - chances are you're gonna have more free
01:37 - time and I know the biggest excuse or
01:39 - the biggest reason a lot of people don't
01:41 - like to do something like this is
01:42 - because of time now as much as this is a
01:45 - horrible and tragic situation I think
01:47 - that there's some light and some
01:48 - positive things that can come out of it
01:50 - like this you're gonna have a lot of
01:52 - free time so whether you decide to do a
01:54 - YouTube channel with that whether you
01:56 - decide to do a website a blog something
01:58 - I want to encourage you to do something
01:59 - with that time rather than sitting
02:01 - around and playing video games or
02:03 - watching the news or you know watching
02:06 - TV whatever it is you're gonna do take
02:08 - some of that time maybe not all of it
02:09 - and dedicate that to something that's
02:11 - going to benefit you when we come
02:13 - out of this kind of downward spiral that
02:15 - we're going on right now this is the
02:17 - time where the people that take
02:18 - advantage of this opportunity are gonna
02:20 - come out much further ahead and you can
02:22 - see that through all of history right I
02:25 - mean there's famous sayings that riches
02:26 - are made in in recessions I'm not saying
02:28 - we're going into a recession but this is
02:30 - kind of kind of applies to this
02:32 - situation where right now
02:33 - maybe you can't work maybe you're
02:35 - staying at home maybe there's no way for
02:36 - you to even make money starting to do
02:38 - something like this is gonna open up
02:40 - opportunities for you maybe not now
02:41 - maybe not in a month but maybe in a few
02:43 - months or even a year where this could
02:45 - be something that could generate you
02:47 - revenue this could be something that
02:48 - opens you up to opportunities this could
02:50 - be what gets you your next job and what
02:52 - I'm gonna do now I'm gonna keep this
02:54 - video kind of short it's talk to you
02:55 - about some of the opportunities that
02:57 - I've had from my YouTube channel and not
02:59 - all of them have come when I'm at a
03:00 - hundred two hundred thousand subscribers
03:02 - they were coming at 2,000 subscribers
03:04 - 3,000 subscribers 500 subscribers you
03:07 - don't need to wait to get to the very
03:09 - top before you can take advantage of the
03:11 - massive benefits that a social platform
03:12 - gives you and speaking a bit about
03:14 - growth and even just getting your
03:16 - YouTube channel getting whatever you're
03:17 - doing off the ground now is going to be
03:19 - the easiest time honestly in the next
03:21 - 100 years in my opinion to do this this
03:24 - is when everyone is staying at home this
03:26 - is one most people aren't going to be
03:28 - doing what you're doing and starting a
03:29 - YouTube channel or a blog or whatever it
03:31 - is they're gonna be watching your videos
03:33 - I can almost guarantee you that the
03:34 - viewership on my channel is going to
03:36 - increase during this time just because a
03:38 - lot of people don't have anything else
03:40 - to do so right now if you have any
03:42 - motivation any desire or you think you
03:44 - might want to do this in the future get
03:46 - started I'm telling you I'm trying to
03:48 - motivate you and get you to do this
03:49 - because you're gonna look back at this
03:51 - and say why didn't I start something
03:52 - during this time that would have been a
03:55 - huge benefit to me so what I'm gonna do
03:57 - now I'm gonna try to keep this video a
03:58 - bit shorter is talking about some of the
04:00 - opportunities that this YouTube channel
04:02 - has given me and what you guys can
04:04 - expect to get from your YouTube channels
04:06 - or from your blogs or from your
04:07 - platforms or whatever it is when you
04:09 - start these things up so the first
04:11 - opportunity here is obviously a revenue
04:13 - generation I'm not sure if any of you
04:15 - know but I actually own an incorporated
04:16 - company called tech with Tim
04:18 - Incorporated and that's where I run all
04:19 - of my stuff there so I'm not just my
04:21 - YouTube channel but my course is my
04:23 - website anything else I do go through
04:25 - that corporation
04:26 - and the reason that I've been able to do
04:28 - that is because when I started this
04:29 - YouTube channel wasn't making very much
04:31 - money he was making like a hundred
04:33 - dollars a month
04:33 - fifty bucks here and there right maybe a
04:36 - few sponsorships every now and then but
04:38 - now it's gotten to the point where I'm
04:39 - able to turn this into a full business
04:41 - and this is something that's honestly
04:42 - mind-boggling to me I never thought that
04:45 - I would be able to make a full-time
04:46 - living from looking at a camera and
04:48 - sharing value with an audience but that
04:50 - is exactly what you can do if you're
04:52 - willing to put in the work now I know a
04:54 - lot of you are gonna say well Tim I
04:56 - can't build a hundred thousand
04:57 - subscriber YouTube channel or two
04:58 - hundred thousand subscriber YouTube
05:00 - channel tonight I'm gonna say actually
05:01 - yeah you can but I understand your point
05:03 - and what I'm gonna say there is you can
05:06 - stay start making money as early as you
05:07 - want with a YouTube channel obviously
05:09 - there's some strategic things that you
05:11 - can do but things like affiliate
05:13 - marketing sponsorships brand deals right
05:16 - all of those things there's no limit to
05:18 - when you can do them and especially if
05:20 - you have your own platform or your own
05:22 - product or something that you're selling
05:23 - it doesn't matter how many people are
05:25 - watching you you can always share that
05:26 - with them now obviously there's some
05:28 - strategy that goes behind this and I'm
05:29 - not gonna really go into that in this
05:31 - video if you guys would like a video on
05:32 - that let me know but what I'm meaning to
05:35 - say here is if you have say 500 loyal
05:37 - fans and you can sell say a 200 dollar
05:40 - course to one or two of them that's
05:42 - already four hundred dollars right I
05:43 - know that might not seem like a lot of
05:44 - money but if you can do that once a week
05:46 - or once a month right those things add
05:49 - up and the little bits right is really
05:51 - what encourages you to keep going and
05:53 - maybe in these times is what's gonna
05:54 - make a difference so you can definitely
05:56 - generate money
05:57 - I know YouTube channels that are smaller
05:58 - than ten thousand subscribers that are
06:00 - making more money than I am right it
06:01 - just depends on how you want to do
06:03 - things and there's no magic number that
06:05 - gives you a certain amount of money
06:07 - right that's that's just the way it is
06:09 - depending on the channel you start
06:10 - depending on the niche you're in
06:11 - depending on what you want to do and how
06:13 - many product placements and ads and
06:15 - things you want to run you are kind of
06:17 - your own boss when it comes to how much
06:18 - money you're gonna make and that is the
06:20 - great thing about these opportunities is
06:22 - that you get to decide how much you want
06:24 - to make and how you want to make that
06:25 - kind of money
06:26 - now the next opportunity here is
06:28 - actually just being known in whatever
06:31 - kind of industry or whatever field that
06:33 - you're in and having something to show
06:35 - for it for me for example I'm only 19
06:37 - I'm a second year computer science
06:38 - student and I was
06:39 - able to just land a job at Microsoft and
06:42 - I didn't even have to go through the
06:43 - regular application process the reason
06:45 - for that was because of this YouTube
06:47 - channel because they can see that I've
06:48 - been putting a lot of work into this
06:50 - that I was motivated and dedicated and
06:52 - that hey I actually do know what I'm
06:53 - talking about you can watch 400 videos
06:56 - of me talking about those specific
06:58 - things so regardless of if you're gonna
06:59 - make money from this or not this is
07:01 - something that you can point people to
07:02 - and say hey guess what you're asking if
07:04 - I'm a hard worker I posted a hundred
07:06 - YouTube videos in twenty twenty twenty
07:08 - when I had a hundred subscribers I
07:10 - pushed through I was motivated and I'm
07:12 - gonna come and do that for you at your
07:13 - next job right there's just so many
07:15 - things you can get out of this and
07:17 - there's really no negative to doing
07:19 - another huge benefit here is just a
07:21 - community the amount of stuff that I've
07:23 - learned and the amount of video ideas
07:25 - I've gone in amazing people I've met
07:27 - because of this channel is unbelievable
07:29 - I know people around the world now that
07:31 - I'm able to send a text to and have a
07:32 - conversation with about pretty much
07:34 - anything I want because of this channel
07:36 - I get amazing people reaching out to me
07:38 - every single day offering me jobs
07:40 - offering opportunities offering to chat
07:42 - and that's just something that's
07:44 - irreplaceable that there's nothing else
07:46 - that can really do that for you other
07:47 - than having an online platform and I
07:50 - think that's something that a lot of
07:50 - people forget that it's not at the end
07:52 - of the day about the money it's not even
07:54 - about the credibility it's also just
07:55 - about you right this could be something
07:57 - that you really enjoy and really have
07:59 - fun doing and this leads me into my next
08:01 - thing which is this is a huge
08:02 - opportunity to grow your skills and not
08:05 - only filming editing marketing
08:07 - advertising but also in communication I
08:09 - can tell you guys that since I've set up
08:11 - these cameras and set this thing up in
08:13 - my room my ability to communicate not
08:15 - just with the camera but with other
08:17 - people in general has gone up
08:18 - tremendously I mean some of you may
08:20 - disagree with that fair enough but I can
08:23 - say that's helped me in job interviews
08:24 - that's helped me in presentations it's
08:26 - helped me in school there's no negative
08:27 - to doing this and this is what this
08:29 - video has been about I just wanted to
08:31 - give you guys a glimpse into what a
08:32 - YouTube channel can really do for you
08:34 - and why right now if you have any
08:36 - motivation any desire any reason at all
08:38 - that you want to start one get it go
08:40 - ahead and start doing it the number one
08:42 - thing to remember is just to try your
08:44 - best to stay consistent and to never
08:45 - worry about how many people are
08:47 - following you if I was worried about how
08:49 - many people were following me when I was
08:50 - at 10 15 20 subscribers I wouldn't
08:53 - here today and I wouldn't be sharing
08:54 - this video with you so keep going guys
08:56 - get something started it doesn't matter
08:58 - what it is but just do something this is
09:01 - only gonna benefit you and with this
09:02 - amount of spare time you have now this
09:04 - is really a great opportunity to take
09:06 - advantage of so with that being said I
09:08 - hope this gave you guys a little bit of
09:09 - insight and motivation into why you
09:11 - should start a YouTube channel personal
09:13 - brand of website whatever it is in 2020
09:16 - right now and with that being said if
09:18 - you guys have any questions leave them

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so in this video what I want to do is talk to you about why I think right now is a great time to get started with a YouTube channel a personal brand a blog anything if you have any desire to do this right now this is the time that you want to do it what I'm gonna do in this video is talk to you not only about why that's the case but but about the opportunities that you're gonna get by doing this now obviously I have this YouTube channel tech with Tim and when I started this I was only about 16 or 17 years old I could have never imagined that it would have grown to something like this and even just a year ago I had no clue that I was gonna be sitting here today talking to an actual camera and giving you guys advice about this specific topic the amount of opportunities that come from some kind of social social media platform or a personal brand or just having some kind of platform to express your opinions and views and share value with your audience is remarkable and to be honest I couldn't even dream that some of the things that I'm able to do today because of this YouTube channel one of those things being telling you guys about my beginner Python programming course which is now on sale for only $9 if you use the code code bid 19 now I've listed this or nine dollars and not free because I do actually need to make sure I can keep up with the demand from students as I share a private email where you can ask questions and send a final project to but if you would like to get started with Python and have some free time you can check this out there's a link in the description so why I think right now is a great opportunity to do this is because I'm going to go on a limb and say that you have a lot of free time with this coronavirus going around and a lot of people being told to stay home business is closing you know shops kind of shutting down in just the streets being emptier and emptier I can bet the chances are you're gonna have more free time and I know the biggest excuse or the biggest reason a lot of people don't like to do something like this is because of time now as much as this is a horrible and tragic situation I think that there's some light and some positive things that can come out of it like this you're gonna have a lot of free time so whether you decide to do a YouTube channel with that whether you decide to do a website a blog something I want to encourage you to do something with that time rather than sitting around and playing video games or watching the news or you know watching TV whatever it is you're gonna do take some of that time maybe not all of it and dedicate that to something that's going to benefit you when we come out of this kind of downward spiral that we're going on right now this is the time where the people that take advantage of this opportunity are gonna come out much further ahead and you can see that through all of history right I mean there's famous sayings that riches are made in in recessions I'm not saying we're going into a recession but this is kind of kind of applies to this situation where right now maybe you can't work maybe you're staying at home maybe there's no way for you to even make money starting to do something like this is gonna open up opportunities for you maybe not now maybe not in a month but maybe in a few months or even a year where this could be something that could generate you revenue this could be something that opens you up to opportunities this could be what gets you your next job and what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna keep this video kind of short it's talk to you about some of the opportunities that I've had from my YouTube channel and not all of them have come when I'm at a hundred two hundred thousand subscribers they were coming at 2,000 subscribers 3,000 subscribers 500 subscribers you don't need to wait to get to the very top before you can take advantage of the massive benefits that a social platform gives you and speaking a bit about growth and even just getting your YouTube channel getting whatever you're doing off the ground now is going to be the easiest time honestly in the next 100 years in my opinion to do this this is when everyone is staying at home this is one most people aren't going to be doing what you're doing and starting a YouTube channel or a blog or whatever it is
