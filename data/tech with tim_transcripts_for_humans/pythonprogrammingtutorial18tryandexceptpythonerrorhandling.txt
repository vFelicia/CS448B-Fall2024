00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another video
00:02 - this is the eighteenth video in my
00:04 - Python programming series and today
00:07 - we're going to be talking about
00:07 - something called a try and accept block
00:10 - of code so just like we talked about the
00:12 - if-else and Elif block of code and like
00:16 - we talked about the for loop which is a
00:18 - block of code and like functions which
00:19 - are blocks of code we're gonna be
00:21 - talking about to try and accept so in
00:24 - Python we use try and accept as our
00:26 - keywords and other languages you may
00:28 - have heard of try and catch statements
00:30 - this is the same thing except in Python
00:32 - instead of catch we use accept okay so
00:35 - let's talk about what a try and accept
00:37 - statement is sometimes in Python you
00:40 - want to do an operation or you want to
00:42 - try something but you don't know if it's
00:44 - really going to work or not there's some
00:46 - different variables they may come in
00:47 - sometimes it may work sometimes it may
00:50 - not work usually this depends on user
00:52 - input or what the user is doing in the
00:55 - program
00:56 - so a good example of this is maybe if
00:58 - we're validating a form so we'll do an
01:00 - example you would say text is equal to
01:03 - input like this and then we'll say
01:07 - username okay now in typical user names
01:12 - you're only allowed certain characters
01:13 - maybe you can't do a comma you couldn't
01:16 - do a star certain things like that right
01:18 - maybe we only want it to be text so we
01:21 - only want it to be numbers we just want
01:23 - to validate this we could use a huge if
01:25 - statement to do this but instead there's
01:29 - something called a try and except that
01:31 - we can use so in this case I want my
01:33 - username to only be numbers so I don't
01:36 - want it to be string at all I want it to
01:38 - only be numbers so what I'm going to do
01:41 - is I'm going to make a new variable here
01:43 - and I'm going to call it number and all
01:46 - I'm going to do is I'm going to try to
01:47 - int the text like this okay so if you
01:51 - remember what the int does is that
01:53 - simply converts our string into an
01:55 - integer and then I'm going to print that
01:57 - to the screen so I'm going to print
01:58 - number to the screen now what happens
02:02 - right here is if I try to type in a word
02:04 - like this you see we get an error it
02:07 - says there's an invalid literal for inks
02:09 - with base 10 now you don't have to
02:11 - understand what this error is pretty
02:13 - much all this means
02:13 - that we can't convert too low into a
02:15 - number because there is really no number
02:18 - there how how does it know what number
02:20 - to make that into right so in this case
02:22 - we would use a try and except look
02:25 - because if the user types in something
02:28 - that's invalid well we want them to type
02:31 - in something else we don't want the
02:33 - program to crash like it just did there
02:35 - so here I'm going to put a try like this
02:38 - followed by a colon and then I'm going
02:41 - to indent these two blocks right here so
02:46 - that means we're going to try this block
02:48 - of code okay and then underneath here
02:51 - I'm going to type except just like that
02:54 - followed by a colon now there is a more
02:57 - advanced way to do this we can accept a
02:58 - specific type of error but I'm not going
03:01 - to talk about that in this video this is
03:02 - just a very basic try and accept block
03:04 - and then under here I'm going to type
03:08 - what I want to happen if this block of
03:10 - code doesn't run meaning this block of
03:12 - code returns an error and we can't
03:15 - actually execute it so in this case I'm
03:17 - just going to do I'll just print to the
03:20 - screen invalid username because remember
03:26 - we're only going to have our username
03:27 - contain numbers all right so now if I
03:30 - run the program and I try to type in
03:32 - something that is not a string so just I
03:34 - mean that is not a number like this it
03:38 - will just say invalid username rather
03:40 - than crashing the program which is what
03:42 - happened before and if I do try to type
03:45 - in something that is valid so maybe I
03:47 - type one two three four it just gives me
03:49 - that username back right so it works
03:51 - like that um so that's pretty much how
03:54 - we try and accept works again this is a
03:57 - very basic example that's what I try to
03:59 - do in my videos just give you the basics
04:01 - and then you can try to apply it to some
04:03 - projects you're doing and some more
04:05 - advanced things so again what happens is
04:08 - it tries this block of code if that
04:11 - block of code doesn't run or an error
04:13 - happens instead of simply crashing the
04:16 - program and giving us that red message
04:18 - it's going to go to this except block
04:20 - and it's going to do whatever's in here
04:21 - now in this except block again we could
04:24 - ask them to type in a new username we
04:27 - display another message we could maybe
04:30 - close the program on them we could do
04:32 - whatever we want to do in this accept
04:33 - block and it's extremely useful so yeah
04:37 - that's pretty much how the try and
04:39 - accept works if you've learned something
04:42 - please like and subscribe and I will see
04:45 - you again in another video

hey guys welcome back to another video this is the eighteenth video in my Python programming series and today we're going to be talking about something called a try and accept block of code so just like we talked about the ifelse and Elif block of code and like we talked about the for loop which is a block of code and like functions which are blocks of code we're gonna be talking about to try and accept so in Python we use try and accept as our keywords and other languages you may have heard of try and catch statements this is the same thing except in Python instead of catch we use accept okay so let's talk about what a try and accept statement is sometimes in Python you want to do an operation or you want to try something but you don't know if it's really going to work or not there's some different variables they may come in sometimes it may work sometimes it may not work usually this depends on user input or what the user is doing in the program so a good example of this is maybe if we're validating a form so we'll do an example you would say text is equal to input like this and then we'll say username okay now in typical user names you're only allowed certain characters maybe you can't do a comma you couldn't do a star certain things like that right maybe we only want it to be text so we only want it to be numbers we just want to validate this we could use a huge if statement to do this but instead there's something called a try and except that we can use so in this case I want my username to only be numbers so I don't want it to be string at all I want it to only be numbers so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a new variable here and I'm going to call it number and all I'm going to do is I'm going to try to int the text like this okay so if you remember what the int does is that simply converts our string into an integer and then I'm going to print that to the screen so I'm going to print number to the screen now what happens right here is if I try to type in a word like this you see we get an error it says there's an invalid literal for inks with base 10 now you don't have to understand what this error is pretty much all this means that we can't convert too low into a number because there is really no number there how how does it know what number to make that into right so in this case we would use a try and except look because if the user types in something that's invalid well we want them to type in something else we don't want the program to crash like it just did there so here I'm going to put a try like this followed by a colon and then I'm going to indent these two blocks right here so that means we're going to try this block of code okay and then underneath here I'm going to type except just like that followed by a colon now there is a more advanced way to do this we can accept a specific type of error but I'm not going to talk about that in this video this is just a very basic try and accept block and then under here I'm going to type what I want to happen if this block of code doesn't run meaning this block of code returns an error and we can't actually execute it so in this case I'm just going to do I'll just print to the screen invalid username because remember we're only going to have our username contain numbers all right so now if I run the program and I try to type in something that is not a string so just I mean that is not a number like this it will just say invalid username rather than crashing the program which is what happened before and if I do try to type in something that is valid so maybe I type one two three four it just gives me that username back right so it works like that um so that's pretty much how we try and accept works again this is a very basic example that's what I try to do in my videos just give you the basics and then you can try to apply it to some projects you're doing and some more advanced things so again what happens is it tries this block of code if that block of code doesn't run or an error happens instead of simply crashing the program and giving us that red message it's going to go to this except block and it's going to do whatever's in here now in this except block again we could ask them to type in a new username we display another message we could maybe close the program on them we could do whatever we want to do in this accept block and it's extremely useful so yeah that's pretty much how the try and accept works if you've learned something please like and subscribe and I will see you again in another video
