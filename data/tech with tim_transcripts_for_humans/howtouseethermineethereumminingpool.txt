00:00 - [Music]
00:05 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:07 - YouTube video today's video I'm gonna be
00:10 - going over how to use the mining pool
00:12 - ether mine org how all that works how
00:15 - payouts work how you can actually get
00:17 - your etherium into your wallet and a lot
00:19 - of questions that I've been having on my
00:20 - previous video how to mine aetherium for
00:22 - beginners from a lot of people saying
00:24 - that they've been mining just like me
00:26 - they have their command prompt up
00:27 - they've been mining for a few hours a
00:29 - few days and they've been checking their
00:31 - aetherium wallet and they see there's
00:33 - zero aetherium in there and they're
00:34 - freaking out they don't know what to do
00:36 - they don't know why it's not working
00:37 - they're wondering if this is a scam
00:39 - possibly so on so forth so pretty much
00:43 - I'm just gonna be going over how to use
00:44 - this website and just so you all know
00:47 - don't worry if you have zero with your m
00:48 - in your wallet and you've been mining
00:50 - for a few days this is completely normal
00:52 - and I'm gonna explain why in this video
00:54 - so pretty much aetherium or ether mind
00:57 - org is a mining pool and we use a mining
01:01 - pool just because if you try to mind
01:02 - alone you have to have a ton of
01:03 - different heart a ton of different
01:05 - graphics cards a lot of hashing power
01:06 - otherwise you're not really gonna get a
01:08 - lot of shares it's gonna be difficult to
01:10 - make any viable amount of money so when
01:12 - you use a mining pool it pretty much
01:14 - splits shares up between different
01:16 - regions of people so you get what's
01:18 - called more luck kind of and you can get
01:20 - more shares and make more money so the
01:24 - mining pool here ether mine takes a 1%
01:26 - fee meaning whenever you cash out it's
01:28 - just gonna take 1% of the etherium that
01:30 - you've mined and yeah so once you've set
01:34 - up your miner like this if you haven't
01:36 - already done this and you still are
01:37 - wondering how to mine aetherium go check
01:39 - out my previous video I'll put a link up
01:41 - in the top right here it's gonna be as a
01:42 - card and it'll be one in the description
01:44 - below go watch that one first as it's
01:46 - kind of a prerequisite to this if you
01:48 - have watched that and you're wondering
01:50 - how ether mine works just continue on
01:51 - with the video so pretty much since
01:54 - you've set up your miner that means you
01:56 - have an aetherium wallet address so you
01:59 - have your private key and your public
02:00 - key so this is my public key here 0 X so
02:04 - on so you're just gonna copy this and
02:06 - you should already have this say saved
02:10 - in your miner so if you go to wherever
02:12 - your miner folder
02:13 - and then you go to whatever script
02:15 - you're using to start it so mine's just
02:17 - called ether mine you click Edit then
02:20 - you can see it's right after a wallet
02:21 - here this will be your address so you
02:23 - can copy that another way as well and
02:25 - you're just gonna go to ether mind org
02:27 - so if I just go to the basic page I go
02:29 - to the home screen and you'll see that
02:31 - it says address up in the top right
02:33 - here's a little white box all you're
02:35 - gonna do is you're gonna paste your
02:36 - address in there and you're gonna click
02:37 - enter now if you just started mining and
02:40 - you've done this it might not show that
02:43 - you've mined anything these numbers
02:44 - might all be 0 don't freak out it takes
02:46 - about 10 to 15 minutes to actually
02:49 - register on ether mind that you're
02:50 - mining so if you don't see those numbers
02:53 - there right away
02:54 - don't worry just give it a few minutes
02:55 - and if after about 10 or 15 minutes you
02:58 - haven't seen anything then maybe there's
03:00 - something wrong but just give it some
03:01 - time ok so you can see I've been mining
03:04 - for 22 minutes my stats are popped up
03:06 - here it shows my current mining rate my
03:09 - rate per this hour and then my effective
03:11 - mining rate if you want to know what
03:12 - those are you can just read on the
03:13 - website it shows you you're gonna have a
03:15 - table that says payout slash rounds now
03:17 - this is what we're gonna click on here
03:19 - just to view a few statistics quickly so
03:22 - when you click this it's going to give
03:23 - you an estimated earning step now this
03:25 - is what you're gonna want to look at to
03:27 - determine how much you're gonna be
03:28 - making in u.s. dollars by the way per
03:30 - day per month per year etc per week per
03:33 - hour and that'll show you how much
03:36 - you're gonna be making and then if you
03:37 - go to settings this is where we can
03:39 - configure our payouts so by default all
03:42 - of the theorem your mind doesn't
03:43 - automatically go into your wallet it's
03:45 - actually stored on this website under
03:48 - your miners address so whatever your
03:50 - theorem will address is that's your
03:51 - miners address you punch it in like this
03:54 - and then you're able to see how much
03:56 - aetherium you've mined now it doesn't
03:58 - get paid out until you reach a certain
04:00 - threshold so what I mean by paid out is
04:02 - it gets sent to your aetherium wallet so
04:04 - you can see right here I have 0.0001
04:07 - aetherium in my wallet I don't have any
04:10 - that's because I haven't reached my
04:11 - payout threshold so if you want to
04:13 - change this threshold you can go to
04:15 - settings and by default it is at 1 I'm
04:17 - gonna tell you right now Mining 1
04:19 - aetherium takes a very long time unless
04:21 - you have a lot of hashing power so
04:24 - you're going to want to change this to
04:25 - probably the minimum amount
04:26 - unless you're mining with a lot of
04:28 - hashing power so you're gonna want to go
04:30 - to 0.05 especially if you're someone
04:32 - like me who's only mining at 17 mega
04:34 - hashes per second right now so that's
04:36 - the minimum amount you can see right
04:37 - here it shows what it is and then you're
04:40 - gonna want to save this information now
04:42 - to do this you need to type in your
04:44 - email address and then you also need to
04:46 - type in your public IP address now to
04:49 - find your public IP address you can just
04:50 - open a Google tab and just search what
04:53 - is my IP like so I'm not actually gonna
04:56 - click enter because then you'd see my IP
04:57 - which is not a good thing don't share
04:59 - that with anyone
05:00 - you're gonna type that in here and
05:02 - you're gonna click Save like so so once
05:04 - you've done that it will save your
05:06 - threshold and then you can come back
05:08 - here and it should show you what
05:10 - percentage you are at of your payout
05:12 - threshold so once you get to 100% so
05:15 - you've mined 0.05 etherium it will pay
05:18 - you out automatically there's nothing
05:20 - you have to do and you can go and check
05:22 - your theory and wallet and you'll see
05:23 - that the etherium is actually in the
05:25 - wallet now so that's pretty much all it
05:28 - is to using ether mine now I will tell
05:30 - you that sometimes ether mine is a
05:32 - little buggy your miner may go offline
05:34 - once in a while and it's a good idea to
05:36 - make sure you type in your email address
05:38 - here as it'll send you an email when
05:40 - your miner goes offline if you have this
05:42 - little checkmark ticked like that now
05:44 - this is really useful because that means
05:45 - that you can check the status of your
05:47 - miner so say you're at school you're at
05:49 - work wherever you are and one of your
05:51 - miner goes offline if you have the
05:52 - ability to bring it back online then
05:54 - you're able to do so and you just know
05:57 - when it's online and offline and it's
05:58 - really useful if I do that whenever I'm
06:01 - mining with my regular address so yeah
06:03 - so yeah just a quick recap if to use
06:06 - ether mine all you have to do pretty
06:08 - much is get your aetherium old address
06:10 - you're using - mine type it in this
06:12 - address tab up here click enter it'll
06:14 - pull up all your statistics here all
06:15 - your octave workers all your hash rate
06:18 - it'll give you the last scene so this
06:20 - one's useful it shows you how long ago
06:22 - that it was online so on and then you
06:26 - can see all your shares everything like
06:28 - that and once you reach your payout
06:29 - threshold which can be changed by going
06:31 - to the Settings tab then you will find
06:33 - that your aetherium is in your wallet
06:35 - alright so I hope you guys enjoyed the
06:37 - video if it helps you out please help me
06:39 - out by leaving a like
06:40 - and subscribe and I will see you again
06:42 - in another video

hey guys and welcome back to another YouTube video today's video I'm gonna be going over how to use the mining pool ether mine org how all that works how payouts work how you can actually get your etherium into your wallet and a lot of questions that I've been having on my previous video how to mine aetherium for beginners from a lot of people saying that they've been mining just like me they have their command prompt up they've been mining for a few hours a few days and they've been checking their aetherium wallet and they see there's zero aetherium in there and they're freaking out they don't know what to do they don't know why it's not working they're wondering if this is a scam possibly so on so forth so pretty much I'm just gonna be going over how to use this website and just so you all know don't worry if you have zero with your m in your wallet and you've been mining for a few days this is completely normal and I'm gonna explain why in this video so pretty much aetherium or ether mind org is a mining pool and we use a mining pool just because if you try to mind alone you have to have a ton of different heart a ton of different graphics cards a lot of hashing power

Mining 1 aetherium takes a very long time unless you have a lot of hashing power so you're going to want to change this to probably the minimum amount unless you're mining with a lot of hashing power so you're gonna want to go to 0.05 especially if you're someone like me who's only mining at 17 mega hashes per second right now so that's the minimum amount you can see right here it shows what it is
