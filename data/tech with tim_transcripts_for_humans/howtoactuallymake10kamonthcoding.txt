With timestamps:

00:00 - everybody wants to teach you how to make
00:01 - 10K per month how to achieve your dream
00:04 - life through coding when the reality is
00:06 - this is hard most of you will fail and
00:08 - the strategy to do this in 2024 is
00:11 - significantly different than it used to
00:12 - be the first thing you need to
00:14 - understand is that the golden days of
00:15 - coding are behind us no longer can you
00:18 - learn to code for 2 months and land a
00:19 - six-figure job at Google now there is
00:21 - still an insane amount of money in this
00:24 - space but more and more of it's being
00:25 - concentrated at the top and the
00:27 - competition is getting steeper and
00:29 - steeper that said you can still
00:30 - absolutely make 10K per month coding but
00:32 - you need to be a little bit more
00:34 - creative and I'll share with you what I
00:35 - mean by that but first as we all know
00:38 - the obvious way to make a lot of money
00:39 - through coding is by running a business
00:41 - or at least being a part of one in the
00:43 - early days now you're probably watching
00:45 - this video because you want to earn
00:46 - money through coding and that means
00:48 - starting a business is key even if it's
00:50 - just a small one and servicing something
00:52 - like a few freelancing clients now that
00:54 - means that you need to check out this
00:55 - free business startup kit from a good
00:57 - friend of the channel HubSpot this
00:59 - business startup kit gives you nine free
01:01 - templates that can help you brainstorm
01:03 - your business's name develop a business
01:05 - plan and even how to pitch your idea to
01:07 - potential investors you can even utilize
01:09 - the business startup cost calculator and
01:11 - feasibility study template to make sure
01:14 - you know what you're getting into before
01:15 - you start I've left a link in the
01:17 - description where you can check this out
01:18 - completely for free now as someone who's
01:20 - run multiple businesses I can say that
01:22 - this is something I definitely wish I
01:24 - had especially during the early days of
01:26 - the business could have saved me a ton
01:27 - of time and thousands of dollars I I
01:30 - definitely recommend you check it out
01:31 - and I want to give a big thank you to
01:32 - HubSpot for making this resource and
01:34 - tons of others completely free and for
01:36 - sponsoring today's video so now we're
01:38 - going to get into a five-step approach
01:40 - where I talk to you about exactly what
01:42 - you need to do in order to build up to
01:44 - the point where you can be making 10K
01:46 - per month now most of us aren't just
01:48 - going to start a business tomorrow that
01:49 - starts making a ton of money we need to
01:51 - have a strategy and we need to have a
01:53 - structured approach and that's why the
01:55 - first thing we need to do is actually
01:58 - understand what it is we're going to be
01:59 - doing to make 10K per month and start to
02:01 - develop some kind of strategy or plan so
02:04 - that we can work our way towards that
02:05 - goal this isn't something that's going
02:07 - to happen in a few days or even most
02:09 - likely a few months it does take time to
02:11 - get to that income level but once you're
02:13 - able to hit a threshold like 10K per
02:15 - month it really can become quite
02:17 - exponential and you can start to realize
02:19 - how much more money there is in this
02:20 - field and how you can capture just a
02:22 - little piece of it so the first thing I
02:24 - recommend doing and what I personally
02:26 - did to start making money from coding
02:28 - even when I was more of a beginner was
02:30 - specialize and learn something that's
02:32 - Niche now a lot of people would disagree
02:34 - with me they'll say hey you should be a
02:35 - generalist you should know everything
02:37 - now as much as that's great the issue
02:39 - with that is if you know everything you
02:40 - don't stand out in one specific area if
02:43 - you're a senior developer and you have
02:44 - 20 years of experience that's fantastic
02:46 - you can just go get a job and you can
02:48 - make $300,000 per year but for those of
02:50 - us that are just starting out we need to
02:52 - make sure that we become a niche
02:54 - Authority that we actually are really
02:56 - good in one certain area and we can
02:58 - provide enough value in that area that
03:00 - we can get paid if we just know a little
03:02 - bit of python a little bit of JavaScript
03:04 - we can build some basic applications
03:06 - well so can everybody else we need to be
03:08 - good in one area so that people
03:10 - specifically looking for that skill set
03:12 - will find us and are willing to pay us
03:14 - rather than someone who just knows a
03:16 - little bit now to give you the exact way
03:18 - that I did this when I was younger I got
03:20 - really really good at pame pame is a
03:23 - python module for making simple 2D games
03:25 - I got so good at this that a lot of
03:27 - other students in my class and from
03:29 - other schools actually wanted to pay me
03:31 - money to complete their homework
03:32 - assignments not the most ethical thing
03:34 - in the world but since I was really good
03:36 - at P game I actually had enough value in
03:38 - that area where I could sell my skill
03:40 - set students needed py game projects
03:42 - completed they needed it specifically in
03:44 - that framework I knew exactly what the
03:46 - professors and teachers were looking for
03:47 - and I could get all of them A's really
03:49 - easily beyond that I also set up some
03:51 - freelancing gigs online same thing
03:53 - specifically for pame and I started
03:55 - making a few hundred a month doing pame
03:58 - projects and this isn't what was going
03:59 - to lead me to 10K per month but it
04:01 - started to show me that if I knew an
04:03 - individual skill and I was really good
04:05 - in one area even if I wasn't a
04:07 - professional software developer and I
04:08 - wasn't at that point I could still make
04:10 - money and I could still monetize my
04:12 - skill so the first thing that you need
04:14 - to do here is pick a field to specialize
04:16 - in it doesn't need to be as niche as
04:18 - something like P game but it should be a
04:20 - specific framework or a specific library
04:22 - or maybe you're really good at building
04:24 - characters in unity or you're really
04:26 - really good at developing fast API API
04:29 - in Python right it doesn't matter what
04:31 - it is but you need to pick one area you
04:34 - can broaden the scope eventually but you
04:36 - need to start where you can penetrate as
04:38 - deep as possible rather than trying to
04:40 - have this whole broad scope and do
04:42 - everything now once you've picked your
04:43 - Niche and you actually have a bit of a
04:45 - strategy here the next thing you need to
04:47 - do is get your name out there you need
04:48 - to start building credibility and
04:50 - demonstrating that you actually have
04:52 - skills having a resum today is just not
04:54 - enough put on a resume all your skills
04:56 - all your projects everything you know it
04:58 - just doesn't matter employers don't care
05:00 - about that as much as they used to and
05:02 - in this digital age you really need to
05:04 - be presenting your skills online I know
05:06 - a lot of you don't want to hear that but
05:08 - my recommendation here is to post
05:10 - content consistently or at least to be
05:12 - networking with other individuals in the
05:14 - space so that you can start building a
05:16 - group of people that actually know what
05:18 - you do and what you're capable of and
05:20 - when I say post content that doesn't
05:21 - mean you need to become a vlogger
05:23 - doesn't mean you need to be a
05:24 - professional medium post writer it just
05:26 - means that you need to start putting
05:27 - something out there so that people can
05:30 - find you or when they do eventually find
05:32 - you they have something to look at they
05:34 - have something to see they can actually
05:35 - have proof that you know what you're
05:37 - doing and you've built something you
05:38 - have credibility that is where content
05:41 - comes in handy it's something you can
05:42 - point to and that people can find when
05:44 - they look up your name that's why you're
05:46 - posting content not because you're going
05:48 - to be making money from the content
05:49 - you're posting now that could happen
05:51 - eventually and that's actually exactly
05:52 - what ended up happening to me but the
05:54 - point is you need to put your name out
05:55 - there in some way or another so I
05:57 - typically recommend for people that
05:58 - maybe don't want to be on camera or film
06:00 - something write some different blog
06:02 - posts write some medium articles do
06:04 - basic tutorials in the niche that you're
06:06 - really good at share some of the
06:07 - projects you built on LinkedIn make a
06:09 - little story about how you actually
06:11 - developed that start just sharing
06:13 - Insight join some different communities
06:15 - make sure that people know who you are
06:17 - and they know what skill set you have to
06:19 - offer now this will be slow but if you
06:20 - can do this consistently and keep
06:22 - building up proof of what you've
06:24 - actually done it's only going to help
06:25 - you in the future whether you do decide
06:27 - to get a job whether you move more into
06:29 - free Lancing or do some of the other
06:30 - methods I'm going to talk about in this
06:32 - video so once You' started to develop a
06:34 - little bit of credibility online or you
06:36 - at least have something that people can
06:37 - go and look at when they look up your
06:39 - name the next thing I recommend you do
06:41 - is some coaching or teaching now keep in
06:43 - mind this is not what's going to make
06:44 - you 10K per month these are the slow
06:47 - building blocks and personally what I
06:48 - did to eventually reach that Milestone
06:51 - so we want to start by making a little
06:52 - bit of money online and then work our
06:54 - way up slowly so that we build
06:55 - credibility along the way so that we can
06:57 - eventually then land those really high
06:59 - paying clients or those high paying jobs
07:01 - so that's why I'm suggesting at this
07:03 - stage we want to start coaching we want
07:04 - to start tutoring we want to start
07:06 - sharing our knowledge with individuals
07:08 - this is where you can actually start
07:09 - making some real money for example when
07:11 - I was as young as 16 years old I was
07:13 - doing tutoring for 20 or $30 per hour I
07:16 - was tutoring in computer science I was
07:17 - actually tutoring in things like math
07:19 - and regular science and I was tutoring
07:21 - in pretty much anything that someone
07:22 - would pay me for that got me my first
07:24 - client because one of my teachers knew
07:26 - that I was really good in computer
07:27 - science recommended me to one of the
07:29 - parents parents or one of the students
07:30 - who was struggling in one of his other
07:31 - classes and there you go I tutored him
07:33 - from there I got recommendations and
07:35 - referrals and I started to build up a
07:37 - really small tutoring business where
07:38 - people in the school knew that if they
07:40 - needed computer science help I could
07:42 - help them with it now the same thing
07:43 - happened as I moved to University I
07:45 - started getting a few gigs online
07:47 - because I had a little bit of content
07:49 - people would find me or if I would post
07:50 - listings in like the university hallway
07:52 - people could actually go and see my name
07:54 - and go okay this guy actually is good at
07:56 - computer science he has a few articles
07:58 - he knows what he's talking about I'll go
07:59 - to him and I'll pay him $40 per hour for
08:02 - coaching and you get the idea here you
08:03 - can really slowly start to build up a
08:05 - bit of a tutoring business you can build
08:06 - a bit of a client base and then you can
08:08 - start getting referrals and testimonials
08:10 - which again only prove your credibility
08:13 - and provide you with assets that you can
08:14 - monetize later on you're not going to do
08:16 - this overnight it's not something that's
08:18 - going to happen extremely quickly so
08:19 - these are the easiest steps that I can
08:21 - think of to start building up towards
08:23 - that skill so once you've made a little
08:25 - bit of money from tutoring and coaching
08:27 - you have some clients you have some
08:28 - credibility you now have a great thing
08:30 - to add to your resume to add to your
08:32 - portfolio and now we can move on to the
08:34 - next step where we can start really
08:36 - moving into the area where we make some
08:38 - real money so now at this point we've
08:40 - built some building blocks we've
08:41 - developed a bit of a strategy we've
08:43 - networked we' put some content out there
08:45 - and we've done a little bit of coaching
08:46 - and tutoring so we have real people that
08:48 - can back up our skills it's now time to
08:50 - actually start making some real money
08:52 - and what I recommend here is to start
08:54 - freelancing now freelancing is something
08:56 - that could make you as little as a few
08:57 - hundred per month to as much as has tens
08:59 - of thousands of dollars per month it's
09:01 - really up to where you want to take it
09:03 - but this is a natural Next Step before
09:05 - we start talking about something like
09:06 - Landing a full-time job so in order to
09:08 - start freelancing we need to start
09:10 - letting people know that we actually do
09:11 - freelance work now that can start from
09:13 - your social media accounts changing even
09:15 - something like your Instagram bio to say
09:17 - hey I do software freelancing contact me
09:20 - here making a post on LinkedIn making a
09:22 - post on the different content platforms
09:24 - you've been using and just starting to
09:26 - make people aware that you do
09:27 - freelancing work beyond that posting on
09:30 - sites like upwork and Fiverr that can
09:31 - give you some organic discoverability
09:33 - make a really good listing in a really
09:35 - Niche area that's not being covered by a
09:37 - lot of other developers and I guarantee
09:39 - you will see some success and you will
09:41 - see some people coming to you this is
09:43 - exactly what I did again I actually
09:45 - posted a bunch of listings on Fiverr I
09:46 - have an entire video of how I did this
09:48 - how I made my first $500 freelancing you
09:51 - can check it out here and I have another
09:52 - video talking about how to price
09:54 - freelancing projects so I'll put that on
09:56 - the screen as well the point is you
09:58 - absolutely can make money with
09:59 - freelancing but only if you're not
10:01 - another freelance developer what I mean
10:03 - by that is you need to stand out you
10:05 - need to have credibility you need to
10:06 - have something backing you up there
10:08 - needs to be a reason someone would pick
10:09 - you over picking one of the other 10,000
10:11 - people that are doing the same thing now
10:14 - that's why we built those building
10:15 - blocks up we got our testimonials we had
10:17 - proof and now we're specializing in an
10:19 - area where we're actually really really
10:22 - good and people want our skill set we're
10:24 - not begging people to pay us they're
10:26 - begging us to do work for them because
10:28 - they really need what it is that we're
10:29 - offering that is the key here you need
10:31 - to provide more value than you're
10:33 - getting from the person a lot of people
10:35 - think hey I can learn coding for one or
10:36 - two months I can go on a freelancing
10:38 - site and immediately I'm going to make a
10:39 - ton of money doesn't work that way
10:41 - everybody tries to do that you need to
10:43 - be different you need to stand out and
10:44 - most of all you need to act like a
10:46 - professional and someone who's not doing
10:47 - this for the first time even if it's
10:49 - your first time I hate to say it but
10:51 - fake it until you make it the more
10:52 - professional you see the more
10:54 - experienced you are the better success
10:56 - you're going to have and I can say that
10:57 - from experience as someone who's done
10:59 - this for a very very long time and
11:01 - taught a lot of people how to do this as
11:03 - well so ideally at this point you've
11:04 - done some freelancing you've made a
11:06 - little bit of money you've worked on
11:07 - some projects and you've continued to
11:09 - build that Network and that credibility
11:11 - and to provide proof of what you
11:13 - actually know you are actually a
11:15 - developer you can do work you can build
11:17 - out projects and you can point people to
11:19 - examples of exactly where you've done
11:20 - that it's only once you've built that up
11:23 - which only comes through hard work and
11:24 - experience you can actually start making
11:26 - a lot of money now at this point we're
11:28 - probably not making 10K per month most
11:31 - of you if you're doing freelancing are
11:32 - probably making a few hundred per month
11:34 - if you're lucky maybe a few thousand per
11:36 - month now you can definitely scale
11:37 - freelancing up and make well more than
11:39 - $10,000 per month but that is a
11:42 - full-time business and that does take a
11:43 - lot of time so what I'm going to give
11:45 - you here is a few different ideas for
11:47 - how you can hit the 10K per month goal
11:49 - after you've kind of built those
11:51 - different building blocks now the first
11:52 - thing you could do is you can continue
11:54 - with content it's actually fairly simple
11:56 - to make 10K per month from content I've
11:58 - been doing that that now for over 5
12:00 - years and I started making 10K per month
12:02 - when I was just 19 years old the reason
12:04 - from that is that there's so many
12:05 - different ways to monetize your content
12:07 - and at minimum you can drive people from
12:09 - your content to your freelancing and get
12:12 - paid that way obviously if you have a
12:13 - lot of viewership you can do ad Revenue
12:16 - if you have a decent kind of niche of
12:18 - people that are watching your content
12:19 - you can get paid through sponsors you
12:21 - can do affiliate deals there's so much
12:22 - in the content world and it's very
12:24 - exponential once you get into it but I
12:26 - also understand most of you don't want
12:27 - to do that or it's not something that
12:29 - you're going to excel at now beyond that
12:31 - if we move past content you could start
12:33 - your own business you could build your
12:34 - own SAS product you could sell an
12:36 - application those are the riskier of the
12:39 - few they take a lot longer to do and
12:41 - much more susceptible to failure but it
12:44 - is obviously an option and something if
12:45 - you're willing to take the risk you
12:46 - could try and could pay off massively
12:48 - beyond that what I would look for for
12:50 - most of you is either contract jobs or
12:52 - full-time positions a lot of companies
12:54 - don't need developers year round they
12:56 - don't want to hire a full-time Dev but
12:59 - happy to hire developers on contract
13:00 - that they'll be paying for maybe 10
13:02 - hours per week 15 hours per week I've
13:04 - done that quite a bit and typically the
13:06 - contract will have a higher hourly rate
13:08 - than if you were a full-time employee
13:10 - because you don't have benefits you're
13:11 - doing minimum hours etc for example
13:13 - right now I currently have a contract
13:14 - for $100 per hour freelancing I don't do
13:16 - it too often it's maybe five hours per
13:18 - week but it is something that I do have
13:20 - and it's written hey any hours you work
13:21 - for us when we tell you we will pay you
13:24 - this amount of money and obviously The
13:25 - Next Step Beyond that will be to land a
13:27 - full-time job that's paying you a salary
13:29 - you're happy with now most entrylevel
13:31 - positions are not going to be paying
13:32 - $120,000 per year or 10K per month but
13:35 - you might be making 60 70 80k if you're
13:38 - lucky maybe 90 to $100,000 and then
13:40 - combining that with a little bit of
13:41 - freelancing a little bit of tutoring
13:43 - maybe content on the side you can easily
13:45 - surpass 10K per month personally my
13:48 - first 10K per month came from a variety
13:50 - of different sources I did a little bit
13:51 - of freelancing I was making some money
13:53 - from content I made a little bit of
13:55 - money from jobs I was working kind of
13:56 - part-time contract jobs weren't even
13:58 - related two coding but I did eventually
14:00 - hit 10K per month from there I started
14:02 - to realize what I was really good at and
14:04 - where I could actually grow and scale
14:06 - the business that ended up being content
14:08 - and teaching so I went down that Avenue
14:10 - and now I've made $50,000 months
14:12 - $100,000 months but it all started from
14:15 - those building blocks that I walked you
14:16 - through it took me many years to even
14:18 - make my first $1,000 per month from
14:20 - coding now I hope it doesn't take you
14:22 - that long because you have guidance like
14:24 - these videos but that's what I wanted to
14:26 - share here making 10K per month is by no
14:28 - means easy but it's also not impossible
14:30 - if you have the willpower if you have

everybody wants to teach you how to make 10K per month how to achieve your dream life through coding when the reality is this is hard most of you will fail and the strategy to do this in 2024 is significantly different than it used to be the first thing you need to understand is that the golden days of coding are behind us no longer can you learn to code for 2 months and land a sixfigure job at Google now there is still an insane amount of money in this space but more and more of it's being concentrated at the top and the competition is getting steeper and steeper that said you can still absolutely make 10K per month coding but you need to be a little bit more creative and I'll share with you what I mean by that but first as we all know the obvious way to make a lot of money through coding is by running a business or at least being a part of one in the early days now you're probably watching this video because you want to earn money through coding and that means starting a business is key even if it's just a small one and servicing something like a few freelancing clients now that means that you need to check out this free business startup kit from a good friend of the channel HubSpot this business startup kit gives you nine free templates that can help you brainstorm your business's name develop a business plan and even how to pitch your idea to potential investors you can even utilize the business startup cost calculator and feasibility study template to make sure you know what you're getting into before you start I've left a link in the description where you can check this out completely for free now as someone who's run multiple businesses I can say that this is something I definitely wish I had especially during the early days of the business could have saved me a ton of time and thousands of dollars I I definitely recommend you check it out and I want to give a big thank you to HubSpot for making this resource and tons of others completely free and for sponsoring today's video so now we're going to get into a fivestep approach where I talk to you about exactly what you need to do in order to build up to the point where you can be making 10K per month now most of us aren't just going to start a business tomorrow that starts making a ton of money we need to have a strategy and we need to have a structured approach and that's why the first thing we need to do is actually understand what it is we're going to be doing to make 10K per month and start to develop some kind of strategy or plan so that we can work our way towards that goal this isn't something that's going to happen in a few days or even most likely a few months it does take time to get to that income level but once you're able to hit a threshold like 10K per month it really can become quite exponential and you can start to realize how much more money there is in this field and how you can capture just a little piece of it so the first thing I recommend doing and what I personally did to start making money from coding even when I was more of a beginner was specialize and learn something that's Niche now a lot of people would disagree with me they'll say hey you should be a generalist you should know everything now as much as that's great the issue with that is if you know everything you don't stand out in one specific area if you're a senior developer and you have 20 years of experience that's fantastic you can just go get a job and you can make $300,000 per year but for those of us that are just starting out we need to make sure that we become a niche Authority that we actually are really good in one certain area and we can provide enough value in that area that we can get paid if we just know a little bit of python a little bit of JavaScript we can build some basic applications well so can everybody else we need to be good in one area so that people specifically looking for that skill set will find us and are willing to pay us rather than someone who just knows a little bit now to give you the exact way that I did this when I was younger I got really really good at pame pame is a python module for making simple 2D games I got so good at this that a lot of other students in my class and from other schools actually wanted to pay me money to complete their homework assignments not the most ethical thing in the world but since I was really good at P game I actually had enough value in that area where I could sell my skill set students needed py game projects completed they needed it specifically in that framework I knew exactly what the professors and teachers were looking for and I could get all of them A's really easily beyond that I also set up some freelancing gigs online same thing specifically for pame and I started making a few hundred a month doing pame projects and this isn't what was going to lead me to 10K per month but it started to show me that if I knew an individual skill and I was really good in one area even if I wasn't a professional software developer and I wasn't at that point I could still make money and I could still monetize my skill so the first thing that you need to do here is pick a field to specialize in it doesn't need to be as niche as something like P game but it should be a specific framework or a specific library or maybe you're really good at building characters in unity or you're really really good at developing fast API API in Python right it doesn't matter what it is but you need to pick one area you can broaden the scope eventually but you need to start where you can penetrate as deep as possible rather than trying to have this whole broad scope and do everything now once you've picked your Niche and you actually have a bit of a strategy here the next thing you need to do is get your name out there you need to start building credibility and demonstrating that you actually have skills having a resum today is just not enough put on a resume all your skills all your projects everything you know it just doesn't matter employers don't care about that as much as they used to and in this digital age you really need to be presenting your skills online I know a lot of you don't want to hear that but my recommendation here is to post content consistently or at least to be networking with other individuals in the space so that you can start building a group of people that actually know what you do and what you're capable of and when I say post content that doesn't mean you need to become a vlogger doesn't mean you need to be a professional medium post writer it just means that you need to start putting something out there so that people can find you or when they do eventually find you they have something to look at they have something to see they can actually have proof that you know what you're doing and you've built something you have credibility that is where content comes in handy it's something you can point to and that people can find when they look up your name that's why you're posting content not because you're going to be making money from the content you're posting now that could happen eventually and that's actually exactly what ended up happening to me but the point is you need to put your name out there in some way or another so I typically recommend for people that maybe don't want to be on camera or film something write some different blog posts write some medium articles do basic tutorials in the niche that you're really good at share some of the projects you built on LinkedIn make a little story about how you actually developed that start just sharing Insight join some different communities make sure that people know who you are and they know what skill set you have to offer now this will be slow but if you can do this consistently and keep building up proof of what you've actually done it's only going to help you in the future whether you do decide to get a job whether you move more into free Lancing or do some of the other methods I'm going to talk about in this video so once You' started to develop a little bit of credibility online or you at least have something that people can go and look at when they look up your name the next thing I recommend you do is some coaching or teaching now keep in mind this is not what's going to make you 10K per month these are the slow building blocks and personally what I did to eventually reach that Milestone so we want to start by making a little bit of money online and then work our way up slowly so that we build credibility along the way so that we can eventually then land those really high paying clients or those high paying jobs so that's why I'm suggesting at this stage we want to start coaching we want to start tutoring we want to start sharing our knowledge with individuals this is where you can actually start making some real money for example when I was as young as 16 years old I was doing tutoring for 20 or $30 per hour I was tutoring in computer science I was actually tutoring in things like math and regular science and I was tutoring in pretty much anything that someone would pay me for that got me my first client because one of my teachers knew that I was really good in computer science recommended me to one of the parents parents or one of the students who was struggling in one of his other classes and there you go I tutored him from there I got recommendations and referrals and I started to build up a really small tutoring business where people in the school knew that if they needed computer science help I could help them with it now the same thing happened as I moved to University I started getting a few gigs online because I had a little bit of content people would find me or if I would post listings in like the university hallway people could actually go and see my name and go okay this guy actually is good at computer science he has a few articles he knows what he's talking about I'll go to him and I'll pay him $40 per hour for coaching and you get the idea here you can really slowly start to build up a bit of a tutoring business you can build a bit of a client base and then you can start getting referrals and testimonials which again only prove your credibility and provide you with assets that you can monetize later on you're not going to do this overnight it's not something that's going to happen extremely quickly so these are the easiest steps that I can think of to start building up towards that skill so once you've made a little bit of money from tutoring and coaching you have some clients you have some credibility you now have a great thing to add to your resume to add to your portfolio and now we can move on to the next step where we can start really moving into the area where we make some real money so now at this point we've built some building blocks we've developed a bit of a strategy we've networked we' put some content out there and we've done a little bit of coaching and tutoring so we have real people that can back up our skills it's now time to actually start making some real money and what I recommend here is to start freelancing now freelancing is something that could make you as little as a few hundred per month to as much as has tens of thousands of dollars per month it's really up to where you want to take it but this is a natural Next Step before we start talking about something like Landing a fulltime job so in order to start freelancing we need to start letting people know that we actually do freelance work now that can start from your social media accounts changing even something like your Instagram bio to say hey I do software freelancing contact me here making a post on LinkedIn making a post on the different content platforms you've been using and just starting to make people aware that you do freelancing work beyond that posting on sites like upwork and Fiverr that can give you some organic discoverability make a really good listing in a really Niche area that's not being covered by a lot of other developers and I guarantee you will see some success and you will see some people coming to you this is exactly what I did again I actually posted a bunch of listings on Fiverr I have an entire video of how I did this how I made my first $500 freelancing you can check it out here and I have another video talking about how to price freelancing projects so I'll put that on the screen as well the point is you absolutely can make money with freelancing but only if you're not another freelance developer what I mean by that is you need to stand out you need to have credibility you need to have something backing you up there needs to be a reason someone would pick you over picking one of the other 10,000 people that are doing the same thing now that's why we built those building blocks up we got our testimonials we had proof and now we're specializing in an area where we're actually really really good and people want our skill set we're not begging people to pay us they're begging us to do work for them because they really need what it is that we're offering that is the key here you need to provide more value than you're getting from the person a lot of people think hey I can learn coding for one or two months I can go on a freelancing site and immediately I'm going to make a ton of money doesn't work that way everybody tries to do that you need to be different you need to stand out and most of all you need to act like a professional and someone who's not doing this for the first time even if it's your first time I hate to say it but fake it until you make it the more professional you see the more experienced you are the better success you're going to have and I can say that from experience as someone who's done this for a very very long time and taught a lot of people how to do this as well so ideally at this point you've done some freelancing you've made a little bit of money you've worked on some projects and you've continued to build that Network and that credibility and to provide proof of what you actually know you are actually a developer you can do work you can build out projects and you can point people to examples of exactly where you've done that it's only once you've built that up which only comes through hard work and experience you can actually start making a lot of money now at this point we're probably not making 10K per month most of you if you're doing freelancing are probably making a few hundred per month if you're lucky maybe a few thousand per month now you can definitely scale freelancing up and make well more than $10,000 per month but that is a fulltime business and that does take a lot of time so what I'm going to give you here is a few different ideas for how you can hit the 10K per month goal after you've kind of built those different building blocks now the first thing you could do is you can continue with content it's actually fairly simple to make 10K per month from content I've been doing that that now for over 5 years and I started making 10K per month when I was just 19 years old the reason from that is that there's so many different ways to monetize your content and at minimum you can drive people from your content to your freelancing and get paid that way obviously if you have a lot of viewership you can do ad Revenue if you have a decent kind of niche of people that are watching your content you can get paid through sponsors you can do affiliate deals there's so much in the content world and it's very exponential once you get into it but I also understand most of you don't want to do that or it's not something that you're going to excel at now beyond that if we move past content you could start your own business you could build your own SAS product you could sell an application those are the riskier of the few they take a lot longer to do and much more susceptible to failure but it is obviously an option and something if you're willing to take the risk you could try and could pay off massively beyond that what I would look for for most of you is either contract jobs or fulltime positions a lot of companies don't need developers year round they don't want to hire a fulltime Dev but happy to hire developers on contract that they'll be paying for maybe 10 hours per week 15 hours per week I've done that quite a bit and typically the contract will have a higher hourly rate than if you were a fulltime employee because you don't have benefits you're doing minimum hours etc for example right now I currently have a contract for $100 per hour freelancing I don't do it too often it's maybe five hours per week but it is something that I do have and it's written hey any hours you work for us when we tell you we will pay you this amount of money and obviously The Next Step Beyond that will be to land a fulltime job that's paying you a salary you're happy with now most entrylevel positions are not going to be paying $120,000 per year or 10K per month but you might be making 60 70 80k if you're lucky maybe 90 to $100,000 and then combining that with a little bit of freelancing a little bit of tutoring maybe content on the side you can easily surpass 10K per month personally my first 10K per month came from a variety of different sources I did a little bit of freelancing I was making some money from content I made a little bit of money from jobs I was working kind of parttime contract jobs weren't even related two coding but I did eventually hit 10K per month from there I started to realize what I was really good at and where I could actually grow and scale the business that ended up being content and teaching so I went down that Avenue and now I've made $50,000 months $100,000 months but it all started from those building blocks that I walked you through it took me many years to even make my first $1,000 per month from coding now I hope it doesn't take you that long because you have guidance like these videos but that's what I wanted to share here making 10K per month is by no means easy but it's also not impossible if you have the willpower if you have the right strategy and if you're willing to follow along with the hard work and go through those steps it's definitely something achievable with that said I will wrap up the video here I hope you enjoyed if you did leave a like subscribe and I will see you in the next one
