00:00 - hey guys so welcome to the second video
00:03 - in the series um if you remember in the
00:06 - last video we talked about data types
00:08 - and variables we want briefly into some
00:11 - of the things that Python can do today
00:13 - I'm going to be talking about operators
00:15 - and we're going to be doing some print
00:18 - statements some input a little a few
00:21 - small console applications I'm just
00:23 - applying some of the knowledge that
00:24 - we've learned so pretty much the first
00:27 - thing I want to do is I want to go back
00:28 - and I want to view what we did in the
00:29 - last lesson very quickly so we talked
00:31 - about variables and data types so for
00:32 - example will be X variable we could set
00:34 - it to something equal to two like that a
00:36 - name we made equal to our name right so
00:39 - I make that equal to Tim so there we go
00:42 - we have the name right there equal to 10
00:44 - we'll start with that okay
00:46 - now if you remember the last one I
00:48 - didn't talk about this but I used
00:49 - something called print now the print
00:51 - statement pretty much takes an argument
00:53 - so inside these brackets the thing that
00:57 - is inside that brackets is called the
00:58 - argument so it takes a string argument
01:02 - usually so I will give it the name so
01:05 - now you'll see again we did this in a
01:06 - lasso I just want a review i'm clicking
01:08 - f5 simply to run the program when i go
01:10 - to the console it simply puts tim onto
01:13 - the console just like that right okay um
01:17 - very basic we already doing that so now
01:19 - let's say well we want to do something
01:22 - else so let's let's print here and we're
01:25 - just going to put a string and we're
01:26 - just going to type this in ourselves
01:27 - let's say hello comma what is your name
01:34 - that's going to print to the console now
01:36 - we want to get what the user's name is
01:39 - now there's a way to do this in Python
01:41 - it's very simple we're going to make a
01:43 - variable name it makes sense to put the
01:45 - variable name here do an equal sign
01:48 - because it's a variable right we're
01:50 - going to type the word input just like
01:53 - this now what's going to happen if I run
01:56 - the program here I'll show you is going
01:59 - to say hello what is your name and it
02:01 - can actually allow me now to type into
02:03 - the console which I couldn't do before
02:05 - now nothing happens after when I click
02:07 - enter because we don't have anything
02:08 - else after that
02:09 - but it's allowing me to type okay so now
02:14 - well we want to print out what the name
02:15 - is that was said so let's just simply
02:17 - type print and then name alright and we
02:23 - have hello what is your name I say oh
02:24 - well my name is Tim it says Tim all
02:27 - right now well we just printed out the
02:31 - name but maybe we want to go a little
02:32 - more advanced than that we want to say
02:34 - well hello Tim how are you doing Tim
02:36 - something like that right so I'm going
02:38 - to just put a comma here I'm going to
02:41 - separate these two things and I'm going
02:43 - to put in a string I'm just going to
02:45 - type it like the types let me say hello
02:46 - with a comma and then you see that I
02:50 - have this other comma here that is
02:52 - outside of the quotations meaning it's
02:53 - not a string it's actually just
02:54 - separating the two arguments in here and
02:57 - you'll notice what happens now when I
02:59 - print is it goes hello is your name's I
03:02 - say oh my name is Jim it says hello
03:05 - Tim right so let's pretty
03:07 - straightforward I hope that's easy to
03:08 - understand we're just using the input to
03:10 - get an input and then we're printing it
03:12 - back out to the screen okay so let's do
03:15 - let's go into the next part of this now
03:16 - we'll use that again later but let's
03:18 - talk about operators so operator that
03:21 - term may sound familiar to you in math
03:24 - we use things called operators so these
03:27 - four offers hopefully should look
03:28 - familiar to you this is a plus sign this
03:31 - is the addition operator we have the
03:34 - minus sign which is the subtraction
03:35 - operator the division sign which is the
03:38 - well division operator and then the
03:40 - multiplication sign which is again the
03:42 - multiplication operator so there's a few
03:45 - more operators I will talk about but
03:47 - these are the four basic ones in Python
03:50 - now you remember how I talked to you
03:51 - about data types this is where this
03:53 - comes in when we use these operators
03:55 - it's important that we use them on
03:57 - certain data types so for example in
04:00 - math I could do something like 3 plus 4
04:03 - right so what is 3 plus 4 equal well
04:05 - that is equal to 7 so the computer can
04:08 - actually do that math operation by using
04:10 - that operator to return this value so
04:12 - let's let's give an example here quickly
04:14 - so I have let's do num1 we're going to
04:18 - use variables here remember I can use a
04:20 - number in the variable as long as it's
04:22 - not at the beginning and I'm going to
04:23 - give it a value of 45 and then we'll do
04:25 - num2 and we're going to
04:27 - a value of three now if I want to print
04:30 - to the console let's say num1 plus num2
04:35 - well you can guess what that's going to
04:37 - give us it's going to give us 45 plus 3d
04:41 - I hope this is not air yeah so that gave
04:45 - us 48 right so oops didn't mean to make
04:48 - that fullscreen num1 plus num2 is 48 all
04:52 - right so now what about - let's try this
04:56 - 42 basic we can do multiplication here
05:00 - with the multiplication sign there you
05:04 - go 135 and then we'll try again with the
05:07 - division sign just to show you all of
05:09 - them we get 15 point Oh like that okay
05:12 - so that's pretty straightforward on
05:14 - those four basic operators now in Python
05:18 - there's a few more operators that we
05:20 - want to talk about now for example in
05:22 - math we have something called exponents
05:24 - right so how do we do exponents in
05:25 - Python well it's actually 2 stars is how
05:29 - you do an exponent all right and now
05:31 - maybe there's something called integer
05:33 - division which I'll get into later but
05:35 - I'll just show you the operated for it
05:36 - right now it's two slashes that means
05:39 - I'll give you an example of math example
05:41 - here 64 divided by let's do 10 would
05:47 - give us usually in math a value of 6.4
05:50 - right that's if you use one division
05:53 - sign sorry what am i doing times I mean
05:55 - divided by will give us 64
05:58 - I've 6.4 but now if we do two division
06:00 - signs here like this it actually gives
06:02 - us a value of 6 that's because it just
06:05 - it doesn't worry about the remainder at
06:07 - all it just tells us how many times 10
06:10 - can go into 64 and that's all it can go
06:14 - in 6 times evenly so it gives us a whole
06:16 - number as our answer that's called
06:18 - integer division this double double
06:21 - slash like this okay and then we have
06:24 - another operator which is actually the
06:27 - modulus operator so this is the
06:30 - percentage sign and this gives us B
06:32 - remainder so here if I do five modulus
06:37 - two
06:38 - then the remainder of that is actually 1
06:42 - because 5 divided by 2 is 4 then with a
06:45 - remainder of 1 right so it's not going
06:47 - to give us the decimal point it's again
06:48 - just going to give us the remainder if I
06:49 - did 5 divided by 4 again the remainder
06:52 - is 1 5 divided by 3 the remainder would
06:54 - be 2 like that ok so that's what the
06:56 - modulus sign gives us so both modules
06:58 - here and then there's probably a few
07:00 - others that I'm forgetting about but we
07:03 - can go into those later
07:05 - so now same thing let's keep using our
07:08 - number of variables here and now let's
07:09 - introduce a third variable called num 3
07:12 - now I want to show you how we can use
07:15 - the variables so num 1 and let's see if
07:17 - you remember what this operator is so
07:20 - that's the exponent operator so that
07:21 - means num 1 which is going to be our
07:22 - base which is 45 raised to the power of
07:26 - 4 because we're gonna use num2 and we
07:28 - can print num 3 press ok and you can see
07:36 - we get a pretty large number that's
07:37 - because of how exponents work and then
07:40 - same thing here if we want to do maybe
07:43 - integer division see what we're gonna
07:45 - get we had 11 write a whole number and
07:49 - then say we won't do modulus we get 1
07:56 - okay so now let's tie all these things
07:58 - together with the operators that we've
08:00 - used the variables the prints and the
08:02 - inputs so um let's start by just get
08:06 - doing with print statement saying pick a
08:09 - number
08:12 - okay pretty basic we're gonna pick a
08:14 - number and then we're going to take the
08:16 - inputs we're going to say number 1 again
08:17 - is equal to the input of that okay so we
08:23 - got the input a number 1 now let's say
08:26 - print pick another number
08:34 - all right so now we're going to pick
08:36 - another number so we're going to do num2
08:37 - is equal to input like that and now what
08:41 - we're going to do is we're gonna
08:42 - introduce our third variable so we'll
08:43 - call it sum because we're going to add
08:45 - these equal to num 1 plus not me - and
08:49 - now actually you can't use some because
08:51 - it's a reserved word so let's just do in
08:53 - all capital sum because remember how we
08:55 - talked to a variables capitals and
08:57 - lowercase they're different and then
08:58 - we're going to print to the console the
09:02 - sum like that okay so we run the program
09:07 - sets pick a number let's figure number
09:09 - let's say 4 and let's do 32 now what do
09:12 - you think it's going to be oh oops okay
09:17 - so yeah someone because num1 plus num2
09:22 - okay so this is why i talked about
09:25 - datatypes so I'm actually happy this
09:27 - happened it's because what actually
09:28 - happens when we get the input of
09:30 - something is it gives us the type of a
09:32 - string which in this case is not what we
09:36 - wanted to do so you saw there I'll run
09:39 - it again it's a good mistake this
09:41 - happened actually we have four and we
09:43 - have a three and it gave us 43 that's
09:45 - just because we added the string four to
09:48 - the string three so that simply gave us
09:50 - 43 but now we know an actual math that 4
09:52 - plus 3 equals 7 so if we want to do the
09:55 - integers we have to actually convert
09:57 - these variables into integers so in
10:00 - order to do that remember I showed you
10:01 - the keyword int like this before we're
10:05 - just going to put brackets around our
10:07 - two variables here like this experience
10:10 - and now hopefully we should get the
10:14 - correct answer when we do 4 and we do 3
10:16 - and you can see we've got 7 so I didn't
10:19 - mean for that to happen originally but
10:20 - I'm happy it did because it shows us why
10:23 - data types are important so when we take
10:25 - the input of something we're typing it
10:27 - from the keyboard and that is actually a
10:29 - string so here we can print again don't
10:33 - worry about what I'm doing right now but
10:34 - I just want to show you the type which
10:36 - is going to give us if it's a string if
10:37 - it's an integer of num2 just to show you
10:39 - what the type actually is so we pick a
10:43 - number we pick 2 and we pick 3 it tells
10:46 - us that
10:47 - three is actually a string so that's why
10:50 - when we added originally three and two
10:52 - or two and three or whatever it was it
10:54 - gave us just them added together sub two
10:57 - and three rather than what it should be
10:59 - which is five okay
11:01 - now same thing here if we had a number
11:04 - and we wanted to convert it into a
11:06 - string all we would do is we'd type STR
11:09 - around the numbers so for example three
11:11 - and then that would give us three just
11:15 - like that so string so now we've kind of
11:18 - gone over conversion of variables
11:21 - conversion of numbers datatypes how to
11:23 - get input from the console using the
11:25 - input like this and some basic operators
11:28 - of Python so view this I hope you
11:32 - followed along and then in the next
11:35 - lesson move into some more advanced
11:36 - operators and we'll maybe start with
11:39 - conditions okay I hope you enjoyed
11:41 - please subscribe like the video and I'll
11:44 - see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys so welcome to the second video in the series um if you remember in the last video we talked about data types and variables we want briefly into some of the things that Python can do today I'm going to be talking about operators and we're going to be doing some print statements some input a little a few small console applications I'm just applying some of the knowledge that we've learned so pretty much the first thing I want to do is I want to go back and I want to view what we did in the last lesson very quickly so we talked about variables and data types so for example will be X variable we could set it to something equal to two like that a name we made equal to our name right so I make that equal to Tim so there we go we have the name right there equal to 10 we'll start with that okay now if you remember the last one I didn't talk about this but I used something called print now the print statement pretty much takes an argument so inside these brackets the thing that is inside that brackets is called the argument so it takes a string argument usually so I will give it the name so now you'll see again we did this in a lasso I just want a review i'm clicking f5 simply to run the program when i go to the console it simply puts tim onto the console just like that right okay um very basic we already doing that so now let's say well we want to do something else so let's let's print here and we're just going to put a string and we're just going to type this in ourselves let's say hello comma what is your name that's going to print to the console now we want to get what the user's name is now there's a way to do this in Python it's very simple we're going to make a variable name it makes sense to put the variable name here do an equal sign because it's a variable right we're going to type the word input just like this now what's going to happen if I run the program here I'll show you is going to say hello what is your name and it can actually allow me now to type into the console which I couldn't do before now nothing happens after when I click enter because we don't have anything else after that but it's allowing me to type okay so now well we want to print out what the name is that was said so let's just simply type print and then name alright and we have hello what is your name I say oh well my name is Tim it says Tim all right now well we just printed out the name but maybe we want to go a little more advanced than that we want to say well hello Tim how are you doing Tim something like that right so I'm going to just put a comma here I'm going to separate these two things and I'm going to put in a string I'm just going to type it like the types let me say hello with a comma and then you see that I have this other comma here that is outside of the quotations meaning it's not a string it's actually just separating the two arguments in here and you'll notice what happens now when I print is it goes hello is your name's I say oh my name is Jim it says hello Tim right so let's pretty straightforward I hope that's easy to understand we're just using the input to get an input and then we're printing it back out to the screen okay so let's do let's go into the next part of this now we'll use that again later but let's talk about operators so operator that term may sound familiar to you in math we use things called operators so these four offers hopefully should look familiar to you this is a plus sign this is the addition operator we have the minus sign which is the subtraction operator the division sign which is the well division operator and then the multiplication sign which is again the multiplication operator so there's a few more operators I will talk about but these are the four basic ones in Python now you remember how I talked to you about data types this is where this comes in when we use these operators it's important that we use them on certain data types so for example in math I could do something like 3 plus 4 right so what is 3 plus 4 equal well that is equal to 7 so the computer can actually do that math operation by using that operator to return this value so let's let's give an example here quickly so I have let's do num1 we're going to use variables here remember I can use a number in the variable as long as it's not at the beginning and I'm going to give it a value of 45 and then we'll do num2 and we're going to a value of three now if I want to print to the console let's say num1 plus num2 well you can guess what that's going to give us it's going to give us 45 plus 3d I hope this is not air yeah so that gave us 48 right so oops didn't mean to make that fullscreen num1 plus num2 is 48 all right so now what about let's try this 42 basic we can do multiplication here with the multiplication sign there you go 135 and then we'll try again with the division sign just to show you all of them we get 15 point Oh like that okay so that's pretty straightforward on those four basic operators now in Python there's a few more operators that we want to talk about now for example in math we have something called exponents right so how do we do exponents in Python well it's actually 2 stars is how you do an exponent all right and now maybe there's something called integer division which I'll get into later but I'll just show you the operated for it right now it's two slashes that means I'll give you an example of math example here 64 divided by let's do 10 would give us usually in math a value of 6.4 right that's if you use one division sign sorry what am i doing times I mean divided by will give us 64 I've 6.4 but now if we do two division signs here like this it actually gives us a value of 6 that's because it just it doesn't worry about the remainder at all it just tells us how many times 10 can go into 64 and that's all it can go in 6 times evenly so it gives us a whole number as our answer that's called integer division this double double slash like this okay and then we have another operator which is actually the modulus operator so this is the percentage sign and this gives us B remainder so here if I do five modulus two then the remainder of that is actually 1 because 5 divided by 2 is 4 then with a remainder of 1 right so it's not going to give us the decimal point it's again just going to give us the remainder if I did 5 divided by 4 again the remainder is 1 5 divided by 3 the remainder would be 2 like that ok so that's what the modulus sign gives us so both modules here and then there's probably a few others that I'm forgetting about but we can go into those later so now same thing let's keep using our number of variables here and now let's introduce a third variable called num 3 now I want to show you how we can use the variables so num 1 and let's see if you remember what this operator is so that's the exponent operator so that means num 1 which is going to be our base which is 45 raised to the power of 4 because we're gonna use num2 and we can print num 3 press ok and you can see we get a pretty large number that's because of how exponents work and then same thing here if we want to do maybe integer division see what we're gonna get we had 11 write a whole number and then say we won't do modulus we get 1 okay so now let's tie all these things together with the operators that we've used the variables the prints and the inputs so um let's start by just get doing with print statement saying pick a number okay pretty basic we're gonna pick a number and then we're going to take the inputs we're going to say number 1 again is equal to the input of that okay so we got the input a number 1 now let's say print pick another number all right so now we're going to pick another number so we're going to do num2 is equal to input like that and now what we're going to do is we're gonna introduce our third variable so we'll call it sum because we're going to add these equal to num 1 plus not me and now actually you can't use some because it's a reserved word so let's just do in all capital sum because remember how we talked to a variables capitals and lowercase they're different and then we're going to print to the console the sum like that okay so we run the program sets pick a number let's figure number let's say 4 and let's do 32 now what do you think it's going to be oh oops okay so yeah someone because num1 plus num2 okay so this is why i talked about datatypes so I'm actually happy this happened it's because what actually happens when we get the input of something is it gives us the type of a string which in this case is not what we wanted to do so you saw there I'll run it again it's a good mistake this happened actually we have four and we have a three and it gave us 43 that's just because we added the string four to the string three so that simply gave us 43 but now we know an actual math that 4 plus 3 equals 7 so if we want to do the integers we have to actually convert these variables into integers so in order to do that remember I showed you the keyword int like this before we're just going to put brackets around our two variables here like this experience and now hopefully we should get the correct answer when we do 4 and we do 3 and you can see we've got 7 so I didn't mean for that to happen originally but I'm happy it did because it shows us why data types are important so when we take the input of something we're typing it from the keyboard and that is actually a string so here we can print again don't worry about what I'm doing right now but I just want to show you the type which is going to give us if it's a string if it's an integer of num2 just to show you what the type actually is so we pick a number we pick 2 and we pick 3 it tells us that three is actually a string so that's why when we added originally three and two or two and three or whatever it was it gave us just them added together sub two and three rather than what it should be which is five okay now same thing here if we had a number and we wanted to convert it into a string all we would do is we'd type STR around the numbers so for example three and then that would give us three just like that so string so now we've kind of gone over conversion of variables conversion of numbers datatypes how to get input from the console using the input like this and some basic operators of Python so view this I hope you followed along and then in the next lesson move into some more advanced operators and we'll maybe start with conditions okay I hope you enjoyed please
