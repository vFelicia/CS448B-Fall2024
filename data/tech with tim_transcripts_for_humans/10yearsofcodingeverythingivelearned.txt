00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:12 - going to be going through everything
00:14 - that i have learned over the past 10
00:16 - years of programming now i started to
00:18 - program back in 2011 when i was only 11
00:22 - years old obviously not doing anything
00:24 - very complicated but this is kind of
00:26 - where my journey began and you're gonna
00:28 - see this has been a long journey with
00:29 - lots of difficulties and it makes a very
00:31 - interesting story anyways hopefully as i
00:34 - go through this video i'll give you kind
00:35 - of a curriculum or outline of things you
00:37 - may want to learn however if you are new
00:40 - to programming or looking to upgrade
00:41 - your skills you should check out
00:44 - programmingexpert.io from the link in
00:46 - the description this is a brand new
00:47 - course that i have just released with
00:49 - the algo expert team we've been working
00:51 - on this for like six months it has a ton
00:53 - of awesome content and it gives you a
00:55 - complete structure and guide on one page
00:58 - of pretty much everything you need to
01:00 - know to master program any support you
01:02 - guys could provide would be awesome i'm
01:04 - super passionate about this and again if
01:06 - you guys are new to programming or just
01:08 - trying to get better definitely check
01:10 - this out programming expert dot io
01:12 - anyways with that said let's go back to
01:14 - 2011 and i will tell you what i remember
01:17 - back then when i was learning how to
01:18 - code all right so the details in the
01:20 - first few years here might be slightly
01:22 - inaccurate because my memory is not that
01:24 - good but i do know that back in 2011
01:27 - this is kind of when i started to
01:28 - realize that i wanted to get into some
01:30 - type of stem related field i really
01:33 - hated art i hated anything creative i
01:35 - hated music and english and all of that
01:37 - but i loved math i loved science and i
01:39 - really liked building stuff i liked
01:41 - doing kind of like mechanical
01:42 - engineering type work now what i was
01:45 - doing back then was working with lego
01:46 - robots i was uh making like model cars
01:50 - catapults anything that had like a
01:52 - little engineering kind of sense to it i
01:54 - really really enjoy and so this is how i
01:56 - got my first taste of programming
01:58 - because i was working with lego robotics
02:00 - and you can program those you can make
02:02 - them so they go forward or so if the
02:03 - sensor is activated it turns to the left
02:05 - or it picks something up and that's kind
02:07 - of how i got into programming back then
02:10 - was i had this block based editor and i
02:12 - would say okay turn the motor you know
02:14 - 360 degrees okay if the sensor is
02:17 - activated back up whatever you guys get
02:19 - what i'm saying but that was the first
02:21 - introduction of programming back in
02:22 - 2011.
02:24 - alright so fast forward to 2012 i am 12
02:27 - years old and this is when i start
02:29 - actually looking at html and css now i
02:31 - don't know exactly how i ended up
02:33 - getting to this topic but i do remember
02:35 - that i was very obsessed with learning
02:37 - at that age i would come home from
02:38 - school immediately go on my laptop start
02:41 - watching all kinds of youtube videos and
02:43 - just like experimenting with stuff and
02:45 - looking at all kinds of different topics
02:47 - and areas so i probably was googling
02:49 - like what is coding or like how does a
02:51 - computer work or something like that and
02:53 - ended up coming across an html and css
02:56 - tutorial now i remember very clearly
02:58 - that this tutorial was from bucky in
03:00 - fact i watched like hundreds of bucky's
03:01 - videos when i was a kid some of you may
03:04 - know his channel i'll put it up on the
03:05 - screen anyways i end up learning the
03:07 - basics of html the basics of css and in
03:10 - my mind i am programming i am writing
03:12 - code and i am like you know mega genius
03:14 - at 12 years old at least that's what i
03:16 - thought so i start messing with that
03:18 - stuff i'm really really interested in it
03:20 - and i just love the fact that i can go
03:21 - on my computer type in a few lines of
03:23 - code and see something appear in my web
03:25 - browser
03:26 - i really don't have any good idea of
03:28 - what i'm doing i'm just watching a ton
03:30 - of video tutorials and that's pretty
03:31 - much all that's happening in 2012. so
03:34 - fast forward to 2013 i've now done a
03:37 - bunch of html and css i'm able to make
03:39 - some very very basic web pages and kind
03:42 - of style them to some level and i start
03:44 - looking at javascript and php now
03:47 - javascript clearly is kind of a natural
03:49 - follow-up from html i'm now handling
03:51 - events on the website so when you click
03:53 - the button maybe i'm showing you a
03:54 - pop-up where i'm generating a random
03:56 - number or i'm doing something relatively
03:58 - trivial with javascript and then after
04:00 - javascript i'm like okay well now i know
04:02 - how to kind of handle stuff on the
04:03 - website how can i make a functioning
04:05 - website that's going to maybe store data
04:07 - so i start looking at php now i don't
04:10 - look at php for very long this is really
04:12 - complicated to me i don't really
04:13 - understand databases and all that kind
04:15 - of stuff and what ends up happening now
04:17 - in 2013 is i start to realize that i
04:20 - don't really like working on websites
04:22 - i'm not a fan of html i'm not a fan of
04:25 - kind of designing stuff in aesthetics i
04:27 - really liked the javascript programming
04:29 - and the php that was way more fun to me
04:32 - working kind of the logic in the back
04:34 - end of the website again i know it's not
04:36 - really the back end but in my mind it
04:38 - was behind the scenes because i didn't
04:39 - actually see the code that i was writing
04:41 - and so what i did is start looking for
04:43 - stuff that was kind of similar to that
04:44 - that i could mess around with so
04:46 - eventually i found vbs which is a visual
04:48 - basic script and i started writing kind
04:50 - of like little viruses or prank scripts
04:52 - that i could run on my friend's computer
04:54 - so for example i would write a script
04:55 - that would like constantly open the disk
04:57 - drive so it would open the disk drive
04:58 - and then if you push it in it would open
05:00 - it again where it would like rapidly
05:02 - toggle the caps locks button so you
05:03 - couldn't type something obviously i
05:05 - didn't leave these running on the
05:06 - computers i would just put them on kind
05:07 - of like prank them and then turn them
05:09 - off but that's what i was doing at that
05:11 - age now i also ended up jailbreaking a
05:13 - bunch of people's ipods i started kind
05:15 - of looking at more of the hacking side
05:16 - of technology and trying to manipulate
05:18 - stuff that i would use every day as
05:21 - opposed to creating brand new things
05:23 - alright so that was 2013 i'm kind of
05:24 - this immature child that's decent at
05:26 - like technology has some technology
05:28 - literacy and is like messing with people
05:30 - and making pranks and kind of vbs
05:32 - scripts and stuff like that and now we
05:34 - fast forward to 2014 where i start
05:36 - eventually learning c sharp now again
05:39 - this is coming from the realization that
05:40 - i really don't like web development the
05:42 - only thing i did like if it was pretty
05:44 - much the javascript and so i've got
05:46 - through my vbs stage i'm not really that
05:48 - interested in kind of pranking people
05:49 - anymore and what i want to do is learn a
05:51 - legitimate programming language so i end
05:53 - up coming across c sharp don't really
05:55 - know how and start trying to learn that
05:57 - for probably six months to a year so
05:59 - anyways i'm learning c sharp i'm
06:01 - continuing to kind of get better at it
06:03 - i'm learning about a strongly typed
06:04 - language i'm getting into stuff like
06:06 - functions arguments parameters and a lot
06:08 - of words that i just don't even
06:10 - understand at the age of 14 and well
06:12 - it's taking me a really long time to
06:14 - learn this i'm finding this really
06:15 - challenging but that's why i keep
06:17 - learning it because it's kind of one of
06:18 - the first things that i've found that is
06:20 - difficult and that's really testing my
06:22 - mind and my ability so anyways i learned
06:24 - c sharp for pretty much the entire year
06:26 - by the end of learning this for about
06:28 - you know six eight months whatever i'm
06:29 - working on graphical user interfaces
06:32 - kind of messing around with net
06:33 - technology i'm making stuff like
06:35 - calculators i'm making stuff like uh you
06:37 - know graphing programs that can graph
06:39 - like a line and at this point i believe
06:41 - i'm probably in grade nine and i'm
06:43 - showing this to some of my friends
06:44 - showing it to my parents all that kind
06:46 - of stuff anyways that's pretty much all
06:48 - i can remember from 2014 now let's go to
06:50 - 2015. so in 2015 i'm now probably
06:52 - entering grade 10 in high school and i'm
06:55 - taking my first computer science course
06:57 - in high school so in this course we're
06:59 - learning action script now actionscript
07:02 - is something that allows you to program
07:03 - flash games i already have a programming
07:05 - fundamental base i kind of know
07:07 - functions i know like you know basic
07:09 - programming concepts so this course is
07:11 - very very easy for me and so i'm always
07:14 - kind of asking the teacher hey what can
07:15 - i do next is there anything more
07:16 - difficult can you challenge me and he
07:18 - says hey maybe you should join the
07:20 - computer science club so in grade 10 i
07:22 - joined the computer science club and in
07:24 - this club they're actually preparing you
07:26 - to write a competition called the ccc
07:28 - now the ccc is the canadian computing
07:30 - competition hosted by the university of
07:33 - waterloo it's pretty much like five data
07:35 - structures and algorithm questions you
07:37 - get like three hours to answer them and
07:39 - depending on how many test cases you
07:41 - pass on all of the questions you could
07:43 - get invited to round two where you
07:44 - actually go to the university of
07:46 - waterloo and compete against like the
07:48 - best high school programs anyways i
07:50 - realized very quickly that i can't
07:52 - actually write this competition in c
07:54 - sharp which is kind of my main
07:55 - programming language at this point and
07:57 - so i asked my teacher hey what language
07:59 - should i learn because they don't have
08:01 - that as an option for me to submit my
08:02 - code with
08:03 - and he says well you should probably
08:05 - learn python that's what we're going to
08:06 - be doing next year in computer science
08:08 - and the year after and python is just a
08:11 - pretty easy language to learn for
08:12 - beginners so this is where i start
08:14 - getting into python i absolutely love
08:16 - python as soon as i pick it up and i
08:18 - study it for a few months before
08:19 - eventually writing the ccc competition
08:22 - that i end up doing very very poorly on
08:24 - i hadn't really prepared for it very
08:26 - much it was pretty challenging a lot of
08:27 - these questions were kind of math heavy
08:29 - as well and they increase in difficulty
08:31 - from one to five so i probably
08:33 - successfully answered like the first two
08:35 - questions and then completely failed the
08:37 - rest of them but i remember being
08:38 - motivated to kind of come back the next
08:40 - year and try to do better so that's
08:42 - pretty much 2015 this is when i started
08:43 - taking programming a bit more serious
08:45 - it's kind of more of a serious hobby now
08:47 - i'm doing it almost every day and i'm
08:49 - really really enjoying it and starting
08:51 - to realize that this is probably a
08:52 - career path for me all right so now we
08:54 - go to 2016. now 2016 i'm 16 years old i
08:58 - am in grade 11 and i'm taking my
09:01 - computer science course in grade 11. now
09:03 - in this course we're learning basic
09:05 - python i already know all of this
09:07 - because i've been continually learning
09:08 - python since that competition last year
09:11 - and again i sign up for the computer
09:12 - science club where i'm going to compete
09:14 - in the ccc now this year in the ccc i do
09:17 - much better i'm a few points away from
09:19 - actually being being invited to kind of
09:21 - the next round at university of waterloo
09:23 - i'm starting to get way better at
09:25 - programming i'm learning stuff like pie
09:27 - game i'm learning python modules i'm
09:29 - learning object oriented programming and
09:31 - i'm really starting to kind of dive head
09:33 - first into this field and realize that i
09:35 - really enjoy this and i really want to
09:37 - be good at this now other than that i'm
09:38 - probably just working on some larger
09:40 - python projects and actually i believe
09:42 - at this point in time i start looking
09:44 - into xcode and developing ios
09:46 - applications so i remember i wanted to
09:48 - make an ios app that would allow me to
09:50 - like categorize photos of my textbooks
09:53 - so this is kind of a little tangent but
09:55 - i'll tell it because it's an interesting
09:56 - story so i always had to walk to school
09:58 - my walk was like 20 to 25 minutes so i
10:01 - hated having to carry my textbooks
10:03 - because they were super heavy and it was
10:04 - really annoying to walk home with the
10:06 - textbooks so what i did is i would
10:08 - always take photos of any of the
10:09 - homework pages from my textbook so i
10:11 - never had to carry them home i could
10:13 - just do them off my phone but then i
10:15 - would go to my camera roll and i would
10:16 - have like hundreds of photos and i
10:17 - wouldn't be able to find the page so i
10:19 - wanted to make an ios app for my phone
10:22 - where i could just like take a picture
10:23 - of the uh of the textbook page it would
10:26 - automatically like group it into
10:28 - sections or subjects and give me the
10:30 - page number and all of that so i ended
10:32 - up working on that for like six months
10:34 - actually ended up making the app and it
10:35 - worked successfully and i put it on my
10:37 - phone so that was kind of uh you know a
10:39 - cool tangent kind of a side project
10:40 - going on where i was learning swift and
10:42 - objective c and just messing around with
10:45 - xcode and eventually creating this you
10:46 - know very simple app but something i was
10:48 - pretty proud of anyways i think that's
10:50 - pretty much it for 2016. now let's go to
10:52 - 2017. all right so 2017 is probably one
10:55 - of the most important years in my life
10:56 - so far i'm only 21 so take that with a
10:59 - grain of salt but anyways this is grade
11:01 - 12 this is when i really start to get
11:03 - passionate about computer science i know
11:05 - i'm going to go to school for computer
11:06 - science next year i've already applied
11:08 - to a bunch of universities and i'm in my
11:10 - grade 12 computer science course i'm
11:12 - learning big-o notation data structures
11:14 - and algorithms i'm continuing to work
11:16 - with a ton of python modules and i'm
11:18 - just a much more confident and competent
11:20 - program
11:21 - at this point in time i also start
11:23 - working at a summer camp as a stem
11:25 - program coordinator now this means i'm
11:27 - actually running a coding specialty and
11:29 - i'm teaching kids between the age of 11
11:31 - and 15 how to code at a summer camp and
11:33 - i'm actually teaching them python code
11:35 - so a real programming language and this
11:38 - is when i realized that i really enjoy
11:39 - teaching i'm super happy doing that and
11:42 - so i start the youtube channel where i
11:43 - start teaching python too well all of
11:45 - you now at some point in time during
11:47 - this year i start posting more and more
11:49 - videos on youtube this would be when i
11:51 - created something like the golf game
11:52 - that some of you may have seen on this
11:54 - channel it's a python kind of like mini
11:56 - golf game anyways i'm working on a lot
11:58 - of larger projects i'm getting way
11:59 - better at coding and again starting to
12:01 - really realize okay this is a career
12:03 - path this is what i want to do and then
12:05 - i eventually get into the university of
12:07 - ottawa for computer science as well as a
12:09 - few other universities i do choose
12:10 - uottawa and now we'll go to 2018 where i
12:13 - start my first year of university
12:15 - alright so 2018 first year of university
12:18 - also mentioned the summer before going
12:19 - to university i did my second year of
12:22 - the stem program coordinator at the
12:24 - summer camp which was great again
12:26 - continuing to post some youtube videos
12:27 - for the kids at the camp then i get to
12:30 - university i'm taking my first year
12:32 - computer science courses so introduction
12:34 - to computing i'm taking linear algebra
12:36 - calculus all of that type of stuff i'm
12:39 - living in residence in a big huge
12:41 - building with like hundreds of people in
12:42 - kind of like apartment style i have a
12:44 - roommate and this is when i really start
12:46 - getting serious about my youtube channel
12:48 - so i realized quite quickly into
12:49 - university that studying for courses is
12:52 - not going to take up nearly enough of my
12:54 - time i just really had a lot of extra
12:56 - time in university i was playing video
12:58 - games i was wasting it doing a bunch of
13:00 - stuff that i wasn't proud of doing and
13:01 - so what i did instead was say okay
13:04 - what can i do that's going to be
13:05 - productive that i'm going to enjoy and
13:07 - that's going to help me in the future
13:08 - and my answer to that was my youtube
13:10 - channel so at this point in time i had
13:11 - like two or three thousand subscribers
13:13 - but i really enjoyed posting on there
13:15 - and coming up with the educational
13:17 - content so i said to myself i'm gonna
13:18 - post a youtube video every single day
13:20 - for as long as i can so the unfortunate
13:23 - thing though was i had a roommate i
13:25 - we're in this like you know big
13:26 - apartment-style building and so it's
13:27 - really loud throughout the day and i
13:29 - just wasn't really able to record when
13:32 - my roommate's in the room and it just
13:33 - didn't work out very well for me to be
13:35 - recording at normal times so what i had
13:37 - to do is wake up at 5 30 a.m every
13:39 - single morning for as long as i could
13:41 - and film youtube videos between the
13:43 - hours of like 5 30 and 8 or 9 a.m and
13:46 - then start the rest of my day now this
13:48 - completely changed my life i got to a
13:50 - point where i was being so extremely
13:51 - productive i could probably do what i
13:53 - would normally do in a week in like six
13:55 - seven hours a day i was grinding really
13:57 - really hard but it completely paid off
13:59 - and over that first year of university
14:01 - or at least that first semester i grew
14:03 - my youtube channel for like two or three
14:05 - thousand subscribers it's like 15 20 25
14:08 - 30k and i think by the time i ended
14:11 - first year of university which is gonna
14:12 - be 2019 i probably had like 30 or 40 000
14:16 - subscribers on youtube
14:18 - anyways at this point since i'm doing so
14:20 - many youtube videos i'm learning flask
14:22 - i'm learning django i'm learning python
14:24 - web development i'm getting into a ton
14:26 - of other python modules and i'm really
14:28 - expanding my programming knowledge i'm
14:30 - learning math i'm learning get and i'm
14:32 - just learning a ton of stuff because of
14:33 - the amount of time that i'm spending
14:35 - work anyways now we move to 2019 now
14:38 - 2019 is going to be like end of first
14:40 - year beginning of second year university
14:42 - now in between that i'm working at the
14:44 - summer camp for the third time as a stem
14:46 - program coordinator and this is when i'm
14:48 - continuing to grow the youtube channel
14:50 - and now i'm sitting with a youtube
14:51 - channel that has like you know multiple
14:53 - 10 000 subscribers so i'm feeling good
14:55 - about that i'm posting a ton more
14:57 - content i'm starting to learn stuff like
14:59 - machine learning artificial intelligence
15:02 - i'm learning like tensorflow
15:04 - scikit-learn pi torch all of that type
15:06 - of stuff i'm now partnering with
15:08 - companies like free code camp i'm sure
15:10 - many of you know them and really just
15:12 - starting to kind of get involved in the
15:13 - programming community and start to learn
15:16 - most of my stuff on my own rather than
15:18 - from school so of course as i'm in
15:20 - university i'm learning you know
15:22 - computing too which means i'm learning
15:23 - stuff like java i'm learning data
15:25 - structures and algorithms in a formal
15:27 - course so i'm using java for that as
15:29 - well i'm learning programming paradigms
15:31 - so i'm learning languages like go like
15:33 - haskell like oh camel i'm kind of diving
15:36 - into all of these university courses but
15:38 - at the same time i'm doing a ton of work
15:40 - on my own and kind of just getting
15:42 - better at programming on the side with
15:44 - side projects and all the youtube videos
15:46 - that i'm posting so now near the end of
15:48 - 2019 this is when i actually start
15:50 - looking for internships for 2020 i
15:52 - really want to work as a software
15:54 - engineer ideally at a large tech company
15:56 - you know i'm targeting like a google
15:58 - microsoft amazon whatever but i'm also
16:00 - totally fine to go to a local company so
16:02 - i interviewed at shopify at ibm at bell
16:05 - actually which was uh close to where i
16:07 - was living at the time in ottawa anyways
16:09 - i was doing a ton of interviews and i
16:11 - started practicing my data structures
16:13 - and algorithms and doing like the coding
16:15 - interview type questions where i
16:17 - actually used algo expert now this is
16:19 - when i started a relationship with
16:20 - clement this is when i did a video on
16:23 - his channel with like a mock google
16:24 - coding interview and i started getting
16:26 - way better at these types of questions
16:28 - and then eventually ended up getting an
16:30 - interview at microsoft and some of you
16:32 - know how that goes but now we're gonna
16:34 - go to 2020 where i'll talk about that
16:36 - all right so 2020 i am continuing to
16:38 - grind for my technical interviews i'm
16:40 - doing all kinds of data structures and
16:42 - algorithms type problems doing almost
16:44 - all of the ones on algo expert anyways
16:47 - then i end up getting flown to microsoft
16:49 - for my in-person technical interviews
16:51 - this is in january before the pandemic
16:53 - is really known in the world so i do
16:56 - them end up passing those technical
16:58 - interviews i get a job offer from
16:59 - microsoft three days later i do my
17:01 - technical interviews at shopify end up
17:03 - getting one from them as well i end up
17:05 - deciding to choose microsoft because i
17:07 - was excited to actually go in person to
17:09 - microsoft to work there of course we
17:11 - know that didn't end up happening
17:13 - regardless though then the pandemic
17:14 - happens kind of puts everything on pause
17:16 - for i guess like a month or so that's
17:18 - probably an accurate timeline i end up
17:20 - moving back home away from school so out
17:23 - of ottawa
17:24 - doing school remotely and continuing to
17:26 - learn computer science stuff from school
17:28 - right so i'm learning languages like
17:30 - golang now i'm learning about
17:32 - programming language concepts computer
17:34 - architecture digital systems all that
17:37 - kind of fun stuff and continuing to work
17:39 - on the youtube channel which at this
17:40 - point in time probably has about 150 000
17:42 - subscribers
17:44 - okay continuing i go to microsoft i'm
17:46 - working on the python extension for
17:49 - visual studio code an absolutely great
17:51 - fit for me
17:52 - at microsoft we're using typescript and
17:54 - javascript for the entire extension so i
17:56 - end up learning typescript and working
17:58 - in that for about three or four months
18:00 - okay so after leaving microsoft because
18:02 - that was just a summer internship i now
18:04 - start school again i am now doing my
18:07 - first semester of third year so i'm
18:09 - learning some other programming stuff
18:10 - there although nothing super notable and
18:12 - i end up actually getting a job at algo
18:15 - expert as an algorithms instructor which
18:17 - i am doing while i am running my youtube
18:19 - channel and while i am going to school
18:21 - so i am extremely busy i'm working like
18:23 - 12 hours days every single day
18:25 - just really grinding because i have a
18:27 - job school as well as the youtube
18:29 - channel which is pretty much a full-time
18:31 - job as well and i end up doing that
18:33 - until i finish my first semester of
18:35 - third year and then i drop out of school
18:37 - alright so 2021 this year i am now
18:40 - dropped out of school i am so happy i
18:42 - finally have some time back in my life
18:44 - i'm not as stressed as i was before long
18:47 - story short on that decision i was
18:49 - generating a significant amount of
18:50 - revenue and it just really didn't make
18:51 - sense to be in school anymore this was
18:53 - not a you know on the whim decision this
18:55 - was something that had been thought
18:56 - about for a long time anyways i continue
18:59 - working at algo expert as an algorithms
19:01 - instructor so continuing to develop my
19:03 - uh you know algorithms data structure
19:05 - knowledge i then really start getting
19:07 - into front-end frameworks learning stuff
19:09 - like react learning a bit more about
19:11 - styling and css and really working on
19:14 - kind of full stack web applications that
19:16 - you guys would have seen me release at
19:17 - kind of end of 2020 beginning of 2021 on
19:20 - the youtube channel of course i'm
19:22 - continuing to work on the youtube
19:23 - channel and then i start working on
19:26 - programming expert now programming
19:28 - expert i talked about at the beginning
19:30 - of this video essentially it's an entire
19:32 - platform to learn how to code and i
19:34 - started planning that as early as
19:36 - february of last year so we kind of had
19:38 - the idea signed all the logistical
19:40 - contracts and all of that then started
19:42 - coming up with the curriculum and
19:44 - building that out pretty much for the
19:45 - entire year until we released it just i
19:48 - guess about a week ago from when i'm
19:49 - filming this video anyways you can check
19:51 - it out from
19:52 - programmingexpert.io but that's what
19:54 - i've been working on for a very long
19:56 - time which means really in this year i
19:58 - haven't been learning a lot related to
20:00 - programming i've been focusing on
20:02 - building this product working on the
20:03 - youtube channel expanding the business
20:06 - and yeah that's what i've been doing
20:08 - now as a side note i actually ended up
20:10 - moving out of my parents house to my own
20:12 - place that was kind of a huge thing that
20:13 - i did at the beginning of the year and
20:16 - now i am pretty well done with this
20:18 - video and everything that i went through
20:20 - now this video did not turn out exactly
20:22 - how i planned for it to be it was kind
20:23 - of more of a life story than it was and
20:26 - necessarily you know what i've learned
20:27 - programming although it did start in
20:29 - that way regardless i hope that gave
20:31 - some value to you guys and i just want
20:33 - to quickly tell you what i'm planning
20:35 - for 2022 in case you've stuck around
20:38 - till the end of this video so for 2022
20:40 - my main goals here are to improve my
20:42 - front-end development skills i really
20:44 - want to learn more about front-end
20:46 - frameworks i want to learn more about
20:47 - javascript and css and be more
20:49 - comfortable working on the front end of
20:51 - websites because i think i have the
20:53 - back-end skills down pretty well i want
20:55 - to continue to improve programming
20:57 - expert dot io again find it from the
20:59 - link in the description i want to be
21:01 - practicing golang go is kind of the next
21:03 - language i really want to transition
21:04 - into and then i want to do some more
21:06 - work on blockchain and cryptocurrency
21:08 - cryptocurrency which is actually what
21:10 - i've been working on a little bit right
21:12 - now and i have a series plan for you
21:13 - guys where i'm going to be teaching you
21:14 - solidity and how to actually host your
21:17 - own smart contracts and work with
21:19 - cryptocurrency
21:20 - regardless with that said that is going
21:22 - to end this video this video has taken a
21:25 - long time to make if you guys enjoyed
21:26 - please leave a like subscribe to the
21:28 - channel leave a comment with your
21:30 - journey learning how to code down below
21:32 - and i will see you in another youtube

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to be going through everything that i have learned over the past 10 years of programming now i started to program back in 2011 when i was only 11 years old obviously not doing anything very complicated but this is kind of where my journey began and you're gonna see this has been a long journey with lots of difficulties and it makes a very interesting story anyways hopefully as i go through this video i'll give you kind of a curriculum or outline of things you may want to learn however if you are new to programming or looking to upgrade your skills you should check out programmingexpert.io from the link in the description this is a brand new course that i have just released with the algo expert team we've been working on this for like six months it has a ton of awesome content and it gives you a complete structure and guide on one page of pretty much everything you need to know to master program any support you guys could provide would be awesome i'm super passionate about this and again if you guys are new to programming or just trying to get better definitely check this out programming expert dot io anyways with that said let's go back to 2011 and i will tell you what i remember back then when i was learning how to code all right so the details in the first few years here might be slightly inaccurate because my memory is not that good but i do know that back in 2011 this is kind of when i started to realize that i wanted to get into some type of stem related field i really hated art i hated anything creative i hated music and english and all of that but i loved math i loved science and i really liked building stuff i liked doing kind of like mechanical engineering type work now what i was doing back then was working with lego robots i was uh making like model cars catapults anything that had like a little engineering kind of sense to it i really really enjoy and so this is how i got my first taste of programming because i was working with lego robotics and you can program those you can make them so they go forward or so if the sensor is activated it turns to the left or it picks something up and that's kind of how i got into programming back then was i had this block based editor and i would say okay turn the motor you know 360 degrees okay if the sensor is activated back up whatever you guys get what i'm saying but that was the first introduction of programming back in 2011. alright so fast forward to 2012 i am 12 years old and this is when i start actually looking at html and css now i don't know exactly how i ended up getting to this topic but i do remember that i was very obsessed with learning at that age i would come home from school immediately go on my laptop start watching all kinds of youtube videos and just like experimenting with stuff and looking at all kinds of different topics and areas so i probably was googling like what is coding or like how does a computer work or something like that and ended up coming across an html and css tutorial now i remember very clearly that this tutorial was from bucky in fact i watched like hundreds of bucky's videos when i was a kid some of you may know his channel i'll put it up on the screen anyways i end up learning the basics of html the basics of css and in my mind i am programming i am writing code and i am like you know mega genius at 12 years old at least that's what i thought so i start messing with that stuff i'm really really interested in it and i just love the fact that i can go on my computer type in a few lines of code and see something appear in my web browser i really don't have any good idea of what i'm doing i'm just watching a ton of video tutorials and that's pretty much all that's happening in 2012. so fast forward to 2013 i've now done a bunch of html and css i'm able to make some very very basic web pages and kind of style them to some level and i start looking at javascript and php now javascript clearly is kind of a natural followup from html i'm now handling events on the website so when you click the button maybe i'm showing you a popup where i'm generating a random number or i'm doing something relatively trivial with javascript and then after javascript i'm like okay well now i know how to kind of handle stuff on the website how can i make a functioning website that's going to maybe store data so i start looking at php now i don't look at php for very long this is really complicated to me i don't really understand databases and all that kind of stuff and what ends up happening now in 2013 is i start to realize that i don't really like working on websites i'm not a fan of html i'm not a fan of kind of designing stuff in aesthetics i really liked the javascript programming and the php that was way more fun to me working kind of the logic in the back end of the website again i know it's not really the back end but in my mind it was behind the scenes because i didn't actually see the code that i was writing and so what i did is start looking for stuff that was kind of similar to that that i could mess around with so eventually i found vbs which is a visual basic script and i started writing kind of like little viruses or prank scripts that i could run on my friend's computer so for example i would write a script that would like constantly open the disk drive so it would open the disk drive and then if you push it in it would open it again where it would like rapidly toggle the caps locks button so you couldn't type something obviously i didn't leave these running on the computers i would just put them on kind of like prank them and then turn them off but that's what i was doing at that age now i also ended up jailbreaking a bunch of people's ipods i started kind of looking at more of the hacking side of technology and trying to manipulate stuff that i would use every day as opposed to creating brand new things alright so that was 2013 i'm kind of this immature child that's decent at like technology has some technology literacy and is like messing with people and making pranks and kind of vbs scripts and stuff like that and now we fast forward to 2014 where i start eventually learning c sharp now again this is coming from the realization that i really don't like web development the only thing i did like if it was pretty much the javascript and so i've got through my vbs stage i'm not really that interested in kind of pranking people anymore and what i want to do is learn a legitimate programming language so i end up coming across c sharp don't really know how and start trying to learn that for probably six months to a year so anyways i'm learning c sharp i'm continuing to kind of get better at it i'm learning about a strongly typed language i'm getting into stuff like functions arguments parameters and a lot of words that i just don't even understand at the age of 14 and well it's taking me a really long time to learn this i'm finding this really challenging but that's why i keep learning it because it's kind of one of the first things that i've found that is difficult and that's really testing my mind and my ability so anyways i learned c sharp for pretty much the entire year by the end of learning this for about you know six eight months whatever i'm working on graphical user interfaces kind of messing around with net technology i'm making stuff like calculators i'm making stuff like uh you know graphing programs that can graph like a line and at this point i believe i'm probably in grade nine and i'm showing this to some of my friends showing it to my parents all that kind of stuff anyways that's pretty much all i can remember from 2014 now let's go to 2015. so in 2015 i'm now probably entering grade 10 in high school and i'm taking my first computer science course in high school so in this course we're learning action script now actionscript is something that allows you to program flash games i already have a programming fundamental base i kind of know functions i know like you know basic programming concepts so this course is very very easy for me and so i'm always kind of asking the teacher hey what can i do next is there anything more difficult can you challenge me and he says hey maybe you should join the computer science club so in grade 10 i joined the computer science club and in this club they're actually preparing you to write a competition called the ccc now the ccc is the canadian computing competition hosted by the university of waterloo it's pretty much like five data structures and algorithm questions you get like three hours to answer them and depending on how many test cases you pass on all of the questions you could get invited to round two where you actually go to the university of waterloo and compete against like the best high school programs anyways i realized very quickly that i can't actually write this competition in c sharp which is kind of my main programming language at this point and so i asked my teacher hey what language should i learn because they don't have that as an option for me to submit my code with and he says well you should probably learn python that's what we're going to be doing next year in computer science and the year after and python is just a pretty easy language to learn for beginners so this is where i start getting into python i absolutely love python as soon as i pick it up and i study it for a few months before eventually writing the ccc competition that i end up doing very very poorly on i hadn't really prepared for it very much it was pretty challenging a lot of these questions were kind of math heavy as well and they increase in difficulty from one to five so i probably successfully answered like the first two questions and then completely failed the rest of them but i remember being motivated to kind of come back the next year and try to do better so that's pretty much 2015 this is when i started taking programming a bit more serious it's kind of more of a serious hobby now i'm doing it almost every day and i'm really really enjoying it and starting to realize that this is probably a career path for me all right so now we go to 2016. now 2016 i'm 16 years old i am in grade 11 and i'm taking my computer science course in grade 11. now in this course we're learning basic python i already know all of this because i've been continually learning python since that competition last year and again i sign up for the computer science club where i'm going to compete in the ccc now this year in the ccc i do much better i'm a few points away from actually being being invited to kind of the next round at university of waterloo i'm starting to get way better at programming i'm learning stuff like pie game i'm learning python modules i'm learning object oriented programming and i'm really starting to kind of dive head first into this field and realize that i really enjoy this and i really want to be good at this now other than that i'm probably just working on some larger python projects and actually i believe at this point in time i start looking into xcode and developing ios applications so i remember i wanted to make an ios app that would allow me to like categorize photos of my textbooks so this is kind of a little tangent but i'll tell it because it's an interesting story so i always had to walk to school my walk was like 20 to 25 minutes so i hated having to carry my textbooks because they were super heavy and it was really annoying to walk home with the textbooks so what i did is i would always take photos of any of the homework pages from my textbook so i never had to carry them home i could just do them off my phone but then i would go to my camera roll and i would have like hundreds of photos and i wouldn't be able to find the page so i wanted to make an ios app for my phone where i could just like take a picture of the uh of the textbook page it would automatically like group it into sections or subjects and give me the page number and all of that so i ended up working on that for like six months actually ended up making the app and it worked successfully and i put it on my phone so that was kind of uh you know a cool tangent kind of a side project going on where i was learning swift and objective c and just messing around with xcode and eventually creating this you know very simple app but something i was pretty proud of anyways i think that's pretty much it for 2016. now let's go to 2017. all right so 2017 is probably one of the most important years in my life so far i'm only 21 so take that with a grain of salt but anyways this is grade 12 this is when i really start to get passionate about computer science i know i'm going to go to school for computer science next year i've already applied to a bunch of universities and i'm in my grade 12 computer science course i'm learning bigo notation data structures and algorithms i'm continuing to work with a ton of python modules and i'm just a much more confident and competent program at this point in time i also start working at a summer camp as a stem program coordinator now this means i'm actually running a coding specialty and i'm teaching kids between the age of 11 and 15 how to code at a summer camp and i'm actually teaching them python code so a real programming language and this is when i realized that i really enjoy teaching i'm super happy doing that and so i start the youtube channel where i start teaching python too well all of you now at some point in time during this year i start posting more and more videos on youtube this would be when i created something like the golf game that some of you may have seen on this channel it's a python kind of like mini golf game anyways i'm working on a lot of larger projects i'm getting way better at coding and again starting to really realize okay this is a career path this is what i want to do and then i eventually get into the university of ottawa for computer science as well as a few other universities i do choose uottawa and now we'll go to 2018 where i start my first year of university alright so 2018 first year of university also mentioned the summer before going to university i did my second year of the stem program coordinator at the summer camp which was great again continuing to post some youtube videos for the kids at the camp then i get to university i'm taking my first year computer science courses so introduction to computing i'm taking linear algebra calculus all of that type of stuff i'm living in residence in a big huge building with like hundreds of people in kind of like apartment style i have a roommate and this is when i really start getting serious about my youtube channel so i realized quite quickly into university that studying for courses is not going to take up nearly enough of my time i just really had a lot of extra time in university i was playing video games i was wasting it doing a bunch of stuff that i wasn't proud of doing and so what i did instead was say okay what can i do that's going to be productive that i'm going to enjoy and that's going to help me in the future and my answer to that was my youtube channel so at this point in time i had like two or three thousand subscribers but i really enjoyed posting on there and coming up with the educational content so i said to myself i'm gonna post a youtube video every single day for as long as i can so the unfortunate thing though was i had a roommate i we're in this like you know big apartmentstyle building and so it's really loud throughout the day and i just wasn't really able to record when my roommate's in the room and it just didn't work out very well for me to be recording at normal times so what i had to do is wake up at 5 30 a.m every single morning for as long as i could and film youtube videos between the hours of like 5 30 and 8 or 9 a.m and then start the rest of my day now this completely changed my life i got to a point where i was being so extremely productive i could probably do what i would normally do in a week in like six seven hours a day i was grinding really really hard but it completely paid off and over that first year of university or at least that first semester i grew my youtube channel for like two or three thousand subscribers it's like 15 20 25 30k and i think by the time i ended first year of university which is gonna be 2019 i probably had like 30 or 40 000 subscribers on youtube anyways at this point since i'm doing so many youtube videos i'm learning flask i'm learning django i'm learning python web development i'm getting into a ton of other python modules and i'm really expanding my programming knowledge i'm learning math i'm learning get and i'm just learning a ton of stuff because of the amount of time that i'm spending work anyways now we move to 2019 now 2019 is going to be like end of first year beginning of second year university now in between that i'm working at the summer camp for the third time as a stem program coordinator and this is when i'm continuing to grow the youtube channel and now i'm sitting with a youtube channel that has like you know multiple 10 000 subscribers so i'm feeling good about that i'm posting a ton more content i'm starting to learn stuff like machine learning artificial intelligence i'm learning like tensorflow scikitlearn pi torch all of that type of stuff i'm now partnering with companies like free code camp i'm sure many of you know them and really just starting to kind of get involved in the programming community and start to learn most of my stuff on my own rather than from school so of course as i'm in university i'm learning you know computing too which means i'm learning stuff like java i'm learning data structures and algorithms in a formal course so i'm using java for that as well i'm learning programming paradigms so i'm learning languages like go like haskell like oh camel i'm kind of diving into all of these university courses but at the same time i'm doing a ton of work on my own and kind of just getting better at programming on the side with side projects and all the youtube videos that i'm posting so now near the end of 2019 this is when i actually start looking for internships for 2020 i really want to work as a software engineer ideally at a large tech company you know i'm targeting like a google microsoft amazon whatever but i'm also totally fine to go to a local company so i interviewed at shopify at ibm at bell actually which was uh close to where i was living at the time in ottawa anyways i was doing a ton of interviews and i started practicing my data structures and algorithms and doing like the coding interview type questions where i actually used algo expert now this is when i started a relationship with clement this is when i did a video on his channel with like a mock google coding interview and i started getting way better at these types of questions and then eventually ended up getting an interview at microsoft and some of you know how that goes but now we're gonna go to 2020 where i'll talk about that all right so 2020 i am continuing to grind for my technical interviews i'm doing all kinds of data structures and algorithms type problems doing almost all of the ones on algo expert anyways then i end up getting flown to microsoft for my inperson technical interviews this is in january before the pandemic is really known in the world so i do them end up passing those technical interviews i get a job offer from microsoft three days later i do my technical interviews at shopify end up getting one from them as well i end up deciding to choose microsoft because i was excited to actually go in person to microsoft to work there of course we know that didn't end up happening regardless though then the pandemic happens kind of puts everything on pause for i guess like a month or so that's probably an accurate timeline i end up moving back home away from school so out of ottawa doing school remotely and continuing to learn computer science stuff from school right so i'm learning languages like golang now i'm learning about programming language concepts computer architecture digital systems all that kind of fun stuff and continuing to work on the youtube channel which at this point in time probably has about 150 000 subscribers okay continuing i go to microsoft i'm working on the python extension for visual studio code an absolutely great fit for me at microsoft we're using typescript and javascript for the entire extension so i end up learning typescript and working in that for about three or four months okay so after leaving microsoft because that was just a summer internship i now start school again i am now doing my first semester of third year so i'm learning some other programming stuff there although nothing super notable and i end up actually getting a job at algo expert as an algorithms instructor which i am doing while i am running my youtube channel and while i am going to school so i am extremely busy i'm working like 12 hours days every single day just really grinding because i have a job school as well as the youtube channel which is pretty much a fulltime job as well and i end up doing that until i finish my first semester of third year and then i drop out of school alright so 2021 this year i am now dropped out of school i am so happy i finally have some time back in my life i'm not as stressed as i was before long story short on that decision i was generating a significant amount of revenue and it just really didn't make sense to be in school anymore this was not a you know on the whim decision this was something that had been thought about for a long time anyways i continue working at algo expert as an algorithms instructor so continuing to develop my uh you know algorithms data structure knowledge i then really start getting into frontend frameworks learning stuff like react learning a bit more about styling and css and really working on kind of full stack web applications that you guys would have seen me release at kind of end of 2020 beginning of 2021 on the youtube channel of course i'm continuing to work on the youtube channel and then i start working on programming expert now programming expert i talked about at the beginning of this video essentially it's an entire platform to learn how to code and i started planning that as early as february of last year so we kind of had the idea signed all the logistical contracts and all of that then started coming up with the curriculum and building that out pretty much for the entire year until we released it just i guess about a week ago from when i'm filming this video anyways you can check it out from programmingexpert.io but that's what i've been working on for a very long time which means really in this year i haven't been learning a lot related to programming i've been focusing on building this product working on the youtube channel expanding the business and yeah that's what i've been doing now as a side note i actually ended up moving out of my parents house to my own place that was kind of a huge thing that i did at the beginning of the year and now i am pretty well done with this video and everything that i went through now this video did not turn out exactly how i planned for it to be it was kind of more of a life story than it was and necessarily you know what i've learned programming although it did start in that way regardless i hope that gave some value to you guys and i just want to quickly tell you what i'm planning for 2022 in case you've stuck around till the end of this video so for 2022 my main goals here are to improve my frontend development skills i really want to learn more about frontend frameworks i want to learn more about javascript and css and be more comfortable working on the front end of websites because i think i have the backend skills down pretty well i want to continue to improve programming expert dot io again find it from the link in the description i want to be practicing golang go is kind of the next language i really want to transition into and then i want to do some more work on blockchain and cryptocurrency cryptocurrency which is actually what i've been working on a little bit right now and i have a series plan for you guys where i'm going to be teaching you solidity and how to actually host your own smart contracts and work with cryptocurrency regardless with that said that is going to end this video this video has taken a long time to make if you guys enjoyed please leave a like subscribe to the channel leave a comment with your journey learning how to code down below and i will see you in another youtube video
