00:00 - in python there is a very useful
00:01 - function that not many people know about
00:03 - and this is the any function now this
00:05 - function tells you if anything inside of
00:07 - an iterable object is true so let's have
00:10 - a look at using it on some of the
00:11 - examples here if i print any of my
00:14 - string notice that we get true the
00:16 - reason we get true is because this
00:18 - string contains some characters and any
00:19 - characters in python evaluate to true if
00:22 - i had this as an empty string then we
00:25 - would get false because we have no items
00:27 - in the string and so no this is not true
00:29 - anyways continuing now let's look at any
00:31 - on our first lst yes we get true because
00:34 - any value that's not zero that's an
00:36 - integer evaluates to true now let's look
00:38 - at it on lst2 notice we get false
00:40 - because we have zero false and false
00:42 - none of these are true values in python
00:44 - let's look at it on list three notice we
00:46 - get true because true is present here
00:48 - and let's look at it on our tuple tup
00:50 - like this notice we get false again and
00:53 - he can take any iterable object and tell
00:55 - you if any of the values inside of it
00:57 - are true if you like this make sure to
00:59 - follow for more
