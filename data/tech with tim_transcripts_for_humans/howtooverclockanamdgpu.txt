00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another video
00:01 - in today's video I'm gonna be talking
00:03 - about how to overclock an AMD graphics
00:05 - card so in one of the last videos I
00:08 - talked about how to overclock a Nvidia
00:10 - graphics card using msi afterburner in
00:13 - this instance i'm going to be talking
00:14 - about how to overclock
00:16 - AMD cards so raid on cards are X 480 RX
00:20 - 580 whatever AMD card you might have
00:22 - using the global walkman which is a part
00:25 - of AMD settings so the first thing we
00:27 - need to do here is just make sure you
00:28 - have the most recent drivers installed
00:30 - I'm not going to show you how to do that
00:32 - you can find that on the website is
00:33 - pretty simple so all we're gonna do is
00:35 - gonna go down to the Start menu and
00:36 - research AMD settings like that I should
00:39 - find something it looks like this it
00:40 - should pop open fairly quickly and then
00:42 - we're gonna go to gaming up here alright
00:45 - now we should see you can see all my
00:47 - games up here we're gonna click on
00:49 - global settings now this comes up and it
00:53 - says global graphics but we want to go
00:54 - to global Whatman right over here ok so
00:58 - now it pops up all the different
01:00 - properties of our GPU now if you haven't
01:04 - watched my other video I will go back
01:06 - and I'll explain what overclocking does
01:08 - and how to safely do it to your GPU so
01:12 - you might hear instances of people
01:14 - blowing up their GPUs are people
01:17 - completely wrecking them because they
01:18 - didn't know how to overclock and they
01:19 - did it improperly so just follow these
01:22 - instructions and you should be fine so
01:23 - you should see something that says the
01:25 - core clock which is right here the
01:27 - memory clock which is over here and then
01:30 - your fan control and your sorry your
01:33 - Heat over here so your temperature now
01:36 - the first thing we always do when we
01:37 - overclock is we crank our power limit
01:39 - all the way up so see power limit down
01:42 - here it might look a little different
01:43 - for you but you just want to put it all
01:45 - the way up to the max and then up here
01:47 - click apply just like that because in
01:50 - order to get the most of it our GPU we
01:52 - need to give it more power so the more
01:54 - power and more volts that we send into
01:56 - it the better performance we can get out
01:58 - of it now the thing to watch here is the
02:01 - card that I have runs really hot so
02:03 - it'll run on load like a DC which is
02:06 - extremely hot for graphics cards so what
02:09 - the killer of graphics card is is the
02:11 - temperature so you have to understand
02:13 - what a good temperature is for your
02:14 - graphics card and depending on what it
02:16 - is and depending on the cooling that's
02:17 - on it that's gonna be different so maybe
02:19 - just looking up like what is a safe
02:21 - temperature for my graphics card or just
02:23 - understanding anything once you get past
02:25 - 80 or 90 Celsius is probably too hot
02:29 - okay so let's just get into now what the
02:32 - most important factors are so a lot of
02:34 - people think that when you overclock you
02:36 - have to throw this core clock all the
02:39 - way up just as high as it can possibly
02:41 - go that is completely false so the core
02:44 - clock is the one that I'm using right
02:46 - now which is orange all you really have
02:48 - to do is just put it up maybe two three
02:50 - percent you don't need to put it up a
02:52 - lot the thing that we we're gonna have
02:55 - to change here is the memory clock this
02:57 - is what the really makes a big
03:00 - difference for our graphics card so we
03:03 - have our core clock we can just click
03:05 - apply there to set that and now we can
03:08 - start adjusting the memory clock so this
03:09 - is where you're gonna have to take it
03:11 - kind of slower and you're gonna have to
03:13 - keep testing and just seeing what is a
03:16 - good temperature because right now I'm
03:17 - idle and I'm running at 63 degrees after
03:19 - pumping my core clock up so you can see
03:21 - that it's running very hot so now we
03:24 - move to the memory clock and I'm just
03:26 - gonna start and we're just gonna move it
03:27 - up maybe 50 at a time so I'll go to 2050
03:31 - megahertz and then I would test that I
03:34 - would see how the temperatures doing and
03:36 - then I would move you move it up again
03:37 - so maybe I'll go to 21 10 is that
03:40 - looking good that looks okay and then we
03:42 - move it up and so on and so forth now
03:44 - you'll notice every time you adjust this
03:46 - bar your temperature should get warmer
03:48 - if you're clicking apply afterwards so
03:50 - in order to counteract this temperature
03:52 - we want to change these target numbers
03:54 - so you see where it says automatic here
03:55 - we're just gonna click on that to set it
03:57 - to manual and we're gonna lower our
03:58 - target down to 75 see on this card
04:02 - so separately on your card it'll be
04:03 - different and then we're gonna our sorry
04:06 - our max to 75 in our target to 60 so
04:08 - actually I want to move this back up to
04:10 - 80 because 75 is a little low for my
04:12 - card and then we'll target at 70 so by
04:15 - doing that now it's gonna try to keep
04:17 - the card a lot cooler which in result is
04:19 - gonna mean they're gonna have a lot
04:21 - louder fan noises um but that's okay
04:24 - because you do want the max perform
04:25 - to your card so now I'm gonna mess
04:28 - around with the fan settings so you can
04:29 - leave it on automatic if you want but on
04:32 - my specific card the automatic settings
04:34 - keep my card really running really hot
04:36 - so I want to bump this up maybe about
04:38 - two times what it is right now just to
04:39 - make sure that it's gonna stay nice and
04:42 - cool so I bump those two numbers up now
04:44 - and then I'm just going to go ahead and
04:46 - click apply now you might actually be
04:48 - able to hear my fan revving up on my GPU
04:50 - right now because that's exactly what
04:51 - it's doing as I've put the minimum fan
04:54 - speed to 2,000 it's gonna continue to
04:56 - climb higher as it needs to so yeah now
05:00 - obviously this is gonna vary depending
05:03 - on what graphics card you have and what
05:06 - year it is what drivers you're running
05:08 - all these things are important factors
05:09 - just realize that you want to make sure
05:11 - that when you're overclocking you get
05:12 - the max performance with the lowest
05:14 - temperature so you want to keep your
05:16 - temperature at a safe degree if you're
05:19 - running an rx 480 like me a safe
05:21 - temperature for that is anything under
05:23 - 90 degrees if you're going above 90
05:25 - you're really kind of pushing the limit
05:27 - um and you're gonna want to readjust
05:29 - your clocks or readjust your fan speed
05:31 - to make sure it doesn't go that high on
05:33 - other cards and then it's probably gonna
05:35 - be lower you just have to kind of look
05:36 - online and see what a good safe speed
05:39 - for your GPU is so yeah and then if you
05:42 - go up here you can monitor your activity
05:44 - here you can see your peak you can see
05:46 - your average and all your clocks what
05:48 - they're running at and yeah that's
05:50 - pretty much it on how to overclock your
05:52 - graphics card it's really not that
05:54 - difficult a lot of people make it out to
05:57 - be a huge deal obviously I could
05:59 - probably push this clock more I can move
06:01 - the frequency up you just play around
06:02 - with it and just make sure you're
06:04 - keeping an eye on this temperature
06:05 - that's the most important part as long
06:06 - as this temperature is safe you're safe
06:08 - and just remember too that these
06:10 - utilities are actually made by the
06:12 - people that design the graphics cards so
06:15 - obviously they're safe to be using with
06:18 - your graphics card and yeah that's it
06:20 - for this video if you liked please like
06:22 - and subscribe and I will see you again
06:23 - in another one

hey guys welcome back to another video in today's video I'm gonna be talking about how to overclock an AMD graphics card so in one of the last videos I talked about how to overclock a Nvidia graphics
