00:00 - hey guys and welcome back do you know a
00:02 - YouTube video so in today's video I'm
00:04 - gonna be showing you how to set up OBS
00:07 - for the best possible screen recordings
00:09 - that you can get so as a small youtuber
00:12 - personally I use OBS and that's what
00:15 - I've been using for all my videos I
00:16 - found it very easy to use pretty
00:19 - intuitive and just extremely simple and
00:21 - obviously it's free so that makes it a
00:23 - very good I know a lot of youtubers use
00:25 - it and when you first boot up Opia so
00:28 - I've done that here I have like a new
00:30 - kind of thing going here it's pretty
00:32 - intimidating you have all these
00:33 - different things you have no idea what
00:35 - to do and pretty much it's gonna be
00:38 - pretty difficult to figure out what to
00:40 - do without looking up a tutorial so this
00:41 - is gonna go through video audio output
00:45 - all the main things you need to do to
00:47 - set up your OBS if you guys are looking
00:50 - for another tutorial on how to make your
00:53 - audio sound really good I'm gonna
00:54 - release another tutorial the next few
00:56 - days so make sure you're subscribed for
00:57 - that and you watch out for that I'll
00:59 - play a little preview now of what that's
01:02 - will sound like so this is what my
01:04 - microphone sounds like without any
01:06 - processing without any tuning without
01:09 - any filters this is just the bare bones
01:11 - mic and all that is helping it is a pop
01:14 - filter
01:15 - so now we've switched over to the tuned
01:18 - version of the microphone you should
01:20 - hopefully hear a difference here it's a
01:22 - little bit more bass here there is not
01:24 - as much background sound just a few
01:26 - small things that in a video add up just
01:29 - to make it sound a lot better
01:31 - so let's get started with the video so
01:34 - when we first opened up OBS I have this
01:35 - on here this is probably what's gonna
01:38 - look like for you guys now if you
01:40 - already have OBS I'm gonna suggest that
01:42 - you start off by just hitting profile
01:44 - and hitting new even if you don't
01:46 - already have it it's probably good idea
01:47 - to do this you're gonna hit new and then
01:49 - you're gonna type in the name of your
01:51 - profile so in this case I already have a
01:53 - profile I'm not gonna create one but you
01:56 - can just type in say the name of youtube
01:57 - channel so check with Tim like so okay
02:01 - once you do that you're gonna see it
02:03 - pops up here it's gonna show your
02:04 - profile of basic recording now these
02:07 - profiles you can see I have two down
02:09 - here they're gonna show up down here
02:10 - you're only gonna have one because you
02:11 - just created one
02:13 - we're gonna be able to store your
02:14 - different settings so this is very
02:16 - useful for example if you have one
02:17 - profile you wanna use for streaming when
02:19 - you want to use for video recording one
02:22 - profile you have me with a webcam with a
02:24 - different microphone etc it's extremely
02:26 - useful to have the different profiles
02:28 - the next thing we're going to do is
02:30 - we're going to create a scene now you
02:31 - should probably already have one it says
02:33 - untitled if you don't go ahead and just
02:36 - hit new and again I just named mine
02:38 - screen recording you can name yours
02:40 - whatever you'd like
02:41 - once you've done that should see down
02:44 - here it's gonna say something called
02:45 - scene and then to the right we have
02:47 - sources so this is where we're gonna be
02:49 - setting up our different sources for OBS
02:51 - again I'm just gonna be showing you the
02:53 - basic source which is going to be
02:54 - probably our main monitor okay so what
02:57 - we're gonna do here is we're gonna click
02:58 - the little plus button we're gonna go to
03:00 - first display capture now again these
03:04 - are pretty intuitive you have game
03:05 - capture image image slideshow
03:08 - etc so if you're just trying to capture
03:11 - for example a game or maybe just a
03:14 - window then you're gonna use the
03:16 - appropriate one so if you don't want to
03:18 - capture the whole screen you only want
03:19 - to capture maybe your Google Chrome
03:20 - window that doesn't take up the entire
03:22 - screen you would just hit window capture
03:23 - alright I'm just gonna be showing you
03:25 - the whole screen for right now so we're
03:26 - gonna go to display capture you can call
03:29 - us whatever you want I like to call mine
03:30 - main monitor
03:32 - because I do have two monitors so this
03:35 - way I can tell which one I'm gonna be
03:37 - recording like that we're going to do
03:39 - make source visible make sure that's
03:40 - check marked and click OK alright so now
03:44 - you can see we have this infinite loop
03:45 - going through here and all you're gonna
03:48 - do here is select your display so you
03:49 - see I have two different displays
03:50 - obviously you just select the display
03:52 - that you'd like to record and hit OK now
03:56 - if you see here you'll see your display
03:58 - comes up here you have a little lock
03:59 - button you can lock that so that you
04:00 - can't edit it you can't change anything
04:02 - and then you have a little eyeball now I
04:06 - recommend if you're doing this and you
04:07 - only have one monitor while you're
04:09 - working on it you probably just hit the
04:10 - little eyeball there this just turns it
04:12 - on or off it's extremely useful ok now
04:16 - let's go on to another source so now
04:19 - that we have our monitor capture like
04:21 - this we need to capture our audio now it
04:24 - is to be noted that right now when I'm
04:25 - recording this video I am using yes
04:27 - so yeah just you know okay so now let's
04:31 - get our audio input so let's hit the
04:34 - little plus button again we're gonna do
04:36 - audio input capture again I just like to
04:40 - name this the name of your mic so in
04:42 - this case I have a blue Yeti mic but I
04:44 - also have like a headset mic a few other
04:46 - ones so it's useful to name them
04:48 - appropriately blue Yeti okay and we're
04:51 - gonna select our microphone so in this
04:53 - case I am gonna select the yeti stereo
04:55 - microphone like so and hit OK alright
04:59 - now you can see we have a little thing
05:02 - popping up here it says blue Yeti and it
05:04 - shows my audio volumes as I'm speaking
05:06 - so you'll notice that as I talk we get
05:09 - the volume is moving up okay now so in
05:13 - the next video that I'm gonna do make
05:15 - sure you guys just subscribe for that
05:16 - again we're gonna be going through the
05:18 - filters on this microphone to make sure
05:19 - it sounds very good and we're gonna be
05:21 - going over some external plugins so that
05:23 - your audio can sound much better alright
05:26 - so now that we have our main monitor and
05:29 - we have our audio source it's time to go
05:31 - through these settings now this is very
05:34 - important I'm pretty much just gonna
05:36 - tell you to copy the settings that I'm
05:37 - using so if you didn't see there I just
05:38 - hit a little Settings button another way
05:40 - to access it is just to go to file and
05:42 - then settings and we have a very
05:44 - confusing looking amount of settings
05:46 - here to go through so general let's just
05:50 - go through here language obviously
05:52 - you're gonna do whatever you want there
05:53 - I'm here you can play with those what
05:57 - you like they're not really that
05:58 - important and
05:59 - we can pretty much just ignore the rest
06:03 - of this general tab we're gonna go down
06:05 - to stream again I'm not gonna be showing
06:07 - you streaming in this video just screen
06:09 - recording so we're gonna go down to
06:11 - output alright so now output mode make
06:13 - sure this is set to simple now your
06:16 - video bitrate this is pretty much the
06:18 - higher this is the better the video is
06:21 - gonna look so I like to just leave mine
06:22 - on 2500 if you have a very good CPU very
06:26 - good graphics card then you can at put
06:28 - yours up to 3,500
06:30 - but typically 2500 is fine that's what
06:32 - you're seeing right now unless you're
06:34 - recording a game and you really want it
06:36 - to look amazing you probably don't need
06:38 - to play with this too much software
06:39 - encoder it's gonna leave it on default
06:41 - here audio bitrate okay so I like to put
06:43 - my audio bitrate up to 320 again it's
06:47 - gonna use up more space in your file
06:48 - size but that's okay 320 audio bitrate
06:52 - you can leave it on 160 pretty much if
06:55 - you put it up to 320 it's just taking
06:57 - more bits for every sample okay so now
07:00 - recording quality so we're not gonna set
07:03 - this as same as stream we're gonna put
07:05 - this to indistinguishable quality large
07:08 - file size now if you really want your
07:11 - video to look amazing and you don't mind
07:13 - having gigabyte files for only a minute
07:15 - or two of recording then you can go to
07:17 - this file size but I'm telling you it is
07:19 - much larger than this large file size so
07:22 - right now I have a video it's about 7
07:24 - minutes long though I'm recording right
07:26 - now and it's probably gonna be I don't
07:29 - know let's see maybe like 300 megabytes
07:31 - probably not even it'll probably be
07:33 - between 100 and 200 megabytes if I was
07:36 - on tremendously large file size this
07:38 - would be a few gigabytes already so just
07:39 - keep that in mind okay
07:40 - and now we're gonna change the recording
07:43 - format so FLV I mean you can use that if
07:45 - you want I prefer just set mine to mp4
07:48 - really doesn't matter just whatever ones
07:50 - you prefer don't worry about this this
07:51 - error message here it's not a big deal
07:54 - encoder again we're just gonna use the
07:57 - regular software encoder we don't need
07:58 - this low CPU preset and yeah that's
08:01 - about it for output okay so now audio so
08:05 - we're gonna go for our desktop audio
08:07 - device we're just going to set this to
08:09 - default so pretty much this is gonna
08:11 - allow us to have a device that records
08:12 - our desktop audio so say for example if
08:15 - you're recording a game and you want to
08:16 - hear these sounds in the game that's
08:18 - what we're gonna be doing now for mic
08:20 - slash exhilerated device you can just
08:22 - leave this blank because we've already
08:23 - set an audio device down below if you
08:26 - have another audio device that you want
08:27 - to set then you can use that okay so now
08:29 - for the separate and the channel so this
08:31 - sampler is gonna depend on what your
08:34 - microphone is and the quality of your
08:35 - America microphone so you're gonna have
08:36 - to check the specs on your microphone if
08:38 - you just have a headset mic you're gonna
08:40 - want to leave this on 44.1 if you have
08:42 - like an expensive mic or a studio
08:44 - microphone you're gonna set this to 48
08:45 - Hertz so I'm gonna set mine to 48 Hertz
08:48 - because I do have a blue Yeti microphone
08:50 - it says this program must be restarted
08:52 - we can do that after channel just leave
08:55 - yours on stereo that's fine audiometer
08:58 - decay rate this doesn't matter you can
09:00 - just leave that like that and now to
09:02 - video okay so this is important here so
09:04 - we see here we have the base and canvas
09:07 - resolution so this pretty much is just
09:09 - the resolution of the monitor that
09:11 - you're recording now your output or your
09:13 - scaled resolution so if you have a
09:16 - decent computer I'm not saying it has to
09:18 - be a god computer you don't have to have
09:21 - like full custom built like 16 gigs or
09:24 - it you don't need all that stuff as long
09:25 - as your computer is somewhat modern
09:27 - you're gonna want to make this output
09:29 - resolution the same as your regular
09:31 - resolution so I'm gonna set mine to 1920
09:33 - by 1080 like so and then we're gonna go
09:37 - to downscale filter and we're gonna set
09:39 - this up to the highest possible so 32
09:42 - now the FPS so this is gonna be very
09:47 - important so pretty much if we set this
09:48 - up higher to 60 for example we're gonna
09:52 - be taking double the amount of frames
09:54 - every second right so FPS frames per
09:56 - second you're only gonna want to set
09:58 - this to 60 if you have a pretty good
10:00 - computer now if you don't have a good
10:03 - computer say maybe you're a generation
10:06 - you don't have a great processor the
10:08 - processor is what's the most important
10:10 - here you're gonna want to leave this on
10:11 - 30 otherwise you're gonna notice if
10:13 - you're playing games you're using
10:14 - anything that has like somewhat of a CPU
10:17 - usage it's gonna be lighting so I'm
10:19 - gonna set mine to 60 I'll tell you my
10:21 - specs right now I have an i5 7700 K it's
10:24 - at 4.2 gigahertz so it's pretty quick
10:28 - again if you guys don't have an
10:29 - overclocked processor or not you're not
10:31 - rockin an i7 you're probably not gonna
10:34 - want to put this on 60 you can always
10:35 - try it and if it doesn't work just put
10:37 - it down to 30 but really if you're not
10:39 - recording games it's not gonna make a
10:41 - huge deal leave it on 30 okay all right
10:43 - so we're gonna click OK and then you can
10:46 - see we have this mic and auxilary device
10:48 - here showing up can just mute this like
10:51 - so and
10:53 - then we have this desktop audio that's
10:55 - showing up so now this is a I don't know
10:58 - if I can get a sound to come out of my
10:59 - computer right now
11:00 - yeah so pretty much any sounds it comes
11:03 - at your computer playing games synced
11:04 - music etc it's gonna show up here
11:06 - you can adjust the audio levels by
11:08 - simply sliding the bar like so and that
11:11 - goes for all of these now if you want to
11:14 - do advanced audio settings again watch
11:16 - my next video coming out and I'll go
11:18 - over that okay so let's go back into
11:19 - settings for a second I just wanted to
11:21 - show you that and go back to video and
11:24 - then to advanced okay so in advanced can
11:28 - go through here and I think that might
11:31 - actually be it so leave this on normal
11:34 - click apply and I think that's
11:38 - everything for this tutorial so this is
11:41 - just setting up your basic OBS now we've
11:44 - set everything up we have we can see we
11:46 - have our profile basic recording our
11:47 - scene screen recording and we have our
11:50 - blue Yeti our main monitor and then we
11:52 - have our audio devices over here which
11:54 - we can then either mute or
11:57 - turn them up in volume in the next
12:00 - tutorial for this so it's not going to
12:01 - be like directly linked to this it's
12:02 - gonna be talking about how to increase
12:04 - your audio or make your audio sound
12:05 - better we're gonna be going through the
12:06 - filters here on the microphone UK you
12:10 - guys can try playing around with them if
12:11 - you want right now just to see what
12:12 - works for you and yeah so if you want to
12:16 - start recording you go ahead you hit
12:17 - start recording and now this was
12:19 - something that I kind of was having
12:22 - trouble with when I first did when I was
12:24 - first doing this if you hit start
12:25 - recording it's gonna start recording to
12:27 - a default path so if you want to change
12:30 - this path again we can go to settings
12:32 - output and then you can just change your
12:35 - recording path right here
12:36 - just so you know exactly what it's
12:39 - recording I recommend you change this to
12:42 - just a dedicated folder because if
12:44 - you're recording a lot of videos you
12:46 - don't want to know exactly what where
12:47 - they're going let's say for example you
12:48 - record a video and you don't know where
12:50 - it went you can go to file show
12:52 - recordings and it will pop up where the
12:54 - videos will be saved
12:56 - okay so that has been the tutorial on
12:59 - how to set up OBS for quality screen
13:02 - recording if you enjoyed and this helped
13:04 - you out please leave a like and
13:05 - subscribe and I will see you again
13:06 - another video
13:08 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys and welcome back do you know a YouTube video so in today's video I'm gonna be showing you how to set up OBS for the best possible screen recordings that you can get so as a small youtuber personally I use OBS and that's what I've been using for all my videos I found it very easy to use pretty intuitive and just extremely simple and obviously it's free so that makes it a very good I know a lot of youtubers use it and when you first boot up Opia so I've done that here I have like a new kind of thing going here it's pretty intimidating you have all these different things you have no idea what to do and pretty much it's gonna be pretty difficult to figure out what to do without looking up a tutorial so this is gonna go through video audio output all the main things you need to do to set up your OBS if you guys are looking for another tutorial on how to make your audio sound really good I'm gonna release another tutorial the next few days so make sure you're subscribed for that and you watch out for that I'll play a little preview now of what that's will sound like so this is what my microphone sounds like without any processing without any tuning without any filters this is just the bare bones mic and all that is helping it is a pop filter so now we've switched over to the tuned version of the microphone you should hopefully hear a difference here it's a little bit more bass here there is not as much background sound just a few small things that in a video add up just to make it sound a lot better so let's get started with the video so when we first opened up OBS I have this on here this is probably what's gonna look like for you guys now if you already have OBS I'm gonna suggest that you start off by just hitting profile and hitting new even if you don't already have it it's probably good idea to do this you're gonna hit new and then you're gonna type in the name of your profile so in this case I already have a profile I'm not gonna create one but you can just type in say the name of youtube channel so check with Tim like so okay once you do that you're gonna see it pops up here it's gonna show your profile of basic recording now these profiles you can see I have two down here they're gonna show up down here you're only gonna have one because you just created one we're gonna be able to store your different settings so this is very useful for example if you have one profile you wanna use for streaming when you want to use for video recording one profile you have me with a webcam with a different microphone etc it's extremely useful to have the different profiles the next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a scene now you should probably already have one it says untitled if you don't go ahead and just hit new and again I just named mine screen recording you can name yours whatever you'd like once you've done that should see down here it's gonna say something called scene and then to the right we have sources so this is where we're gonna be setting up our different sources for OBS again I'm just gonna be showing you the basic source which is going to be probably our main monitor okay so what we're gonna do here is we're gonna click the little plus button we're gonna go to first display capture now again these are pretty intuitive you have game capture image image slideshow etc so if you're just trying to capture for example a game or maybe just a window then you're gonna use the appropriate one so if you don't want to capture the whole screen you only want to capture maybe your Google Chrome window that doesn't take up the entire screen you would just hit window capture alright I'm just gonna be showing you the whole screen for right now so we're gonna go to display capture you can call us whatever you want I like to call mine main monitor because I do have two monitors so this way I can tell which one I'm gonna be recording like that we're going to do make source visible make sure that's check marked and click OK alright so now you can see we have this infinite loop going through here and all you're gonna do here is select your display so you see I have two different displays obviously you just select the display that you'd like to record and hit OK now if you see here you'll see your display comes up here you have a little lock button you can lock that so that you can't edit it you can't change anything and then you have a little eyeball now I recommend if you're doing this and you only have one monitor while you're working on it you probably just hit the little eyeball there this just turns it on or off it's extremely useful ok now let's go on to another source so now that we have our monitor capture like this we need to capture our audio now it is to be noted that right now when I'm recording this video I am using yes so yeah just you know okay so now let's get our audio input so let's hit the little plus button again we're gonna do audio input capture again I just like to name this the name of your mic so in this case I have a blue Yeti mic but I also have like a headset mic a few other ones so it's useful to name them appropriately blue Yeti okay and we're gonna select our microphone so in this case I am gonna select the yeti stereo microphone like so and hit OK alright now you can see we have a little thing popping up here it says blue Yeti and it shows my audio volumes as I'm speaking so you'll notice that as I talk we get the volume is moving up okay now so in the next video that I'm gonna do make sure you guys just subscribe for that again we're gonna be going through the filters on this microphone to make sure it sounds very good and we're gonna be going over some external plugins so that your audio can sound much better alright so now that we have our main monitor and we have our audio source it's time to go through these settings now this is very important I'm pretty much just gonna tell you to copy the settings that I'm using so if you didn't see there I just hit a little Settings button another way to access it is just to go to file and then settings and we have a very confusing looking amount of settings here to go through so general let's just go through here language obviously you're gonna do whatever you want there I'm here you can play with those what you like they're not really that important and we can pretty much just ignore the rest of this general tab we're gonna go down to stream again I'm not gonna be showing you streaming in this video just screen recording so we're gonna go down to output alright so now output mode make sure this is set to simple now your video bitrate this is pretty much the higher this is the better the video is gonna look so I like to just leave mine on 2500 if you have a very good CPU very good graphics card then you can at put yours up to 3,500 but typically 2500 is fine that's what you're seeing right now unless you're recording a game and you really want it to look amazing you probably don't need to play with this too much software encoder it's gonna leave it on default here audio bitrate okay so I like to put my audio bitrate up to 320 again it's gonna use up more space in your file size but that's okay 320 audio bitrate you can leave it on 160 pretty much if you put it up to 320 it's just taking more bits for every sample okay so now recording quality so we're not gonna set this as same as stream we're gonna put this to indistinguishable quality large file size now if you really want your video to look amazing and you don't mind having gigabyte files for only a minute or two of recording then you can go to this file size but I'm telling you it is much larger than this large file size so right now I have a video it's about 7 minutes long though I'm recording right now and it's probably gonna be I don't know let's see maybe like 300 megabytes probably not even it'll probably be between 100 and 200 megabytes if I was on tremendously large file size this would be a few gigabytes already so just keep that in mind okay and now we're gonna change the recording format so FLV I mean you can use that if you want I prefer just set mine to mp4 really doesn't matter just whatever ones you prefer don't worry about this this error message here it's not a big deal encoder again we're just gonna use the regular software encoder we don't need this low CPU preset and yeah that's about it for output okay so now audio so we're gonna go for our desktop audio device we're just going to set this to default so pretty much this is gonna allow us to have a device that records our desktop audio so say for example if you're recording a game and you want to hear these sounds in the game that's what we're gonna be doing now for mic slash exhilerated device you can just leave this blank because we've already set an audio device down below if you have another audio device that you want to set then you can use that okay so now for the separate and the channel so this sampler is gonna depend on what your microphone is and the quality of your America microphone so you're gonna have to check the specs on your microphone if you just have a headset mic you're gonna want to leave this on 44.1 if you have like an expensive mic or a studio microphone you're gonna set this to 48 Hertz so I'm gonna set mine to 48 Hertz because I do have a blue Yeti microphone it says this program must be restarted we can do that after channel just leave yours on stereo that's fine audiometer decay rate this doesn't matter you can just leave that like that and now to video okay so this is important here so we see here we have the base and canvas resolution so this pretty much is just the resolution of the monitor that you're recording now your output or your scaled resolution so if you have a decent computer I'm not saying it has to be a god computer you don't have to have like full custom built like 16 gigs or it you don't need all that stuff as long as your computer is somewhat modern you're gonna want to make this output resolution the same as your regular resolution so I'm gonna set mine to 1920 by 1080 like so and then we're gonna go to downscale filter and we're gonna set this up to the highest possible so 32 now the FPS so this is gonna be very important so pretty much if we set this up higher to 60 for example we're gonna be taking double the amount of frames every second right so FPS frames per second you're only gonna want to set this to 60 if you have a pretty good computer now if you don't have a good computer say maybe you're a generation you don't have a great processor the processor is what's the most important here you're gonna want to leave this on 30 otherwise you're gonna notice if you're playing games you're using anything that has like somewhat of a CPU usage it's gonna be lighting so I'm gonna set mine to 60 I'll tell you my specs right now I have an i5 7700 K it's at 4.2 gigahertz so it's pretty quick again if you guys don't have an overclocked processor or not you're not rockin an i7 you're probably not gonna want to put this on 60 you can always try it and if it doesn't work just put it down to 30 but really if you're not recording games it's not gonna make a huge deal leave it on 30 okay all right so we're gonna click OK and then you can see we have this mic and auxilary device here showing up can just mute this like so and then we have this desktop audio that's showing up so now this is a I don't know if I can get a sound to come out of my computer right now yeah so pretty much any sounds it comes at your computer playing games synced music etc it's gonna show up here you can adjust the audio levels by simply sliding the bar like so and that goes for all of these now if you want to do advanced audio settings again watch my next video coming out and I'll go over that okay so let's go back into settings for a second I just wanted to show you that and go back to video and then to advanced okay so in advanced can go through here and I think that might actually be it so leave this on normal click apply and I think that's everything for this tutorial so this is just setting up your basic OBS now we've set everything up we have we can see we have our profile basic recording our scene screen recording and we have our blue Yeti our main monitor and then we have our audio devices over here which we can then either mute or turn them up in volume in the next tutorial for this so it's not going to be like directly linked to this it's gonna be talking about how to increase your audio or make your audio sound better we're gonna be going through the filters here on the microphone UK you guys can try playing around with them if you want right now just to see what works for you and yeah so if you want to start recording you go ahead you hit start recording and now this was something that I kind of was having trouble with when I first did when I was first doing this if you hit start recording it's gonna start recording to a default path so if you want to change this path again we can go to settings output and then you can just change your recording path right here just so you know exactly what it's recording I recommend you change this to just a dedicated folder because if you're recording a lot of videos you don't want to know exactly what where they're going let's say for example you record a video and you don't know where it went you can go to file show recordings and it will pop up where the videos will be saved okay so that has been the tutorial on how to set up OBS for quality screen recording if you enjoyed and this helped you out please leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again another video
