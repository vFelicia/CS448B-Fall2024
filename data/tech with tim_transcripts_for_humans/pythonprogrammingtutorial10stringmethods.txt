00:00 - hey guys welcome back today we're going
00:02 - to be doing the 10th video in my Python
00:05 - Programming series and today we're going
00:06 - to be talking about string Methods um so
00:09 - method is simply something you can call
00:11 - on a string by using the delimiter of a
00:14 - period followed by whatever the method
00:17 - is and then brackets like this now
00:20 - sometimes we have to put some things
00:21 - inside of the brackets um but most of
00:23 - the time we can just leave them with
00:27 - empty brackets okay so let's get right
00:29 - into an example we're going to start by
00:30 - talking about the dot dot strip method
00:34 - um now what this one does is it pretty
00:36 - much removes all of the leading and
00:38 - trailing white spaces from a word or
00:42 - from a string sorry so we'll start by
00:45 - just making a variable and we'll make it
00:46 - equal to the input from the console and
00:50 - we'll just say
00:52 - input something like
00:54 - that and then we're just going to print
00:56 - out our input so oops print out
01:00 - text. strip okay so again what strip
01:04 - does is just going to remove all the
01:06 - white spaces before and after the word
01:08 - and it's best to show you with an
01:10 - example um so you can see if we type a
01:12 - few spaces so 1 2 3 4 and then I type
01:16 - hello and then a few more spaces and I
01:18 - click enter it simply gives us hello
01:20 - that's because it had removed all of the
01:22 - spaces from the string while as if I
01:25 - don't have the dot strip here so if I
01:28 - get rid of that and we run it and I do
01:30 - some spaces again and I type hello and
01:33 - some more spaces it's going to give us
01:34 - those spaces as a part of the string and
01:37 - most of the times when we have a string
01:39 - we want to remove these spaces so that's
01:41 - why we use dot
01:43 - strip did I spell that right strip yeah
01:46 - just like that okay um all right so that
01:49 - one's pretty straightforward just
01:50 - removes these spaces now you may want to
01:52 - do this if you're checking um if a
01:54 - string is equal to a certain thing and
01:56 - you're getting a user input and they may
01:58 - have accidentally typed the space before
01:59 - before or after the word right okay so
02:02 - now we'll move on to the Len um so this
02:05 - one is actually not a method because you
02:07 - don't call it using a DOT um using a
02:10 - period followed by the word it's
02:11 - actually known as a function which I'll
02:13 - get into later so this just means that
02:15 - it takes something inside of the
02:17 - brackets um so this stands for length
02:19 - Len and pretty much what it does is
02:22 - Returns the length of a string or of a
02:24 - list so right now we're going to use a
02:26 - string and we're going to put text in
02:28 - here and I'll show you again what it
02:30 - does um 1 2 3 4 5 remember although this
02:35 - is a number since I'm typing it in the
02:36 - console it actually gives me a string
02:38 - value so this will work and it says that
02:40 - the length of this is five again uh that
02:43 - one's pretty useful I used it in the
02:45 - last video um to determine how many
02:47 - times we had to iterate through a list
02:49 - because we got the length of the
02:51 - list all right now for lower so pretty
02:55 - much what lower does um is it turns
02:58 - everything into lower cases in our word
03:01 - um so again it's best to just show using
03:03 - an example if I type something like this
03:07 - uh with a few lower cases a few capitals
03:10 - and I click enter you see we get
03:12 - everything in lowercase
03:15 - letters all right and now for Dot Upper
03:17 - you can probably guess what this one's
03:19 - going to do it's the exact same thing
03:20 - except in this case everything is going
03:23 - to uppercase
03:25 - so like this and you see we get all
03:28 - uppercase letters
03:31 - all right um and now for the last string
03:35 - method that I'm going to talk about
03:36 - although there is tons of different
03:38 - string Methods um there's probably over
03:40 - 40 or 50 I'm going to leave the link
03:42 - down below to all of the string Methods
03:44 - on the python website so you can go
03:46 - check them out if you'd like to see some
03:47 - more um so this one is called dos spit
03:51 - now this one I'd say is probably one of
03:52 - the most useful methods that I um that I
03:55 - use all the time and what it does is it
03:57 - actually creates a list out of of the
04:00 - string that you give it um so inside of
04:03 - these brackets you're going to put
04:05 - what's called a delimiter and what a
04:07 - delimiter is is pretty much what you
04:09 - want to split by so for example I'm
04:12 - going to put a period in here just so we
04:14 - can get an example so we have text dosit
04:18 - and inside of the brackets for dos spit
04:21 - we have a period so it's best to just
04:23 - show an example oh invalid syntax I
04:26 - think I have one too many brackets there
04:27 - yes I do okay so run it so I input
04:30 - something I'm going to type
04:32 - hello.
04:34 - tim. by. High just a few random words
04:38 - and you can see they're all separated by
04:40 - a period or by a DOT now when I click
04:44 - enter you see we actually get a list
04:47 - with all of the words and you notice
04:50 - that we don't actually have a period in
04:52 - this list that's because the way that
04:55 - dot split works is it gets rid of the
04:57 - delimiter so since the delimiter was a
04:59 - period it's not going to include the
05:01 - period in this list now this may be kind
05:03 - of confusing um we'll do a few more
05:05 - examples so hope hopefully you can
05:07 - understand so usually what you do um is
05:10 - you would you you would leave these uh
05:13 - brackets blank so you wouldn't put
05:14 - anything in them and by default Python's
05:16 - going to say okay well I guess you want
05:18 - to eliminate by a space um so the way
05:22 - that we can do this again um what'll
05:24 - happen is if I type a sentence like my
05:26 - name is Tim um and I click enter here
05:30 - you see it separates by spaces and we
05:32 - have no spaces in our list because it
05:35 - removes those spaces now you could also
05:38 - diiminate by anything you like so I
05:40 - could do an a for example um now if
05:44 - click F5 and we just type a bunch of
05:46 - letters and I put an A and then another
05:49 - a you see we get um the letters and
05:52 - again there's a space at the end because
05:53 - I typed a space right um so yeah okay so
05:58 - that's how dot split works now dos
06:00 - split's very useful um if you want to do
06:03 - certain things with a list we're going
06:04 - to talk a bit more about it later on um
06:07 - but those are just some basic string
06:08 - Methods that we talked about today again
06:11 - there are tons more on the python
06:12 - website which I will link down below um
06:15 - if you like the video please like And
