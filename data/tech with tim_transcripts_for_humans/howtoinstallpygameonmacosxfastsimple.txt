00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:03 - YouTube video so today's video I'm gonna
00:05 - be going over how to install PI game on
00:08 - a Mac OS X computer now personally what
00:11 - I was doing is I had a lot of
00:12 - difficulties and there's a lot of things
00:14 - I went through to try to get this to
00:15 - work but I think I found the easiest
00:17 - solution so I'm gonna be sharing with
00:19 - you sharing that with you today now to
00:22 - do so what we're gonna have to do is we
00:24 - have to install the hip now if you don't
00:25 - know what pip is that's package
00:27 - installer for Python as Pi game is a
00:29 - Python module so once we have pip then
00:32 - that's going to allow us to install any
00:34 - package which is gonna be extremely
00:36 - useful in the future so to do this we
00:38 - first need to open up our terminal so if
00:40 - you don't already have terminal open go
00:41 - ahead and go to your spotlight in the
00:43 - top right hand corner here and just
00:44 - search terminal if for some reason you
00:47 - can't find the spotlight it's probably
00:48 - somewhere in your dock at the bottom of
00:51 - the screen you just see mine's off to
00:52 - the side so it doesn't get in the way
00:53 - right now go ahead and open that up I
00:55 - already have mine open and then in here
00:58 - we're going to start just by typing curl
01:00 - and then we're gonna stop and not hit
01:02 - enter yet now what we need to do is we
01:04 - need to go to this website so you can
01:06 - either copy it down just by looking at
01:08 - the link up here on the top right in the
01:10 - top left hand corner of my screen or you
01:12 - can go down to this description below
01:14 - and copy that link just ctrl C and make
01:18 - sure that's on your clipboard so I've
01:20 - done that now we're gonna go back in
01:22 - here to our terminal now once we have
01:24 - this link and we're simply going to
01:26 - paste it in and then that's and then
01:30 - we're gonna put a sign that looks like
01:32 - this as you can see this right here and
01:34 - then we're just gonna type get - tip dot
01:38 - py so I'll slow down here for a second
01:41 - so you can copy this down so curl that
01:42 - link I showed you and then get - pipbuck
01:45 - py so this website here that I have open
01:48 - pretty much is just a way to install pip
01:51 - so it's just a module that you can run
01:53 - in Python that's gonna automatically
01:54 - install it for us so it's gonna make
01:56 - things a lot easier once you've done
01:58 - this you've typed this line and go ahead
01:59 - and hit enter and you can see we're
02:01 - going to be popped up at the loading
02:03 - screen and there we go so in pip has now
02:06 - been installed on my computer now that
02:09 - we have pip installed what we need to
02:10 - type is just sudo so we're gonna be
02:12 - running this as an
02:13 - straighter and then pip install hogging
02:20 - like this now once you do that it's
02:22 - gonna ask you for your password because
02:24 - you've typed sudo so you're not gonna
02:25 - see your password run you type this in
02:27 - but just go ahead and type it in
02:29 - nothing's gonna pop up on the screen
02:31 - once you've typed it in just hit enter
02:33 - and then you could see everything is
02:35 - gonna start running so you can see it
02:37 - says downloading pygame
02:38 - and installing pygame successfully
02:41 - installed pygame 1.9.3 now my PI game
02:45 - was already installed so this one a bit
02:46 - faster but if yours isn't installed you
02:48 - might see a few more lines now to verify
02:50 - that everything is working let's go
02:51 - ahead and open up our Python so I'm just
02:53 - gonna run my ID le here and then it
02:56 - should bring up the console for me and
02:57 - I'm simply just gonna type in here
02:59 - import hockey like this you hit enter
03:02 - and if you don't get an error that means
03:04 - that everything is working correctly and
03:06 - you've done everything right so that has
