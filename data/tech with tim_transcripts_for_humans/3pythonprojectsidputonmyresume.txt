With timestamps:

00:00 - I've built over 100 python projects but
00:03 - here are three that I would actually put
00:05 - on my resume but first let's understand
00:08 - the four key components that make a
00:10 - great resumé project number one is that
00:12 - it needs to be easy to understand no one
00:15 - cares about your resume projects if they
00:17 - don't understand what they are
00:19 - regardless of what you build you need to
00:20 - be able to summarize it really simply
00:22 - and in one sentence someone should
00:24 - understand exactly what it is and why
00:26 - you built it number two is that it needs
00:28 - to have a wow factor you need to build
00:31 - something unique that when someone reads
00:32 - the title they immediately go wow that's
00:35 - cool I want to know more about that if
00:37 - you're resume projects are actually
00:39 - going to help you out people need to
00:40 - look at them or at least ask you
00:42 - questions about them and that's why you
00:44 - need a wow factor now number three is
00:46 - that they have to have been built for a
00:48 - purpose the best resumé projects solve a
00:50 - real world problem and have a story
00:52 - behind them sure you can just build
00:54 - something to put on your resume but it's
00:56 - a lot better in an interview to actually
00:58 - explain why you need it to build this
01:00 - and the type of problem that you're
01:02 - solving even less impressive projects
01:04 - that have a really good backstory
01:05 - usually stand out quite a bit more and
01:08 - they make it a lot easier for you to
01:09 - explain them with passion during an
01:11 - interview and lastly number four is that
01:13 - you need to demonstrate the capabilities
01:15 - employers are looking for especially at
01:17 - the junior level employers want to know
01:19 - that you're capable of actually building
01:21 - something on your own and specifically
01:23 - using the tools Frameworks or languages
01:25 - that are listed in the job description
01:27 - that you'll be using on a day-to-day so
01:29 - so feel free to change up your resume
01:31 - and tailor the projects you're putting
01:33 - there to the specific role that you're
01:34 - applying for so now let's dive into the
01:37 - three python projects I would put on my
01:39 - resume and why after an important
01:41 - message now when you do start building
01:43 - out these programming projects you'll
01:45 - want to be working in an IDE and that's
01:47 - not just because idees make your life so
01:49 - much easier but because experience with
01:52 - them is actually something that a lot of
01:53 - jobs are looking for now look there's
01:55 - all kinds of basic code editors out
01:57 - there that you could be using but if you
01:59 - want to get the professional level you
02:01 - should really utilize Jeet brains idees
02:03 - which is the sponsor of this video
02:06 - whether you're working in Python go rust
02:09 - Java you name it Jeet brains has a fully
02:11 - featured professional IDE for you these
02:14 - idees offer the best performance and
02:16 - speed and have impressive user
02:18 - interfaces take advantage of integrated
02:20 - debuggers code analysis quick fixes and
02:23 - incredible AI assistance that
02:25 - supercharge your workflow not to mention
02:27 - features like instant search and
02:29 - navigation and an insane amount of
02:31 - plugins to customize your environment
02:33 - now as you scale up and work on larger
02:35 - and larger projects the importance of an
02:37 - IDE becomes clear and can have a massive
02:39 - impact on your performance and
02:41 - efficiency you should really start
02:43 - building strong habits Now by working
02:45 - with professional jet brains idees by
02:47 - clicking the link in the description and
02:49 - taking advantage of these powerful tools
02:51 - so when we're selecting projects for our
02:53 - resume we want to choose a variety of
02:55 - different projects that showcase our
02:57 - knowledge across the different fields
02:59 - and skills that the employer is looking
03:01 - for and for a python related position
03:04 - usually this will be within something
03:05 - like web development or machine learning
03:07 - or automation so make sure you select
03:09 - the specific projects that really fit
03:11 - the role but if you're just doing a
03:13 - general resume showcasing your python
03:15 - skills you may want to have a few
03:17 - projects that cover those different
03:19 - areas so that's exactly what I would do
03:21 - and why I've selected these three
03:22 - projects I have one project that's a web
03:25 - development project another one that's
03:26 - more Ai and machine learning and then
03:28 - one that's more AUD and showcases that I
03:31 - can combine python with different
03:33 - languages so keep that in mind and let's
03:34 - roll into project number one here which
03:37 - is a Django website now this website
03:39 - right here fits the criteria I listed
03:41 - before it was actually built for a
03:43 - purpose and this purpose was to
03:44 - facilitate something called a code jam
03:47 - now a code Jam was a monthly coding
03:48 - competition I ran a while ago and this
03:50 - was actually a community project that a
03:52 - lot of people built now full disclosure
03:54 - here I did not build this entire website
03:57 - and if I did put it on my resume I would
03:58 - need to mention this specific
04:00 - contributions that I made as this was a
04:02 - community project but it makes such a
04:04 - great project for a resume which is why
04:05 - I'm showing it to you so first of all in
04:07 - order to use this site you need to sign
04:09 - in with GitHub so immediately that
04:11 - demonstrates that we know how to
04:12 - interact with an API and kind of bring
04:14 - an integration into our site now this
04:16 - entire site is built with Jango it's a
04:18 - whole python backend then obviously we
04:20 - have some HTML and JavaScript styling
04:22 - showing that we know some other
04:24 - languages as well so we have a nice
04:26 - landing page here you can see we can
04:27 - join the Discord server or we can view
04:29 - the current timoon so if I view the
04:31 - current timoon this is a competition
04:33 - that was happening this was about a year
04:34 - ago that it was going on and we have
04:36 - different roles so notice here that I'm
04:38 - kind of an admin user so I have the
04:39 - ability to end the timoon start team
04:42 - creation start submission start voting
04:44 - the different phases of the competition
04:46 - I can view the different submissions
04:48 - here so if I go here I can view all of
04:49 - them from the different teams that
04:51 - enrolled let's go back and I have the
04:53 - ability to judge as well so we can go
04:55 - here and we can view all the comments
04:57 - from the judges we can view the
04:58 - different categories and you can see
05:00 - this actually a pretty sophisticated
05:02 - website and the team that built this put
05:04 - quite a bit of work into this so as an
05:05 - individual this would take a long time
05:07 - to build but I think it's a really
05:08 - really great project that demonstrates
05:10 - so many different skills and again is
05:12 - really built for a real purpose and
05:13 - allows you to talk about why you need it
05:15 - to make this now let's go back to the
05:17 - homepage here you can see that we can
05:19 - view the timoon history and we can see
05:21 - who won in the previous timoon so we
05:23 - have these winners we can view all of
05:25 - their different projects we can go to
05:27 - something like unreleased there's no
05:29 - unreleased challenges so there's nothing
05:30 - there and then we can view things like
05:32 - the rules Etc there's a lot of other
05:34 - features here and depending on what type
05:36 - of user you're signed in as you'll have
05:38 - different permissions on the site but
05:40 - the reason I really love this project is
05:42 - because it takes all four of those boxes
05:44 - I talked about before it's Unique it has
05:47 - that wow factor it's easy to understand
05:49 - it's for grading a custom coding
05:51 - competition it's something that was
05:52 - built for a real purpose that has a
05:54 - story behind it and that's interesting
05:56 - to tell in an interview and it
05:57 - definitely demonstrates a lot of
05:59 - different capabilities at minimum
06:01 - building an entire site with Django but
06:03 - also user management interacting with
06:05 - different apis having some JavaScript
06:07 - and some HTML and it's sufficiently
06:09 - complex that if someone saw this on a
06:11 - resume and you were able to explain it
06:13 - to them they' know that you know Python
06:15 - and specifically know the D Jango
06:17 - framework now again I didn't build this
06:18 - entirely by myself but I could have if I
06:20 - wanted to and if I had done that I would
06:22 - definitely put this on my resume and it
06:24 - would be a great project that I could
06:26 - talk a lot about in an interview so the
06:28 - next project we're looking at is one of
06:30 - my all-time favorites and this is an AI
06:32 - learning how to play the game of Flappy
06:34 - Bird now this is great because not only
06:36 - did I code out the AI but I also coded
06:38 - out the game of Flappy Bird now as I
06:40 - said before we want to pick projects
06:42 - that kind of fit different categories
06:44 - based on the role that we're applying to
06:46 - so this one would be more for an AI or
06:48 - machine learning type position and could
06:49 - maybe even fit into data science as well
06:52 - although it's a little bit different
06:53 - than that anyways let's run the code
06:55 - here and I'll kind of explain to you how
06:56 - this works and why I love this project
06:58 - so this uses something called neuro
07:00 - evolution of augmented topologies
07:02 - otherwise known as neat now this is an
07:05 - evolutionary algorithm that trains in AI
07:07 - how to play a game through multiple
07:09 - different iterations and generations in
07:12 - this case we have about 50 birds in one
07:14 - generation it then takes the best
07:15 - performing birds from that generation
07:17 - kind of breeds them together and
07:19 - combines some of their parameters and
07:21 - eventually we end up with a bird that
07:23 - can go through the different pipes so
07:24 - the reason I really love this project is
07:26 - it's visual it's easy to understand it
07:29 - has that that wow factor because someone
07:30 - wants to ask hey how did you do that how
07:32 - did you train an AI how to play Flappy
07:34 - Bird we built it for a purpose because
07:36 - we wanted to actually do something
07:37 - related to machine learning and AI we
07:39 - wanted to maybe complete Flappy Bird
07:41 - maybe it's one of our favorite games we
07:42 - can come up with a decent story on why
07:44 - we wanted to build this and then we
07:47 - actually have the Showcase of our
07:48 - capabilities building an AI is not
07:50 - simple especially using something like
07:52 - neat it's a more advanced technique and
07:54 - algorithm and we can explain to the
07:56 - interviewer how it works right it's an
07:58 - interesting story we can showcase our
08:00 - knowledge of AI and machine learning by
08:02 - explaining how the neat algorithm
08:03 - operates and I just think it makes a
08:05 - really really great project and everyone
08:07 - that I've showed this to has really
08:08 - enjoyed it even if they're a
08:09 - non-programmer so hopefully you're
08:11 - getting the idea here things that are
08:13 - visual things that are easy to
08:14 - understand that are sufficiently complex
08:17 - that's what we're going for here and all
08:18 - the projects I've showed you so far
08:20 - immediately you can see the value from
08:22 - them and you can see how we could craft
08:24 - a really great story and really
08:26 - demonstrate our skills in an interview a
08:28 - project is not just there to be read
08:30 - it's there to be explained and
08:31 - elaborated on and you can really use
08:33 - that to your advantage when you're
08:35 - actually in an interview you can point
08:36 - to those different projects and say
08:38 - because of this project I did this this
08:39 - and this that's why you should consider
08:41 - me for this role so the last project I
08:43 - have for you Falls more into the
08:44 - automation category and it has a really
08:47 - strong purpose because it's something a
08:48 - lot of businesses actually legitimately
08:51 - need it's showing that you can build
08:52 - something that does solve a real world
08:54 - problem and does have real world value
08:57 - anyways let's get into it here and I'll
08:58 - quickly talk about kind kind of how it
08:59 - works then run you through the code a
09:01 - little bit so this project uses a
09:03 - combination of python specifically it
09:05 - uses flask for a backend API and then it
09:08 - uses react and JavaScript on the front
09:10 - end to actually render out and kind of
09:12 - visualize the website now this
09:14 - demonstrates you know how to use python
09:16 - in its correct purpose more for backend
09:18 - type languages and how to combine it
09:20 - with other languages which is a good
09:21 - skill and shows that you know more than
09:23 - simply just python so what we can do
09:25 - here with this is we can actually track
09:28 - the price of different products across
09:30 - amazon.com Now what I could do is I
09:32 - could type in a product here maybe I
09:34 - want to track the prices of soap or
09:35 - something and then I can start this web
09:37 - scraper and what this does is go to
09:39 - Amazon scrape all the products that
09:42 - match this filter in this case it's soap
09:44 - and then it will return a list to us and
09:46 - store them in a database so it's a
09:48 - multi-step process some of it's handled
09:50 - by python some of it's handled by the
09:52 - front end and it makes a really good
09:53 - project there's a lot of stuff that you
09:55 - can explain and it's fairly complex yet
09:57 - it's easy to understand just the
09:59 - implementation is complicated so if I
10:01 - scroll down here you can see that for
10:03 - something like an RTX 4080 it's showing
10:05 - me the last price I scraped this on
10:07 - March 3rd that was the last time and
10:09 - then any price change in this case if I
10:11 - look at this one we can see that there's
10:13 - been a bunch of price changes here and
10:14 - it's tracking all of those different
10:16 - changes for this specific Tower so kind
10:18 - of an interesting tool and you can see
10:20 - how businesses could use this in the
10:21 - e-commerce space a lot of these don't
10:23 - have any price changes that's fine you
10:25 - can see that it just shows you the
10:26 - actual Tower right here now if I click
10:28 - on something else like my ddr5 Ram same
10:31 - thing we can see any of the different
10:32 - price changes we can view ddr5 Ram we
10:35 - can view the product on Amazon or in
10:37 - this case this one was on NewEgg because
10:39 - it does it on multiple different sites
10:41 - and now let me quickly explain to you
10:42 - how this actually operates so you can
10:44 - see the python component for it so in my
10:46 - code here you can see that I have a back
10:48 - end a front end and then a tool that
10:50 - actually runs this on a schedule this
10:52 - uses python as well just to
10:53 - automatically send a request to the
10:55 - backend API to actually initiate the
10:58 - scraping now this this is a little bit
10:59 - complicated to explain in a minute or
11:01 - two I'm going to try to go really
11:02 - quickly you can see that I have a flask
11:04 - API setup here and what this will do is
11:06 - actually go to amazon.com it uses
11:09 - something called bright data we don't
11:10 - need to talk about that here that does
11:12 - some automated web scraping gets the
11:14 - results back to the API and then it
11:16 - saves that in a database and then
11:18 - Returns the results to the front end so
11:20 - it's doing two things right it's
11:21 - actually initiating the different
11:22 - scraping going to the site grabbing
11:24 - those different products storing them in
11:26 - a database and it's also communicating
11:28 - with the front end giving the data that
11:30 - the front end needs so it's showing that
11:32 - we know how to separate out different
11:33 - concerns how we handle the data on the
11:35 - back end and then push that to the front
11:36 - end how we interact with the database
11:38 - and how we write a flask API so you can
11:41 - see that I have some database models
11:42 - here right for a product result for my
11:44 - tracked product because there's some
11:46 - products that you can actually track and
11:47 - they'll automatically be scraped every
11:49 - day every hour whatever time period you
11:51 - want we have a few different endpoints
11:53 - that we've written here this one is to
11:55 - get the different results so we're
11:56 - posting the results to this endpoint
11:58 - when they're received there's a bunch of
11:59 - other stuff that goes on here I actually
12:01 - have an entire video walking through
12:02 - this project that I will link on screen
12:05 - the idea is it's a pretty complicated
12:07 - back end there's a lot of stuff going on
12:09 - we have something for the API we have
12:10 - something for the web scraper you can
12:12 - see there's a bunch of code here that
12:13 - actually does the web scraping itself
12:15 - we're communicating with different
12:16 - endpoints using a rest API and then we
12:18 - have a front end that's displaying all
12:20 - of that information so having that on a
12:22 - resume and being able to walk through
12:24 - that very clearly in an interview is
12:25 - going to show you really know what
12:27 - you're doing you know how to build a
12:28 - large Pro project you know how to solve
12:30 - different problems you know how to
12:31 - connect different components together
12:33 - which is what a lot of companies are
12:35 - looking for so with all that said let's
12:36 - wrap up by going through a few key tips
12:38 - you want to keep in mind when you're
12:40 - actually determining your resumé
12:42 - projects first of all when you're
12:44 - building a resumé project always try to
12:46 - build something that has a good story
12:48 - has a good reason behind it something
12:50 - that you can actually point to and say
12:51 - hey the reason I needed this project was
12:54 - because this issue that I faced that's
12:56 - what you do as a software engineer you
12:57 - solve problems and you build products
12:59 - that help everyday people so being able
13:02 - to explain that how you went from the
13:04 - problem to the solution and the
13:05 - different design decisions that you made
13:07 - is really important and stands out a lot
13:09 - more than purely the complexity of your
13:12 - project it's also really important to
13:14 - make sure that your project stand out
13:16 - they have that wow factor and that
13:17 - people actually want to look at them if
13:19 - you build the same thing that everyone
13:21 - else has built an employer or a
13:23 - recruiter is not even going to click on
13:24 - the link they're not even going to check
13:25 - it out so make sure you're building
13:27 - something that's exciting that people
13:28 - actually want to look at and that
13:30 - they're going to ask you questions about
13:32 - a lot of recruiters won't actually look
13:33 - at your projects before an interview
13:35 - what they're going to do is ask you
13:37 - questions about them if they do
13:38 - eventually decide to bring you in if you
13:40 - had a really really impressive project
13:42 - they might check it out briefly that
13:44 - could be the reason that they actually
13:45 - invite you for an interview because they
13:47 - want to learn more about it and you
13:48 - stood out compared to a lot of other
13:50 - people I know that I've had that happen
13:52 - to me people have seen some of the
13:53 - projects and accomplishments that I had
13:55 - on my resume and invited me purely
13:57 - because they were interested in that
13:59 - didn't necessarily think they were going
14:00 - to give me a job they said hey this guy
14:02 - looks a little bit different than all
14:03 - these other candidates let's invite him
14:05 - in let's see what he's about so just
14:06 - another way to make yourself Stand Out
14:08 - have that wow factor make sure people
14:10 - can understand what it is and also make
14:12 - sure if possible it's easy for someone
14:14 - to actually view the project if it's a
14:16 - simple website URL that's the best they
14:18 - can just click on it it opens up if it
14:20 - requires a bunch of install steps and
14:22 - they have to set it up on their local
14:24 - computer people just aren't going to do
14:25 - that they're lazy right so the more
14:27 - Visual and easier you can make it for
14:29 - someone to access your project the
14:30 - better it's going to be and the higher
14:32 - chance they're actually going to look at
14:33 - it so with that said guys that's going
14:35 - to wrap up this video If you enjoyed
14:37 - make sure to leave a like subscribe to
14:38 - the channel and I will see you in the
14:40 - next one
14:42 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

I've built over 100 python projects but here are three that I would actually put on my resume but first let's understand the four key components that make a great resumé project number one is that it needs to be easy to understand no one cares about your resume projects if they don't understand what they are regardless of what you build you need to be able to summarize it really simply and in one sentence someone should understand exactly what it is and why you built it number two is that it needs to have a wow factor you need to build something unique that when someone reads the title they immediately go wow that's cool I want to know more about that if you're resume projects are actually going to help you out people need to look at them or at least ask you questions about them and that's why you need a wow factor now number three is that they have to have been built for a purpose the best resumé projects solve a real world problem and have a story behind them sure you can just build something to put on your resume but it's a lot better in an interview to actually explain why you need it to build this and the type of problem that you're solving even less impressive projects that have a really good backstory usually stand out quite a bit more and they make it a lot easier for you to explain them with passion during an interview and lastly number four is that you need to demonstrate the capabilities employers are looking for especially at the junior level employers want to know that you're capable of actually building something on your own and specifically using the tools Frameworks or languages that are listed in the job description that you'll be using on a daytoday so so feel free to change up your resume and tailor the projects you're putting there to the specific role that you're applying for so now let's dive into the three python projects I would put on my resume and why after an important message now when you do start building out these programming projects you'll want to be working in an IDE and that's not just because idees make your life so much easier but because experience with them is actually something that a lot of jobs are looking for now look there's all kinds of basic code editors out there that you could be using but if you want to get the professional level you should really utilize Jeet brains idees which is the sponsor of this video whether you're working in Python go rust Java you name it Jeet brains has a fully featured professional IDE for you these idees offer the best performance and speed and have impressive user interfaces take advantage of integrated debuggers code analysis quick fixes and incredible AI assistance that supercharge your workflow not to mention features like instant search and navigation and an insane amount of plugins to customize your environment now as you scale up and work on larger and larger projects the importance of an IDE becomes clear and can have a massive impact on your performance and efficiency you should really start building strong habits Now by working with professional jet brains idees by clicking the link in the description and taking advantage of these powerful tools so when we're selecting projects for our resume we want to choose a variety of different projects that showcase our knowledge across the different fields and skills that the employer is looking for and for a python related position usually this will be within something like web development or machine learning or automation so make sure you select the specific projects that really fit the role but if you're just doing a general resume showcasing your python skills you may want to have a few projects that cover those different areas so that's exactly what I would do and why I've selected these three projects I have one project that's a web development project another one that's more Ai and machine learning and then one that's more AUD and showcases that I can combine python with different languages so keep that in mind and let's roll into project number one here which is a Django website now this website right here fits the criteria I listed before it was actually built for a purpose and this purpose was to facilitate something called a code jam now a code Jam was a monthly coding competition I ran a while ago and this was actually a community project that a lot of people built now full disclosure here I did not build this entire website and if I did put it on my resume I would need to mention this specific contributions that I made as this was a community project but it makes such a great project for a resume which is why I'm showing it to you so first of all in order to use this site you need to sign in with GitHub so immediately that demonstrates that we know how to interact with an API and kind of bring an integration into our site now this entire site is built with Jango it's a whole python backend then obviously we have some HTML and JavaScript styling showing that we know some other languages as well so we have a nice landing page here you can see we can join the Discord server or we can view the current timoon so if I view the current timoon this is a competition that was happening this was about a year ago that it was going on and we have different roles so notice here that I'm kind of an admin user so I have the ability to end the timoon start team creation start submission start voting the different phases of the competition I can view the different submissions here so if I go here I can view all of them from the different teams that enrolled let's go back and I have the ability to judge as well so we can go here and we can view all the comments from the judges we can view the different categories and you can see this actually a pretty sophisticated website and the team that built this put quite a bit of work into this so as an individual this would take a long time to build but I think it's a really really great project that demonstrates so many different skills and again is really built for a real purpose and allows you to talk about why you need it to make this now let's go back to the homepage here you can see that we can view the timoon history and we can see who won in the previous timoon so we have these winners we can view all of their different projects we can go to something like unreleased there's no unreleased challenges so there's nothing there and then we can view things like the rules Etc there's a lot of other features here and depending on what type of user you're signed in as you'll have different permissions on the site but the reason I really love this project is because it takes all four of those boxes I talked about before it's Unique it has that wow factor it's easy to understand it's for grading a custom coding competition it's something that was built for a real purpose that has a story behind it and that's interesting to tell in an interview and it definitely demonstrates a lot of different capabilities at minimum building an entire site with Django but also user management interacting with different apis having some JavaScript and some HTML and it's sufficiently complex that if someone saw this on a resume and you were able to explain it to them they' know that you know Python and specifically know the D Jango framework now again I didn't build this entirely by myself but I could have if I wanted to and if I had done that I would definitely put this on my resume and it would be a great project that I could talk a lot about in an interview so the next project we're looking at is one of my alltime favorites and this is an AI learning how to play the game of Flappy Bird now this is great because not only did I code out the AI but I also coded out the game of Flappy Bird now as I said before we want to pick projects that kind of fit different categories based on the role that we're applying to so this one would be more for an AI or machine learning type position and could maybe even fit into data science as well although it's a little bit different than that anyways let's run the code here and I'll kind of explain to you how this works and why I love this project so this uses something called neuro evolution of augmented topologies otherwise known as neat now this is an evolutionary algorithm that trains in AI how to play a game through multiple different iterations and generations in this case we have about 50 birds in one generation it then takes the best performing birds from that generation kind of breeds them together and combines some of their parameters and eventually we end up with a bird that can go through the different pipes so the reason I really love this project is it's visual it's easy to understand it has that that wow factor because someone wants to ask hey how did you do that how did you train an AI how to play Flappy Bird we built it for a purpose because we wanted to actually do something related to machine learning and AI we wanted to maybe complete Flappy Bird maybe it's one of our favorite games we can come up with a decent story on why we wanted to build this and then we actually have the Showcase of our capabilities building an AI is not simple especially using something like neat it's a more advanced technique and algorithm and we can explain to the interviewer how it works right it's an interesting story we can showcase our knowledge of AI and machine learning by explaining how the neat algorithm operates and I just think it makes a really really great project and everyone that I've showed this to has really enjoyed it even if they're a nonprogrammer so hopefully you're getting the idea here things that are visual things that are easy to understand that are sufficiently complex that's what we're going for here and all the projects I've showed you so far immediately you can see the value from them and you can see how we could craft a really great story and really demonstrate our skills in an interview a project is not just there to be read it's there to be explained and elaborated on and you can really use that to your advantage when you're actually in an interview you can point to those different projects and say because of this project I did this this and this that's why you should consider me for this role so the last project I have for you Falls more into the automation category and it has a really strong purpose because it's something a lot of businesses actually legitimately need it's showing that you can build something that does solve a real world problem and does have real world value anyways let's get into it here and I'll quickly talk about kind kind of how it works then run you through the code a little bit so this project uses a combination of python specifically it uses flask for a backend API and then it uses react and JavaScript on the front end to actually render out and kind of visualize the website now this demonstrates you know how to use python in its correct purpose more for backend type languages and how to combine it with other languages which is a good skill and shows that you know more than simply just python so what we can do here with this is we can actually track the price of different products across amazon.com Now what I could do is I could type in a product here maybe I want to track the prices of soap or something and then I can start this web scraper and what this does is go to Amazon scrape all the products that match this filter in this case it's soap and then it will return a list to us and store them in a database so it's a multistep process some of it's handled by python some of it's handled by the front end and it makes a really good project there's a lot of stuff that you can explain and it's fairly complex yet it's easy to understand just the implementation is complicated so if I scroll down here you can see that for something like an RTX 4080 it's showing me the last price I scraped this on March 3rd that was the last time and then any price change in this case if I look at this one we can see that there's been a bunch of price changes here and it's tracking all of those different changes for this specific Tower so kind of an interesting tool and you can see how businesses could use this in the ecommerce space a lot of these don't have any price changes that's fine you can see that it just shows you the actual Tower right here now if I click on something else like my ddr5 Ram same thing we can see any of the different price changes we can view ddr5 Ram we can view the product on Amazon or in this case this one was on NewEgg because it does it on multiple different sites and now let me quickly explain to you how this actually operates so you can see the python component for it so in my code here you can see that I have a back end a front end and then a tool that actually runs this on a schedule this uses python as well just to automatically send a request to the backend API to actually initiate the scraping now this this is a little bit complicated to explain in a minute or two I'm going to try to go really quickly you can see that I have a flask API setup here and what this will do is actually go to amazon.com it uses something called bright data we don't need to talk about that here that does some automated web scraping gets the results back to the API and then it saves that in a database and then Returns the results to the front end so it's doing two things right it's actually initiating the different scraping going to the site grabbing those different products storing them in a database and it's also communicating with the front end giving the data that the front end needs so it's showing that we know how to separate out different concerns how we handle the data on the back end and then push that to the front end how we interact with the database and how we write a flask API so you can see that I have some database models here right for a product result for my tracked product because there's some products that you can actually track and they'll automatically be scraped every day every hour whatever time period you want we have a few different endpoints that we've written here this one is to get the different results so we're posting the results to this endpoint when they're received there's a bunch of other stuff that goes on here I actually have an entire video walking through this project that I will link on screen the idea is it's a pretty complicated back end there's a lot of stuff going on we have something for the API we have something for the web scraper you can see there's a bunch of code here that actually does the web scraping itself we're communicating with different endpoints using a rest API and then we have a front end that's displaying all of that information so having that on a resume and being able to walk through that very clearly in an interview is going to show you really know what you're doing you know how to build a large Pro project you know how to solve different problems you know how to connect different components together which is what a lot of companies are looking for so with all that said let's wrap up by going through a few key tips you want to keep in mind when you're actually determining your resumé projects first of all when you're building a resumé project always try to build something that has a good story has a good reason behind it something that you can actually point to and say hey the reason I needed this project was because this issue that I faced that's what you do as a software engineer you solve problems and you build products that help everyday people so being able to explain that how you went from the problem to the solution and the different design decisions that you made is really important and stands out a lot more than purely the complexity of your project it's also really important to make sure that your project stand out they have that wow factor and that people actually want to look at them if you build the same thing that everyone else has built an employer or a recruiter is not even going to click on the link they're not even going to check it out so make sure you're building something that's exciting that people actually want to look at and that they're going to ask you questions about a lot of recruiters won't actually look at your projects before an interview what they're going to do is ask you questions about them if they do eventually decide to bring you in if you had a really really impressive project they might check it out briefly that could be the reason that they actually invite you for an interview because they want to learn more about it and you stood out compared to a lot of other people I know that I've had that happen to me people have seen some of the projects and accomplishments that I had on my resume and invited me purely because they were interested in that didn't necessarily think they were going to give me a job they said hey this guy looks a little bit different than all these other candidates let's invite him in let's see what he's about so just another way to make yourself Stand Out have that wow factor make sure people can understand what it is and also make sure if possible it's easy for someone to actually view the project if it's a simple website URL that's the best they can just click on it it opens up if it requires a bunch of install steps and they have to set it up on their local computer people just aren't going to do that they're lazy right so the more Visual and easier you can make it for someone to access your project the better it's going to be and the higher chance they're actually going to look at it so with that said guys that's going to wrap up this video If you enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next one
