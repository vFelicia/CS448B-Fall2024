00:00 - so now the third Pro I have for you when
00:01 - it comes to learning machine learning is
00:03 - that you get to be a part of a
00:05 - constantly evolving field that is
00:07 - genuinely changing the way in which
00:08 - humans live now some of you may argue
00:10 - that because you're not very good at
00:12 - machine learning or you're just getting
00:13 - started that you're not really a part of
00:14 - this constantly evolving and very
00:16 - exciting field but I would beg to differ
00:18 - because even just having that basic
00:20 - understanding allows you to really
00:22 - appreciate what is being created by the
00:24 - absolute Geniuses out there you know
00:26 - even something like Tesla chess AIS like
00:28 - stockfish or Alpha zero all of these
00:30 - really cool things that are coming out
00:32 - and personally I am super fascinated and
00:35 - just very interested in watching what
00:36 - people are able to create with this
00:38 - technology because I can actually go in
00:40 - and read a little bit of the research
00:41 - paper kind of understand what it is that
00:43 - they've done on a very very simple level
00:45 - and it's just a really really cool thing
00:47 - to be able to do
