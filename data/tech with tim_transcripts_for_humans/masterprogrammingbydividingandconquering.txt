00:00 - the first design principle that I have
00:01 - for us is known as divide and conquer
00:04 - and what this means is take your large
00:06 - problem and break it down into as many
00:09 - small sub problems as possible solve
00:11 - those smaller sub problems and then that
00:13 - will help you solve the large problem to
00:15 - give you an example of this in a coding
00:17 - context maybe you have some very large
00:20 - scale system maybe the system has some
00:22 - subsystems involved with it maybe those
00:24 - subsystems all have different packages
00:26 - maybe those packages have different
00:27 - classes those classes have different
00:29 - methods maybe those methods use some
00:31 - external dependencies or some functions
00:33 - and now all I need to do is say figure
00:34 - out what all the methods of the class
00:36 - are figure out what all the classes of
00:38 - the packages are figure out what all the
00:40 - packages of the subsystem are and then
00:42 - all of the subsystems of this system as
00:44 - a whole and I'm good to go I've pretty
00:45 - much solved the problem
