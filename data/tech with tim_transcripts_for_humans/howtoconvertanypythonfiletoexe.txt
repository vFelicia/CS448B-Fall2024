With timestamps:

00:00 - in this video I'm gonna be showing you
00:02 - how to convert any Python file or Python
00:05 - project into an executable file that you
00:07 - can run on a machine that does not have
00:09 - Python or the said packages installed so
00:13 - this is gonna work for Python scripts
00:15 - that involve other scripts so you're
00:17 - importing other modules and stuff like
00:19 - that and it's gonna work for just
00:20 - individual scripts as well what we're
00:22 - gonna be using is called PI installer so
00:24 - the first step we need to type CMD in
00:27 - our window is bar down here and just run
00:29 - it as an administrator just for some
00:32 - purposes for installing stuff so this is
00:34 - gonna require that you have pip
00:35 - installed if you don't have pip
00:37 - installed well it defaults comes with
00:39 - Python I'm gonna be showing you how to
00:40 - do that in one second so first thing we
00:42 - want to do is just type it in our CMD
00:44 - now if you've got something that looks
00:46 - like what I got and you did not get any
00:47 - errors go ahead and skip to the
00:49 - timestamp that I'm about to put in the
00:51 - middle of my screen now if you did not
00:53 - watch until that timestamp because I'm
00:56 - gonna be showing you how to install pip
00:58 - really quickly so the first issue you
01:00 - could run into and why you'd be getting
01:02 - this says something like pip is not in
01:03 - path it's an unrecognized command so the
01:06 - easiest way to fix this is to go to just
01:09 - search environment variables in your
01:11 - bottom bar here click edit the system
01:13 - environment variables go to environment
01:16 - variables in path click edit and then
01:19 - here click add or add click new ok so
01:24 - once you click a new in here you're
01:25 - going to type in the body called the
01:28 - directory of your Python file so you can
01:30 - see for me I'm using anaconda and this
01:32 - is the directory I also have a regular
01:34 - Python one that's not currently in my
01:36 - path so what you need to do here is
01:38 - simply find where your python is
01:39 - installed and add that to the path if
01:42 - you don't know where it is i'm gonna put
01:43 - up a default python install location on
01:46 - the screen right now that you can simply
01:47 - put in to the path once you've done that
01:50 - click OK click OK and you should be done
01:53 - click Oh click apply and then click OK
01:55 - again and it should be added to path
01:57 - once again try to click try to type in
01:59 - pip if this does not work then you don't
02:02 - have pip installed in your system and
02:03 - what I would recommend to you is just
02:05 - search python click on python org
02:07 - go to downloads and reinstall python
02:09 - when you do this it so uninstalled
02:12 - python first do this
02:13 - once this downloads and installs just
02:15 - wait one second for it to come up when I
02:17 - click on this it's going to say what do
02:19 - you want to run this file run the file
02:21 - modify and then you can add pip by just
02:25 - clicking on this little check mark here
02:26 - and you can also add it to the path
02:28 - automatically so here say add Python to
02:30 - environment variables click the check
02:32 - mark and click install
02:33 - so as you don't actually have to
02:34 - uninstall Python first sure you want to
02:37 - cancel yes we're gonna cancel cuz we
02:38 - already have that done okay so once
02:40 - you've done that now we're ready to move
02:41 - on to creating our executable file ok so
02:45 - what we're gonna do first of all is we
02:46 - have to go to the directory where we
02:47 - want to create that file so I'm gonna go
02:48 - in my python file and i'm just gonna go
02:50 - to games i'm gonna go to golf game and
02:52 - you can see that here i already have an
02:54 - executable file created this is just
02:56 - because i test it out before to make
02:57 - sure everything was working so what
02:59 - we're gonna do in here is we're gonna
03:00 - simply type CMD once CMD comes up what
03:03 - you're going to type is pip install pi
03:07 - installer like this ok
03:10 - you should run through this you can see
03:12 - that it's not installing for a because
03:13 - it's already installed and everything
03:15 - should work fine there once you have pi
03:16 - installer installed then you can move to
03:19 - creating your executable so to do this
03:20 - you're simply going to type PI installer
03:22 - and then you are going to type the name
03:25 - of the file that you want to create an
03:26 - executable of in this case I want to do
03:29 - Main now it's a few flags you can put
03:31 - here the first flag is - - one file I
03:34 - recommend that you type this as what
03:36 - this is gonna do is create everything in
03:38 - one executable file rather than having a
03:40 - bunch of other files so I recommend you
03:41 - type that I also recommend you put
03:43 - hyphen W here if you don't want your
03:46 - Python file to bring up the console when
03:48 - it runs so if you're running a graphical
03:50 - game with Pi game or something you're
03:51 - gonna want - W if your project works
03:54 - within the console then don't put - W
03:56 - otherwise it's not gonna work okay now
03:58 - you type your script name I'm gonna say
03:59 - Maine Pyaar py and click enter now this
04:03 - takes quite a while especially if you
04:05 - have a project with a lot of
04:06 - dependencies and a lot a project like
04:08 - modules and stuff to import so just wait
04:10 - for that to run I'm gonna fast-forward
04:11 - through this okay so now that's
04:13 - completed we can actually exit out the
04:14 - command prompt window and I'm just gonna
04:16 - show you how to actually run your file
04:18 - so you can see here that in the
04:19 - directory it should have created two
04:21 - folders D is T and build now build you
04:23 - can actually delete you don't need this
04:25 - folder this
04:26 - may not spec you don't need that either
04:27 - so all you need is this D is T so once
04:30 - it loads up you can see that we now have
04:31 - a executable file which is main now if
04:35 - you only had one Python file and it has
04:37 - no dependencies no images no other
04:38 - imports or anything that you created so
04:40 - like for example in my golf game I have
04:42 - Start screen courses and physics which
04:44 - are imported by main then all you have
04:46 - to do is simply click on this executable
04:48 - file and it will run everything and
04:49 - everything should work now in the case
04:51 - that you do have dependencies which you
04:52 - probably do what you're going to want to
04:54 - do is drag this executable file into the
04:57 - main directory where those dependencies
04:58 - are so for example here so we can delete
05:01 - this di s T folder now I need to import
05:04 - images from the image folder and you can
05:05 - see I have images here I have all these
05:07 - other Python files so I'm gonna need to
05:08 - make sure my executable file is in this
05:10 - main directory now if that's all you
05:12 - wanted to do everything should be
05:13 - working fine just double click on this
05:14 - and do note that since it is such a
05:16 - large application file with a lot of
05:18 - dependencies this is gonna take a while
05:19 - to boot up typically for me it takes
05:21 - between one and two minutes actually
05:22 - start running as pygame
05:25 - if you're running just a single script
05:26 - it should not take that long ok so now
05:29 - that we're done that you guys are
05:30 - welcome to click off the video however I
05:31 - am gonna show you one really cool thing
05:32 - to make all of this into one file so
05:35 - that you don't have a big folder like
05:39 - this whenever you trying to run
05:39 - something so all this stuff can be
05:41 - condensed into one folder using
05:43 - something called NS is ok so we're gonna
05:47 - do is we first need to download install
05:48 - NS is to do that you can simply just
05:50 - click the link in the description all
05:52 - you can also do is just type NS is you
05:55 - can click on the website and wait for it
05:58 - to load up ok so now that we're on the
06:01 - website you can simply click on download
06:02 - it should bring you to a page and you
06:04 - can download NS is just run through and
06:06 - click all the default commands it's not
06:08 - very important the installation process
06:10 - of that ok just do whatever was
06:11 - recommended for you
06:13 - alright so now that you have this it
06:14 - should pop up as a desktop icon
06:15 - otherwise you can simply type NS is
06:18 - double click it run it you see it says
06:20 - compiler here simply select compile n SS
06:23 - or installer based on zip file so
06:26 - actually that leads to B the next point
06:27 - what we need to do first of all do is
06:29 - click on the folder in which we're
06:30 - trying to like create a big I don't know
06:33 - whatever you want to call XQ before and
06:35 - we're simply gonna click on it and click
06:37 - send to and then compressed compressed
06:39 - zip
06:40 - now you can see that I already actually
06:41 - have a compressive folder of golf game
06:43 - so we don't need to do that okay so now
06:46 - you've done that click installer based
06:47 - on zip file and simply find the zip file
06:51 - so for me it's right here in Python
06:53 - games you double click on your zip
06:55 - folder and then you can just leave all
06:57 - these the same so now installer name
06:59 - obviously you can change that's what you
07:00 - want interface modern is fine and
07:02 - everything else is just standard ok once
07:06 - it extracts all these files simply click
07:07 - on generate now this will take a while
07:10 - because it's going through a ton of
07:11 - files at least in my case it's like
07:13 - something like 250 megabytes so expect
07:15 - to be waiting here for about a minute or
07:16 - two I'm just gonna fast forward and then
07:17 - talk about the next steps ok so now
07:19 - that's complete you can either click
07:21 - test to try to test out your file or you
07:23 - can click close ok so now that you've
07:25 - done that you should have something that
07:26 - looks like this kind of a weird looking
07:28 - icon you can double click on it when you
07:30 - do this ok so now it brings up a folder
07:32 - like this or installer you can simply
07:34 - select where you want to install click
07:36 - install and then what it's going to do
07:38 - is simply install this folder in that
07:41 - directory that you chose so now if you
07:43 - wanted to export this file or you want
07:45 - to upload it or give it to a friend or
07:46 - something you can simply give them this
07:47 - one application and they can have
07:50 - everything from that and they don't have
07:51 - to have Python installed on their system
07:53 - or any of the packages or anything that
07:54 - you had when you created the game as its
07:56 - going to automatically create them in
07:58 - this executable file when you make that
08:00 - executable okay so that's been it for
08:02 - this video if this helped you out please
08:03 - make sure you guys leave a like on the
08:04 - video and subscribe to the channel for
08:06 - more Python tricks and tips and with
08:09 - that being said I guess I'll see you
08:10 - guys in another video
08:11 - [Music]
