00:00 - today my goal is to work on a machine
00:02 - learning project that would look really
00:03 - good on a resume I have no idea how this
00:06 - video is going to go but I want to give
00:07 - you a realistic look at what it's like
00:09 - to build a project completely from
00:11 - scratch what I go through the bugs I run
00:14 - into how I plan how I design how I come
00:16 - up with the architecture I just want
00:18 - this to be a more real video than some
00:20 - of the tutorials where I already have
00:21 - the code written and you guys know that
00:23 - I'm not really problem solving on the
00:25 - spot anyways I think this will be an
00:27 - interesting idea let me know what you
00:28 - guys think of it in the comments and
00:30 - let's dive in and build a machine
00:31 - learning
00:37 - project so first things first we need an
00:40 - idea now when I generate ideas I
00:42 - typically apply the following checklist
00:44 - first of all is this practical does it
00:47 - make sense is this something I'll
00:48 - actually use second is this challenging
00:51 - enough that I'm going to learn something
00:53 - and I might have some things to talk
00:54 - about in the interview but not
00:55 - challenging enough that I won't be able
00:57 - to complete it so I want to pick
00:58 - something in that intermediate
01:00 - difficulty where I know kind of how to
01:02 - complete the project but there might be
01:03 - a few things that I'll need to learn or
01:05 - pick up along the way which will give me
01:07 - something to talk about in the interview
01:09 - and then lastly I want to make something
01:10 - somewhat visual or at least very easy to
01:12 - use so if I wanted to link to a website
01:15 - or if I want to have just a simple app
01:17 - that someone can download there's not a
01:18 - ton of setup steps and people will
01:20 - actually be able to use this project
01:21 - relatively simply so with that in mind
01:24 - the project I'm deciding to do is a
01:26 - sentiment analysis project for my
01:28 - YouTube comments the idea is I want to
01:31 - have a little UI where you can pop in
01:33 - the URL of a YouTube video it will
01:35 - analyze all the comments and give you
01:37 - kind of a rating and say this video had
01:39 - 80% positive comments 20% negative or
01:42 - something along those lines so that's
01:43 - the project I'm going to try to build
01:45 - now let me show you how I'd plan that
01:46 - out all right so I don't want to bore
01:47 - you guys too much with architecture here
01:50 - but usually when I start a project I'll
01:52 - just do a quick kind of mind map or
01:54 - little diagram in my horrible
01:55 - handwriting just so I have a general
01:57 - sense of the steps or at least parts of
02:00 - the project that I need so you can see
02:02 - we have a front end here I just kind of
02:04 - Drew basically what I'm looking for I
02:06 - want to have you know a title enter some
02:08 - URL and then we're going to have some
02:09 - sentiment report where it's saying you
02:11 - know the percent negative positive
02:12 - neutral Etc that's going to connect to
02:14 - some kind of API the API is going to
02:16 - need to fetch the comments from the
02:18 - YouTube url run the model on those
02:21 - comments and then return and format the
02:23 - result back to the front end and then in
02:25 - terms of my model to create the model
02:26 - I'm going to need to find a data set to
02:28 - train the model on clean that data train
02:31 - the model with that data test it save it
02:34 - and then deploy and use it very very
02:36 - simple you can see we kind of have three
02:37 - parts model API front end I think for
02:41 - this project I'm going to use D Jango
02:43 - we'll see if that works in a second and
02:45 - for the model I'm probably going to go
02:46 - with something like tensorflow just
02:47 - because that's what I'm familiar with
02:49 - all right now let's start working on our
02:51 - model now to work on this AI model it's
02:53 - actually one of the few times that I
02:55 - need a pretty ridiculous computer in
02:57 - terms of specs now fortunately for this
02:59 - video video I teamed up with MSI and
03:01 - they sent me over their Raider g78 hx1
03:05 - 13v now this is a CS 2023 award-winning
03:09 - laptop and is actually the most powerful
03:12 - laptop I've ever used it has a
03:13 - ridiculous Intel 13th gen I9 1390 HX
03:18 - processor that has 24 cores eight of
03:21 - which are power cores meaning they can
03:23 - utilize Intel's adaptive boost
03:25 - technology and get up to 5.6 GHz it also
03:28 - comes with an RT X 490 and 32 GB of RAM
03:32 - which means I can actually load and
03:33 - train these pretty massive machine
03:35 - learning models locally not to mention
03:38 - it's got a 240 HZ 17in 16 by10 QD
03:43 - display that is true cut technology it
03:45 - looks incredible and I can game on it
03:47 - while I'm taking a break from coding now
03:49 - you guys might not know this but one of
03:51 - the massive issues and concerns I
03:53 - typically have with these huge laptops
03:55 - is that there's not enough power to go
03:56 - to both the GPU and the CPU at the same
03:59 - time to run them at their full potential
04:01 - in parallel now this laptop actually
04:04 - mitigates that it has something called
04:05 - over boost technology which allows it to
04:08 - deliver 250 watts in parallel to both
04:11 - the CPU and the GPU so that it can boost
04:14 - up hit those turbo clocks and actually
04:16 - utilize the full potential of the
04:18 - hardware now that's a great feature but
04:19 - for any of you that won't be using the
04:21 - GPU all the time you can actually toggle
04:23 - the discrete graphics mode which allows
04:25 - you to optimize for your performance or
04:27 - battery life using the 9 9.9 wat battery
04:31 - that's charged by this ridiculous power
04:33 - brick that comes with this computer now
04:35 - of course this has Windows 11 full I/O
04:37 - HDMI 2.1 Thunderbolt 4 ethernet SD card
04:41 - reader audio jack really everything I
04:43 - feel like I would need for a mobile
04:45 - workstation which is how I'm going to be
04:47 - using this laptop going forward
04:48 - regardless if you're interested in this
04:50 - computer you can check it out from the
04:51 - link in the description now let's start
04:53 - training that AI
04:56 - model all right so I just got some
04:58 - boiler play code running here just to
05:00 - test my tensorflow installation and a
05:02 - really simple model I'm training this
05:04 - off the IMDb movie review set which is a
05:07 - really popular one that comes built into
05:09 - tensorflow now it's not going to be the
05:11 - best for our use case but it will at
05:13 - least give me a baseline of how much
05:15 - better we need to improve the model and
05:16 - how much more data we might need to feed
05:18 - it so I won't run through all the code
05:20 - here what I'm going to do is just train
05:21 - up this model and let's give it a quick
05:23 - test and kind of see the results we're
05:24 - getting so
05:27 - far so the model is now trained it's
05:30 - giving me a testing accuracy of 86%
05:33 - which is not great but let's just run
05:35 - some simple queries here to see what
05:36 - we're getting so let's say I love this
05:39 - video remember it's going to be
05:41 - sentiment analysis okay positive nice I
05:44 - hate this
05:46 - video positive okay so a little bit of
05:49 - work to do here let's do another one
05:51 - this
05:52 - is really bad positive okay so clearly
05:57 - making a few mistakes here back to the
05:59 - drawing Bo let's see if we can improve
06:02 - this it's been about an hour and what I
06:05 - did is just downloaded a new data set
06:07 - that's a lot larger and closer to the
06:09 - type of content we'll be analyzing so I
06:11 - got this data set here it's called
06:13 - sentiment 140 with 1.6 million tweets I
06:17 - couldn't find anything on YouTube
06:18 - comments so I figured I'd go with this
06:19 - instead by the way this is from kagle
06:21 - they have a bunch of free data sets if
06:23 - you guys want to download anyways I
06:24 - trained up a model here took about 20
06:26 - minutes on this computer which is pretty
06:27 - fast even on GPU uh training here and
06:30 - let's give this a shot and see if it
06:32 - works let's say this is a really bad
06:36 - video I don't like it come on give me
06:38 - negative yes negative okay uh let's see
06:42 - this is the best video I have ever
06:46 - watched positive okay this is okay let's
06:49 - see what it says for that negative all
06:51 - right so that's not quite correct but at
06:53 - least the other one seemed okay uh do
06:55 - another one I really enjoyed this
07:00 - nice work positive okay so it seems like
07:02 - we're getting some decent results here I
07:04 - can continue to test this but I think
07:06 - for now this is probably going to be
07:07 - good next what I'm going to move on to
07:09 - doing is the API cuz I got to grab those
07:12 - YouTube comments so then we can feed it
07:14 - through the
07:17 - model so I'm happy to report that I've
07:19 - made pretty good progress here the next
07:21 - thing I wanted to do after getting that
07:23 - model trade was grab all of the YouTube
07:25 - comments from any given video and then
07:27 - feed them into the model so I just wrote
07:29 - a script here with the help of chat GPT
07:31 - that goes and grabs all of the public
07:33 - YouTube comments for a video given its
07:35 - ID that's working you can see if I go
07:38 - here I punched in one of my videos and
07:40 - we're getting all the different comments
07:41 - with all the Emojis and all this stuff
07:43 - so now what I got to do is take these
07:44 - comments pass them into the AI model and
07:47 - get some kind of output or report so the
07:49 - percentage positive percentage negative
07:51 - Etc then I got to aggregate those once I
07:54 - have that then we can go make a little
07:56 - API and a front end and we can hook this
07:58 - up so we get a bit of a graphical user
08:00 - interface for the
08:03 - project so I'm happy to report I got
08:06 - pretty much everything I was talking
08:07 - about working I set up a really simple
08:09 - flask API that just takes in a video ID
08:12 - on a get endpoint returns all of the
08:14 - comments on that video the one I chose
08:16 - had a bunch of comments and then it
08:18 - gives you actually the results for every
08:20 - single comment so positive negative Etc
08:22 - with the analysis of the sentiment then
08:24 - if we come down here and gives you a
08:25 - little summary and says this is the
08:27 - number of negative comments this is the
08:28 - number of positive comments total number
08:30 - of comments and then it gives an overall
08:32 - rating so it's saying about 69% of the
08:35 - comments were positive now I don't know
08:37 - if that's necessarily correct or not I
08:39 - would think that the amount of positive
08:41 - comments would be larger but I guess
08:43 - there's a bunch of comments where the
08:44 - sentiment is kind of unknown and it's
08:46 - probably leaning towards negative there
08:48 - there's probably some ways we can tweak
08:49 - the model and make it a little bit
08:51 - better but for now I'm happy with this
08:52 - so to quickly show you the code get out
08:55 - of OBS there you can see that I have one
08:57 - simple script here for my API that's
08:59 - simply calling to get all the video
09:01 - comments and then calls to get all the
09:02 - predictions counts number of positive
09:04 - and negative returns a summary and then
09:07 - simply returns a Json response now what
09:09 - we've got to do is hook this up with a
09:11 - front end once we have the front end
09:13 - we'll have a nice graphical user display
09:15 - and the project will pretty much be
09:19 - done all right a few minutes later and
09:21 - we've got the front end up and running I
09:23 - just made a simple input box here where
09:25 - you put in a YouTube url I then have the
09:28 - little summary here so pause POS
09:29 - negative number of comments overall
09:30 - rating should probably round that value
09:32 - but that's fine for now and then if we
09:34 - go through some of the comments here you
09:35 - can see this one for example you don't
09:37 - really do a good job at explaining
09:39 - negative okay makes sense someone didn't
09:40 - like the video continuing here thank you
09:42 - so much for the tutorial really
09:43 - appreciate it positive now I went
09:45 - through and there is a few mistakes like
09:47 - it's not perfect but when I was trading
09:48 - the model I was getting about 81%
09:50 - accuracy and it seems like that's about
09:52 - the accuracy I'm getting on it analyzing
09:55 - all of the comments regardless this is
09:57 - actually a useful project it's somewhat
09:58 - function working pretty well as far as I
10:01 - can tell and this would make a great
10:02 - resume project that I'd actually have
10:04 - quite a bit to talk about during the
10:05 - interview I can discuss how I adjusted
10:07 - the model how I collected the data how I
10:10 - cleaned the data how I connected
10:11 - everything with an API made a front end
10:13 - had a back end even though this isn't
10:15 - the most complicated project in the
10:16 - world there was a lot of different parts
10:18 - that went into it and that's kind of
10:19 - what makes a great project having a ton
10:22 - of different things and showcasing your
10:24 - skill and knowledge across multiple
10:25 - domains so with that said I'll start
10:27 - wrapping it up here will mention that
10:30 - there will be a link to the code in the
10:32 - description if you guys want to check it
10:33 - out and I will say that this was a nice
10:35 - change of pace and different video than
10:37 - what I normally do if you guys enjoy it
10:39 - please leave a comment and let me know
10:41 - and obviously this laptop I was using
10:43 - was actually quite Pleasant I was a
10:44 - little bit worried that I was going to
10:45 - be less efficient or I wasn't going to
10:47 - like it as much as working in my big
10:49 - kind of office desktop multim monitor
10:51 - display but since this is a really
10:53 - powerful laptop it felt pretty much the
10:55 - exact same as my big huge computer
10:57 - that's like doubled the price and since
10:59 - this has such a massive monitor 17in
11:02 - screen I actually found I had enough
11:04 - real estate and even though it would
11:05 - have been nice to have some extra
11:06 - monitors I didn't really think that I
11:08 - needed that I could definitely bring
11:10 - this with me on the go and be close to
11:12 - as productive as I could be in my huge
11:14 - office kind of desktop PC setup anyways
11:17 - I'll wrap it up here if you guys enjoyed
11:18 - make sure to leave a like subscribe to
11:20 - the channel and I will see you in the
11:22 - next

Cleaned transcript:

today my goal is to work on a machine learning project that would look really good on a resume I have no idea how this video is going to go but I want to give you a realistic look at what it's like to build a project completely from scratch what I go through the bugs I run into how I plan how I design how I come up with the architecture I just want this to be a more real video than some of the tutorials where I already have the code written and you guys know that I'm not really problem solving on the spot anyways I think this will be an interesting idea let me know what you guys think of it in the comments and let's dive in and build a machine learning project so first things first we need an idea now when I generate ideas I typically apply the following checklist first of all is this practical does it make sense is this something I'll actually use second is this challenging enough that I'm going to learn something and I might have some things to talk about in the interview but not challenging enough that I won't be able to complete it so I want to pick something in that intermediate difficulty where I know kind of how to complete the project but there might be a few things that I'll need to learn or pick up along the way which will give me something to talk about in the interview and then lastly I want to make something somewhat visual or at least very easy to use so if I wanted to link to a website or if I want to have just a simple app that someone can download there's not a ton of setup steps and people will actually be able to use this project relatively simply so with that in mind the project I'm deciding to do is a sentiment analysis project for my YouTube comments the idea is I want to have a little UI where you can pop in the URL of a YouTube video it will analyze all the comments and give you kind of a rating and say this video had 80% positive comments 20% negative or something along those lines so that's the project I'm going to try to build now let me show you how I'd plan that out all right so I don't want to bore you guys too much with architecture here but usually when I start a project I'll just do a quick kind of mind map or little diagram in my horrible handwriting just so I have a general sense of the steps or at least parts of the project that I need so you can see we have a front end here I just kind of Drew basically what I'm looking for I want to have you know a title enter some URL and then we're going to have some sentiment report where it's saying you know the percent negative positive neutral Etc that's going to connect to some kind of API the API is going to need to fetch the comments from the YouTube url run the model on those comments and then return and format the result back to the front end and then in terms of my model to create the model I'm going to need to find a data set to train the model on clean that data train the model with that data test it save it and then deploy and use it very very simple you can see we kind of have three parts model API front end I think for this project I'm going to use D Jango we'll see if that works in a second and for the model I'm probably going to go with something like tensorflow just because that's what I'm familiar with all right now let's start working on our model now to work on this AI model it's actually one of the few times that I need a pretty ridiculous computer in terms of specs now fortunately for this video video I teamed up with MSI and they sent me over their Raider g78 hx1 13v now this is a CS 2023 awardwinning laptop and is actually the most powerful laptop I've ever used it has a ridiculous Intel 13th gen I9 1390 HX processor that has 24 cores eight of which are power cores meaning they can utilize Intel's adaptive boost technology and get up to 5.6 GHz it also comes with an RT X 490 and 32 GB of RAM which means I can actually load and train these pretty massive machine learning models locally not to mention it's got a 240 HZ 17in 16 by10 QD display that is true cut technology it looks incredible and I can game on it while I'm taking a break from coding now you guys might not know this but one of the massive issues and concerns I typically have with these huge laptops is that there's not enough power to go to both the GPU and the CPU at the same time to run them at their full potential in parallel now this laptop actually mitigates that it has something called over boost technology which allows it to deliver 250 watts in parallel to both the CPU and the GPU so that it can boost up hit those turbo clocks and actually utilize the full potential of the hardware now that's a great feature but for any of you that won't be using the GPU all the time you can actually toggle the discrete graphics mode which allows you to optimize for your performance or battery life using the 9 9.9 wat battery that's charged by this ridiculous power brick that comes with this computer now of course this has Windows 11 full I/O HDMI 2.1 Thunderbolt 4 ethernet SD card reader audio jack really everything I feel like I would need for a mobile workstation which is how I'm going to be using this laptop going forward regardless if you're interested in this computer you can check it out from the link in the description now let's start training that AI model all right so I just got some boiler play code running here just to test my tensorflow installation and a really simple model I'm training this off the IMDb movie review set which is a really popular one that comes built into tensorflow now it's not going to

round that value but that's fine for now and then if we go through some of the comments here you can see this one for example you don't really do a good job at explaining negative okay makes sense someone didn't like the video continuing here thank you so much for the tutorial really appreciate it positive now I went through and there is a few mistakes like it's not perfect but when I was trading the model I was getting about 81% accuracy and it seems like that's about the accuracy I'm getting on it analyzing all of the comments regardless this is actually a useful project it's somewhat function working pretty well as far as I can tell and this would make a great resume project that I'd actually have quite a bit to talk about during the interview I can discuss how I adjusted the model how I collected the data how I cleaned the data how I connected everything with an API made a front end had a back end even though this isn't the most complicated project in the world there was a lot of different parts that went into it and that's kind of what makes a great project having a ton of different things and showcasing your skill and knowledge across multiple domains so with that said I'll start wrapping it up here will mention that there will be a link to the code in the description if you guys want to check it out and I will say that this was a nice change of pace and different video than what I normally do if you guys enjoy it please leave a comment and let me know and obviously this laptop I was using was actually quite Pleasant I was a little bit worried that I was going to be less efficient or I wasn't going to like it as much as working in my big kind of office desktop multim monitor display but since this is a really powerful laptop it felt pretty much the exact same as my big huge computer that's like doubled the price and since this has such a massive monitor 17in screen I actually found I had enough real estate and even though it would have been nice to have some extra monitors I didn't really think that I needed that I could definitely bring this with me on the go and be close to as productive as I could be in my huge office kind of desktop PC setup anyways I'll wrap it up here if you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next one
