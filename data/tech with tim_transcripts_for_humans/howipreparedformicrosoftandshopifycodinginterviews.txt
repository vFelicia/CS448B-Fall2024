00:00 - here's how I prepared for my technical
00:01 - interviews at both Microsoft and Shopify
00:03 - first of all I already knew about data
00:05 - structures and algorithms from my
00:07 - University course what I needed to learn
00:08 - was how to answer these algorithm style
00:10 - questions and how to do that properly so
00:13 - I started by using algo expert this is
00:15 - when I was not affiliated with the
00:16 - platform before I was paid by them or
00:18 - had any kind of courses and I did about
00:20 - 60 Questions on that platform the reason
00:22 - I used that was to get the explanations
00:24 - from the videos so I wanted to have
00:26 - someone walk me through each problem and
00:28 - actually understand why I was doing a
00:30 - specific solution once I did well with
00:31 - algo expert then I moved on to leak code
00:34 - where I much more quickly did about 50
00:35 - or 60 questions on the platform I was
00:38 - targeting mostly medium and hard
00:40 - problems after that I actually got a
00:41 - whiteboard I bought one and I put it in
00:43 - my room and then I started practicing a
00:45 - few of these questions about five or ten
00:47 - of them with the Whiteboard actually in
00:49 - my room where I would write everything
00:50 - out using the marker and actually
00:51 - simulate the real interview environment
00:53 - after doing this I was able to get job
00:55 - offers from both Microsoft and Shopify
00:57 - for an internship that was about three
00:59 - years ago
