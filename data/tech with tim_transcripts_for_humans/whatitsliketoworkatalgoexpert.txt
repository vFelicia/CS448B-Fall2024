00:56 - flexibility that i have and then finally
00:58 - what it's like to be in kind of a
00:59 - startup environment and a startup
01:01 - company
01:01 - algo expert is very small it has
01:04 - probably like six
01:05 - to eight employees something like that
01:07 - so very much a startup company now with
01:09 - that said if you don't know what algo
01:11 - expert is then don't worry because they
01:12 - are the sponsor of this video so you're
01:14 - about to hear all about them
01:16 - before we get started i need to thank
01:17 - the sponsor of this video which is
01:19 - alco expert oligoexpert is the best
01:22 - platform to use when preparing for your
01:23 - software engineering coding interviews
01:25 - as the highest quality coding interview
01:27 - practice questions
01:28 - with over 115 practice questions
01:31 - detailed solutions in nine of the most
01:33 - popular programming languages
01:35 - a feature-packed browser-based coding
01:37 - environment extensive test suites and
01:39 - conceptual overviews and code
01:41 - walkthroughs for each and every problem
01:43 - algo expert is the best resource to use
01:46 - to ace your coding interviews
01:47 - algo expert also has a data structures
01:50 - crash course coding interview
01:51 - assessments and a brand new
01:53 - mock interviews feature i can highly
01:55 - recommend algo expert as a former
01:57 - customer myself
01:58 - and now an official instructor on the
02:00 - platform get started using algo expert
02:02 - today by hitting the link in the
02:03 - description
02:04 - and using the code tech with tim for a
02:06 - discount on the platform
02:08 - all right so now that we all understand
02:09 - what i'll go expert is i can tell you
02:11 - what i do there so first of all my boss
02:14 - at algo expert the one that i report to
02:16 - is clement he is one of the co-founders
02:18 - you guys have probably seen him on this
02:20 - channel before and while i'll leave a
02:21 - link to his youtube channel in the
02:23 - description
02:23 - but we've known each other for a while i
02:25 - a little bit over a year now
02:27 - and if you actually want the story of
02:28 - how i got a job at algo expert i will
02:30 - leave a link to that video i made that
02:32 - probably four or five months ago
02:33 - when i just started working so anyways
02:35 - he's my boss and
02:37 - what i do on a day to day is i come up
02:39 - with coding interview questions
02:41 - so my you know formal job title is
02:43 - algorithms instructor
02:45 - and pretty much what that means is come
02:46 - up with coding interview practice
02:48 - questions
02:48 - write all of the detailed information
02:50 - related to that so the prompt the test
02:52 - cases the hints
02:53 - the space and time complexity and all
02:55 - the other stuff that's involved
02:56 - obviously write out the solutions for
02:58 - those questions i write all of those in
03:00 - python first
03:01 - and then i'll transcribe them into other
03:03 - programming languages that are on
03:05 - algo expert and then once that is done i
03:07 - will take all of that code that i've
03:08 - written i will push that up to the
03:10 - github repository that we will have
03:11 - it will get a review from clement or
03:14 - some of the other guys that work there
03:15 - and then once that is all good to go and
03:17 - i respond to any feedback i film
03:19 - a video so every single question on algo
03:21 - expert has a conceptual overview and
03:24 - a code walkthrough so kind of two
03:26 - separate parts the first part the
03:27 - conceptual overview is very much just
03:29 - kind of drawing and whiteboard style so
03:31 - i have this
03:32 - ipad here that i use to actually kind of
03:34 - do all the illustrations and diagrams
03:36 - and all of that
03:36 - and then i hop into my code editor and i
03:39 - do the code walkthrough
03:40 - so i spend a few hours filming that it
03:42 - actually takes a really long time to
03:44 - film these videos because they need to
03:45 - be absolutely perfect
03:47 - so even just small stutters or small
03:48 - mistakes that i make i have to kind of
03:50 - refilm that section and you know cut
03:52 - stuff out and edit the video
03:54 - once that is done though i you know edit
03:56 - the entire video and then i
03:58 - submit that to clement or to whoever is
04:00 - you know going to be looking at it at
04:01 - algo expert
04:02 - then they give me a review for the video
04:04 - they say yes this is good to go or no we
04:06 - need some feedback or we have some
04:07 - feedback and there's some revisions that
04:09 - we need
04:10 - then once all of that is done we get the
04:11 - video and the question ready to go into
04:14 - production and i'm not really involved
04:16 - in that side that's kind of in
04:17 - the main code base they do all that so i
04:19 - don't really know what's involved
04:20 - in getting the question in to production
04:23 - that is kind of what i do
04:24 - at algo experts so not terribly exciting
04:27 - but it is really cool to kind of be
04:29 - finding these different coding interview
04:30 - questions because i have to come up
04:32 - with the question that i'm actually
04:33 - going to do right i have to pick the
04:34 - questions myself
04:36 - and then you know figuring out how to
04:37 - solve them all of the neat tricks you
04:39 - know doing some research on my own
04:40 - and this is kind of great because this
04:42 - means if i ever did want to go work at a
04:44 - big tech company or something like that
04:46 - i would have a ton of experience because
04:48 - i have literally been creating
04:50 - practice questions for coding interviews
04:52 - so that is kind of my day-to-day
04:54 - now i'm going to jump over and kind of
04:56 - talk about my hours and flexibility and
04:58 - when i'm actually working for algo
05:00 - expert because as you guys
05:01 - know i have this youtube channel here
05:03 - this takes a ton of time
05:05 - while i'm doing that as well as working
05:07 - for algo expert
05:08 - all right so let me kind of talk about
05:09 - my hours and the flexibility and when
05:11 - i'm actually doing work for algo expert
05:13 - because it's definitely not like your
05:15 - standard job this is not a nine to five
05:17 - i don't have to like clock in or clock
05:18 - out
05:19 - there's nothing like that going on i can
05:21 - work literally whenever i want and one
05:23 - of the reasons i actually took this job
05:25 - is because it is so extremely flexible
05:27 - there is very few deadlines and
05:29 - the deadlines that do exist are
05:31 - extremely lenient and
05:32 - well i can just work whenever i want so
05:34 - if i'm really busy
05:36 - on youtube for a week i can do nothing
05:37 - for algox but i don't even have to look
05:39 - at the slack
05:40 - group chat that we have there so we do
05:42 - have a slack chat where everyone kind of
05:43 - communicates
05:44 - i don't even have to look at that i
05:45 - don't have to answer messages that's
05:46 - totally fine i just do
05:48 - whatever i want whenever i want so that
05:50 - is the reason why i'm actually working
05:51 - for algo expert because it's super
05:53 - flexible
05:54 - and oftentimes i'm working on algo
05:56 - expert questions at say 9 p.m
05:58 - 10 p.m one in the morning i just do them
06:00 - whenever i feel like
06:01 - doing a question so that is kind of the
06:04 - great thing about this job and another
06:06 - thing to note is that every single
06:07 - person that works for algo expert is
06:09 - working remotely so they don't have an
06:10 - office
06:11 - we just have this slack group chat which
06:13 - in my opinion kind of acts as the office
06:15 - there's all these channels and stuff
06:16 - that we talk in
06:17 - and there's people in all different
06:18 - types of time zones so i'm in eastern
06:20 - standard time
06:21 - i believe clements in mountain standard
06:23 - time there's some people in other
06:26 - states in the us and we're kind of all
06:28 - over the place so
06:29 - it's neat it's very interesting having
06:31 - everyone work remotely
06:32 - and algo expert is a very small team
06:34 - right so there's only like probably six
06:36 - seven maybe eight employees i don't know
06:38 - the entire structure but the people i've
06:40 - talked to at least there's like seven
06:41 - or eight of them and so to wrap up this
06:43 - section on kind of the hours and the
06:45 - flexibility
06:46 - i'll just say that this works absolutely
06:48 - perfect for me um
06:49 - you know sometimes i don't go to bed
06:50 - till three in the morning i don't wake
06:52 - up till noon or 1 p.m or whatever
06:54 - and it's great to just be able to do
06:56 - whatever i want whenever i want to do it
06:58 - now obviously you guys know i'm working
07:00 - very hard i'm doing a lot of stuff but
07:01 - it's nice to have that flexibility where
07:03 - if i want to just grind algo expert
07:05 - questions on you know saturday and
07:06 - sunday
07:07 - and then i want to you know go do my
07:08 - youtube channel for the rest of the week
07:10 - i can totally do that
07:11 - and the algo expert team is really funny
07:13 - because everyone is pretty much a night
07:15 - owl now i
07:16 - didn't really used to be a night owl
07:17 - before i started working there but
07:19 - literally everyone is online at least in
07:21 - eastern standard time from the hours of
07:23 - like
07:23 - let's say 8 p.m to like four in the
07:25 - morning so it's just
07:26 - really a unique working environment and
07:29 - it's not something that you would ever
07:30 - have working for you know like
07:32 - a big corporation or not kind of a
07:34 - startup company so this kind of leads me
07:36 - nicely into what it's like to work for a
07:38 - startup company
07:39 - so if you guys have been following me
07:40 - for a while then you would know that the
07:41 - first
07:42 - big tech company that i worked at the
07:44 - first job i had that was related to
07:46 - programming and software engineering
07:48 - was at microsoft now i think that
07:50 - company has like a hundred and twenty
07:51 - thousand employees or 140 000 employees
07:54 - or something crazy like that
07:55 - so obviously a massive company and in
07:58 - that company i have no idea what i don't
08:00 - even know you know the senior management
08:02 - team i'm talking to like
08:03 - the 10th level of manager down you know
08:06 - the hierarchy of things
08:07 - so it's just a very different
08:09 - environment because here i'm talking to
08:11 - you know the founders of the company
08:12 - which
08:13 - i'm not trying to make that sound super
08:14 - special it's just interesting because
08:16 - you get a really good look at what's
08:18 - actually going on you can see all the
08:19 - new features that are being released you
08:21 - kind of see the direction that the
08:22 - company is moving in
08:23 - and it just makes you feel so much more
08:25 - immersed and kind of engaged in what
08:27 - you're doing
08:28 - it's way more exciting for me personally
08:30 - to be working for a company like algo
08:31 - expert
08:32 - where the work that i'm doing is
08:33 - genuinely changing the product shaping
08:35 - what it looks like and changing maybe
08:37 - even the future of the company
08:39 - whereas when i'm working at a company
08:40 - like microsoft you know i'm just another
08:42 - guy in the corporate office
08:44 - and very disposable you know i could be
08:45 - gone tomorrow and no one would even know
08:47 - so it's just a very different
08:48 - environment it's just really engaging
08:51 - and really exciting and
08:52 - at least for this company here everyone
08:54 - that's working here is just young
08:55 - energetic like they're all under 30 i'm
08:58 - pretty sure and it's just cool to be
08:59 - around a lot of people that are in a
09:00 - very similar field to me
09:02 - clement is a youtuber nick is a youtuber
09:04 - and so i have a lot of similarities and
09:06 - stuff in common with them and it's just
09:08 - fun you know at one in the morning you
09:09 - know you're grinding out now go expert
09:11 - question and making jokes in the slack
09:12 - channel
09:13 - and just all kind of stuff like that so
09:15 - that is kind of my experience working
09:17 - for
09:17 - algo expert in this startup company i
09:19 - wish there was more that i could say but
09:21 - i just wanted to kind of express
09:23 - how different it is to work for a
09:24 - company that's fairly new that doesn't
09:26 - have very many employees and that's
09:27 - moving extremely quickly
09:29 - compared to a very bureaucratic you know
09:31 - large organization now there's pros and
09:33 - cons from both obviously
09:34 - but right now i can honestly say that i
09:36 - am definitely enjoying working at algo
09:38 - expert
09:39 - honestly a lot of the time it doesn't
09:40 - even really feel like work what i'm
09:42 - doing because i genuinely do enjoy you
09:44 - know teaching and writing out these
09:45 - algorithmic style questions
09:47 - and for me i'm learning a ton and i'm
09:48 - getting way better myself at doing these
09:50 - types of coding interviews because while
09:52 - i'm teaching them almost every single
09:54 - day
09:54 - so anyways that was the video for today
09:57 - i hope you guys enjoyed if you have any
09:58 - questions about algo expert please do
10:01 - leave them in the comments i will try to
10:02 - respond
10:03 - with that said if you enjoyed make sure
10:04 - to leave a like subscribe to the channel
10:06 - and i will see you in another
10:08 - youtube video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to talk to you about what it is like to work at algo expert now for any of you that are not aware i currently work at algo expert as an algorithms instructor algo expert is a platform that you can use to prepare for your software engineering coding interviews and well the founder of that platform one of the cofounders is actually one of my close friends and his name is clement so i've been working at algo expert for about four or five months maybe and i just wanted to make this video to talk to you about what it's like to work in this kind of startup environment and for this company that i'm sure many of you know now with that said if you guys know me and you watch this channel you know that i like to have very structured videos so in this video specifically i'm going to talk about the work that i do at algo expert kind of the hours and the flexibility that i have and then finally what it's like to be in kind of a startup environment and a startup company algo expert is very small it has probably like six to eight employees something like that so very much a startup company now with that said if

walkthroughs for each and every problem algo expert is the best resource to use to ace your coding interviews algo expert also has a data structures crash course coding interview assessments and a brand new mock interviews feature i can highly recommend algo expert as a former customer myself and now an official instructor on the platform get started using algo expert today by hitting the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform all right so now that we all understand what i'll go expert is i can tell you what i do there so first of all my boss at algo expert the one that i report to is clement he is one of the cofounders you guys have probably seen him on this channel before and while i'll leave a link to his youtube channel in the description but we've known each other for a while i a little bit over a year now and if you actually want the story of how i got a job at algo expert i will leave a link to that video i made that probably four or five months ago when i just started working so anyways he's my boss and what i do on a day to day is i come up with coding interview questions so my you know formal job title is algorithms instructor and pretty much what that means is come up with coding interview practice questions write all of the detailed information related to that so the prompt the test cases the hints the space and time complexity and all the other stuff that's involved obviously write out the solutions for those questions i write all of those in python first and then i'll transcribe them into other programming languages that are on algo expert and then once that is done i will take all of that code that i've written i will push that up to the github repository that we will have it will get a review from clement or some of the other guys that work there and then once that is all good to go and i respond to any feedback i film a video so every single question on algo expert has a conceptual overview and a code walkthrough so kind of two separate parts the first part the conceptual overview is very much just kind of drawing and whiteboard style so i have this ipad here that i use to actually kind of do all the illustrations and diagrams and all of that and then i hop into my code editor and i do the code walkthrough so i spend a few hours filming that it actually takes a really long time to film these videos because they need to be absolutely perfect so even just small stutters or small mistakes that i make i have to kind of refilm that section and you know cut stuff

a review for the video they say yes this is good to go or no we need some feedback or we have some feedback and there's some revisions that we need then once all of that is done we get the video and the question ready to go into production and i'm not really involved in that side that's kind of in the main code base they do all that so i don't really know what's involved in getting the question

just young energetic like they're all under 30 i'm pretty sure and it's just cool to be around a lot of people that are in a very similar field to me clement is a youtuber nick is a youtuber and so i have a lot of similarities and stuff in common with them and it's just fun you know at one in the morning you know you're grinding out now go expert question and making jokes in the slack channel and just all kind of stuff like that so that is kind of my experience working for algo expert in this startup company i wish there was more that i could say but i just wanted to kind of express how different it is to work for a company that's fairly new that doesn't have very many employees and that's moving extremely quickly compared to a very bureaucratic you know large organization now there's pros and cons from both obviously but right now i can honestly say that i am definitely enjoying working at algo expert honestly a lot of the time it doesn't even really feel like work what i'm doing because i genuinely do enjoy you know teaching and writing out these algorithmic style questions and for me i'm learning a ton and i'm getting way better myself at doing these types of coding interviews because while i'm teaching them almost every single day so anyways that was the video for today i hope you guys enjoyed if you have any questions about algo expert please do leave them in the comments i will try to respond with that said if you enjoyed make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another youtube video
