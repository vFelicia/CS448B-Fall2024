00:16 - a few months ago I made a video when
00:18 - chat GPT first came out and was
00:20 - available to the public and I kind of
00:22 - shared my opinions on it and that video
00:24 - was pretty misinformed I didn't know
00:26 - much about the tool I didn't have a lot
00:27 - of experience using it and I didn't make
00:29 - very strong arguments in that video
00:31 - about why it might replace programmers
00:33 - why you shouldn't be worried Etc so now
00:36 - a few months later I have a lot more
00:37 - experience using this I've used it in a
00:39 - lot of different contexts for example
00:41 - some of my videos have been scripted by
00:42 - chatgpt a lot of my shorts it's helping
00:45 - helped give me kind of ideas for those
00:47 - and even from a programming standpoint
00:49 - I've been handing off and kind of
00:51 - delegating a lot of smaller tasks to
00:53 - chat GPT so in this video I want to
00:55 - share with you my new kind of formed
00:56 - opinion on this where I see it going in
00:59 - the next few months and years and how
01:01 - I'm using it as a programmer to be more
01:03 - efficient so first let me share with you
01:05 - how I use Chad gbt now I will admit this
01:08 - is not a massive part of my workflow a
01:10 - lot of what I'm doing as more of a
01:11 - senior programmer right now is writing
01:13 - or architecting code myself however I do
01:16 - treat chat gbt kind of like a low paid
01:19 - intern where I'm handing it off kind of
01:21 - smaller tasks discrete things things
01:24 - that I can describe relatively fast and
01:26 - that would be faster for me to describe
01:28 - to the AI than to write from scratch by
01:30 - myself now a lot of you might relate to
01:32 - this problem where you're working in
01:34 - some kind of engineering team and if
01:35 - you're in any kind of management role or
01:37 - you're kind of leading other developers
01:38 - oftentimes it's actually faster for you
01:41 - just to write the code and kind of fix a
01:43 - problem than it is to try to describe
01:45 - what needs to be done to someone else so
01:48 - in the situation in which it's very easy
01:49 - for me to describe something I'll go to
01:51 - chat gbt describe that and then have it
01:53 - spit out that code for example I'll
01:56 - write some code maybe like an API
01:57 - endpoint and then I'll paste that into
01:59 - chat GPT and say hey can you write a
02:01 - unit test for this or can you make sure
02:03 - this code doesn't have any bugs I'll
02:05 - treat it as kind of like an auditor for
02:07 - some of my code and I'll get it to do
02:09 - monotonous and just repetitive tasks
02:13 - that would just cost me a lot of
02:14 - keystrokes but not a lot of like comp
02:16 - mutational effort in terms of me
02:18 - thinking about what the actual task
02:19 - needs to do so testing is a big thing
02:21 - that I ask it to do I'll give it kind of
02:23 - the objective of what this code should
02:25 - do I'll ask it to write the test for the
02:27 - code and then to ensure that the code
02:29 - kind of adheres to those tests and then
02:31 - I also get it to do things like writing
02:33 - small functions so for example if I need
02:35 - a function that's reversing a string I
02:37 - know that's very straightforward but I
02:39 - might ask chatgpt to do that I might
02:41 - also get it to refactor some code so
02:43 - maybe I write some really messy
02:44 - spaghetti code as long as it's not super
02:46 - long and I'll say hey can you clean this
02:48 - up for me rewrite it and usually it
02:49 - gives me a pretty decent solution now in
02:52 - my experience using this chat GPT is
02:54 - pretty good at doing code generation
02:56 - especially in the popular programming
02:58 - languages like JavaScript python Etc
02:59 - which are mostly the ones that I'm using
03:01 - however it does have quite a few
03:04 - mistakes a lot of times it will
03:05 - incorrectly write a test sometimes its
03:08 - code has actual syntax errors in it and
03:10 - I need to tell it to correct its mistake
03:12 - the interesting thing here is that when
03:14 - I tell it that it made a mistake even if
03:16 - I don't point out where that mistake is
03:18 - it actually is pretty good at going in
03:20 - and correcting it so that's pretty
03:22 - powerful the fact that it can actually
03:24 - reason based on what I'm telling it and
03:26 - say oh I need to review this code and
03:28 - fix a specific mistake here there's also
03:30 - times where it uses like a very obscure
03:32 - feature or something that I don't want
03:34 - to be in the code base so I'll tell it
03:35 - hey do this but write it in a different
03:37 - way same in terms of efficiency so
03:40 - that's kind of how I'm treating chat GPT
03:41 - really like a low paid intern where I'm
03:43 - handing off and delegating these
03:45 - different tasks and I would use it more
03:47 - if I felt that it would be faster for me
03:49 - to describe the tasks to the AI rather
03:51 - than just to solve them myself now when
03:53 - it comes to kind of architectural
03:54 - decisions and larger type decisions here
03:57 - I'm still handling that on my own I
03:59 - might ask for tips or advice from
04:01 - chatgpt but at the end of the day I'm
04:03 - kind of the one that needs to make the
04:05 - decision having the full context of the
04:07 - project so here's where we'll talk about
04:09 - where chat gbt is kind of lacking and
04:12 - why we still do need programmers in the
04:14 - world
04:18 - now I think that's obvious but the
04:20 - reality is if you're working on a large
04:22 - application that has hundreds maybe even
04:24 - thousands of files all kinds of
04:26 - different systems different Integrations
04:28 - deployments all of this stuff going on
04:30 - chat gbt at the current point in time is
04:32 - not capable of ingesting all of that
04:34 - data building context around the project
04:37 - and then putting something into practice
04:39 - right like actually building an endpoint
04:41 - or building whatever it may be you need
04:43 - to give it very specific instructions
04:45 - just like you would give like a more low
04:47 - level employee that doesn't fully
04:48 - understand the system so in my situation
04:51 - I can't rely on chat gbt to write a
04:53 - majority of the code for the code base
04:55 - because I would have to give it so much
04:57 - information for it to be able to do that
04:59 - and at that point it's just faster for
05:00 - me to write it myself however where I
05:03 - think things are going and from what
05:04 - I've heard in kind of rumors of soon
05:06 - chat gbt will actually have plugins this
05:09 - means you can connect it to like Google
05:11 - Sheets Google Docs eventually probably
05:13 - GitHub maybe even your IDE or your
05:16 - development kind of environment that you
05:18 - have set up if that actually happens
05:20 - that could be a massive game changer for
05:23 - how good the code generation could be
05:25 - from chat GPT if this can hook into my
05:28 - GitHub repo read the entire GitHub repo
05:30 - and then give me suggestions on how I
05:32 - could clean up my code refactor it
05:34 - different ways to write things even
05:36 - start producing individual files
05:38 - directories systems that will be an
05:41 - absolute Game Changer and I think that
05:43 - we're going in that direction and that's
05:44 - kind of why I'm making this video
05:46 - because previously when I looked at chat
05:47 - GPT I said okay this is cool but really
05:49 - it's only capable of acting as again
05:51 - like a low paid intern where it's doing
05:53 - very discreet tasks that need to be
05:55 - described in extreme detail if we get to
05:57 - the point where it can ingest this
05:59 - massive amount of data and it can view
06:01 - the entire code base and actually kind
06:03 - of Reason about that and build context
06:05 - about the systems then that's going to
06:07 - change things drastically at least
06:09 - that's what I feel and from what I've
06:10 - heard that's the way that we're going
06:12 - soon there'll be all these plugins
06:14 - directly in chatgpt and I don't know how
06:16 - how powerful or how good they're going
06:17 - to be immediately but I know they'll get
06:19 - to a point where Chad gbt can go to
06:21 - GitHub read your GitHub issues and start
06:24 - submitting pull requests that are fixing
06:25 - those issues for you if we get to that
06:28 - point that does seriously put quite a
06:30 - few programmers in danger so with that
06:32 - said what does that mean for people that
06:34 - are more Junior maybe just getting
06:35 - started and trying to land a programming
06:37 - job right now well from what I've seen
06:39 - there hasn't been a huge Wipeout of
06:41 - programming jobs obviously that's
06:43 - different than you know all the Google
06:44 - layoffs Facebook all of that I don't
06:46 - think that's really related to AI
06:48 - regardless in kind of the General market
06:51 - not this huge Tech Market I haven't seen
06:53 - like a massive decrease in programming
06:56 - listings in fact programmers are still
06:58 - pretty high in demand and I think that's
07:00 - because a lot of companies realize that
07:02 - even though these AI tools exist they
07:04 - still need programmers to use these
07:06 - tools like your average Layman person
07:08 - can't really go in and accurately use
07:10 - these tools and even follow the
07:12 - instructions that are being provided by
07:13 - it and they want to train employees that
07:16 - have eventually the more junior level
07:17 - guys can move up to be senior
07:20 - programmers right eventually we're going
07:21 - to run out of senior programmers people
07:23 - are going to leave companies and there
07:24 - needs to be some kind of investment in
07:26 - training for people that are at a lower
07:27 - level so they can eventually be a more
07:30 - senior developer so to wrap up this
07:31 - video just say that as I've used this
07:33 - tool more and more really my opinion has
07:35 - become that this is not necessarily
07:37 - going to wipe out programmers or replace
07:39 - software developers it's more going to
07:41 - change the way in which people work
07:42 - right it's going to change how your
07:45 - average developer goes about
07:46 - contributing to a code base it's
07:48 - possible that you have chat GPT that's
07:50 - now reviewing your code on a GitHub repo
07:52 - that could very well be happening in the
07:54 - next few months I just know that things
07:56 - are happening very very quickly
07:58 - obviously there's a ton of investment in
07:59 - open Ai and just in AI Tools in general
08:02 - and this is kind of the next big push
08:04 - when it comes to technology so I'm
08:06 - trying to watch it fairly carefully
08:07 - anyways I think if you're a programmer
08:09 - if you're just getting started you don't
08:10 - need to freak out and panic a ton it's
08:12 - definitely worth having it on your radar
08:14 - and considering how you can utilize
08:15 - these tools I think these tools can also
08:18 - allow you to learn programming a lot
08:20 - faster and to hopefully kind of reduce
08:22 - that skill gap between yourself and
08:24 - someone who's maybe been programming for
08:26 - a long time I think really the main
08:28 - point is that we're all going to have to
08:29 - adapt to this it's going to change the
08:30 - way in which we write code and produce
08:32 - software and even though we might not
08:34 - like it it's just the reality of what's
08:35 - happening and that's kind of what I
08:37 - wanted to State here anyways if you guys
08:39 - enjoyed this video make sure to leave a
08:40 - like subscribe the channel and I will
08:42 - see you in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

foreign a few months ago I made a video when chat GPT first came out and was available to the public and I kind of shared my opinions on it and that video was pretty misinformed I didn't know much about the tool I didn't have a lot of experience using it and I didn't make very strong arguments in that video about why it might replace programmers why you shouldn't be worried Etc so now a few months later I have a lot more experience using this I've used it in a lot of different contexts for example some of my videos have been scripted by chatgpt a lot of my shorts it's helping helped give me kind of ideas for those and even from a programming standpoint I've been handing off and kind of delegating a lot of smaller tasks to chat GPT so in this video I want to share with you my new kind of formed opinion on this where I see it going in the next few months and years and how I'm using it as a programmer to be more efficient so first let me share with you how I use Chad gbt now I will
