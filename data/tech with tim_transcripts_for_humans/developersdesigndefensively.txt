00:00 - the last design principle on my list is
00:02 - to design defensively now what this
00:05 - means is to idiot proof your code that's
00:07 - really the best way that I can explain
00:08 - this you have to imagine that anyone
00:11 - using your code using your framework is
00:13 - an absolute idiot what that means is you
00:15 - have to make sure you have good error
00:16 - messages or you're handling anything
00:18 - that could go wrong from the user
00:19 - calling or using your code or your
00:21 - function design it in a way such that it
00:24 - doesn't matter who uses this code it
00:26 - will not break it is robust it is
00:28 - defensive and it is giving the user
00:30 - valid error messages and trying to help
00:33 - them be able to use this framework
