00:02 - that's being transmitted across the

00:06 - some information from one computer to
00:08 - another you're going to use the internet
00:10 - to do this right you're going to use
00:11 - some type of network to do this whether
00:12 - it's your local network or it's actually
00:14 - the internet point being is that you
00:16 - can't usually send all the information
00:18 - you want in just one piece of data for
00:20 - example say I want to send you an entire
00:22 - video game okay I can't just send you
00:24 - that whole video game as like one little
00:26 - package I need to split it into packets
00:29 - those packets all get sent to you and
00:31 - then once you receive all the packets
00:33 - you can reconstruct them into what the
00:35 - original data was
