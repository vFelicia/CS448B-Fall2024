00:00 - in this video i'll show you how to read
00:01 - from a file in python the first thing we
00:03 - need to do is open the file i'm going to
00:04 - say file equals open my file is called
00:06 - file.txt so i put that right there and
00:08 - then i put r as the mode that i want to
00:09 - open this file in that stands for read
00:11 - now if your file is not in the same
00:13 - directory as your python file then you
00:14 - need to put in the absolute path to this
00:16 - file so c colon slash etc whatever the
00:20 - path is to it if it's in the same
00:21 - directory you can just put the name of
00:22 - the file now to actually read from the
00:24 - file what you do is the following print
00:26 - and then file dot read lines like that
00:28 - read lines will give you a list
00:29 - containing all of the lines in the file
00:31 - once you're done with the file you need
00:32 - to make sure you close it so file.close
00:34 - when i run this notice we get all of the
00:36 - lines inside of the file we just read
00:38 - the file another way to do this is
00:39 - simply with read if you use dot read
00:41 - notice you're going to get a string that
00:42 - contains all of the text in the file but
00:44 - not based on its lines finally a quick
00:46 - way that you can do this as well that
00:48 - avoids you having to close it say with
00:50 - open file as file like that then you can
00:52 - read the file inside of here now you no
00:54 - longer need to close it let's run the
00:55 - code notice everything works hopefully
00:57 - you found this helpful if you did follow
00:59 - for more
