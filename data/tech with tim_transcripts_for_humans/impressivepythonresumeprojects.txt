00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - in this video i'll share with you some
00:10 - impressive python projects that look
00:12 - great on a resume and that really
00:14 - showcase your ability as a programmer
00:16 - and your skill with python these
00:18 - projects will be in different categories
00:20 - like web development machine learning
00:22 - artificial intelligence data analysis
00:24 - and all the other things that python is
00:26 - really good at so with that said let's
00:28 - dive into the video so i'm going to
00:30 - start listing a ton of different
00:31 - projects but i do want to mention that
00:33 - you need to have a really strong
00:34 - foundation in programming and in python
00:37 - before you can start working on anything
00:39 - this complicated now if you don't
00:40 - already have that you can check out my
00:42 - course programming expert dot io this is
00:44 - designed to make you a software engineer
00:46 - as quickly as possible and has all of
00:48 - the stuff you need to get really good at
00:50 - python and just programming in general
00:52 - so it has object oriented programming
00:55 - advanced programming software design
00:56 - software engineering tools five
00:58 - completely guided programming projects
01:00 - that you can work on as well as over 250
01:03 - coding questions and assessments for
01:05 - each section so that you actually know
01:07 - that you understand all of the content
01:09 - that you're learning from over the 100
01:11 - videos anyways you guys can check it out
01:13 - from the link in the description and use
01:15 - code tim for a discount with that said
01:17 - though let's start getting into these
01:18 - resume projects now the first kind of
01:21 - category of projects i have here is
01:23 - artificial intelligence now in my
01:25 - opinion these are the most fun to work
01:27 - on and they also stand out a lot on a
01:28 - resume because even though they might
01:30 - not take a ton of time they're just
01:32 - really cool they sound impressive and
01:34 - that's kind of what you're going for
01:35 - with these type of projects so the first
01:37 - idea i have here is to make an
01:39 - artificial intelligence that can play a
01:41 - game so you can start with something
01:43 - really simple like pong make a neural
01:45 - network that can play the game of pop
01:47 - not the easiest thing in the world but
01:48 - definitely doable and you could 100 put
01:50 - that on a resume especially for a more
01:52 - junior position you can make an ai that
01:54 - plays tetris that automatically rotates
01:56 - the shapes and moves it in the correct
01:58 - direction maybe you have ais play
02:00 - against each other in the game of tetris
02:02 - there's a ton of stuff you can do next
02:04 - you can make an ai that plays flappy
02:05 - bird i actually have an entire tutorial
02:07 - series on this channel that shows you
02:09 - how to do that if you're looking for
02:10 - some concrete steps here on how you
02:12 - would accomplish something like this you
02:14 - can use a module in python called me now
02:16 - neats is a neural evolution of augmented
02:18 - topologies this is a really cool
02:20 - algorithm that actually takes a bunch of
02:22 - neural networks runs them all through
02:24 - your game and then takes the best of
02:26 - those neural networks and breeds them
02:28 - together and then continues this for
02:30 - generations until you eventually get a
02:32 - neural network that can say beat the
02:34 - game or is really good at completing it
02:36 - now of course there's a ton of other
02:37 - stuff that you can do with ai you can
02:39 - make an ai chat bot you can make an ai
02:41 - that trades stocks for you you do all
02:43 - kinds of stuff but i really like the
02:45 - game idea because you can actually build
02:47 - the game yourself in something like pie
02:49 - game and then design an ai in whatever
02:51 - way you like to actually play the game
02:53 - for you so moving on now to the web
02:55 - development section now i will note that
02:57 - there is an unlimited number of websites
02:59 - that you can make python is very
03:01 - flexible when it comes to web
03:02 - development but i'm gonna recommend here
03:04 - that you make something like a social
03:06 - media clone so something like instagram
03:08 - twitter facebook youtube maybe you get
03:11 - creative and do something like codegram
03:13 - where people post code instead of
03:14 - posting regular photos whatever you can
03:16 - get as creative as you want and of
03:18 - course you're going to build a slimmed
03:19 - down version you're not going to build a
03:21 - full instagram app or a full twitter
03:23 - you're going to build kind of the core
03:24 - features where users can sign in and
03:27 - sign up they can post something maybe
03:29 - they can search for different users and
03:31 - look at a profile they can like and they
03:32 - can comment that alone is a ton of
03:34 - different features and even if you just
03:36 - build a really bare bones version it's
03:38 - pretty impressive now the reason it's
03:40 - impressive is because if you're making
03:41 - something like this you need to make not
03:43 - only a front end buddy back end as well
03:45 - now personally for me when i build front
03:47 - ends for these websites i go really
03:49 - really simple i just use something like
03:51 - bootstrap which is a css framework i'll
03:53 - do plain javascript and html you don't
03:56 - need to get into anything too
03:57 - complicated like react unless you
03:59 - already know that but the core here is
04:01 - going to be the back end and how you're
04:03 - handling data story security and then
04:05 - the database integration that you have
04:08 - so that's why it's a good resume project
04:09 - because there's a lot of stuff going on
04:11 - there's a lot of different components
04:12 - that need to be connected together and
04:14 - there's a lot that you can learn when
04:16 - you're making this and that you can talk
04:17 - about in an interview about this project
04:20 - so again in terms of some concrete
04:21 - recommendations here if you're building
04:23 - a website you're going to use flask or
04:25 - django or you're going to build a
04:27 - separate front end and a separate back
04:29 - end and you're going to have an api on
04:31 - the back end using something like fast
04:33 - api or uh django rest framework or flask
04:36 - rest right there's all different kinds
04:38 - of stuff that you can do here i'm
04:40 - assuming if you guys are at this level
04:41 - in terms of building projects you
04:43 - already know what i'm talking about
04:44 - you're gonna have some type of back end
04:46 - some type of front end some type of
04:48 - database to store this information
04:49 - you're gonna have to learn a lot to make
04:51 - this and it's gonna look really good on
04:52 - a resume all right so continuing i have
04:54 - another web development-ish idea and
04:57 - this is to build a live chat application
05:00 - so something like telegram something
05:01 - like facebook messenger something like
05:04 - whatsapp where you have the ability to
05:06 - maybe add a contact or add a user and
05:08 - then you can chat with them in a chat
05:10 - room of some sort using sockets now
05:13 - sockets is kind of a live messaging
05:15 - system it's an ability for you to
05:17 - actually send information through the
05:18 - web without having to say upload it to a
05:20 - database and then pull the information
05:22 - from the database it's a really quick
05:24 - way to transmit messages specifically or
05:26 - different commands or kind of events
05:28 - that have occurred so this is definitely
05:30 - a really impressive thing to put on a
05:31 - resume especially if you implement a
05:33 - smooth and polished chat application
05:36 - this is actually something that i did to
05:37 - get a job at shopify now i didn't end up
05:40 - working at shopify but the project i
05:42 - submitted to them and that i kind of
05:43 - walked them through was a live chat
05:45 - application where i implemented it with
05:47 - sockets and then i built the user
05:49 - interface of this using uh what do you
05:51 - call it html css and javascript just a
05:54 - plain you know html website with a
05:57 - really simple ui but the whole core of
05:59 - the project was the fact that users
06:01 - could communicate in live time with very
06:03 - little delay it's like when you go on
06:05 - your messenger on your iphone or on your
06:07 - android and you see the little three
06:08 - dots pop up the reason they can do that
06:10 - is using something similar to sockets
06:12 - where in live time you're actually
06:14 - communicating with each other again
06:16 - you're not adding stuff to a database
06:17 - pulling it from the database and doing
06:19 - stuff in a really slow and sluggish way
06:21 - so i think this is a cool project i'll
06:23 - leave you guys to come up with more
06:25 - details related to that but if you want
06:26 - some concrete steps here on how you
06:28 - would do this you can use regular python
06:30 - sockets or you can use flask sockets
06:33 - which is kind of like a plug-in for
06:34 - flask or django sockets i believe they
06:37 - have a specific kind of plug-in or
06:39 - framework uh with django if you're going
06:41 - to be building this on the web now you
06:42 - don't have to build this on the web you
06:44 - could build an interface in pygame you
06:46 - could build an interface in kivy or in
06:48 - pi qt5 there's a ton of different kind
06:50 - of user interface libraries or modules
06:52 - in python pick whatever you want but
06:54 - you're going to need some way for users
06:56 - to type something in and then to see
06:57 - kind of the message log and maybe
06:59 - communicate with different people all
07:00 - right so now we're moving on to some
07:02 - data science and data analysis projects
07:04 - now this is a very popular application
07:07 - of python and really i think any project
07:09 - is good here so long as you're pulling a
07:12 - large piece of data and actually drawing
07:14 - some meaningful conclusions from it so
07:16 - as long as your project is actually
07:17 - doing something useful it's not just
07:19 - displaying data then i think you're
07:21 - going to have a good project now to give
07:23 - you a few ideas of what i'm thinking
07:25 - maybe you pull a million tweets and you
07:27 - look at all those tweets and you analyze
07:29 - the sentiment of them so you see if the
07:31 - tweets are happy or sad in terms of the
07:34 - general mood and then maybe you graph
07:36 - that against the time when twitter users
07:38 - are tweeting and you try to figure out
07:39 - what time of day twitter users are the
07:41 - happiest right that's a project i could
07:43 - think of of course you could do
07:44 - something with coronavirus data i think
07:46 - that's not very original especially
07:48 - because so many people have done that
07:49 - now but that's a good you know classic
07:52 - example of data analysis you could do
07:54 - something like graph your own data maybe
07:56 - you graph your spending habits and try
07:58 - to figure out the days you spend the
07:59 - most money what you spend the most money
08:01 - on maybe events that cause you to spend
08:04 - all of that type of stuff there's lots
08:06 - of information that you can pull and
08:07 - again so long as you're doing something
08:09 - that's actually useful i think you're
08:10 - going to have a good project so stay
08:12 - away from anything where you're just you
08:14 - know graphing data or kind of displaying
08:16 - stuff that you've pulled you want to be
08:18 - analyzing the data and actually pulling
08:19 - out some type of meaningful conclusion
08:21 - and there's all kinds of python modules
08:23 - that help you do this
08:24 - for example you could be using something
08:25 - like pandas you could be using something
08:27 - like numpy like matplotlib if you did
08:29 - want to visualize maybe the conclusions
08:31 - that you drew there's all kinds of
08:33 - artificial intelligence packages you
08:35 - have natural language processing like
08:37 - the nlp module you could import
08:39 - something like scikit-learn you could
08:41 - import and use tensorflow if you want to
08:43 - make a basic machine learning model i'm
08:45 - just rattling off random ideas at this
08:47 - point i'm trying to give you some
08:48 - inspiration for a meaningful data
08:50 - science project and hopefully i did that
08:53 - all right so my final project idea here
08:55 - is to build a data structure and
08:57 - algorithm visualizer now i know you guys
08:59 - have heard this many times in the past
09:01 - this is a very very popular idea however
09:04 - i'm still going to recommend it because
09:05 - i think it's a really good resume
09:07 - project and i'm going to tell you here
09:08 - to get more creative and unique in what
09:11 - you're visualizing as opposed to just a
09:13 - generic sorting algorithm or a data
09:15 - structure like a binary tree or a heap
09:17 - or something like that in my opinion
09:19 - those ones are kind of kind of boring i
09:21 - have done them in the past because a lot
09:22 - of people like those types of projects
09:24 - but i would recommend you visualize
09:25 - something that's not traditionally
09:27 - visualized for example maybe you make a
09:29 - game of chess i've done this on the
09:31 - channel and you make kind of a very
09:33 - basic ai that plays chess maybe you
09:35 - visualize how the ai makes decisions on
09:37 - what piece is going to move next even if
09:39 - it's moving a piece that makes no sense
09:41 - and it's not the best ai you're still
09:43 - visualizing something cool and not only
09:45 - have you made the visualization but you
09:47 - had to make the game to be able to do
09:48 - that i've also done on this channel
09:50 - visualizing sudoku so that game actually
09:53 - i built it out first you could just play
09:55 - the game and then i built a
09:56 - visualization tool which showed you how
09:58 - the i guess ai solves the board using
10:01 - something called a back tracking
10:03 - algorithm so get creative pick
10:05 - algorithms for projects that aren't
10:07 - traditionally visualized and then this
10:09 - gives you kind of a two in one you build
10:10 - out a game and you build out a project
10:12 - and then you show how your ai or
10:14 - whatever it's going to be actually
10:15 - solves that right i think that's cool i
10:18 - think that goes with data structure and
10:19 - algorithm visualization and you can
10:21 - visualize multiple things at the same
10:23 - time maybe you visualize the data
10:25 - structure as well as the algorithm
10:26 - that's running and then again you kind
10:28 - of get a two in one so that's my final
10:30 - idea here to summarize i had ai plays a
10:33 - video game i had to build a social media
10:36 - clone at a live messaging app i had some
10:39 - type of data science and data analysis
10:41 - project specifically analyzing tweets or
10:44 - analyzing coronavirus data pretty much
10:46 - any data right and then i had build a
10:48 - data structure and algorithm visualizer
10:51 - but to get more unique and creative and
10:52 - pick something that's not traditionally
10:54 - visualized
10:55 - all right so with that said that is
10:56 - going to wrap up this video if you guys
10:59 - have any project ideas please do share
11:01 - them down below if you like these type
11:03 - of videos leave a like subscribe to the
11:05 - channel don't forget to check out
11:07 - programmingexpert.io from the link in
11:08 - the description and i will see you in

Cleaned transcript:

in this video i'll share with you some impressive python projects that look great on a resume and that really showcase your ability as a programmer and your skill with python these projects will be in different categories like web development machine learning artificial intelligence data analysis and all the other things that python is really good at so with that said let's dive into the video so i'm going to start listing a ton of different projects but i do want to mention that you need to have a really strong foundation in programming and in python before you can start working on anything this complicated now if you don't already have that you can check out my course programming expert dot io this is designed to make you a software engineer as quickly as possible and has all of the stuff you need to get really good at python and just programming in general so it has object oriented programming advanced programming software design software engineering tools five completely guided programming projects that you can work on as well as over 250 coding questions and assessments for each section so that you actually know that you understand all of the content that you're learning from over the 100 videos anyways you guys can check it out from the link in the description and use code tim for a discount with that said though let's start getting into these resume projects now the first kind of category of projects i have here is artificial intelligence now in my opinion these are the most fun to work on and they also stand out a lot on a resume because even though they might not take a ton of time they're just really cool they sound impressive and that's kind of what you're going for with these type of projects so the first idea i have here is to make an artificial intelligence that can play a game so you can start with something really simple like pong make a neural network that can play the game of pop not the easiest thing in the world but definitely doable and you could 100 put that on a resume especially for a more junior position you can make an ai that plays tetris that automatically rotates the shapes and moves it in the correct direction maybe you have ais play against each other in the game of tetris there's a ton of stuff you can do next you can make an ai that plays flappy bird i actually have an entire tutorial series on this channel that shows you how to do that if you're looking for some concrete steps here on how you would accomplish something like this you can use a module in python called me now neats is a neural evolution of augmented topologies this is a really cool algorithm that actually takes a bunch of neural networks runs them all through your game and then takes the best of those neural networks and breeds them together and then continues this for generations until you eventually get a neural network that can say beat the game or is really good at completing it now of course there's a ton of other stuff that you can do with ai you can make an ai chat bot you can make an ai that trades stocks for you you do all kinds of stuff but i really like the game idea because you can actually build the game yourself in something like pie game and then design an ai in whatever way you like to actually play the game for you so moving on now to the web development section now i will note that there is an unlimited number of websites that you can make python is very flexible when it comes to web development but i'm gonna recommend here that you make something like a social media clone so something like instagram twitter facebook youtube maybe you get creative and do something like codegram where people post code instead of posting regular photos whatever you can get as creative as you want and of course you're going to build a slimmed down version you're not going to build a full instagram app or a full twitter you're going to build kind of the core features where users can sign in and sign up they can post something maybe they can search for different users and look at a profile they can like and they can comment that alone is a ton of different features and even if you just build a really bare bones version it's pretty impressive now the reason it's impressive is because if you're making something like this you need to make not only a front end buddy back end as well now personally for me when i build front ends for these websites i go really really simple i just use something like bootstrap which is a css framework i'll do plain javascript and html you don't need to get into anything too complicated like react unless you already know that but the core here is going to be the back end and how you're handling data story security and then the database integration that you have so that's why it's a good resume project because there's a lot of stuff going on there's a lot of different components that need to be connected together and there's a lot that you can learn when you're making this and that you can talk about in an interview about this project so again in terms of some concrete recommendations here if you're building a website you're going to use flask or django or you're going to build a separate front end and a separate back end and you're going to have an api on the back end using something like fast api or uh django rest framework or flask rest right there's all different kinds of stuff that you can do here i'm assuming if you guys are at this level in terms of building projects you already know what i'm talking about you're gonna have some type of back end some type of front end some type of database to store this information you're gonna have to learn a lot to make this and it's gonna look really good on a resume all right so continuing i have another web developmentish idea and this is to build a live chat application so something like telegram something like facebook messenger something like whatsapp where you have the ability to maybe add a contact or add a user and then you can chat with them in a chat room of some sort using sockets now sockets is kind of a live messaging system it's an ability for you to actually send information through the web without having to say upload it to a database and then pull the information from the database it's a really quick way to transmit messages specifically or different commands or kind of events that have occurred so this is definitely a really impressive thing to put on a resume especially if you implement a smooth and polished chat application this is actually

chess maybe you visualize how the ai makes decisions on what piece is going to move next even if it's moving a piece that makes no sense and it's not the best ai you're still visualizing something cool and not only have you made the visualization but you had to make the game to be able to do that i've also done on this channel visualizing sudoku so that game actually i built it out first you could just play the game and then i built a visualization tool which showed you how the i guess ai solves the board using something called a back tracking algorithm so get creative pick algorithms for projects that aren't traditionally visualized and then this gives you kind of a two in one you build out a game and you build out a project and then you show how your ai or whatever it's going to be actually solves that right i think that's cool i think that goes with data structure and algorithm visualization and you can visualize multiple things at the same time maybe you visualize the data structure as well as the algorithm that's running and then again you kind of get a two in one so that's my final idea here to summarize i had ai plays a video game i had to build a social media clone at a live messaging app i had some type of data science and data analysis project specifically analyzing tweets or analyzing coronavirus data pretty much any data right and then i had build a data structure and algorithm visualizer but to get more unique and creative and pick something that's not traditionally visualized all right so with that said that is going to wrap up this video if you guys have any project ideas please do share them down below if you like these type of videos leave a like subscribe to the channel don't forget to check out programmingexpert.io from the link in the description and i will see you in another youtube video you
