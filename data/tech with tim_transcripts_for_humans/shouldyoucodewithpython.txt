00:00 - now python for me at least is what I use
00:02 - when I want to get something done fast
00:03 - and typically when I'm scripting so it's
00:05 - really used a lot in machine learning
00:07 - artificial intelligence data science
00:09 - it's used for backend web servers and
00:11 - it's used for other scripting tasks so
00:13 - if you want to automate some file
00:15 - operations or you just need to do any
00:17 - automation python is really really good
00:19 - at that because of how quickly you can
00:20 - write code however python is not the
00:22 - best when it comes to Enterprise grade
00:24 - applications anything that requires a
00:26 - high performance and you're not going to
00:27 - see python in a lot of large scale apps
00:30 - it doesn't scale extremely well I would
00:32 - never use Python to create something
00:34 - that's like a massive application that
00:36 - would not be my choice so with all that
00:37 - said the core disadvantage of python is
00:39 - really the performance and scalability
00:41 - of it and the fact that you're not going
00:43 - to be using it in massive applications
