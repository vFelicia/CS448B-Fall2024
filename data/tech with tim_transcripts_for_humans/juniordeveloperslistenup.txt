00:00 - if you're new to programming I want you
00:01 - to listen to these next few minutes
00:03 - where I share with you a bit of wisdom
00:04 - from someone who's been learning and
00:06 - teaching coding for nearly 10 years and
00:08 - that person is me and I want to begin by
00:10 - saying coding is hard this is a tough
00:13 - thing to do it's not going to be easy
00:15 - and in fact it's probably going to be
00:16 - one of the hardest things you've ever
00:18 - done but that's more of a reason why you
00:20 - should actually do it and I just want to
00:22 - give you some kind of tips and advice in
00:23 - this video to really keep you pushing
00:25 - and make sure you remember why you
00:27 - wanted to learn to code in the first
00:29 - place and you don't give up on that goal
00:31 - so first off coding again very difficult
00:34 - very frustrating I am a relatively calm
00:37 - person I'm usually fairly stoic but when
00:39 - I run into bugs when I can't solve
00:41 - something for the 30th minute or for the
00:43 - fifth hour it's been 2 days and I just
00:45 - can't get past an issue you will see me
00:47 - punching my monitor screaming yelling
00:50 - doing push-ups to get my energy out like
00:52 - it just goes crazy it's such a
00:54 - frustrating thing and there's nothing in
00:56 - my life I've done that's more
00:57 - frustrating than trying to solve some of
00:59 - the simplest coding bugs this is
01:01 - something that even at the higher levels
01:03 - of development you're going to
01:04 - experience and sometimes it makes you
01:06 - question your life decisions why you're
01:08 - doing this and what even is the point of
01:10 - building this website or this project or
01:12 - whatever is going on now I have
01:14 - obviously gotten better at dealing with
01:15 - that over the years but I just want to
01:17 - make you aware that it's a very very
01:19 - normal feeling and I've had many nights
01:21 - where I've gone to bed with an unsolved
01:23 - bug and ask myself what the heck I'm
01:25 - doing and if I should just change career
01:27 - paths and go do something else because I
01:29 - don't want to deal with this so very
01:30 - normal feeling and you will learn how to
01:32 - overcome that and in fact that's one of
01:35 - the most impactful things being able to
01:37 - persevere being able to solve that
01:40 - impossible bug to work through that
01:42 - tutorial to set up your computer when
01:43 - it's been hours and hours and it's
01:45 - nothing is working is really one of the
01:47 - most satisfying feelings in the world
01:49 - and I can tell you that I still remember
01:51 - bug fixes I did when I was 17 years old
01:54 - because of how long they took me and how
01:56 - ecstatic and elated I felt that I was
01:58 - actually finally able to to solve them
02:00 - so please keep going don't give up that
02:03 - ability to persevere is something that
02:05 - carries much further than just coding
02:07 - and it really brings itself into your
02:08 - everyday life I can say since I've
02:10 - gotten better at programming and as I've
02:12 - gone through this journey I just feel
02:14 - more confident I think any problem I
02:16 - have is solvable that I can fix it that
02:19 - I can figure it out and that's one of
02:20 - the most freeing things in the world
02:22 - obviously you can get this from doing
02:24 - other things not just learning how to
02:25 - code but I think that being a developer
02:27 - you really learn that quite quickly any
02:30 - problem is fixable it is solvable there
02:32 - is a solution you can figure it out and
02:35 - I want you to remember that because
02:37 - there is always a way to fix a problem
02:39 - it's not impossible and it comes down to
02:41 - how much can you persevere and how much
02:44 - more effort can you give how much more
02:45 - time can you put into it and can you use
02:47 - strategies to help you calm down relax
02:50 - and approach the problem from a
02:51 - different angle now with that said I
02:53 - want to talk a little bit about the
02:54 - coding journey I remind you that this is
02:57 - exactly what it says a journey and it's
02:59 - Unique for everyone it's really
03:01 - discouraging when you're just learning
03:03 - how to code and you go online and you
03:04 - see stories of people that learned to
03:06 - code in 3 months and got a job at Google
03:08 - or ran the next AI Tech startup and made
03:10 - a billion dollars or our you know y
03:12 - combinator Founders at 19 years old and
03:15 - our AI Geniuses and programming experts
03:18 - that is an abnomaly and is really really
03:20 - dangerous and toxic to compare yourself
03:22 - to those type of people even comparing
03:24 - yourself to someone like myself a
03:25 - YouTuber who's been doing this for a
03:27 - very long time or going on Reddit forum
03:29 - are looking at people that just have all
03:31 - these great success stories at such a
03:33 - young age or in such a short time period
03:35 - this is really not a healthy thing to do
03:37 - and I want to discourage you from doing
03:38 - that now yes it can be motivating and
03:40 - you can take that component of it but
03:42 - the reality is everyone learns us at a
03:44 - completely different pace I've taught
03:46 - over 10,000 people how to code on a more
03:49 - personal level I know their stories and
03:51 - I know that all these people had a
03:53 - completely different Journey needed
03:55 - different resources different videos a
03:57 - much different time frame some people
03:59 - yet yes they can do it in a few months
04:01 - other people it takes years the amount
04:03 - of time it takes you to learn this does
04:04 - not dictate your ability to code and it
04:07 - does not say if you're a good or bad
04:08 - developer some of the best developers I
04:10 - know it took them a really really long
04:12 - time to get started and I was one of
04:14 - those people it took me years to really
04:16 - get my confidence in programming many
04:18 - people wouldn't know that watching my
04:20 - videos but that's the case a lot of time
04:22 - a lot of effort and I promise you it is
04:24 - worth it so just a friendly reminder
04:26 - here don't compare yourself to other
04:28 - people you want to make sure you're just
04:30 - looking at your own progress obviously
04:31 - you want to move forward you want to
04:32 - make progress but don't go look at those
04:34 - brainiacs online that are getting jobs
04:37 - at 19 and 20 years old and making
04:38 - hundreds of thousands of dollars those
04:40 - are abnomalities that is not normal it
04:42 - is going to take you a long time to do
04:44 - this and everyone's journey is
04:45 - completely different you really need to
04:47 - embrace that and remember that it's
04:49 - about you it's not about all the other
04:50 - people now with all that said I want to
04:52 - leave you with one last parting message
04:53 - here programming and software
04:55 - development is one of the highest value
04:57 - skills you can build in 2024 and that's
05:00 - because it gives you time location and
05:02 - Financial Freedom this gives you the
05:04 - skill to choose where you want to work
05:06 - who you want to work for how much money
05:08 - you want to get paid you can do this in
05:10 - any location you can do this in any time
05:12 - zone and you can do it for any company
05:14 - at any rate or any salary you want now
05:16 - obviously you got to build yourself up
05:17 - it's not like you can just demand to get
05:19 - paid half a million dollars a year but
05:21 - the reality is there's very few skill
05:23 - sets that give you all of those traits
05:25 - like software development does and over
05:27 - the past few years I've taken advantage
05:29 - of those I've been traveling a lot more
05:30 - now I'm actually moving to Dubai very
05:32 - shortly kind of a little announcement
05:34 - there and it's one of the things that I
05:36 - really appreciate about this skill set I
05:38 - can do it anywhere I want I can do it on
05:40 - any time zone and I can pretty much
05:41 - control my income by doing different
05:43 - jobs freelance gigs teaching programming
05:46 - or even building my own company if I
05:48 - wanted to go ahead and do that so I
05:50 - highly encourage you learn this skill if
05:52 - you do want a premium option to do that
05:54 - I do have a software development course
05:55 - this is with course careers we run you
05:57 - through software development
05:58 - fundamentals teach you in specialization
06:00 - in front end backend or devops and then
06:02 - help you every step of the way to
06:04 - actually Landing your first job check
06:06 - that out from the link in the
06:07 - description I hope this was a helpful
06:08 - video and I will see you in the next
06:11 - [Music]
