00:00 - in this video we're gonna be going over
00:02 - if-else and L if statements in Java so
00:05 - quickly just I want to fix a really
00:07 - small mistake I'm in the last video so
00:09 - if you guys don't know I am like a
00:10 - Python programmer typically so I'm doing
00:13 - Java obviously but Python is like my
00:15 - first language so I'm used to being able
00:16 - to use two equal signs on pretty much
00:18 - anything because that's what you can do
00:19 - in Python but in the last video I showed
00:21 - you using two equal signs on strings now
00:23 - that's not incorrect to do that but it's
00:26 - not gonna work the way you think right
00:28 - now so if you want to compare if two
00:29 - strings are logically the same like the
00:32 - actual string values are the same way
00:34 - you should actually do is say you have a
00:35 - string so s in this case you have to do
00:38 - dot equals okay and then inside of this
00:40 - equals here you're gonna put the string
00:42 - that you want to compare it to or you're
00:43 - gonna put another variable which is a
00:45 - string so in this case if I want to say
00:46 - if like my scanner objects which I've
00:48 - just typed out before this video is
00:50 - equal to hello this is how I would do it
00:52 - with this dot equal sign not the two
00:55 - equal signs you the two equal signs
00:57 - isn't wrong but it's gonna give you a
00:58 - different answer and we will talk about
01:01 - that in future videos but it's too
01:02 - advanced to go into right now so just
01:03 - remember if you want to compare two
01:05 - strings use dot equals my apologies
01:07 - about that from the last video so what
01:09 - we want to do now is when we do it using
01:11 - if and else statements so pretty much if
01:13 - something happens do this otherwise do
01:17 - this and this is the basis of
01:20 - programming using conditions based on
01:22 - like user input or based on certain
01:24 - events that happen we're gonna do
01:25 - different things right so they're really
01:27 - important to understand so first of all
01:29 - what I'm doing here is I'm just getting
01:31 - I'm just setting up a new scanner object
01:32 - I'm just gonna get you input from the
01:34 - user we've already talked about this and
01:35 - what I want to do is I want to check
01:37 - that users input and based on what they
01:40 - type in I want to do something so the
01:42 - basic syntax are if and else is in Java
01:44 - is you simply type if you put brackets
01:46 - and inside of these brackets is going to
01:49 - be your condition and this is why I
01:50 - spend so much time talking about
01:51 - conditions in the last video the
01:53 - condition here is if this condition
01:55 - evaluates to true whatever's inside of
01:57 - what I'm going to show you here
01:58 - whatever's inside of these curly braces
02:00 - is gonna happen so let's start with the
02:02 - condition let's say if s dot equals not
02:06 - to equal signs and in this case I'm
02:08 - going to say Tim so if the user types in
02:11 - Tim when we're when we
02:13 - prompt them for input then I want to do
02:16 - something and what's gonna happen is
02:17 - inside of these curly braces and this
02:19 - denotes a block so this is known as like
02:22 - an if statement or an if block so this
02:24 - block simply goes the syntax if then we
02:27 - have this these brackets inside the
02:30 - brackets as a condition the condition
02:31 - can be as long as it wants as long as
02:33 - you want as long as you're going to get
02:35 - a true or false value back from it and
02:36 - then we have these curly braces so an
02:38 - open brace and a close brace and inside
02:41 - of these braces anything that I type in
02:43 - here is going to happen if this
02:45 - condition is true so let's just do a
02:47 - quick little test here in order to do
02:49 - system dot out dot println and in this
02:52 - case we'll just say you typed ten okay
02:56 - Wow
02:57 - types you types you typed Tim okay and
03:00 - let's run the program and see what
03:02 - happened so when I run this if it loads
03:06 - up that's odd
03:07 - okay mmm give me one second okay so
03:10 - we're back I accidentally closed my
03:12 - console and yeah we were running into
03:14 - some issues with that so I got that up
03:15 - and running now let me just restart this
03:18 - quickly
03:19 - okay Wow okay I don't know why that's
03:21 - white but anyways uh let's just type out
03:24 - what are we gonna say here let's type
03:26 - hello and see what we get
03:27 - well we get nothing because we didn't
03:30 - type Tim so let's run it again let's try
03:32 - it this time I type Tim and it says you
03:35 - typed Tim so there we go our basic if
03:37 - statement is working now I want you to
03:40 - put another system dot out over here so
03:45 - that we can see what happens when we
03:48 - have like just with this example guy I'm
03:50 - just going to print I'm literally gonna
03:52 - print print okay so now what I want to
03:55 - show what happens here is like what is
03:58 - the program gonna run so if we type Tim
04:01 - we're gonna get this you typed him but
04:03 - are we still gonna get this print out
04:05 - here are we not gonna get it well let's
04:07 - test this out and see okay so in this
04:08 - case I typed Tim so when I typed him it
04:10 - says you typed him and then it says
04:11 - print okay now the reason that happens
04:14 - is because this print is not within this
04:16 - if block right so we're just gonna
04:18 - execute simply after this if block
04:20 - happens so now same thing right if I
04:21 - type like hi it's still gonna print out
04:25 - print to the screen
04:27 - because right it didn't go through this
04:28 - if block but this is not inside of the
04:30 - if block or the if statement or whatever
04:32 - so that executes okay so that's pretty
04:35 - straightforward now I'm going to show
04:36 - you else and LCIF
04:38 - rest start with notes so else is very
04:41 - straightforward it can only come after
04:44 - an else--if or and if so like the start
04:47 - of the block has to be if and then this
04:49 - else you can't just have it like a loan
04:51 - it has to come after an if statement or
04:53 - an else if statement which we're gonna
04:55 - go into in a second okay there's
04:57 - different ways to format this some
04:58 - people like to put the else like this so
05:00 - it has the closing brace and then the
05:02 - open brace I personally like to do it
05:03 - like this some people like to do it like
05:06 - this it's however you want okay this
05:08 - just works fine just make sure that your
05:10 - curly brace doesn't look something like
05:12 - that all the way out there because
05:13 - that's kind of hard to read okay so what
05:15 - I'm gonna do now is I'm going to put
05:16 - this print statement and I'm going to
05:18 - put it in my else statement alright
05:20 - now the way this else works is if this
05:23 - happens that's fine we're gonna go in
05:25 - here we're gonna print this out and then
05:27 - we'll move down to the end of the the
05:29 - block so we'll go to here as our next
05:32 - execution line now if this doesn't
05:34 - happen so other words or else
05:37 - then we print this so we're either
05:39 - printing you type Tim or print we're
05:41 - never printing both because one of them
05:43 - is if and one of them is else alright
05:45 - so let's test this out if I type Tim we
05:48 - you type Tim okay if I type anything
05:50 - else so like some random letters and I
05:52 - hit enter you get print so as else works
05:55 - is it's meant to do something if this
05:57 - condition is not true right okay so
05:59 - that's pretty straightforward I don't
06:00 - think I need to talk about that anymore
06:01 - the next one I'm gonna show you is else
06:03 - if now this is a way that we can add
06:06 - multiple if conditions in one kind of
06:08 - block okay so what I can do now is I can
06:11 - do like else if and now it's the exact
06:14 - same syntax as regular if statement
06:18 - except you just have this else before
06:20 - and obviously since this is an else it
06:23 - has to come after an initial if
06:25 - statement so you can have as many of
06:27 - these else ifs as you want now first
06:30 - I'll just put a condition in here so say
06:31 - s dodge equals and in this case let's
06:36 - just say hey like hello okay
06:38 - and then here we'll just do it system
06:40 - dot out dot println and we'll just say
06:44 - hi because we want to greet them back
06:46 - they said hello okay so again the way
06:49 - this is gonna work is we're gonna go
06:50 - through we're gonna check we're gonna
06:52 - get our scanner input we get s say okay
06:54 - what's s is s equal to Tim if it is
06:57 - we're gonna print this and then we're
06:59 - gonna move down after the last else
07:01 - statement we're not gonna even bother
07:02 - checking if it's something else because
07:04 - if it's equal to Tim then we know that
07:06 - we shouldn't bother looking at the else
07:08 - ifs right now if it's not equal to Tim
07:11 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
07:13 - through and we're gonna check we're
07:13 - gonna say okay else if that's our next
07:15 - block is it equal to hello if it's equal
07:18 - to hello we're gonna print hi we're
07:20 - gonna move on with our lives are gonna
07:21 - move down here we're not even gonna
07:22 - bother go into the else okay now if it's
07:25 - not equal to hello we're gonna go into
07:27 - the else statement and we're just simply
07:28 - gonna print print there's no condition
07:30 - it's just automatically gonna happen if
07:32 - you print anything other than hello or
07:33 - Tim we're going to print print okay so
07:36 - let's try this out and let's type hello
07:39 - and you can see we get hi
07:42 - all right now if I print type anything
07:44 - else in here so like some random letters
07:46 - we get print okay and that is how that
07:50 - works now I can show you I can add as
07:52 - many else ifs as I want so if I copy
07:54 - this and I simply paste it down here I
07:57 - can have another else--if and in here I
07:59 - could have hi and then here I could type
08:01 - hello and we could keep going and we
08:04 - could do as many else ifs as we want
08:05 - just know that whenever you have kind of
08:07 - a block that looks like this it has to
08:09 - start with an if statement and it does
08:11 - actually doesn't have to end with an
08:13 - else
08:13 - so in else just is should be the last
08:16 - thing so if you have any else ifs else
08:18 - will be your last thing like I couldn't
08:20 - do an Elif here and then try typing like
08:22 - that's that's not okay you can't do that
08:25 - but if I omit this else that's perfectly
08:28 - fine so now I have if we type Tim we
08:30 - type below or we type hi let's run this
08:32 - and let's type none of them let's let's
08:34 - type a bunch of letters we get nothing
08:36 - printed to the screen because we don't
08:37 - have that else statement now if I type
08:39 - hi you see we get hello because right we
08:43 - went through it wasn't equal to Tim it
08:44 - wasn't equal to hello so we printed hi
08:46 - now I want to show you this this is a
08:49 - bad example but it'll work if I put
08:52 - here and I put hello here which one are
08:55 - we gonna print so remember we're only
08:57 - gonna print one of these things we're
08:58 - not gonna print more than one so which
09:00 - one is it is it high or is it hello well
09:03 - let's test it out if I type hello in
09:07 - here we print high now the reason we're
09:10 - printing high is because this else--if
09:11 - is above this one and this is the first
09:14 - one that's gonna be looked at when we
09:15 - type something in just the way I kind of
09:17 - went through it's Akatsuki Lee so since
09:20 - we print high here we'll be like okay
09:22 - well that happens so there's no point in
09:24 - checking this and we just move on okay
09:26 - straightforward now again I can do more
09:28 - if statements down here you could keep
09:30 - typing like do a bunch of stuff just
09:32 - understand you can have as many else ifs
09:34 - as you want
09:34 - you don't need an else--if like we could
09:36 - just do an if and then else but every
09:38 - time you have kind of like an if
09:39 - statement or block starting it has to
09:41 - start with an if it can have as many
09:43 - Alice's as you want and the last thing
09:45 - has to be in else if you're adding the
09:48 - else you don't have to have that else
09:49 - there so anyways I think that's all I'm
09:52 - gonna show for if statements else ifs
09:54 - and else they're pretty straightforward
09:56 - any condition can go here so anything
09:58 - that I showed you before like you could
09:59 - have a really long chain conditional
10:02 - with ton of stuff same thing here you
10:04 - could have any condition like it doesn't
10:06 - matter anything that gives you a true or
10:07 - false value
10:07 - you could also literally just type true
10:09 - and like that would always happen okay
10:11 - so anyways that's been it for this video
10:13 - if you guys enjoyed and learned
10:14 - something please make sure you leave a
10:15 - like and subscribe and I will see you
10:17 - again in the next one

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're gonna be going over ifelse and L if statements in Java so quickly just I want to fix a really small mistake I'm in the last video so if you guys don't know I am like a Python programmer typically so I'm doing Java obviously but Python is like my first language so I'm used to being able to use two equal signs on pretty much anything because that's what you can do in Python but in the last video I showed you using two equal signs on strings now that's not incorrect to do that but it's not gonna work the way you think right now so if you want to compare if two strings are logically the same like the actual string values are the same way you should actually do is say you have a string so s in this case you have to do dot equals okay and then inside of this equals here you're gonna put the string that you want to compare it to or you're gonna put another variable which is a string so in this case if I want to say if like my scanner objects which I've just typed out before this video is equal to hello this is how I would do it with this dot equal sign not the two equal signs you the two equal signs isn't wrong but it's gonna give you a different answer and we will talk about that in future videos but it's too advanced to go into right now so just remember if you want to compare two strings use dot equals my apologies about that from the last video so what we want to do now is when we do it using if and else statements so pretty much if something happens do this otherwise do this and this is the basis of programming using conditions based on like user input or based on certain events that happen we're gonna do different things right so they're really important to understand so first of all what I'm doing here is I'm just getting I'm just setting up a new scanner object I'm just gonna get you input from the user we've already talked about this and what I want to do is I want to check that users input and based on what they type in I want to do something so the basic syntax are if and else is in Java is you simply type if you put brackets and inside of these brackets is going to be your condition and this is why I spend so much time talking about conditions in the last video the condition here is if this condition evaluates to true whatever's inside of what I'm going to show you here whatever's inside of these curly braces is gonna happen so let's start with the condition let's say if s dot equals not to equal signs and in this case I'm going to say Tim so if the user types in Tim when we're when we prompt them for input then I want to do something and what's gonna happen is inside of these curly braces and this denotes a block so this is known as like an if statement or an if block so this block simply goes the syntax if then we have this these brackets inside the brackets as a condition the condition can be as long as it wants as long as you want as long as you're going to get a true or false value back from it and then we have these curly braces so an open brace and a close brace and inside of these braces anything that I type in here is going to happen if this condition is true so let's just do a quick little test here in order to do system dot out dot println and in this case we'll just say you typed ten okay Wow types you types you typed Tim okay and let's run the program and see what happened so when I run this if it loads up that's odd okay mmm give me one second okay so we're back I accidentally closed my console and yeah we were running into some issues with that so I got that up and running now let me just restart this quickly okay Wow okay I don't know why that's white but anyways uh let's just type out what are we gonna say here let's type hello and see what we get well we get nothing because we didn't type Tim so let's run it again let's try it this time I type Tim and it says you typed Tim so there we go our basic if statement is working now I want you to put another system dot out over here so that we can see what happens when we have like just with this example guy I'm just going to print I'm literally gonna print print okay so now what I want to show what happens here is like what is the program gonna run so if we type Tim we're gonna get this you typed him but are we still gonna get this print out here are we not gonna get it well let's test this out and see okay so in this case I typed Tim so when I typed him it says you typed him and then it says print okay now the reason that happens is because this print is not within this if block right so we're just gonna

personally like to do it like this some people like to do it like this it's however you want okay this just works fine just make sure that your curly brace doesn't look something like that all the way out there because that's kind of hard to read okay so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to put this print statement and I'm going to put it in my else statement alright now the way this else works is if this happens that's fine we're gonna go in here we're gonna print this out and then we'll move down to the end of the the block so we'll go to here as our next execution line now if this doesn't happen so other words or else then we print this so we're either printing you type Tim or print we're never printing both because one of them is if and one of them is else alright so let's test this

know that whenever you have kind of a block that looks like this it has to start with an if statement and it does actually doesn't have to end with an else so in else just is should be the last thing so if you have any else ifs else will be your last thing like I couldn't do an Elif here and then try typing like that's that's not okay you can't do that but if I omit this else that's perfectly fine so now I have if we type Tim we type below or we type hi let's run this and let's type none of them let's let's type a bunch of letters we get nothing printed to the screen because we don't have that else statement now if I type hi you see we get hello because right we went through it wasn't equal to Tim it wasn't equal to hello so we printed hi now I want to show you this this is a bad example but it'll work if I put here and I put hello here which one are we gonna print so remember we're only gonna print one of these things we're not gonna print more than one so which one is it is it high or is it hello well let's test it out if I type hello in here we print high now the reason we're printing high is because this elseif is above this one and this is the first one that's gonna be looked at when we type something in just the way I kind of went through it's Akatsuki Lee so since we print high here we'll be like okay well that happens so there's no point in checking this and we just move on okay straightforward now again I can do more if statements down here you could keep typing like do a bunch of stuff just understand you can have as many else ifs as you want you don't need an elseif like we could just do an if and then else but every time you have kind of like an if statement or block starting it has to start with an if it can have as many Alice's as you want and the last

any condition can go here so anything that I showed you before like you could have a really long chain conditional with ton of stuff same thing here you could have any condition like it doesn't matter anything that gives you a true or false value you could also literally just type true and like that would always happen okay so anyways that's been it for this video if you guys enjoyed and learned something please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
