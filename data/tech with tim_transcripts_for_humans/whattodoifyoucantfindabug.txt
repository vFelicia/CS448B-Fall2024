00:01 - you're banging your head on the table
00:03 - you cannot fix the bug what do you do
00:05 - next well you may not like this answer
00:07 - but honestly it is what works for me the
00:09 - best take a break and try again tomorrow
00:11 - or try again later you've gone through
00:13 - and you've checked everything that you
00:15 - need to check you've got looked at the
00:16 - logic you've used the debugger you've
00:18 - checked the variable names you've looked
00:19 - at your dependencies if you've done all
00:21 - of that and you still can't find it you
00:23 - need a mental brick honestly whenever
00:25 - you find you're running into a lot of
00:27 - issues or there's a bug that's just
00:29 - really difficult to find seriously
00:31 - consider just stopping taking a break
00:32 - doesn't have to be for a long time maybe
00:34 - half an hour go for a walk come back to
00:36 - it chances are you're going to be in a
00:37 - better state of mind and able to find
00:39 - that a lot easier also you can kind of
00:41 - have your perspective drilled into one
00:43 - thing that you think is the issue when
00:45 - it's something completely different and
00:46 - by kind of taking a little break you can
00:48 - reset that get rid of the tunnel vision
00:50 - and hopefully find the book
