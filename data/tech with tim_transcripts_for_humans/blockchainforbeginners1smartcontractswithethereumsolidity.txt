00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to a brand
00:02 - new and very exciting series on this
00:04 - channel on an introduction to blockchain
00:07 - development so in this series i'm going
00:09 - to be showing you how to write smart
00:11 - contracts and deploy them on the
00:12 - ethereum network and i just want to
00:15 - state before i go any further this is
00:16 - designed for complete beginners so if
00:19 - you have never written code before if
00:20 - you don't know anything about blockchain
00:22 - do not worry this is the place for you
00:24 - i'm going to be explaining absolutely
00:26 - everything and in this series we're not
00:28 - going to write any massively complicated
00:30 - smart contracts this is really meant to
00:31 - give you kind of a high speed
00:33 - introduction and just get your hands
00:35 - dirty and actually deploying and writing
00:38 - contracts anyways with that said in this
00:40 - first video here what i'm going to be
00:42 - doing is showing you how to set up
00:44 - ethereum so how to set up a wallet how
00:46 - to get some different accounts and then
00:47 - how you can get free ethereum from an
00:49 - ethereum test network this is important
00:52 - because when we're kind of practicing we
00:54 - don't want to be spending real money and
00:56 - you do need to actually spend ethereum
00:58 - to put your smart contracts on the
01:00 - ethereum network so i'll show you how we
01:01 - can do that for free in this video so
01:04 - i'm super excited for this series i hope
01:06 - you guys are as well and there will
01:08 - likely be more on blockchain related
01:10 - topics on this channel coming in the
01:12 - future so look forward to that now i do
01:14 - need to mention and i apologize for the
01:16 - long intro here that the reason why i'm
01:18 - able to actually create this series is
01:19 - because of a company known as cartesi
01:21 - now cartesi is the sponsor of this video
01:24 - and this series and they've actually
01:25 - been working with me behind the scenes
01:27 - to come up with the curriculum here and
01:29 - make sure that i'm getting everything
01:30 - correct as i'm relaying this information
01:33 - to you i am not a blockchain expert i am
01:35 - kind of a beginner just like you guys
01:37 - but i am good at making youtube videos
01:39 - and tutorials and so they've been kind
01:40 - of helping me come up with the content
01:42 - in the structure and then reviewing all
01:44 - the work just to make sure everything is
01:46 - a hundred percent accurate now cartesi
01:48 - is an amazing company they're dedicated
01:50 - to making the blockchain more accessible
01:52 - for everyone and they have a ton of
01:54 - technology solutions that allow you to
01:57 - develop on the blockchain for much
01:59 - cheaper now we will hear more about them
02:00 - throughout the rest of this series but
02:02 - for now i just wanted to give them a
02:04 - general introduction and a massive thank
02:06 - you for working with me and well with
02:08 - you guys i guess to make this accessible
02:10 - to everyone and allow people to get into
02:12 - this world of blockchain development
02:14 - with that said let's get into this first
02:17 - video
02:20 - [Music]
02:26 - all right so let's go ahead and get
02:27 - started in this first video i'm going to
02:29 - show you how to set up a meta mask
02:31 - wallet this is actually an extension for
02:33 - chrome although it's available for ios
02:35 - and android as well and please even if
02:38 - you have an existing ethereum wallet
02:39 - because this will be storing ethereum
02:41 - follow along with these steps because
02:43 - you want a metamask wallet so you can
02:45 - get access to free ethereum and use it
02:48 - with the different applications we're
02:49 - going to be using later in this series
02:51 - so go to this website click on download
02:53 - i'll leave a link to it in the
02:54 - description and click on chrome and then
02:56 - install metamask for chrome now when you
02:58 - do this it will install a chrome
03:00 - extension it should pin this for you but
03:03 - if for some reason you don't see this in
03:05 - the top right hand corner so a little
03:06 - fox icon that's the metamask icon then
03:09 - click on this puzzle icon for extensions
03:12 - and just pin this it's just going to be
03:13 - helpful so click on the little pin and
03:15 - then it will make it so it's
03:16 - persistently up and i guess your i don't
03:18 - know you want to call this a taskbar
03:19 - bookmark bar whatever
03:21 - otherwise if you don't want to pin this
03:22 - you can just click directly on metamask
03:24 - and it will open up this page now for
03:27 - you i'm sure this is going to look a
03:28 - little bit different because you have
03:30 - not yet set up an account with metamask
03:32 - so i'm not going to walk through those
03:33 - steps because they're pretty intuitive
03:34 - but just walk through the basic setup
03:36 - steps on metamask you need a password
03:38 - make sure that's secure you're also
03:40 - going to need some secret words you want
03:42 - to make sure you save those somewhere
03:44 - you want to have access to them and then
03:46 - once you've done that it should prompt
03:48 - you to create an account
03:50 - so
03:50 - if you don't get prompted to create an
03:52 - account for some reason just click on
03:54 - this circular icon in the top right hand
03:56 - corner and click create account now you
03:59 - can have as many accounts as you would
04:00 - like within metamask you can see here i
04:03 - have two i have account one and i have
04:05 - tutorial and this will be very useful
04:07 - for us later on if we want to actually
04:09 - try testing out sending ethereum between
04:11 - different accounts
04:13 - great so that's kind of the basic setup
04:14 - so i have a count one notice i have six
04:16 - ethereum this is actually fake ethereum
04:18 - i'm going to show you how to get that in
04:19 - a second and then the tutorial account
04:21 - where i have zero
04:23 - all right so at this point in time i'm
04:24 - going to imagine that you've gone
04:25 - through those setup steps you figured
04:27 - out how to get to a page that looks
04:29 - similar to this and now i can show you
04:31 - how to get some free ethereum so the
04:33 - first thing i want to mention is that
04:34 - ethereum has a few different networks so
04:36 - if you click up here where it says for
04:38 - you it'll say ethereum mainnet but for
04:40 - me it says this gorelli test network
04:42 - what you're going to do is select one of
04:44 - the test networks that you want to try
04:47 - out your application on now these test
04:49 - networks are kind of a mirror or a clone
04:52 - of the ethereum mainnet the mainnet is
04:54 - the main ethereum network this is where
04:56 - real ethereum exists real smart
04:58 - contracts exist and anything on here is
05:01 - real money so you'll see this is 0.00
05:04 - usd whereas if i switch to a test
05:06 - network there's no price because this is
05:08 - all fake ethereum it's not worth any
05:10 - money it's just for testing for
05:12 - development so you can use any test
05:14 - network that you would like and you can
05:15 - kind of mess around with different ones
05:16 - if you want but the one that's been
05:18 - working really well for me recently is
05:20 - this go rally one now i'm probably
05:22 - mispronouncing this but this is the test
05:23 - network we're going to be using for
05:25 - right now and i just want to note that
05:27 - the public address of this wallet if
05:29 - that means anything to you is available
05:31 - right here so if you go copy to
05:33 - clipboard let's take this and paste this
05:35 - you'll see that we have this address
05:38 - this is the address for my ethereum wall
05:41 - okay let me go back to metamask here and
05:43 - now we are back on the go really test
05:45 - network in my tutorial account great now
05:48 - that we've done this i'm going to show
05:49 - you how we can use a faucet to access
05:52 - free ethereum and have it sent to this
05:54 - wallet so what we can do is click on buy
05:57 - when we do this we have directly deposit
05:58 - ether
05:59 - or test faucet get ether from a faucet
06:02 - for the corelli now this is the one that
06:04 - we want so we're going to click on get
06:06 - ether you can do this on any of the test
06:08 - networks and it will bring you to a
06:09 - different website now this is bringing
06:11 - us to some faucet i actually haven't
06:12 - used this faucet i'm going to show you
06:14 - how we do a different one or use a
06:16 - different one but what you can do is
06:17 - just stick in your address right here
06:20 - and then request the ether i would need
06:21 - to do the i'm not a robot thing and
06:24 - notice it's giving me an internal server
06:25 - error because sometimes these things
06:27 - just don't work they are test networks
06:29 - okay so they're going to be down
06:30 - sometimes there's going to be some
06:32 - maintenance they're not 100 reliable but
06:34 - that's fine because we're just using
06:36 - them to test so you kind of just have to
06:38 - experiment and mess around with them and
06:40 - find one that's working on a specific
06:42 - day kind of annoying but considering we
06:44 - get free ethereum and we can test it out
06:46 - without without having to pay i am not
06:48 - complaining okay so what i'm going to do
06:50 - is go back to metamask here
06:52 - and actually uh let's just copy this
06:55 - public address although i already have
06:56 - that copied and now we're going to go to
06:58 - this website right here i'll leave a
07:00 - link to this in the description now this
07:02 - website is what's known as a social
07:04 - faucet now a social faucet means that
07:06 - you need to post something on social
07:08 - media that contains your wallet address
07:10 - and then put the link to that post and
07:13 - it will then send you a theorem now you
07:15 - don't need to post on some large account
07:17 - or something you can just make a brand
07:18 - new account on twitter or facebook i
07:20 - think those are the two available ones
07:21 - right here and in fact that's exactly
07:23 - what i did so what i did is i went to
07:25 - twitter i have this actually really old
07:27 - twitter account from when i was like 12
07:28 - or something oh yeah july 2013. anyways
07:31 - i don't use this account so i just
07:32 - signed in and then i posted this tweet
07:35 - requesting fawcett funds into and then
07:37 - this address now you actually don't need
07:39 - to write anything other than the address
07:42 - of your wallet so what you'll do is go
07:43 - tweet or if you're on facebook you would
07:45 - post something and then i'm just going
07:47 - to make a tweet that contains my wallet
07:49 - address i'm going to click tweet then
07:51 - i'm going to go here and i'm going to go
07:53 - share so i'm going to copy the link to
07:55 - the tweet
07:56 - i'm going to go here paste that link in
07:59 - and then click give me ether now we have
08:01 - a few options select whatever one you
08:03 - want i'm just going to go with six
08:04 - ethers every day
08:06 - i got to select the chimney so let's see
08:08 - if i can pass this
08:10 - okay that looks good
08:11 - and it said oh i have a certain amount
08:14 - of time left until my next allowance uh
08:17 - okay looks like it's because i got ether
08:20 - recently from the same account
08:22 - and so that means that i have to wait
08:24 - but for you guys this should work you
08:26 - shouldn't have a timeout problem i
08:28 - already have six ethereum so i'll deal
08:29 - with using that as i need to as we go
08:31 - through the tutorial regardless this
08:34 - should work it should just give you
08:35 - ethereum and then if you go to metamask
08:37 - you should see in your account so let me
08:39 - swap my account here to account one that
08:42 - you have some amount of ethereum all
08:44 - right so at this point in time i'm going
08:46 - to assume you've successfully got some
08:48 - ethereum if the test network i used
08:50 - didn't work just try another one go
08:52 - through all of them eventually one
08:53 - should probably work for you now it
08:55 - doesn't really matter which test network
08:57 - you used but just keep track of which
08:58 - one it was because you will need to
09:00 - change some very minor steps as we go
09:02 - through the rest of the tutorial if you
09:03 - did use a different test network but
09:05 - everything will still work the general
09:06 - concepts are the same you just need to
09:08 - alter like one or two things very very
09:10 - small
09:11 - anyways what i want to do now is show
09:12 - you how to send ethereum which is really
09:14 - easy to do with metamask and how you can
09:17 - explore the blockchain and look at the
09:19 - addresses of wallets look at different
09:21 - transactions that have occurred and just
09:23 - show you this website here known as
09:25 - etherscan now etherscan is what i like
09:27 - to call a blockchain explorer you'll
09:29 - notice here i'm on goreli.etherscan.io
09:33 - so this is specific to the test network
09:35 - that i'm using if you did use a
09:36 - different test network then you're going
09:38 - to want to search up etherscan plus the
09:40 - name of that test network and just go to
09:42 - that ether skin obviously this one is
09:44 - for the test network that i used so what
09:47 - i want to do is show you that we can
09:48 - actually view everything on the
09:50 - blockchain completely transparently it's
09:52 - one of the great things about the
09:53 - blockchain you can just go and look at
09:55 - any wall address you don't necessarily
09:57 - know who owns that walled address but
09:59 - you can see every single transaction
10:01 - that's occurred you can see who sent the
10:03 - money how much money is in every single
10:04 - account that's one of the great features
10:06 - of the blockchain everything is
10:07 - completely transparent so i want to show
10:09 - you how we look up our own account on
10:11 - etherscan
10:13 - so i'm going to go here to metamask and
10:15 - i'm just going to click on my account
10:16 - address right here and copy it to the
10:18 - clipboard now that i have that i'm just
10:20 - going to paste it in this search bar
10:21 - right here and just click search
10:24 - okay so here we go we can now see my
10:26 - wall address showing up on etherscan now
10:29 - if you guys go and paste this address in
10:31 - i don't assume you're going to type all
10:32 - of it out but let's say you did that
10:34 - into etherscan you would see the exact
10:35 - same page that i'm seeing and you could
10:37 - view all of the transactions in my
10:39 - wallet so anyways here we are this is my
10:42 - wallet you can see i have six ethereum
10:44 - inside of here and i had one transaction
10:46 - that occurred eight days and three hours
10:48 - ago this is correct that's actually when
10:50 - i had the ethereum sent in when i was
10:52 - kind of preparing for this video and you
10:54 - can see it was on this block i had this
10:57 - transaction hash and then i have the
10:59 - from address and the to address so the
11:01 - to address is my wallet address right
11:03 - here but if i want to see where this
11:04 - ethereum came from which was the faucet
11:07 - i can click on this so when i click here
11:09 - notice this has an absurd amount of
11:11 - ethereum 515 000 ethereum right that's
11:14 - quite a bit and you can go and look at
11:16 - all of the different transactions that
11:17 - it's sent and how frequently it's
11:19 - sending them so you can see how many
11:20 - people are requesting ethereum from this
11:22 - faucet anyways let's go back
11:25 - and let's actually click on this
11:26 - transaction hash that's what txnhash is
11:30 - so let's do that and let's just look at
11:31 - some details that we have here now
11:33 - notice it's telling us this is only from
11:35 - this test network okay it gives us the
11:37 - hash of the transaction which we'll
11:39 - discuss later on we have the status this
11:41 - was successful you could have a status
11:43 - of pending meaning it's not yet been
11:45 - sent through then we have the block that
11:47 - this was attached to we can actually
11:49 - click directly into the block and view
11:51 - everything that was associated with this
11:52 - block as well we can see the minor that
11:54 - mined it too which is interesting
11:57 - then we can go and look at the from
11:58 - address the two address the value of the
12:00 - ethereum the transaction fee the gas
12:03 - price and a bunch of other stuff now
12:05 - this is really not going to mean
12:07 - anything to you right now but i just
12:08 - wanted to show you that you can do this
12:10 - you can look at all of the details of
12:12 - the blockchain completely for free
12:15 - transparently and anyone can do this
12:17 - there's not one person who has access
12:19 - you can't hide your transactions from
12:20 - one person everything is completely
12:22 - publicly available all right so now that
12:24 - we've looked at that i'm just going to
12:26 - quickly show you how you could send
12:27 - ethereum now you only can send ethereum
12:30 - between the same test networks so i
12:32 - can't send this ethereum to a different
12:34 - test network or to the main ethereum
12:35 - network obviously that's not going to
12:37 - work but what i'm going to do here is
12:39 - just look at my other account so you'll
12:41 - notice that if i go here i have my
12:43 - tutorial account and then i have my
12:45 - account one so let's say i want to send
12:47 - i don't know one ethereum to this
12:49 - tutorial account well i'm just going to
12:51 - copy the address here notice i'm on this
12:53 - test network
12:54 - i'm going to go back to account one i'm
12:56 - just going to click on send in meta mask
12:58 - i'm going to paste in this public
13:00 - address i'll go with one ethereum i will
13:03 - click next and i can confirm this it's
13:06 - going to tell me how much this will cost
13:07 - i have to pay a very small gas fee i
13:09 - will click confirm and now it is sending
13:12 - the transaction you can see it says
13:14 - pending if i click on it here it gives
13:16 - me the details and this is very similar
13:18 - to what i had on etherskin now let's see
13:21 - if we can find the hash of this
13:22 - transaction copy address copy address no
13:27 - let's go copy transaction id okay so i'm
13:29 - going to copy that let's go to etherscan
13:31 - here and paste this in and let's see if
13:33 - we can view the transaction and there we
13:35 - go we can view it and notice if we go to
13:37 - the from address this is my address that
13:40 - now has less ethereum in it than it did
13:41 - before because i am attempting to send
13:44 - money now it is not showing me the
13:45 - pending transaction because the
13:46 - transaction is currently pending it is
13:48 - not finished but you get the point
13:50 - this is all working and well we can view
13:53 - all of the transaction details all right
13:54 - so i just took a quick cut and you can
13:56 - see that the transaction has now
13:58 - actually gone through so i have a status
14:00 - success the page actually updated live
14:02 - when i was on it so that's how i knew
14:04 - this and if i go back to the from
14:05 - address you can see this transaction is
14:07 - now here uh and sorry it's right here
14:10 - actually because it's more recent and
14:11 - it's saying we sent one ethereum out
14:13 - from this address to the other address
14:15 - and if we go here we can see we have one
14:17 - ether and then of course if we go back
14:18 - to metamask and let's go to this other
14:22 - account so let's go to account number
14:24 - one or tutorial
14:26 - we have one ethereum so anyways with
14:28 - this transaction now being completed i'm
14:31 - actually going to end the video here i
14:32 - just wanted to give you a brief
14:34 - introduction to how we actually set up
14:36 - ethereum accounts how we can send money
14:38 - between different accounts the test
14:39 - networks and the faucets and then of
14:41 - course ether scan so how you can
14:43 - actually view different transactions
14:45 - view wallets and see what's going on on
14:46 - the blockchain a lot of this will start
14:48 - to make more sense in the next video
14:50 - where i actually go through a deep
14:52 - explanation of how blockchain technology
14:54 - works how the network is secure how
14:57 - transactions are sent etc etc anyways i
15:00 - am going to wrap up the video here i
15:02 - hope you guys enjoyed one last massive
15:04 - thank you to cartesi for sponsoring this
15:06 - video and helping with the content we'll
15:08 - hear more from them in future videos i
15:10 - hope you guys are sticking around make
15:12 - sure you subscribe to the channel and i
15:14 - will see you in the next one
15:17 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to a brand new and very exciting series on this channel on an introduction to blockchain development so in this series i'm going to be showing you how to write smart contracts and deploy them on the ethereum network and i just want to state before i go any further this is designed for complete beginners so if you have never written code before if you don't know anything about blockchain do not worry this is the place for you i'm going to be explaining absolutely everything and in this series we're not going to write any massively complicated smart contracts this is really meant to give you kind of a high speed introduction and just get your hands dirty and actually deploying and writing contracts anyways with that said in this first video here what i'm going to be doing is showing you how to set up ethereum so how to set up a wallet how to get some different accounts and then how you can get free ethereum from an ethereum test network this is important because when we're kind of practicing we don't want to be spending real money and you do need to actually spend ethereum to put your smart contracts on the ethereum network so i'll show you how we can do that for free in this video so i'm super excited for this series i hope you guys are as well and there will likely be more on blockchain related topics on this channel coming in the future so look forward to that now i do need to mention and i apologize for the long intro here that the reason why i'm able to actually create this series is because of a company known as cartesi now cartesi is the sponsor of this video and this series and they've actually been working with me behind the scenes to come up with the curriculum here and make sure that i'm getting everything correct as i'm relaying this information to you i am not a blockchain expert i am kind of a beginner just like you guys but i am good at making youtube videos and tutorials and so they've been kind of helping me come up with the content in the structure and then reviewing all the work just to make sure everything is a hundred percent accurate now cartesi is an amazing company they're dedicated to making the blockchain more accessible for everyone and they have a ton of technology solutions that allow you to develop on the blockchain for much cheaper now we will hear more about them throughout the rest of this series but for now i just wanted to give them a general introduction and a massive thank you for working with me and well with you guys i guess to make this accessible to everyone and allow people to get into this world of blockchain development with that said let's get into this first video all right so let's go ahead and get started in this first video i'm going to show you how to set up a meta mask wallet this is actually an extension for chrome although it's available for ios and android as well and please even if you have an existing ethereum wallet because this will be storing ethereum follow along with these steps because you want a metamask wallet so you can get access to free ethereum and use it with the different applications we're going to be using later in this series so go to this website click on download i'll leave a link to it in the description and click on chrome and then install metamask for chrome now when you do this it will install a chrome extension it should pin this for you but if for some reason you don't see this in the top right hand corner so a little fox icon that's the metamask icon then click on this puzzle icon for extensions and just pin this it's just going to be helpful so click on the little pin and then it will make it so it's persistently up and i guess your i don't know you want to call this a taskbar bookmark bar whatever otherwise if you don't want to pin this you can just click directly on metamask and it will open up this page now for you i'm sure this is going to look a little bit different because you have not yet set up an account with metamask so i'm not going to walk through those steps because they're pretty intuitive but just walk through the basic setup steps on metamask you need a password make sure that's secure you're also going to need some secret words you want to make sure you save those somewhere you want to have access to them and then once you've done that it should prompt you to create an account so if you don't get prompted to create an account for some reason just click on this circular icon in the top right hand corner and click create account now you can have as many accounts as you would like within metamask you can see here i have two i have account one and i have tutorial and this will be very useful for us later on if we want to actually try testing out sending ethereum between different accounts great so that's kind of the basic setup so i have a count one notice i have six ethereum this is actually fake ethereum i'm going to show you how to get that in a second and then the tutorial account where i have zero all right so at this point in time i'm going to imagine that you've gone through those setup steps you figured out how to get to a page that looks similar to this and now i can show you how to get some free ethereum so the first thing i want to mention is that ethereum has a few different networks so if you click up here where it says for you it'll say ethereum mainnet but for me it says this gorelli test network what you're going to do is select one of the test networks that you want to try out your application on now these test networks are kind of a mirror or a clone of the ethereum mainnet the mainnet is the main ethereum network this is where real ethereum exists real smart contracts exist and anything on here is real money so you'll see this is 0.00 usd whereas if i switch to a test network there's no price because this is all fake ethereum it's not worth any money it's just for testing for development so you can use any test network that you would like and you can kind of mess around with different ones if you want but the one that's been working really well for me recently is this go rally one now i'm probably mispronouncing this but this is the test network we're going to be using for right now and i just want to note that the public address of this wallet if that means anything to you is available right here so if you go copy to clipboard let's take this and paste this you'll see that we have this address this is the address for my ethereum wall okay let me go back to metamask here and now we are back on the go really test network in my tutorial account great now that we've done this i'm going to show you how we can use a faucet to access free ethereum and have it sent to this wallet so what we can do is click on buy when we do this we have directly deposit ether or test faucet get ether from a faucet for the corelli now this is the one that we want so we're going to click on get ether you can do this on any of the test networks and it will bring you to a different website now this is bringing us to some faucet i actually haven't used this faucet i'm going to show you how we do a different one or use a different one but what you can do is just stick in your address right here and then request the ether i would need to do the i'm not a robot thing and notice it's giving me an internal server error because sometimes these things just don't work they are test networks okay so they're going to be down sometimes there's going to be some maintenance they're not 100 reliable but that's fine because we're just using them to test so you kind of just have to experiment and mess around with them and find one that's working on a specific day kind of annoying but considering we get free ethereum and we can test it out without without having to pay i am not complaining okay so what i'm going to do is go back to metamask here and actually uh let's just copy this public address although i already have that copied and now we're going to go to this website right here i'll leave a link to this in the description now this website is what's known as a social faucet now a social faucet means that you need to post something on social media that contains your wallet address and then put the link to that post and it will then send you a theorem now you don't need to post on some large account or something you can just make a brand new account on twitter or facebook i think those are the two available ones right here and in fact that's exactly what i did so what i did is i went to twitter i have this actually really old twitter account from when i was like 12 or something oh yeah july 2013. anyways i don't use this account so i just signed in and then i posted this tweet requesting fawcett funds into and then this address now you actually don't need to write anything other than the address of your wallet so what you'll do is go tweet or if you're on facebook you would post something and then i'm just going to make a tweet that contains my wallet address i'm going to click tweet then i'm going to go here and i'm going to go share so i'm going to copy the link to the tweet i'm going to go here paste that link in and then click give me ether now we have a few options select whatever one you want i'm just going to go with six ethers every day i got to select the chimney so let's see if i can pass this okay that looks good and it said oh i have a certain amount of time left until my next allowance uh okay looks like it's because i got ether recently from the same account and so that means that i have to wait but for you guys this should work you shouldn't have a timeout problem i already have six ethereum so i'll deal with using that as i need to as we go through the tutorial regardless this should work it should just give you ethereum and then if you go to metamask you should see in your account so let me swap my account here to account one that you have some amount of ethereum all right so at this point in time i'm going to assume you've successfully got some ethereum if the test network i used didn't work just try another one go through all of them eventually one should probably work for you now it doesn't really matter which test network you used but just keep track of which one it was because you will need to change some very minor steps as we go through the rest of the tutorial if you did use a different test network but everything will still work the general concepts are the same you just need to alter like one or two things very very small anyways what i want to do now is show you how to send ethereum which is really easy to do with metamask and how you can explore the blockchain and look at the addresses of wallets look at different transactions that have occurred and just show you this website here known as etherscan now etherscan is what i like to call a blockchain explorer you'll notice here i'm on goreli.etherscan.io so this is specific to the test network that i'm using if you did use a different test network then you're going to want to search up etherscan plus the name of that test network and just go to that ether skin obviously this one is for the test network that i used so what i want to do is show you that we can actually view everything on the blockchain completely transparently it's one of the great things about the blockchain you can just go and look at any wall address you don't necessarily know who owns that walled address but you can see every single transaction that's occurred you can see who sent the money how much money is in every single account that's one of the great features of the blockchain everything is completely transparent so i want to show you how we look up our own account on etherscan so i'm going to go here to metamask and i'm just going to click on my account address right here and copy it to the clipboard now that i have that i'm just going to paste it in this search bar right here and just click search okay so here we go we can now see my wall address showing up on etherscan now if you guys go and paste this address in i don't assume you're going to type all of it out but let's say you did that into etherscan you would see the exact same page that i'm seeing and you could view all of the transactions in my wallet so anyways here we are this is my wallet you can see i have six ethereum inside of here and i had one transaction that occurred eight days and three hours ago this is correct that's actually when i had the ethereum sent in when i was kind of preparing for this video and you can see it was on this block i had this transaction hash and then i have the from address and the to address so the to address is my wallet address right here but if i want to see where this ethereum came from which was the faucet i can click on this so when i click here notice this has an absurd amount of ethereum 515 000 ethereum right that's quite a bit and you can go and look at all of the different transactions that it's sent and how frequently it's sending them so you can see how many people are requesting ethereum from this faucet anyways let's go back and let's actually click on this transaction hash that's what txnhash is so let's do that and let's just look at some details that we have here now notice it's telling us this is only from this test network okay it gives us the hash of the transaction which we'll discuss later on we have the status this was successful you could have a status of pending meaning it's not yet been sent through then we have the block that this was attached to we can actually click directly into the block and view everything that was associated with this block as well we can see the minor that mined it too which is interesting then we can go and look at the from address the two address the value of the ethereum the transaction fee the gas price and a bunch of other stuff now this is really not going to mean anything to you right now but i just wanted to show you that you can do this you can look at all of the details of the blockchain completely for free transparently and anyone can do this there's not one person who has access you can't hide your transactions from one person everything is completely publicly available all right so now that we've looked at that i'm just going to quickly show you how you could send ethereum now you only can send ethereum between the same test networks so i can't send this ethereum to a different test network or to the main ethereum network obviously that's not going to work but what i'm going to do here is just look at my other account so you'll notice that if i go here i have my tutorial account and then i have my account one so let's say i want to send i don't know one ethereum to this tutorial account well i'm just going to copy the address here notice i'm on this test network i'm going to go back to account one i'm just going to click on send in meta mask i'm going to paste in this public address i'll go with one ethereum i will click next and i can confirm this it's going to tell me how much this will cost i have to pay a very small gas fee i will click confirm and now it is sending the transaction you can see it says pending if i click on it here it gives me the details and this is very similar to what i had on etherskin now let's see if we can find the hash of this transaction copy address copy address no let's go copy transaction id okay so i'm going to copy that let's go to etherscan here and paste this in and let's see if we can view the transaction and there we go we can view it and notice if we go to the from address this is my address that now has less ethereum in it than it did before because i am attempting to send money now it is not showing me the pending transaction because the transaction is currently pending it is not finished but you get the point this is all working and well we can view all of the transaction details all right so i just took a quick cut and you can see that the transaction has now actually gone through so i have a status success the page actually updated live when i was on it so that's how i knew this and if i go back to the from address you can see this transaction is now here uh and sorry it's right here actually because it's more recent and it's saying we sent one ethereum out from this address to the other address and if we go here we can see we have one ether and then of course if we go back to metamask and let's go to this other account so let's go to account number one or tutorial we have one ethereum so anyways with this transaction now being completed i'm actually going to end the video here i just wanted to give you a brief introduction to how we actually set up ethereum accounts how we can send money between different accounts the test networks and the faucets and then of course ether scan so how you can actually view different transactions view wallets and see what's going on on the blockchain a lot of this will start to make more sense in the next video where i actually go through a deep explanation of how blockchain technology works how the network is secure how transactions are sent etc etc anyways i am going to wrap up the video here i hope you guys enjoyed one last massive thank you to cartesi for sponsoring this video and helping with the content we'll hear more from them in future videos i hope you guys are sticking around make sure you subscribe to the channel and i will see you in the next one
