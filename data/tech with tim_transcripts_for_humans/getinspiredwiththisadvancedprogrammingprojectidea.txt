00:18 - you could take an API or take some web
00:19 - service whatever you create and connect
00:21 - that with a bunch of different

00:26 - hooking this up with a database it's
00:28 - going to mean hosting it on the cloud
00:29 - trying to get some domain associated
00:31 - with it a lot of cool stuff a lot of
