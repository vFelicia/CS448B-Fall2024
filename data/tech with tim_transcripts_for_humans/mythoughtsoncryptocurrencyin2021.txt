00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video
00:11 - so in today's video i'm going to be
00:12 - giving you my thoughts on cryptocurrency
00:15 - now the first thing i will say is that
00:17 - nothing in this video is financial
00:18 - advice i'm not telling you to buy
00:20 - sell do anything with cryptocurrency
00:22 - this is strictly my perspective
00:24 - my thoughts there's a good chance that i
00:26 - may make some mistakes in this video i
00:28 - may have some statements that are
00:29 - slightly inaccurate and if that is the
00:31 - case please do correct me in the
00:33 - comments
00:33 - they are just honest mistakes and
00:35 - something that hopefully i can learn
00:36 - from
00:37 - anyways with that said in this video i'm
00:38 - just going to talk to you about
00:40 - cryptocurrency and what i think of it
00:41 - and i'm kind of going to come from
00:42 - three angles the first angle being is
00:45 - this practical does this make sense is
00:47 - this something that's actually going to
00:48 - be used for day-to-day transactions are
00:50 - you going to be buying your next car in
00:52 - bitcoin
00:53 - then i'm going to give my perspective on
00:54 - it from an investment side so
00:56 - does this make sense as an investment
00:57 - something to add to your portfolio
00:59 - something that's going to make you money
01:01 - that's kind of the only thing i'm
01:02 - talking about in that section and then
01:04 - finally i'm going to talk about this
01:05 - in terms of a developer perspective so
01:07 - if you're someone who's writing code if
01:09 - you're someone who wants to get into the
01:10 - blockchain space but what does this mean
01:11 - for you
01:12 - at least in my opinion is this something
01:14 - good is this something bad so on and so
01:16 - forth
01:16 - so anyways with that said let's get into
01:18 - this video after a quick word
01:20 - from our sponsor before we get started i
01:22 - need to thank the sponsor of this video
01:24 - which is alco
01:25 - expert algo expert is the best platform
01:27 - to use for preparing for your software
01:29 - engineering coding interviews
01:30 - and has the highest quality coding
01:32 - interview practice questions
01:34 - with 155 practice questions detailed
01:37 - solutions and nine of the most popular
01:39 - programming languages
01:40 - a feature-packed browser-based coding
01:42 - environment extensive test suites and
01:44 - conceptual overviews and code
01:46 - walkthroughs for each and every problem
01:48 - algo expert is the best resource to use
01:50 - to ace your coding interviews
01:52 - aligoexpert also has a data structures
01:54 - crash course coding interview
01:55 - assessments and a mock interviews
01:57 - feature
01:58 - i can highly recommend algo expert as a
02:00 - former customer myself
02:01 - and now an official instructor on the
02:03 - platform get started using algo expert
02:05 - today by clicking the link in the
02:07 - description
02:08 - and using the code tech with tim for a
02:09 - discount on the platform
02:11 - so i'm actually going to start by just
02:12 - giving you guys some context here i'm
02:14 - someone who's been super enthusiastic
02:16 - about cryptocurrency i'm actually the
02:18 - first person i know
02:19 - that was really into cryptocurrency back
02:21 - kind of at the beginning stages of it
02:23 - so i started getting into cryptocurrency
02:25 - in 2016
02:26 - unfortunately i was only 16 at that
02:28 - point in time and so i didn't have
02:30 - boatloads of money to go you know buy a
02:31 - ton of bitcoin and ethereum at
02:33 - a thousand dollars a hundred dollars
02:35 - respectively and now be a millionaire
02:37 - today i think i made maybe a few
02:38 - thousand dollars off of my previous
02:40 - investments when i was quite young which
02:42 - is still great no complaints
02:43 - but just wanted to say that no i'm not a
02:45 - bitcoin millionaire or anything like
02:47 - that
02:47 - i'm just someone who was really
02:48 - passionate about that technology learned
02:50 - a lot about it i was building a mining
02:52 - rig at like 16 years old
02:54 - and anyways yeah i just have really
02:55 - liked cryptocurrency for a long time and
02:57 - it's awesome to see it kind of coming
02:59 - into the forefront now
03:00 - having media coverage having people that
03:02 - aren't technologically savvy
03:04 - using investing and understanding how
03:06 - cryptocurrency works
03:07 - and for me one of the most interesting
03:09 - things about cryptocurrency is not even
03:10 - just like the investment
03:12 - potential and the worldwide potential
03:14 - and all of that it's really just the
03:15 - technology behind it and kind of how
03:17 - that works
03:18 - and the idea of decentralization which i
03:20 - think is becoming more and more
03:21 - important as we go through the years
03:23 - so anyways that kind of leads me into
03:25 - the first thing i want to talk about
03:26 - with cryptocurrency
03:27 - which is is this practical does this
03:29 - make sense are you going to be buying
03:30 - your next house or
03:31 - car in cryptocurrency now i'm leaning
03:34 - towards
03:34 - no that's probably not going to happen i
03:37 - don't see especially in north america
03:39 - having cryptocurrency be the main you
03:41 - know worldwide or national currency i
03:44 - still think there is a place for
03:45 - currencies like us dollar canadian
03:47 - dollar
03:47 - all of the other currencies around the
03:49 - world i think that cryptocurrency will
03:51 - have its own place and certain things
03:53 - that you definitely
03:53 - will be able to purchase with it but i
03:55 - think we are a long time away from
03:57 - seeing it being something
03:58 - that is actually going to be used as
04:00 - kind of a mainstream
04:01 - currency especially because now a lot of
04:04 - times when people get paid in
04:05 - cryptocurrency
04:06 - the first thing they do is sell it into
04:07 - fiat currency or the other way around
04:09 - right people will buy cryptocurrency
04:11 - with the fiat currency with the idea of
04:13 - maybe investing trading it putting it
04:15 - somewhere else
04:16 - and then they will pull that money out
04:17 - in fiat currency
04:19 - and anyways one of the reasons i don't
04:20 - see this being kind of a global currency
04:23 - or something that's going to be used
04:24 - super mainstream is because first the
04:27 - only people that are really using
04:28 - cryptocurrency and this is a vast
04:30 - generalization
04:31 - are people in the younger generation at
04:32 - least in my experience
04:34 - i mean even my parents for example they
04:35 - don't really understand it anyone who
04:37 - i talk to who's not kind of in this you
04:39 - know tech generation
04:40 - who's maybe a little bit older they're a
04:42 - little bit skeptical of cryptocurrency
04:44 - there's still a lot of people that
04:45 - really just don't understand it
04:46 - and obviously the volatility is a kind
04:48 - of huge turn off for people wanting to
04:50 - actually put their money into that
04:52 - and use that as their kind of day-to-day
04:54 - thing right
04:55 - and same thing with companies i mean i
04:57 - guess like big props to elon musk
04:59 - and all of the other companies that are
05:00 - actually accepting bitcoin and
05:01 - cryptocurrency they are kind of leading
05:03 - the way
05:04 - but i think it's going to be a long time
05:05 - before we see you know all of the
05:07 - mainstream companies especially not tech
05:09 - companies
05:10 - in the world transitioning straight to
05:12 - cryptocurrency because of some of those
05:14 - reasons and one of the main reasons for
05:15 - me i think it's just a lot of people
05:16 - don't seem to really trust
05:17 - cryptocurrency
05:18 - again they don't quite understand it is
05:20 - something that's pretty technologically
05:21 - difficult to understand on a deep level
05:23 - and i think until we get to that point
05:25 - where
05:25 - the general public really understands
05:27 - how this technology works and doesn't
05:29 - just see it as a quick way to make money
05:31 - uh we're going to be using fiat currency
05:33 - for a while so anyways that's kind of my
05:34 - first thoughts there
05:36 - but moving on to the investment
05:37 - perspective right so cryptocurrency is
05:39 - obviously a very exciting space to be in
05:41 - especially if you invested
05:42 - less than really six months ago right if
05:44 - you invested six months ago or before
05:46 - and you bought you know one of the top
05:47 - ten coins right now chances are you've
05:49 - already doubled tripled maybe even
05:50 - 5 to 10x your investment which is great
05:53 - but at the same time there's a ton of
05:55 - volatility so personally for me
05:56 - i am invested in cryptocurrency not very
05:59 - heavily i see this investment as
06:00 - something super high risk
06:02 - and all the money that i put in
06:03 - cryptocurrency i just imagine it
06:05 - completely disappears
06:06 - and my kind of strategy with
06:07 - cryptocurrency is buy a bunch
06:09 - and hold it until eventually one day i
06:11 - can retire with that cryptocurrency that
06:13 - is really the way that i see it
06:14 - uh it's either gonna go to zero or it's
06:16 - gonna be worth you know millions of
06:18 - dollars that's kind of
06:19 - what i think of when i think of my
06:20 - investment strategy with cryptocurrency
06:23 - that said without giving any financial
06:24 - advice i think it's a really good thing
06:26 - to have in your portfolio
06:28 - especially just a small amount right
06:30 - this isn't something where you want to
06:31 - go put all of your money into it
06:33 - uh personally for me i wouldn't put more
06:34 - than 10 of my net worth into
06:36 - cryptocurrency
06:37 - this is something that is just one of
06:39 - those high risk investments
06:40 - and hopefully if it doesn't do very well
06:42 - the rest of your maybe more conservative
06:44 - portfolio will make up for that
06:46 - at least that's my investment strategy
06:48 - now when it comes to day trading coins
06:49 - swing trading coins
06:50 - and doing all that kind of stuff that's
06:52 - great i know a bunch of people that make
06:54 - lots of money doing that but again it's
06:56 - just super risky i remember back in 2016
06:59 - 2017
07:00 - there was people that lost quite
07:01 - literally their homes because of you
07:03 - know cryptocurrency scams and flash
07:05 - crashes
07:06 - and there's just a lot of things that
07:07 - can go wrong in cryptocurrency and that
07:09 - you definitely need to be aware of
07:10 - before you kind of dive into the deep
07:12 - end and put everything
07:14 - in to that currency so that's kind of my
07:16 - perspective on that
07:17 - personally i actually much prefer
07:19 - investing in cryptocurrency in terms of
07:21 - the technology behind it
07:23 - so for example mining rigs i know a lot
07:25 - of people don't like miners right now
07:26 - because of gpu inflation and all of that
07:28 - but personally i do have a gpu mining
07:30 - rig for me that makes a lot more sense
07:32 - as a way to kind of directly invest in
07:34 - cryptocurrency
07:35 - because at least my money or my
07:37 - investment is kind of backed by a
07:38 - physical asset that at some point in
07:40 - time
07:40 - i could sell and you know i'm not just
07:42 - going to lose everything if the value of
07:44 - the currency immediately goes
07:46 - to zero so that's kind of my perspective
07:48 - on the investment side of it
07:49 - definitely something to be involved in
07:51 - definitely something i would be exposed
07:53 - to
07:53 - but not to the point where you're
07:55 - risking you know everything so the last
07:57 - angle i'm going to come from
07:58 - is kind of the developer angle so i'll
07:59 - be honest i really don't know much about
08:01 - developing on the blockchain what i do
08:03 - know though is that there's a ton of
08:04 - opportunities and a ton of potential to
08:06 - do so
08:07 - and actually personally i really want to
08:09 - get involved and
08:10 - kind of look into what it's like to
08:12 - actually make a cryptocurrency or make a
08:14 - smart contract or an nft or add on to a
08:16 - blockchain
08:17 - or whatever it may be and there'll
08:19 - probably be a tutorial series coming in
08:20 - the future where i do something like
08:22 - that so make sure you guys just
08:23 - subscribe stay tuned for that
08:24 - but i just think that if you're a
08:26 - developer this is something that's
08:27 - really really exciting regardless if you
08:29 - believe in cryptocurrency or not
08:30 - it just seems like there's a ton of
08:32 - really cool stuff that you can do with
08:33 - this technology
08:34 - and just with the general idea of
08:36 - decentralization
08:38 - and so anyways that's kind of my
08:39 - perspective as a developer i'm excited i
08:41 - want to see where this goes i want to
08:42 - try stuff out on this kind of new
08:44 - blockchain stack cryptocurrency area
08:47 - and kind of see what it is see what i
08:48 - can do and obviously what i can help you
08:50 - guys do if i decide to do a tutorial
08:52 - series
08:53 - and so the last thing i'll touch on here
08:54 - quickly is just this idea of
08:55 - decentralization
08:56 - so to me decentralization is the reason
08:59 - cryptocurrency is doing so well right
09:00 - now
09:01 - i feel like the pandemic has actually
09:02 - massively kind of accelerated the growth
09:05 - of cryptocurrency beyond what it would
09:06 - be at naturally and i think the reason
09:08 - for that at least in my perspective is
09:10 - that
09:10 - as the pandemic has happened a lot of
09:12 - people rightfully or not rightfully so
09:14 - i'm not here to argue that
09:15 - have growing distrust in their
09:17 - government in central organizations
09:19 - in banks in media and all of these other
09:22 - areas around the world
09:23 - and people feel safer using something
09:25 - that's not controlled
09:26 - by a very small group of people or a
09:29 - very small subset of organizations
09:31 - or whatever it may be and i know this is
09:33 - probably not as big of a deal for people
09:34 - that live in north america or live maybe
09:36 - in central europe or in places that
09:38 - just are kind of more fortunate to have
09:40 - a government in which they can trust and
09:41 - have a society in which
09:43 - they have a good amount of trust in that
09:45 - right they don't think they're going to
09:46 - get robbed they don't think
09:48 - that the currency is going to be
09:49 - hyperinflated all of these horrible
09:51 - things that happen
09:52 - all around the world but when i think of
09:54 - cryptocurrency i think of what it can do
09:56 - for kind of developing countries for
09:58 - people that aren't as fortunate as me
09:59 - people that don't have access to a bank
10:01 - people that can't just send money across
10:03 - the world to relatives
10:04 - people that really cannot trust a
10:06 - government organization
10:07 - above them that's where i see
10:09 - cryptocurrency really being a huge asset
10:11 - is to people that actually need to use
10:14 - this that genuinely
10:15 - cannot use the central authorities or
10:18 - cannot use the central banking
10:19 - institutions
10:20 - or don't feel comfortable using them in
10:22 - their country or wherever it is that
10:23 - they live
10:24 - so anyways i don't want to get into that
10:25 - too much i really have very little
10:27 - knowledge on that but when i think of
10:28 - cryptocurrency that's really the angle i
10:30 - take of it and that's why i see it
10:32 - continuing to succeed in continuing to
10:34 - grow is because i think a lot of people
10:36 - as they continue to distrust all these
10:38 - organizations more and more
10:39 - are going to be leaning more towards
10:41 - technologies and products and things in
10:43 - general
10:43 - general that are decentralized and that
10:45 - offer them some level of security
10:47 - where they feel like this is safe you
10:49 - know no government agency is going to be
10:51 - able to come in here and rob
10:52 - all of my money there's not going to be
10:53 - hyperinflation of the currency there's
10:55 - not going to be
10:56 - all of these horrible things crazy
10:58 - transaction fees to send this money or
11:00 - exchange it to a different currency for
11:01 - example so anyways that's where i'm
11:03 - going to leave this video off
11:04 - let me know if you guys agree with me if
11:05 - you disagree with me what you thought of
11:07 - my thoughts
11:08 - i might make a follow-up video and go
11:10 - into more depth on some more of these
11:11 - topics but if you guys want to hear more
11:13 - about cryptocurrency on this channel
11:14 - please do let me know
11:16 - if you're unaware about four years ago
11:17 - this entire channel literally was just
11:19 - cryptocurrency i still have some videos
11:21 - talking about you know how to mine
11:22 - ethereum how to get better hash rates on
11:24 - graphics cards all of that kind of stuff
11:26 - and so i love this stuff i like talking
11:28 - about it that's why i made this video if
11:29 - you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a
11:31 - like
11:31 - make sure you subscribe to the channel
11:32 - and i will see you in another youtube
11:35 - [Music]
11:40 - video
11:43 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to be giving you my thoughts on cryptocurrency now the first thing i will say is that nothing in this video is financial advice i'm not telling you to buy sell do anything with cryptocurrency this is strictly my perspective my thoughts there's a good chance that i may make some mistakes in this video i may have some statements that are slightly inaccurate and if that is the case please do correct me in the comments they are just honest mistakes and something that hopefully i can learn from anyways with that said in this video i'm just going to talk to you about cryptocurrency and what i think of it and i'm kind of going to come from three angles the first angle being is this practical does this make sense is this something that's actually going to be used for daytoday transactions are you going to be buying your next car in bitcoin then i'm going to give my perspective on it from an investment side so does this make sense as an investment something to add to your portfolio something that's going to make you money that's kind of the only thing i'm talking about in that section and then finally i'm going to talk about this in terms of a developer perspective so if you're someone who's writing code if you're someone who wants to get into the blockchain space but what does this mean for you at least in my opinion is this something good is this something bad so on and so forth so anyways with that said let's get into this video after a quick word from our sponsor before we get started i need to thank the sponsor of this video which is alco expert algo expert is the best platform to use for preparing for your software engineering coding interviews and has the highest quality coding interview practice questions with 155 practice questions detailed solutions and nine of the most popular programming languages a featurepacked browserbased coding environment extensive test suites and conceptual overviews and code walkthroughs for each and every problem algo expert is the best resource to use to ace your coding interviews aligoexpert also has a data structures crash course coding interview assessments and a mock interviews feature i can highly recommend algo expert as a former customer myself and now an official instructor on the platform get started using algo expert today by clicking the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform so i'm actually going to start by just giving you guys some context here i'm someone who's been super enthusiastic about cryptocurrency i'm actually the first person i know that was really into cryptocurrency back kind of at the beginning stages of it so i started getting into cryptocurrency in 2016 unfortunately i was only 16 at that point in time and so i didn't have boatloads of money to go you know buy a ton of bitcoin and ethereum at a thousand dollars a hundred dollars respectively and now be a millionaire today i think i made maybe a few thousand dollars off of my previous investments when i was quite young which is still great no complaints but just wanted to say that no i'm not a bitcoin millionaire or anything like that i'm just someone who was really passionate about that technology learned a lot about it i was building a mining rig at like 16 years old and anyways yeah i just have really liked cryptocurrency for a long time and it's awesome to see it kind of coming into the forefront now having media coverage having people that aren't technologically savvy using investing and understanding how cryptocurrency works and for me one of the most interesting things about cryptocurrency is not even just like the investment potential and the worldwide potential and all of that it's really just the technology behind it and kind of how that works and the idea of decentralization which i think is becoming more and more important as we go through the years so anyways that kind of leads me into the first thing i want to talk about with cryptocurrency which is is this practical does this make sense are you going to be buying your next house or car in cryptocurrency now i'm leaning towards no that's probably not going to happen i don't see especially in north america having cryptocurrency be the main you know worldwide or national

things that you definitely will be able to purchase with it but i think we are a long time away from seeing it being something that is actually going to be used as kind of a mainstream currency especially because now a lot of times when people get paid in cryptocurrency the first thing they do is sell it into fiat currency or the other way around right people will buy cryptocurrency with the

wanting to actually put their money into that and use that as their kind of daytoday thing right and same thing with companies i mean i guess like big props to elon musk and all of the other companies that are actually accepting bitcoin and cryptocurrency they are kind of leading the way but i think it's going to be a long time before we see you know all of the mainstream companies especially not tech companies in the world transitioning straight to cryptocurrency because of some of those reasons and one of the main reasons for me i think it's just a lot of people don't seem to really trust cryptocurrency again they don't quite understand it is something that's pretty technologically difficult to understand on a deep level and i think until we get to that point where the general public really understands how this technology works and doesn't just see it as a quick way to make money uh we're going to be using fiat currency for a while so anyways that's kind of my first thoughts there but moving on to the investment perspective right so cryptocurrency is obviously a very exciting space to be in especially if you invested less than really six months ago right if you invested six months ago or before and you bought you know one of the top ten coins right now chances are you've already doubled tripled maybe even 5 to 10x your investment which is great but at the same time there's a ton of volatility so personally for me i am invested in cryptocurrency not very heavily i see this investment as something super high risk and all the money that i put in cryptocurrency i just imagine it completely disappears and my kind of strategy with cryptocurrency is buy a bunch and hold it until eventually one day i can retire with that cryptocurrency that is really the way that i see it uh it's either gonna go to zero or it's gonna be worth you know millions of dollars that's kind of what i think of when i think of my investment strategy with cryptocurrency that said without giving any financial advice i think it's a really good thing to have in your portfolio especially just a small amount right this isn't something where you want to go put all of your money into it uh personally for me i wouldn't put more than 10 of my net worth into cryptocurrency this is something that is just one of those high risk investments and hopefully if it doesn't do very well the rest of your maybe more conservative portfolio will make up for that at least that's my investment strategy now when it comes to day trading coins swing trading coins and doing all that kind of stuff that's great i know a bunch of people that make lots of money doing that but again it's just super risky i remember back in 2016 2017 there was people that lost quite literally their homes because of you know cryptocurrency scams and flash crashes and there's just a lot of things that can go wrong in cryptocurrency and that you definitely need to be aware of before you kind of dive into the deep end and put everything in to that currency so that's kind of my perspective on that personally i actually much prefer investing in cryptocurrency in terms of the technology behind it so for example mining rigs i know a lot of people don't like miners right now because of gpu inflation and all of that but personally i do have a gpu mining rig for me that makes a lot more sense as a way to kind of directly invest in cryptocurrency because at least my money or my investment is kind of backed by a physical asset that at some point in time i could sell and you know i'm not just going to lose everything if the value of the currency immediately goes to zero so that's kind of my perspective on the investment side of it definitely something to be involved in definitely something i would be exposed to but not to the point where you're risking you know everything so the last angle i'm going to come from is kind of the developer angle so i'll be honest i really don't know much about developing on the blockchain what i do know though is that there's a ton of opportunities and a ton of potential to do so and actually personally i really want to get involved and kind of look into what it's like to actually make a cryptocurrency or make a smart contract or an nft or add on to a blockchain or whatever it may be and there'll probably be a tutorial series coming in the future where i do something like that so make sure you guys just subscribe stay tuned for that but i just think that if you're a developer this is something that's really really exciting regardless if you believe in cryptocurrency or not it just seems like there's a ton of really cool stuff that you can do with this technology and just with the general idea of decentralization and so anyways that's kind of my perspective as a developer i'm excited i want to see where this goes i want to try stuff out on this kind of new blockchain stack cryptocurrency area and kind of see what it is see what i can do and obviously what i can help you guys do if i decide to do a tutorial series and so the last thing i'll touch on here quickly is just this idea of decentralization so to me decentralization is the reason cryptocurrency is doing so well right now i feel like the pandemic has actually massively kind of accelerated the growth of cryptocurrency beyond what it would be at naturally and i think the reason for that at least in my perspective is that as the pandemic has happened a lot of people rightfully or not rightfully so i'm not here to argue that have growing distrust in their government in central organizations in banks in media and all of these other areas around the world and people feel safer using something that's not controlled by a very small group of people or a very small subset of organizations or whatever it may be and i know this is probably not as big of a deal for people that live in north america or live maybe in central europe or in places that just are kind of more fortunate to have a government in which they can trust and have a society in which they have a good amount of trust in that right they don't think they're going to get robbed they don't think that the currency is going to be hyperinflated all of these horrible things that happen all around the world but when i think of cryptocurrency i think of what it can do for kind of developing countries for people that aren't as fortunate as me people that don't have access to a bank people that can't just send money across the world to relatives people that really cannot trust a government organization above them that's where i see cryptocurrency really being a huge asset is to people that actually need to use this that genuinely cannot use the central authorities or cannot use the central banking institutions or don't feel comfortable using them in their country or wherever it is that they live so anyways i don't want to get into that too much i really have very little knowledge on that but when i think of cryptocurrency that's really the angle i take of it and that's why i see it continuing to succeed in continuing to grow is because i think a lot of people as they continue to distrust all these organizations more and more are going to be leaning more towards technologies and products and things in general general that are decentralized and that offer them some level of security where they feel like this is safe you know no government agency is going to be able to come in here and rob all of my money there's not going to be hyperinflation of the currency there's not going to be all of these horrible things crazy transaction fees to send this money or exchange it to a different currency for example so anyways that's where i'm going to leave this video off let me know if you guys agree with me if you disagree with me what you thought of my thoughts i might make a followup video and go into more depth on some more of these topics but if you guys want to hear more about cryptocurrency on this channel please do let me know if you're unaware about four years ago this entire channel literally was just cryptocurrency i still have some videos talking about you know how to mine ethereum how to get better hash rates on graphics cards all of that kind of stuff and so i love this stuff i like talking about it that's why i made this video if you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a like make sure you subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another youtube video you
