00:02 - [Music]
00:05 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:08 - today's video what I'm gonna be doing is
00:10 - teaching github fundamentals so
00:12 - essentially everything you need to know
00:14 - to be effectively using github and all
00:16 - of the common commands that you'll use
00:18 - 99% of the time I will note that getting
00:21 - github are extremely complicated tools
00:23 - when you get to the advanced level
00:25 - there's a lot of things that you can do
00:27 - and there is like thousands of commands
00:29 - and variations of commands that you can
00:31 - use within git and github of course I'm
00:34 - not gonna be showing you all those these
00:35 - are kind of things if you need to use
00:37 - them you're gonna look up and use them
00:38 - once in a blue moon the stuff I'm gonna
00:41 - be showing you here is what I can almost
00:42 - guarantee you you'll use literally 99%
00:45 - of the time so with that being said what
00:47 - I'm gonna do in this video is really
00:48 - focused on actually trying to teach you
00:50 - how get and github work I don't want you
00:53 - to just memorize the commands I want you
00:55 - to actually understand what those
00:56 - commands are doing so that if something
00:58 - goes wrong or you need to figure out
01:00 - what command to use you actually have
01:02 - some idea of what's happening on a lower
01:04 - level so with that being said I'm gonna
01:06 - hop over to the kind of blackboard here
01:08 - where I'm just gonna do some drawings
01:09 - and illustrations talk about first the
01:12 - difference between git and github then
01:13 - we'll talk about the workflow of github
01:15 - we'll talk about branches and then we'll
01:18 - actually get into all of the different
01:19 - commands and that will probably be near
01:21 - the second half of this video so I'm
01:23 - here on the blackboard and the first
01:24 - thing that I want to discuss is the
01:26 - difference between git and github so a
01:29 - lot of people seem to think the getting
01:31 - github are one in the same that they're
01:33 - the exact same thing that is not true
01:35 - these are actually different things they
01:37 - obviously integrate very well with each
01:39 - other and they're very similar and what
01:41 - they actually do but they are two
01:43 - separate things and I think it's
01:44 - important to understand the difference
01:45 - and github is really just a website I
01:48 - like to think of it as kind of like a
01:50 - nice add-on or extension to get and what
01:53 - github does is it gives us a nice UI and
01:55 - gives us some features that git doesn't
01:56 - have and it lets us host remote
01:58 - repositories and work collaboratively
02:00 - with a lot of other people now what git
02:03 - does is this is actually what handles
02:05 - all the version control stuff so when
02:07 - you're doing something like merging code
02:08 - together or when you're doing something
02:10 - like making a commit or making a change
02:12 - or pulling or push
02:13 - you're using get get is the version
02:15 - control version control software this is
02:18 - what we're really gonna be learning how
02:19 - git works github is kind of just like a
02:22 - layer on top of git that gives us a
02:24 - bunch of commands it gives us a bunch of
02:26 - UI features it has a fancy website and
02:29 - it has a bunch of other things that get
02:30 - just doesn't have so these are two
02:32 - separate things please do not confuse
02:34 - the fact that they are the same and I
02:36 - want to make it clear that we can use
02:37 - git without even having to touch github
02:40 - because github is not required it's not
02:42 - a dependency of get it is just something
02:44 - that we use on top of git and there's
02:46 - lots of other tools that go on top of
02:48 - git as well so with that being said
02:50 - let's actually get now into kind of the
02:52 - workflow when we use a github repository
02:54 - and let's actually discuss what I mean
02:57 - when I say the word repository so let's
03:00 - go here so to kind of explain what I
03:02 - mean by repository and so through the
03:05 - differences of what we call a local and
03:07 - a remote repository which i think is the
03:08 - first important thing to understand I
03:10 - want to consider an example where we
03:12 - have a team of four developers let's say
03:14 - we have four people and they're working
03:16 - on some kind of game
03:17 - well what these people probably want to
03:20 - do is they're all gonna have their own
03:22 - machines they're all gonna be coding and
03:23 - they want to kind of sync up with each
03:25 - other right when one person finishes a
03:27 - feature or they make some changes they
03:28 - want to send it to the other person when
03:30 - the other person has some changes they
03:31 - want to send it to them and they want
03:33 - some kind of system that keeps track of
03:34 - those changes and that means that you
03:37 - know everything goes fine so essentially
03:39 - we're not sending zip folders to each
03:40 - other we actually have some kind of
03:43 - automated system like yet that is
03:45 - controlling this version control stuff
03:47 - for us so let's say we have our four
03:49 - developers what I'm gonna do is I'm
03:51 - gonna draw four boxes down here in the
03:54 - corner of my screen and these will be my
03:56 - developers now here we're gonna draw a
03:59 - big circle and this is what I'm gonna
04:00 - call my remote repository so a
04:03 - repository is really just a store it is
04:06 - a place where we have a bunch of code
04:08 - and it can be a remote or it can be
04:09 - local a local repository is something
04:12 - that sits on your machine so it sits on
04:14 - your end in front of you other people
04:16 - don't see it it's your version of the
04:18 - code that is a local repository so each
04:21 - of these four developers have their own
04:22 - local repository on their machine so
04:25 - let's say we started out in development
04:26 - and
04:27 - just started there's a little bit of
04:28 - code that already exists the first thing
04:30 - that all these developers would do is
04:31 - they'd look at the remote repository
04:33 - which is going to be kind of our source
04:35 - of truth this is going to be the place
04:37 - that really has all of the up-to-date
04:40 - code this is where all of the changes go
04:42 - to this is where it starts from this is
04:45 - where we have the most recent version
04:46 - the version that's working that's what
04:48 - we think of when we think of a remote
04:50 - repository this is the place that all
04:52 - four of these developers kind of trust
04:54 - that has the most up-to-date version and
04:55 - they'll be making changes to this place
04:58 - and they'll be asking for new changes
05:00 - and that is what the remote repository
05:01 - does so essentially these four
05:03 - developers have four local repositories
05:06 - on their computer they are some kind of
05:07 - version based off of this remote
05:09 - repository
05:10 - they'll make changes on their local
05:12 - version and then they will push those
05:14 - changes to the remote repository and
05:16 - when someone else makes some changes
05:17 - they will pull those changes down so
05:20 - this is the basic workflow right we have
05:21 - this remote repository when we start out
05:23 - all of these developers kind of take a
05:25 - copy of this repository so they'll say
05:28 - okay let's copy it onto our local
05:30 - machine so let's say at the very
05:32 - beginning at time zero all of these
05:34 - developers have the same copy of this
05:37 - remote repository now let's say you know
05:39 - developer one starts working on a new
05:41 - feature
05:41 - well his code base immediately locally
05:43 - is gonna look different than developer
05:45 - two and it's gonna look different than
05:46 - the remote repository right that's just
05:49 - how it works so let's say developer 1
05:51 - makes some changes on his local machine
05:52 - he test them out they look good and what
05:55 - he does is he says okay let me push
05:57 - these changes to the remote repository I
05:59 - want my other teammates to see them I
06:01 - want to check it in I want to make sure
06:03 - everything's good so he pushes those
06:04 - changes to the remote repository now the
06:08 - next day he says to developer - hey I
06:10 - made some changes pull those down from
06:12 - the remote repository what he does is he
06:15 - asks the remote repository hey give me
06:17 - any new changes and then it compares the
06:19 - remote repository with his local
06:21 - repository and changes anything that
06:23 - changed so it gives him all of these new
06:26 - changes maybe a new file was added maybe
06:28 - some files change lines whatever that's
06:30 - what get does for us it pretty much
06:32 - handles the interaction between changes
06:35 - and making changes right like that's all
06:38 - its really doing it's when changes
06:39 - happen
06:40 - handles that for us and the nice thing
06:42 - with git is that since it is a very
06:44 - complex tool it can do things like
06:47 - automatically merge code together like
06:49 - let's say you and I have worked on the
06:50 - same file but we changed different parts
06:52 - of those files
06:53 - well git can actually figure out what's
06:55 - happened in those two files and then
06:57 - automatically merge those changes
06:59 - together such that there's no conflict
07:01 - now sometimes there is but that's beside
07:03 - the point this is kind of the basic
07:05 - workflow of git and that's what I wanted
07:07 - to cover here all right so the next
07:09 - thing I want to talk about is get
07:11 - history and branches now this is really
07:14 - important and if you can understand this
07:16 - part here you're pretty much gonna be
07:17 - good to understand like 99% of github or
07:21 - the stuff that you're actually gonna
07:22 - have to use all github really does for
07:25 - us is track a history of what we call
07:27 - commits now a commit is simply a change
07:30 - that you've made now that's not
07:33 - necessarily like you change one line of
07:35 - code I wouldn't call that a commits what
07:37 - a commit is is essentially you make a
07:39 - bunch of changes on your local machine
07:40 - and then you commit those changes so you
07:43 - say hey I want to save all these changes
07:45 - I want to bundle them up into their own
07:47 - little package and I want to store the
07:49 - fact that I changed all of this stuff at
07:51 - this point in time that's what a commit
07:53 - is essentially like a checkpoint a way
07:55 - to return back to a previous point if
07:57 - something goes wrong so not every single
08:00 - time we save the file are you making a
08:02 - commit you have to actually manually
08:04 - make a commit so let's say I add on like
08:06 - a new feature or I have a bug fix I
08:08 - would commit that so that that way say I
08:11 - messed something up in the future in the
08:13 - codebase I can always come back to that
08:14 - commit and say hey at this point in time
08:17 - this was working this was functioning
08:20 - that's the point of a commit and it
08:22 - stores a bunch of data with it who made
08:24 - the commit what time the commit happened
08:26 - at who changed what files you know when
08:29 - they were changed within each file it
08:30 - stores a ton of different information
08:32 - and that information is really valuable
08:33 - when we start talking about branches and
08:36 - kind of a timeline in github so we have
08:39 - all of these commits and commits are
08:40 - just changes what you do is on your
08:42 - local machine so in your local
08:44 - repository here you know you make a
08:46 - bunch of changes you do whatever you're
08:47 - doing and then you commit those changes
08:49 - locally so inside your local version of
08:52 - the repository you commit those
08:53 - Changez once you've made all of your
08:55 - commits so you can make multiple commits
08:57 - it doesn't make as many as you want you
08:58 - know just checkpoints you're just saving
09:00 - whenever you want to essentially you
09:02 - will take those commits and you will
09:04 - push them up to the remote repository so
09:06 - this is your local repository and this
09:08 - would be the remote repository now the
09:11 - remote repository will have a look at
09:13 - all of these commits and it will attempt
09:15 - to bring all of those commits and push
09:17 - them into the branch of the remote
09:20 - repository so I haven't talked about
09:22 - branches yet so I'm trying not to say
09:23 - that word but essentially just imagine
09:25 - it takes these commits and it somehow
09:27 - kind of merges them with the existing
09:29 - code base and adds them into that that's
09:31 - what happened it happens when you push
09:32 - commits up now let's say that you're on
09:35 - a local repository and you know it's
09:37 - been a few days since you've updated
09:38 - your repository the remote repository
09:41 - has changed people have made some
09:42 - changes well what do you need to do you
09:44 - need to get those changes so what you do
09:46 - is you do what's known as a pull so you
09:48 - pull all of the changes down from the
09:50 - remote repository so let's just say the
09:52 - remotes up here pretend this one's gone
09:54 - you pull all these down and then what it
09:57 - does is it gives you all of the new
09:59 - commits that have happened since you
10:01 - last pulled down these changes now you
10:04 - have all these commits coming from the
10:05 - remote repository and you merge them
10:07 - into your local repository so you take
10:10 - them and you combine them with the work
10:11 - you currently have and that is kind of
10:13 - how this system works with a bunch of
10:15 - commits now what github does for us is
10:18 - it tracks all of these commits so let me
10:20 - attempt to erase all this let's get rid
10:23 - of that as well so in github we have
10:25 - these things called branches and the
10:27 - first branch I want to discuss is what's
10:28 - known as the master branch now we have
10:31 - all these commits these are all our
10:32 - checkpoints all our kind of saves and we
10:35 - push commits up and we pull commits down
10:37 - now the remote repository and even your
10:39 - local repository as well keeps track of
10:41 - all of these commits and everything that
10:43 - happens to the repository so if at any
10:45 - point in time something goes wrong I can
10:47 - always roll back to a previous commit or
10:49 - I can just look at all of the history
10:51 - and what's happened in this code base
10:53 - which is very valuable so all of these
10:55 - dots that I'm gonna put here are commits
10:57 - and imagine this being a time line we're
11:00 - back here is in the past previous
11:02 - commits and right here so at the very
11:04 - end of the time line is what the current
11:06 - code base looks like
11:07 - and it's the most recent commit so what
11:09 - stores all of these commits kind of on
11:11 - this timeline maybe they all happen from
11:13 - different people maybe they're all the
11:14 - same person whatever there's all these
11:16 - commits these are all the changes that
11:17 - happen now this is on what we call the
11:20 - master branch so the main branch of our
11:23 - repository is really just what we think
11:27 - of when we think of the code base we
11:28 - have a branch and a branch is just one
11:31 - version of this codebase essentially and
11:34 - it's hard to describe until I show you
11:35 - what another branch looks like but just
11:37 - imagine that the core code base that
11:39 - you're looking at is pretty much always
11:41 - going to be the master branch
11:43 - now this master branch is what we want
11:45 - to make sure is always working think of
11:47 - if we're working on a large project I
11:49 - don't want to modify this master branch
11:51 - with some code that's broken or not
11:54 - working right because if another
11:55 - developer pulls it down now all of a
11:57 - sudden their local repositories messed
11:59 - up because you've made a change to the
12:00 - master branch they pull down the master
12:02 - branch and now they're all you know
12:04 - they're all messed up on their end
12:06 - because you made a bad change the master
12:08 - branch so instead of always making
12:10 - changes to the master branch so instead
12:12 - of always putting these bubbles so these
12:13 - commits right on to here sometimes what
12:16 - we use is what's known as another branch
12:18 - and what a branch essentially is is a
12:21 - copy of a repository at a certain point
12:23 - in time that has different changes so
12:26 - let's do this
12:27 - so another branch could look something
12:29 - like this so maybe this branch
12:31 - I'm gonna call feature are like a new
12:33 - feature so when you ever you have a new
12:35 - branch you give it a name you can call
12:37 - it whatever you want and the point of
12:38 - this branch is to essentially be able to
12:41 - work on a new feature push it up to the
12:43 - remote repository without actually
12:44 - directly putting it into the master
12:47 - branch so if I make a new branch maybe I
12:50 - branched off starting at this point
12:52 - right here so I branched off at this
12:54 - point in time at this commit now this
12:56 - branch has whatever the repository had
12:58 - up until this point right so everything
13:00 - behind it it has all of those changes
13:03 - and you've branched off and now these
13:05 - dots here are your changes on this
13:08 - branch so you are just making different
13:10 - changes on this branch so that you are
13:12 - not affecting the master branch until
13:15 - you're sure that this branch is fully
13:17 - functioning because imagine say you and
13:19 - for
13:19 - other developers are working on a new
13:21 - feature you're not done yet you haven't
13:23 - finished up you need to work on it
13:24 - together
13:25 - well you might make a new branch off the
13:27 - master branch so that you don't affect
13:29 - the master branch of code the stuff that
13:31 - everyone else sees and then as soon as
13:33 - this branch you're satisfied that it's
13:36 - actually working that everything is good
13:38 - what you do is you merge it with the
13:40 - master branch so you take all of these
13:43 - commits here and you say okay I want to
13:45 - merge those into the master branch and
13:48 - then get does its magic which I won't
13:50 - really discuss and it takes all of these
13:52 - commit messages and aligns them onto
13:55 - this master branch in the order that
13:56 - they should go and makes all of the
13:58 - appropriate changes that is essentially
14:00 - what happens when you have what's known
14:01 - as a branch and again you branch off
14:04 - because what you want to do is make sure
14:06 - that you're not modifying the master
14:08 - branch until you're sure what you're
14:10 - doing is working and functioning and of
14:12 - course on this branch here on this
14:14 - feature branch you can still update this
14:17 - branch from the master branch what you
14:19 - can do is you can say hey give me all
14:21 - the most recent updates from the master
14:22 - branch throw them on here so that this
14:24 - one is staying up to date with the
14:25 - master branch but it has some new
14:27 - changes that aren't yet in the master
14:29 - branch that is what another branch is
14:31 - kind of meant to do and you can even
14:34 - branch off from branches so when you get
14:36 - into really complicated projects maybe
14:38 - you have like another feature you're
14:40 - working on on top of a feature well you
14:43 - could branch off from another branch
14:44 - merge it on to this branch so merge like
14:47 - that and then merge all of this on to
14:49 - the master branch I know okay so this
14:52 - was a long explanation of branches of
14:55 - git of github but I think we've gone
14:56 - through a lot of theory most of the
14:58 - theory we kind of need to understand and
15:00 - now it's gonna be really easy to get
15:02 - into the commands and start actually
15:03 - doing some examples so with that being
15:05 - said let's head over now to come to the
15:07 - terminal and actually github and let's
15:09 - set up a repository let's go through
15:11 - some examples and let's learn what these
15:13 - different commands do all right so I'm
15:15 - on github here and I actually just
15:16 - wanted to show you an example of a large
15:18 - repository and what it kind of looks
15:20 - like in terms of branches and commits
15:22 - before we get into the commands so this
15:24 - is actually the repository I work on at
15:26 - work so I work at Microsoft this is an
15:28 - open source repository this is the
15:30 - extension for vs code so python
15:33 - four vs code and I just wanted to show
15:35 - you that if you're looking on github
15:37 - this is github the website not yet you
15:39 - can see that right here this repository
15:41 - has 4,500 commits and 22 branches so if
15:45 - I click on commits I gotta accept this
15:48 - let's let's see if this go through here
15:50 - okay so I'm in commits now and you can
15:52 - see that this is what I'm talking about
15:53 - I say branch master and here you can see
15:56 - all of the commits that's that have
15:58 - happened that have been pushed into this
16:00 - branch so it shows you on what day all
16:02 - of these commits happened and then you
16:04 - can click on a commit let me just click
16:06 - on one here and let's just have a look
16:08 - at what this is you can see the things
16:10 - that have changed in all of the
16:12 - different files and what actually
16:13 - happened in this commit so that's why
16:16 - it's really valuable to have these
16:17 - different branches and to have these
16:19 - commits because you can look back at the
16:21 - history of anything that's happened in
16:22 - their repository now if you go to
16:24 - branches you can see there's a bunch of
16:27 - branches here that people have been
16:28 - working on and these are branches that
16:30 - are off of the master branch right so
16:33 - let me click on my branches and you can
16:34 - see that I haven't pushed any branches
16:36 - of the repository but if I go to maybe
16:38 - active branches let's see how many
16:40 - active branches we have we have all
16:42 - these branches that are currently active
16:44 - that people are working on so that is
16:46 - what I mean by branches and commits and
16:48 - now I want to get us started with our
16:50 - first github repository so the first
16:52 - thing that we need to do is actually
16:54 - download and install the tool called git
16:56 - now this is gonna be the same on Mac and
16:59 - Windows all of the commands that I show
17:00 - you but you need to go and download
17:02 - install git I'm gonna assume most of you
17:04 - have this so I won't go through the
17:05 - steps but I will leave a link in the
17:07 - description that has the link to
17:09 - download and install git once you have
17:11 - that what we're gonna do is we're gonna
17:13 - start by making a local repository on
17:15 - our machine and experiment with how all
17:17 - of those things work and then we'll talk
17:19 - about remote repositories so let me
17:21 - actually change directories to my
17:23 - desktop if I could make it there so I'm
17:27 - on my command line CD stands for change
17:29 - directory this is a common tool you're
17:31 - gonna see me use some command line tools
17:33 - here I'll explain what they do but these
17:35 - should be the same on Mac and Windows
17:37 - and Linux as well so don't worry about
17:39 - that but get into your terminal so open
17:41 - a terminal open a command prompt and
17:42 - then go to your desktop or go to some
17:44 - location where you're okay to make a new
17:46 - folder and
17:47 - m'kay dirt and the name of your folder
17:49 - which in this case I'm gonna call test
17:51 - underscore repo so this is gonna be my
17:53 - test repository this is what I want to
17:55 - just kind of experiment with so I'm
17:57 - gonna make a new folder on my desktop
17:58 - that's what mkdir stands for make
18:01 - directory called test repo next I'm
18:03 - gonna see B into my test repo like that
18:06 - and now what I'm going to do is
18:08 - initialize a new git repository so
18:11 - there's many different ways to kind of
18:12 - start up and you get repository the most
18:15 - common way if you're working on a brand
18:16 - new project and you're starting it on
18:18 - your local machine is that type gets an
18:20 - it so let's say that you're about to
18:23 - start working on something you know you
18:24 - haven't worked on it yet and you're just
18:26 - booting up the repository it doesn't
18:28 - already exist what you do is you type
18:30 - get an it and that will make whatever
18:32 - folder you're inside of a github
18:34 - repository so keep in mind you can do
18:37 - this anywhere but as soon as you
18:39 - initialize a folder as a github
18:40 - repository anything inside of that now
18:43 - is going to be tracked by git and what
18:45 - that means is that you can add files you
18:47 - can use all your git commands within
18:49 - this folder but only if you've
18:52 - initialized a git repository so here let
18:54 - me just type git commit and you'll see
18:56 - that um this works everything's fine but
18:59 - if I actually CD back so I CD back to my
19:02 - desktop and I type the same thing so
19:04 - let's go get commit that it says fatal
19:06 - not a git repository so just make sure
19:08 - that you're actually in a git repository
19:10 - before you start doing all of these git
19:13 - commands okay so I've made a git
19:16 - repository and what I'm gonna do now is
19:17 - I'm gonna open this up in subline text
19:19 - so I'm going to file open folder test
19:22 - repos right there awesome and now I'm
19:24 - just gonna make a new fold make a new
19:26 - file server so file new file let's just
19:30 - name this readme MD and let's save that
19:33 - inside of test repo and let's just make
19:36 - a this is a markdown file let me just do
19:38 - pound hi so that's just like a header
19:40 - I've just made in a markdown file great
19:43 - so I have that now and I've made a
19:44 - change to this repository so let's
19:46 - imagine you know I added my code I'm in
19:48 - the repository I've made a new change
19:50 - the first thing I need to do if I want
19:52 - to commit or kind of like store this
19:54 - change so I want to make that checkpoint
19:56 - is they need to add all of the files
19:58 - that I want to actually
20:00 - commit so this is where we talk about
20:02 - something called a staging area so
20:04 - inside of gets what we have is a staging
20:07 - area this is where we're temporarily
20:09 - adding or removing files that we want to
20:12 - be in our next commit so let's say I
20:14 - added that final write and I believe I
20:16 - called that test or something what I
20:18 - would do if I want to add this to my
20:20 - next commit I'm not committing yet but I
20:22 - want to add it in and it's a temporary
20:24 - area called the staging area as I type
20:26 - get add and then the name of the file
20:28 - which in this case is readme MD so let's
20:32 - do that we see that nothing goes wrong
20:34 - everything happens fine and now if we
20:35 - want to check what we actually just did
20:37 - we type git status now you can see that
20:40 - it says we're on the master branch which
20:42 - is by default just our core branch we
20:44 - don't need to make that or anything
20:45 - it says no commits yet and it says
20:47 - changes to be committed it says we made
20:49 - a new file called readme MD so that is
20:52 - because I added this readme file to the
20:55 - staging area that I typed get status to
20:57 - look at what was happening in the
20:59 - staging area okay so I had a small error
21:01 - there but anyways do we now have this
21:03 - file inside of the staging area so we've
21:05 - added this in and now what this means is
21:08 - that it is ready to be committed so I
21:10 - can go ahead and add more files into
21:12 - here in the staging area and when I'm
21:14 - ready when I've made the changes that
21:15 - I've want I can go ahead and commit now
21:18 - usually you commit once you've made some
21:20 - kind of progress once you have something
21:21 - that's kind of working or maybe you're
21:23 - like in the middle of something and you
21:24 - want to store it at that point that's
21:26 - when you make a commit
21:27 - you're not really doing it like every
21:29 - 5-10 minutes you might do it like every
21:30 - few files you change or every like you
21:33 - know kind of milestone you hit when
21:35 - you're programming if you want to put it
21:37 - that way but anyways once we have that
21:39 - staged what you can do is type git
21:41 - commit - M which stands for message and
21:45 - then inside of quotation marks you put
21:48 - what's known as the commit message now
21:50 - the commit message to be something
21:51 - that's under fifty characters long and
21:53 - accurately describes what you changed in
21:56 - this commit so in this case what I did
21:58 - was I added readme dot MD that's what I
22:02 - did in this commit I made it a new I
22:03 - made a new breed me file so I'm gonna
22:04 - type git commit - M added readme MD now
22:08 - look what happens it says master root
22:11 - commit this is actually the commit ID it
22:13 - says
22:14 - Rini thought md1 file changed one
22:17 - insertions and create mode something
22:19 - readme MD so now we have just committed
22:23 - that file and we've made a change now if
22:26 - I actually type git status to look at
22:28 - our staging area we see on branch master
22:30 - nothing to commit working tree is clean
22:33 - and that is as easy as it is to make a
22:36 - change to a git repository you add your
22:39 - files you make a commit and there you go
22:41 - you've now stored that and you've saved
22:43 - that commit now what we can do is look
22:47 - at some other ways to add files and to
22:49 - make commits so let me go here now and
22:51 - once actually make a change to this file
22:53 - so let me just add another one that says
22:56 - hello let me save that file it's
22:57 - important that I save it and let's go
22:59 - back here and now let's type git status
23:02 - and now when I type git status we can
23:05 - see changes not staged for commit so
23:07 - this is telling me what I've made the
23:09 - changes that I made that have not yet
23:10 - been staged that I haven't added and it
23:13 - says okay we modified readme MD and then
23:16 - it says okay use git add file to update
23:18 - what will be committed use git checkout
23:20 - to discard changes in the working
23:22 - directory so we don't want to do that
23:24 - what we actually want to do is we want
23:26 - you add this file we want to stage it
23:28 - and we want to make another commit so
23:30 - what I can do is I can type git add in
23:32 - the name of that file or what I can do
23:35 - is actually type git add period and what
23:37 - this stands for is add all files so add
23:41 - everything that I've in the repository
23:43 - that's what this stands for just add it
23:45 - to the commit so when you do dot that
23:47 - literally means just add everything so
23:49 - I'm gonna do get add dot that's gonna
23:52 - automatically add this file now i can
23:54 - type git status and i can see that it
23:56 - says boom this is green we've put this
23:58 - it's changes ready to be committed and
24:00 - now we can go ahead and do another
24:02 - commit so get commit - a.m. and we'll
24:06 - say sorry not an as she's gonna be m
24:08 - made changes you know this is not very
24:11 - descriptive usually you want to be more
24:13 - descriptive but that's okay we're just
24:14 - gonna say made changes and now boom we
24:17 - have our new commit made changes one
24:18 - file change three insertions one
24:21 - deletion awesome next thing I'm going to
24:23 - show you is branches so let's say that
24:26 - at this point in time
24:27 - what I want to do is actually want to
24:29 - make a new branch and I want to start
24:30 - working on something and not modifying
24:32 - my master branch keep in mind all of
24:34 - this is happening locally so I have my
24:36 - master branch of code we're just going
24:38 - to imagine that this is for one user
24:40 - just ourself because this is a local
24:42 - repository and I really don't want to
24:44 - mess up the master branch I don't want
24:45 - to make any changes on there I want to
24:47 - make them on another branch and then
24:48 - maybe later on I'll merge that with the
24:50 - master branch well what I can do is make
24:54 - a new branch so I can say git checkout -
24:57 - B I believe is actually the command and
25:00 - then the name of the new branch that I
25:02 - actually want to check out - so git
25:04 - checkout is how you changed between
25:06 - branches when you do - B I believe that
25:09 - stands for make a new branch and now you
25:11 - can put the name of your branch so what
25:13 - I'm gonna do here is just call this
25:15 - branch new so get checkout - beet knew
25:17 - what this did now is to switch to a new
25:20 - branch new so now what I've done is I've
25:23 - gone from my master branch and I've
25:24 - branched off so I've copied everything
25:27 - in my master branch onto this branch new
25:29 - and now any changes I make on my new
25:31 - branch are not gonna happen on the
25:33 - master branch
25:33 - so let's actually split these screens
25:36 - and let's look at this so let's go here
25:39 - and say new branch insider readme MD and
25:42 - let's now on our new branch new make a
25:46 - new commit so let's say get aa dot let's
25:50 - add those changes let's say git commit -
25:53 - M and let's make this first commit on
25:55 - new branch boom let's make that commit
25:59 - and now let's change back to the master
26:02 - branch and see if the master branch
26:04 - changed because remember I just made
26:05 - these changes on the new branch so to
26:08 - change branches what you do is you type
26:10 - git checkout and then the name of the
26:14 - branch so if I want to go to the master
26:16 - branch I type master since I'm already
26:18 - on the new branch I can't change to it
26:21 - right but let's do this
26:22 - get checkout master and now look at this
26:26 - did you see the file it automatically
26:27 - removed that change because I had made
26:30 - it on the other branch so now we have
26:32 - two branches one branch which is a head
26:35 - of the master branch because it has new
26:36 - changes and the master branch which has
26:38 - our original changes right so let's
26:40 - actually add a new file
26:41 - here let's just do this test dot py and
26:45 - let's just say like imports hi game or
26:48 - something like that okay now let's make
26:50 - a commit so let's go get Ad dot so let's
26:53 - add all these files let's type git
26:55 - status we have our new file test stop hi
26:58 - let's do git commit - M added test dot
27:03 - PI boom inserted that awesome now let's
27:07 - change over to our new branch so let's
27:09 - say git checkouts new now I'm on this
27:13 - new branch and give us a second you
27:15 - notice that inside of this folder so
27:17 - let's get rid of that we have the change
27:20 - that we made previously on that branch
27:21 - and we don't have the new file that was
27:23 - on the master branch so let's say that
27:25 - what I actually want to do is I want to
27:27 - update this branch with what's on the
27:29 - master branch so a change happened on
27:31 - the master branch which is a new file
27:32 - was created and I actually want to get
27:34 - that change and bring that to my new
27:36 - branch how do I actually go ahead and do
27:38 - that well when we're working in this
27:40 - kind of system what I can do is actually
27:42 - merge the master branch with my branch
27:45 - so I can actually type git merge and
27:48 - then type master and what this will do
27:50 - is take all of the changes from the
27:51 - master branch and merge them with my
27:53 - branch so let's do this
27:55 - git merge master merge made by the
27:57 - recursive strategy and now look we're on
28:00 - our new branch here and we have this
28:02 - test file we have our readme file that
28:04 - still has this change here and now we're
28:07 - looking pretty similar to the master
28:08 - branch except we have this line of code
28:10 - now let's change branches again let's
28:13 - say git checkout master and watch you're
28:17 - gonna see that this new branch on line
28:19 - five here will disappear and there you
28:21 - go it's gone so we have these two files
28:23 - now but that line is gone this is kind
28:26 - of the power of git and that is how the
28:28 - two branches work you check out make a
28:31 - new one with the - be in the git
28:33 - checkout command and then you can make
28:35 - commits you can change and you can merge
28:37 - these things together now that hopefully
28:39 - you have a basic understanding of some
28:41 - git commands let's look at setting up a
28:44 - remote repository and get all of this
28:46 - working now in the cloud rather than
28:48 - just on our local machine so what I'm
28:50 - gonna do is go over to github and I'm
28:52 - gonna make a new repository so you need
28:54 - to make an account
28:55 - signing on github I'm going to assume
28:57 - you guys can figure that out now I'm
28:58 - gonna go to the plus sign and I'm gonna
29:00 - click new repository so let's do this
29:02 - and what I'm just trying to set up here
29:04 - is a remote repository something that
29:06 - other people can look at that's not
29:08 - local on my machine I'm gonna call this
29:10 - one a test repository I'm gonna call
29:13 - this test underscore because test is
29:15 - already taken I'm gonna make this a
29:17 - public repository I'm not gonna give any
29:19 - description and I'm not going to
29:21 - initialize this with a readme file you
29:24 - can if you want but for this step I
29:25 - would recommend you don't because I'm
29:27 - gonna show you how we can link our local
29:29 - repository with this remote repository
29:31 - and push what we currently have up so
29:34 - let's go ahead and click create new
29:35 - repository let's give it a chance here
29:38 - and here it goes it says quick setup if
29:40 - you've done this kind of thing before we
29:42 - haven't so what we're actually gonna do
29:44 - is follow the commands that are right
29:46 - here essentially what this is saying is
29:48 - we made a new repository but we haven't
29:50 - initialized it yet so we haven't
29:52 - actually set anything up what we need to
29:54 - do is we need to actually push some
29:56 - changes to this repository first to have
29:59 - it actually be set up remotely so what
30:01 - it's saying to do here is essentially
30:03 - what we've already done it says make a
30:04 - new repository on our machine add a new
30:07 - file make a commit and then we need to
30:10 - follow these two steps so what I'm gonna
30:12 - do is copy this line of code
30:14 - you guys are need to gonna need to copy
30:16 - this as well so git remote add origin
30:18 - and then this line right here so make
30:21 - sure you copy this and at least make
30:24 - sure you have this URL to your remote
30:25 - repository because you're gonna need
30:27 - that so let's go to our command line now
30:29 - let's actually put this on the side and
30:31 - let's type in that line by just
30:34 - right-clicking so if you copy something
30:35 - and you're in terminal you can right
30:37 - click on your mouse and it should paste
30:39 - it in and then go ahead and hit enter
30:41 - what this has just done is added what's
30:44 - known as a remote now a remote is
30:46 - essentially a URL to another repository
30:49 - so what we've done is we've said hey I
30:51 - want to add this remote repository as
30:53 - kind of a link as something that we know
30:56 - of here in our local repository so that
30:59 - we can actually push changes to it and
31:01 - pull changes from so that's what we've
31:03 - done when we say git remote add origin
31:07 - I said I'm adding a new
31:08 - remote that's called origin that has
31:11 - this URL so now when we use the word
31:14 - origin we'll be referencing this URL
31:17 - that's all we're doing we're literally
31:18 - mapping the word origin to this URL when
31:21 - we type git remote app you can add as
31:23 - many remotes as you want some people
31:26 - will commonly call this also like
31:27 - upstream so you can have an Origin which
31:30 - is typically your remote repository
31:33 - because you can work on more than one
31:35 - remote repository and then maybe like
31:37 - the company's remote repository will be
31:40 - your upstream repository or something
31:41 - like that anyways so we have that let me
31:44 - just clear the screen here and now I'm
31:46 - going to show you how we push changes to
31:48 - this repository so it shows us here that
31:50 - the command is get push - you origin
31:53 - master so the first thing I want to do
31:55 - is make sure that I'm on the right
31:56 - branch so I want to check out usually
31:59 - you wouldn't have more branches before
32:00 - you do this but I want to check out to
32:02 - the master branch so get check out
32:03 - master see we're already on the master
32:05 - branch but it's important we're there
32:07 - and then what we're gonna type is git
32:09 - push - you forage in master what this is
32:14 - saying is let's push all of our commits
32:16 - to the origin remote repository and
32:19 - let's push them to the branch master so
32:22 - we're picking where and what branch we
32:25 - want to push these two because we can
32:27 - push to another branch as well which
32:28 - I'll show you in a second
32:29 - - you says save these settings what that
32:33 - means is that next time we do this all
32:35 - we have to type is git push and it will
32:38 - automatically remember that it was
32:39 - origin and master that we pushed you so
32:41 - let's hit enter and let's see what
32:43 - happens here enumerated objects counting
32:46 - objects and boom there we go branch
32:48 - master set up on track remote branch
32:51 - master from origin so now if I go ahead
32:54 - and refresh this here let's have a look
32:56 - and says readme dot MD test up high and
32:59 - you can see that we look at a readme and
33:01 - we have these changes now on github so
33:03 - if you had any problems pushing there I
33:05 - probably know why I think I approach
33:07 - this at the beginning of the video but I
33:09 - kind of forgot so I'm gonna bring it in
33:10 - here what we need to do before we can
33:12 - actually work with the remote repository
33:14 - and the reason it worked for me is
33:15 - because I've already done this is set up
33:17 - a username and an email so don't worry
33:19 - if that push didn't work just follow
33:21 - along with what I'm about to show
33:22 - you this may not work either this gets a
33:25 - little bit tricky because you do need to
33:26 - authenticate yourself locally on your
33:28 - machine before you can just push and
33:30 - pull from any remote repository right so
33:33 - what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna
33:35 - start by saying git config - - global
33:39 - user dot name and let me make this
33:42 - fullscreen actually so you guys can't
33:44 - see it and what I'm gonna do is put in
33:45 - quotation marks the name that I want to
33:47 - be represented by in this remote
33:49 - repository so on your local repository
33:51 - it doesn't matter but on the remote
33:53 - repository other people will see this
33:55 - potentially so you want to have some
33:56 - name that identifies you so I'm gonna
33:58 - put Tim as my user dot name so there we
34:01 - go now I've set up my global name so now
34:04 - this is stored on github locally and
34:06 - anytime I make a change to a remote
34:08 - repository I push or I pull or whatever
34:10 - I'm gonna be identified by the name of
34:13 - Tim now the next thing I want to do is
34:15 - use email so I want to say git config -
34:18 - - global user dot email and in here I'm
34:20 - gonna put the email that I use on github
34:23 - now this should hopefully authenticate
34:25 - you you might not you might have to
34:27 - actually use I might have to it might
34:29 - ask you to sign into github there's a
34:30 - bunch of different things that could
34:31 - happen here I don't remember how you
34:33 - authenticate locally to be able to push
34:35 - to be honest so you might have to look
34:37 - up how to do that there is something
34:39 - called a personal access token which you
34:41 - can use as well if you're on Windows at
34:42 - least but anyways let's put in our email
34:45 - so I am just gonna put a random email
34:47 - because I'm already authenticated so
34:48 - this is fine and I'm gonna put Tim at
34:50 - gmail.com actually I'm not gonna save
34:52 - that cuz I have another email that I
34:54 - don't want to share with you but anyways
34:56 - just put your email and hit enter and
34:58 - once you've done that you will have
34:59 - configured your name and your email on
35:02 - git so now you can try to push again and
35:05 - see if that works it may ask you for
35:07 - your password for github it might ask
35:09 - you to login if that doesn't happen
35:11 - unfortunately you're probably gonna have
35:13 - to go to the internet and figure out how
35:14 - to authenticate but let's say that now
35:16 - you guys are authenticated and you were
35:18 - able to push to this remote repository
35:20 - if you were able to do that what we need
35:22 - to do is move on to the next step which
35:24 - is understanding how to pull from the
35:26 - remote repository so I'm in my
35:27 - repository now I've pushed my changes up
35:30 - and I'm
35:30 - actually gonna make a change on this
35:32 - remote repository so let's go here and
35:34 - let me actually go to the edit button
35:35 - and I'm just gonna make a change that's
35:37 - hopefully gonna simulate what someone
35:39 - else might change on a remote repository
35:40 - so let's just move it so that the readme
35:43 - only has hello now and you can see that
35:45 - I can commit my changes right from
35:47 - github I'll just say updated readme
35:49 - commit changes all right so I've
35:51 - committed that now let's go back to test
35:53 - and we see that we've made a change and
35:55 - that just happened now let's go back to
35:58 - our command line and now let's figure
36:00 - out how we can actually get this change
36:01 - from the remote repository well the way
36:04 - to do that is to use what's known as a
36:06 - pull so I'm gonna say git pull origin
36:09 - master what I'm stating is what I want
36:13 - to pull so what I want to do where I
36:15 - want to pull from and what branch I want
36:17 - to take in this case I want to pull the
36:19 - from the origin which is the remote that
36:21 - we set up and I want to pull the master
36:23 - branch so let's go and hit enter and it
36:26 - says mm and boom go ahead and we have
36:29 - those changes so that happened
36:32 - everything worked and now if I go back
36:33 - to my sub line text you can see that
36:35 - Hello is the most recent change because
36:38 - that's what we modify now let's do this
36:40 - let's make a change here I'm gonna add
36:43 - hi and I'm gonna actually go ahead to
36:45 - this repository here and I'm gonna make
36:47 - a change on here as well I'm gonna put
36:49 - hello and I'm going to delete actually
36:55 - let's see here I'm gonna add hi I'm
36:59 - gonna add hi again on line four I'm
37:02 - trying to find a way that I can make
37:03 - this conflict so let's do this okay so
37:05 - I'm gonna commit this change here on
37:07 - this repository and now what I'm gonna
37:09 - do is we're gonna add my change here so
37:11 - I'm going to say get add cuz I made a
37:13 - change
37:13 - I say get commit - M change and now what
37:18 - I want to do is want to pull from this
37:20 - remote repository actually what I want
37:22 - to do is push to this remote repository
37:24 - so I've made some changes here I want to
37:26 - push them up to this repository but
37:28 - notice and oops let's go back here that
37:30 - I made a change to this remote
37:32 - repository that I don't currently have
37:34 - on my local machine so I change this
37:37 - just to be high and I don't have that on
37:39 - this local machine so watch what happens
37:41 - when I try to push this
37:43 - to the remote repository so get push and
37:46 - you see that says failed to push some
37:48 - refs too and then that origin updates
37:51 - were rejected because the remote
37:52 - contains work that you do not have so
37:55 - what what I need to do and what this is
37:57 - saying to me is hey there's changes on
37:59 - the remote repository that you don't
38:00 - have yet you need to pull those down
38:02 - before I'm gonna let you push your
38:04 - changes up that's what it's saying so if
38:06 - you get a message like this what you
38:08 - need to do is just get pull first so I'm
38:10 - gonna say git pull origin master and now
38:13 - look what it said and said ok boom we're
38:16 - gonna go ahead and we are going to pull
38:19 - all of these changes down now look what
38:21 - it says here
38:21 - automatic merge failed fix conflicts and
38:24 - then commit the result so what this is
38:26 - telling me is that hey we pulled some
38:28 - changes down but when we pulled those
38:30 - changes we had a conflict in readme dot
38:33 - MD the reason we had a conflict is
38:36 - because we changed two of the same lines
38:38 - and git doesn't know what to keep so on
38:41 - this remote repository I change the same
38:44 - line that I changed on this repository
38:46 - and this local machine right so now if
38:49 - we actually go ahead and look in here we
38:50 - can see that this is showing me there's
38:52 - a merge conflict so when you go ahead
38:54 - and you actually do a like you try to
38:58 - pull it down and there's a merge so we
39:00 - can't automatically sorry there's a
39:02 - conflict it can't automatically merge
39:04 - the code what you need to do is manually
39:06 - tell git what this code should look like
39:08 - so here what this is showing you is that
39:11 - hey there was a merge and there's merge
39:13 - conflict you need to fix this so what
39:15 - you have to do is delete all these
39:17 - arrows delete all this stuff and just
39:19 - make this file look how you want it to
39:21 - actually look so I'm gonna change it to
39:23 - look like this I'm gonna save it and I'm
39:25 - gonna resolve this merge conflict it
39:27 - can't automatically merge it so I need
39:29 - to manually come in and make the fixes
39:31 - which I've done and now what I will do
39:33 - is I will go ahead and I will actually
39:36 - commit this change so git commit - M
39:39 - change okay so I realize that what I've
39:41 - forgotten to do is just add the new
39:43 - change that I wanted to make so pretty
39:44 - much what happens is when you have a
39:46 - merge conflict what you need to do is
39:48 - fix the file so resolve the conflict you
39:51 - need to add those changes and then you
39:53 - need to commit those changes and then
39:55 - you should be good so we're gonna say
39:56 - gits
39:57 - ah dots we're gonna say get commit - em
40:01 - change boom we made the change that's
40:04 - known as our merge commit so we
40:06 - committed the merge conflict that we
40:08 - fixed and now I can go ahead and say get
40:11 - push so if I do this now you can see
40:13 - that I'm totally fine to push up to the
40:15 - remote repository because I pulled I got
40:17 - the most recent changes I fix the merge
40:19 - conflict and then I pushed back up to
40:22 - the remote repository and I made the
40:24 - change that I wanted to make that is
40:27 - kind of what happens and actually
40:29 - happens quite often is you get a merge
40:30 - conflict and hopefully you have some
40:32 - kind of software tool in this case I
40:33 - have sub line text that was able to help
40:35 - me a little bit in fixing that but all
40:37 - you have to do is go into the file that
40:39 - had the conflict sometimes will be
40:41 - multiple files fix the conflict add that
40:44 - file back in commit the change and then
40:46 - you can push again and pull again and
40:48 - everything should be working and
40:49 - functioning now the last thing I'll show
40:52 - you is pushing another branch and then
40:54 - after that I think we've pretty much
40:55 - covered everything we need to do so I'm
40:57 - gonna say git checkout and we're gonna
40:59 - go to the new branch and now what I'm
41:01 - gonna do is just push this branch up to
41:02 - the remote repository so I'm literally
41:04 - just gonna say git push and now I'm
41:06 - going to say origin for where I want to
41:08 - push it to and new so I need to specify
41:11 - that I want to push this here as the
41:13 - branch new to the new remote repository
41:16 - so I'm gonna go ahead and do that and
41:17 - now we will push this branch up to the
41:20 - remote repository so if we come here you
41:23 - can see that it says hey you've pushed a
41:25 - new branch called new and it says do you
41:27 - want to compare and make a pull request
41:28 - why it's saying this is because it knows
41:31 - that what we commonly use branches for
41:33 - is actually merging them with the master
41:36 - branch once they're ready and once
41:37 - they're good so let me refresh this here
41:39 - you notice it says two branches if I
41:42 - click we can see the new branch updated
41:44 - 17 minutes ago and let's click on it and
41:46 - go new pull request now it says you
41:48 - can't automatically merge because
41:51 - there's conflicting changes well let me
41:54 - go here and make this a girafft pull
41:56 - request so I'm just gonna submit it here
41:58 - just do this just to show you something
42:00 - and I'm gonna go to files change and you
42:02 - can see what it's showing me here this
42:04 - is what I added and this is what I
42:06 - removed from the previous file so that
42:09 - is how this works
42:10 - and this is kind of the basis of merging
42:13 - things into master is you make what's
42:15 - known as a pull request by having a new
42:17 - branch and then you compare that to the
42:19 - master branch and you merge them kind of
42:21 - squash them together so with that I
42:24 - think I've covered pretty much
42:26 - everything I can for github fundamentals
42:29 - I do apologize if this video is slightly
42:31 - confusing I'm trying my best here to
42:33 - explain everything sometimes it's hard
42:35 - to think back to the point where I've
42:36 - never used github before cuz I've been
42:37 - using it for a very long time but
42:40 - hopefully that at least gave you a good
42:42 - enough introduction that you kind of
42:44 - understand what's happening in github
42:45 - now maybe some of the commands you need
42:47 - to go look up again but now you have
42:49 - like a good foundation you kind of
42:51 - understand what a commit is what pushing
42:52 - is what pulling is what a merge conflict
42:54 - is how to make new branches all of the
42:56 - stuff that I cover so anyways if you
42:58 - guys enjoyed this video please do leave
43:00 - a like subscribe to the channel and of
43:02 - course I will see you in another YouTube
43:04 - video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so in today's video what I'm gonna be doing is teaching github fundamentals so essentially everything you need to know to be effectively using github and all of the common commands that you'll use 99% of the time I will note that getting github are extremely complicated tools when you get to the advanced level there's a lot of things that you can do and there is like thousands of commands and variations of commands that you can use within git and github of course I'm not gonna be showing you all those these are kind of things if you need to use them you're gonna look up and use them once in a blue moon the stuff I'm gonna be showing you here is what I can almost guarantee you you'll use literally 99% of the time so with that being said what I'm gonna do in this video is really focused on actually trying to teach you how get and github work I don't want you to just memorize the commands I want you to actually understand what those commands are doing so that if something goes wrong or you need to figure out what command to use you actually have some idea of what's happening on a lower level so with that being said I'm gonna hop over to the kind of blackboard here where I'm just gonna do some drawings and illustrations talk about first the difference between git and github then we'll talk about the workflow of github we'll talk about branches and then we'll actually get into all of the different commands and that will probably be near the second half of this video so I'm here on the blackboard and the first thing that I want to discuss is the difference between git and github so a lot of people seem to think the getting github are one in the same that they're the exact same thing that is not true these are actually different things they obviously integrate very well with each other and they're very similar and what they actually do but they are two separate things and I think it's important to understand the difference and github is really just a website I like to think of it as kind of like a nice addon or extension to get and what github does is it gives us a nice UI and gives us some features that git doesn't have and it lets us host remote repositories and work collaboratively with a lot of other people now what git does is this is actually what handles all the version control stuff so when you're doing something like merging code together or when you're doing something like making a commit or making a change or pulling or push you're using get get is the version control version control software this is what we're really gonna be learning how git works github is kind of just like a layer on top of git that gives us a bunch of commands it gives us a bunch of UI features it has a fancy website and it has a bunch of other things that get just doesn't have so these are two separate things please do not confuse the fact that they are the same and I want to make it clear that we can use git without even having to touch github because github is not required it's not a dependency of get it is just something that we use on top of git and there's lots of other tools that go on top of git as well so with that being said let's actually get now into kind of the workflow when we use a github repository and let's actually discuss what I mean when I say the word repository so let's go here so to kind of explain what I mean by repository and so through the differences of what we call a local and a remote repository which i think is the first important thing to understand I want to consider an example where we have a team of four developers let's say we have four people and they're working on some kind of game well what these people probably want to do is they're all gonna have their own machines they're all gonna be coding and they want to kind of sync up with each other right when one person finishes a feature or they make some changes they want to send it to the other person when the other person has some changes they want to send it to them and they want some kind of system that keeps track of those changes and that means that you know everything goes fine so essentially we're not sending zip folders to each other we actually have some kind of automated system like yet that is controlling this version control stuff for us so let's say we have our four developers what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna draw four boxes down here in the corner of my screen and these will be my developers now here we're gonna draw a big circle and this is what I'm gonna call my remote repository so a repository is really just a store it is a place where we have a bunch of code and it can be a remote or it can be local a local repository is something that sits on your machine so it sits on your end in front of you other people don't see it it's your version of the code that is a local repository so each of these four developers have their own local repository on their machine so let's say we started out in development and just started there's a little bit of code that already exists the first thing that all these developers would do is they'd look at the remote repository which is going to be kind of our source of truth this is going to be the place that really has all of the uptodate code this is where all of the changes go to this is where it starts from this is where we have the most recent version the version that's working that's what we think of when we think of a remote repository this is the place that all four of these developers kind of trust that has the most uptodate version and they'll be making changes to this place and they'll be asking for new changes and that is what the remote repository does so essentially these four developers have four local repositories on their computer they are some kind of version based off of this remote repository they'll make changes on their local version and then they will push those changes to the remote repository and when someone else makes some changes they will pull those changes down so this is the basic workflow right we have this remote repository when we start out all of these developers kind of take a copy of this repository so they'll say okay let's copy it onto our local machine so let's say at the very beginning at time zero all of these developers have the same copy of this remote repository now let's say you know developer one starts working on a new feature well his code base immediately locally is gonna look different than developer two and it's gonna look different than the remote repository right that's just how it works so let's say developer 1 makes some changes on his local machine he test them out they look good and what he does is he says okay let me push these changes to the remote repository I want my other teammates to see them I want to check it in I want to make sure everything's good so he pushes those changes to the remote repository now the next day he says to developer hey I made some changes pull those down from the remote repository what he does is he asks the remote repository hey give me any new changes and then it compares the remote repository with his local repository and changes anything that changed so it gives him all of these new changes maybe a new file was added maybe some files change lines whatever that's what get does for us it pretty much handles the interaction between changes and making changes right like that's all its really doing it's when changes happen handles that for us and the nice thing with git is that since it is a very complex tool it can do things like automatically merge code together like let's say you and I have worked on the same file but we changed different parts of those files well git can actually figure out what's happened in those two files and then automatically merge those changes together such that there's no conflict now sometimes there is but that's beside the point this is kind of the basic workflow of git and that's what I wanted to cover here all right so the next thing I want to talk about is get history and branches now this is really important and if you can understand this part here you're pretty much gonna be good to understand like 99% of github or the stuff that you're actually gonna have to use all github really does for us is track a history of what we call commits now a commit is simply a change that you've made now that's not necessarily like you change one line of code I wouldn't call that a commits what a commit is is essentially you make a bunch of changes on your local machine and then you commit those changes so you say hey I want to save all these changes I want to bundle them up into their own little package and I want to store the fact that I changed all of this stuff at this point in time that's what a commit is essentially like a checkpoint a way to return back to a previous point if something goes wrong so not every single time we save the file are you making a commit you have to actually manually make a commit so let's say I add on like a new feature or I have a bug fix I would commit that so that that way say I messed something up in the future in the codebase I can always come back to that commit and say hey at this point in time this was working this was functioning that's the point of a commit and it stores a bunch of data with it who made the commit what time the commit happened at who changed what files you know when they were changed within each file it stores a ton of different information and that information is really valuable when we start talking about branches and kind of a timeline in github so we have all of these commits and commits are just changes what you do is on your local machine so in your local repository here you know you make a bunch of changes you do whatever you're doing and then you commit those changes locally so inside your local version of the repository you commit those Changez once you've made all of your commits so you can make multiple commits it doesn't make as many as you want you know just checkpoints you're just saving whenever you want to essentially you will take those commits and you will push them up to the remote repository so this is your local repository and this would be the remote repository now the remote repository will have a look at all of these commits and it will attempt to bring all of those commits and push them into the branch of the remote repository so I haven't talked about branches yet so I'm trying not to say that word but essentially just imagine it takes these commits and it somehow kind of merges them with the existing code base and adds them into that that's what happened it happens when you push commits up now let's say that you're on a local repository and you know it's been a few days since you've updated your repository the remote repository has changed people have made some changes well what do you need to do you need to get those changes so what you do is you do what's known as a pull so you pull all of the changes down from the remote repository so let's just say the remotes up here pretend this one's gone you pull all these down and then what it does is it gives you all of the new commits that have happened since you last pulled down these changes now you have all these commits coming from the remote repository and you merge them into your local repository so you take them and you combine them with the work you currently have and that is kind of how this system works with a bunch of commits now what github does for us is it tracks all of these commits so let me attempt to erase all this let's get rid of that as well so in github we have these things called branches and the first branch I want to discuss is what's known as the master branch now we have all these commits these are all our checkpoints all our kind of saves and we push commits up and we pull commits down now the remote repository and even your local repository as well keeps track of all of these commits and everything that happens to the repository so if at any point in time something goes wrong I can always roll back to a previous commit or I can just look at all of the history and what's happened in this code base which is very valuable so all of these dots that I'm gonna put here are commits and imagine this being a time line we're back here is in the past previous commits and right here so at the very end of the time line is what the current code base looks like and it's the most recent commit so what stores all of these commits kind of on this timeline maybe they all happen from different people maybe they're all the same person whatever there's all these commits these are all the changes that happen now this is on what we call the master branch so the main branch of our repository is really just what we think of when we think of the code base we have a branch and a branch is just one version of this codebase essentially and it's hard to describe until I show you what another branch looks like but just imagine that the core code base that you're looking at is pretty much always going to be the master branch now this master branch is what we want to make sure is always working think of if we're working on a large project I don't want to modify this master branch with some code that's broken or not working right because if another developer pulls it down now all of a sudden their local repositories messed up because you've made a change to the master branch they pull down the master branch and now they're all you know they're all messed up on their end because you made a bad change the master branch so instead of always making changes to the master branch so instead of always putting these bubbles so these commits right on to here sometimes what we use is what's known as another branch and what a branch essentially is is a copy of a repository at a certain point in time that has different changes so let's do this so another branch could look something like this so maybe this branch I'm gonna call feature are like a new feature so when you ever you have a new branch you give it a name you can call it whatever you want and the point of this branch is to essentially be able to work on a new feature push it up to the remote repository without actually directly putting it into the master branch so if I make a new branch maybe I branched off starting at this point right here so I branched off at this point in time at this commit now this branch has whatever the repository had up until this point right so everything behind it it has all of those changes and you've branched off and now these dots here are your changes on this branch so you are just making different changes on this branch so that you are not affecting the master branch until you're sure that this branch is fully functioning because imagine say you and for other developers are working on a new feature you're not done yet you haven't finished up you need to work on it together well you might make a new branch off the master branch so that you don't affect the master branch of code the stuff that everyone else sees and then as soon as this branch you're satisfied that it's actually working that everything is good what you do is you merge it with the master branch so you take all of these commits here and you say okay I want to merge those into the master branch and then get does its magic which I won't really discuss and it takes all of these commit messages and aligns them onto this master branch in the order that they should go and makes all of the appropriate changes that is essentially what happens when you have what's known as a branch and again you branch off because what you want to do is make sure that you're not modifying the master branch until you're sure what you're doing is working and functioning and of course on this branch here on this feature branch you can still update this branch from the master branch what you can do is you can say hey give me all the most recent updates from the master branch throw them on here so that this one is staying up to date with the master branch but it has some new changes that aren't yet in the master branch that is what another branch is kind of meant to do and you can even branch off from branches so when you get into really complicated projects maybe you have like another feature you're working on on top of a feature well you could branch off from another branch merge it on to this branch so merge like that and then merge all of this on to the master branch I know okay so this was a long explanation of branches of git of github but I think we've gone through a lot of theory most of the theory we kind of need to understand and now it's gonna be really easy to get into the commands and start actually doing some examples so with that being said let's head over now to come to the terminal and actually github and let's set up a repository let's go through some examples and let's learn what these different commands do all right so I'm on github here and I actually just wanted to show you an example of a large repository and what it kind of looks like in terms of branches and commits before we get into the commands so this is actually the repository I work on at work so I work at Microsoft this is an open source repository this is the extension for vs code so python four vs code and I just wanted to show you that if you're looking on github this is github the website not yet you can see that right here this repository has 4,500 commits and 22 branches so if I click on commits I gotta accept this let's let's see if this go through here okay so I'm in commits now and you can see that this is what I'm talking about I say branch master and here you can see all of the commits that's that have happened that have been pushed into this branch so it shows you on what day all of these commits happened and then you can click on a commit let me just click on one here and let's just have a look at what this is you can see the things that have changed in all of the different files and what actually happened in this commit so that's why it's really valuable to have these different branches and to have these commits because you can look back at the history of anything that's happened in their repository now if you go to branches you can see there's a bunch of branches here that people have been working on and these are branches that are off of the master branch right so let me click on my branches and you can see that I haven't pushed any branches of the repository but if I go to maybe active branches let's see how many active branches we have we have all these branches that are currently active that people are working on so that is what I mean by branches and commits and now I want to get us started with our first github repository so the first thing that we need to do is actually download and install the tool called git now this is gonna be the same on Mac and Windows all of the commands that I show you but you need to go and download install git I'm gonna assume most of you have this so I won't go through the steps but I will leave a link in the description that has the link to download and install git once you have that what we're gonna do is we're gonna start by making a local repository on our machine and experiment with how all of those things work and then we'll talk about remote repositories so let me actually change directories to my desktop if I could make it there so I'm on my command line CD stands for change directory this is a common tool you're gonna see me use some command line tools here I'll explain what they do but these should be the same on Mac and Windows and Linux as well so don't worry about that but get into your terminal so open a terminal open a command prompt and then go to your desktop or go to some location where you're okay to make a new folder and m'kay dirt and the name of your folder which in this case I'm gonna call test underscore repo so this is gonna be my test repository this is what I want to just kind of experiment with so I'm gonna make a new folder on my desktop that's what mkdir stands for make directory called test repo next I'm gonna see B into my test repo like that and now what I'm going to do is initialize a new git repository so there's many different ways to kind of start up and you get repository the most common way if you're working on a brand new project and you're starting it on your local machine is that type gets an it so let's say that you're about to start working on something you know you haven't worked on it yet and you're just booting up the repository it doesn't already exist what you do is you type get an it and that will make whatever folder you're inside of a github repository so keep in mind you can do this anywhere but as soon as you initialize a folder as a github repository anything inside of that now is going to be tracked by git and what that means is that you can add files you can use all your git commands within this folder but only if you've initialized a git repository so here let me just type git commit and you'll see that um this works everything's fine but if I actually CD back so I CD back to my desktop and I type the same thing so let's go get commit that it says fatal not a git repository so just make sure that you're actually in a git repository before you start doing all of these git commands okay so I've made a git repository and what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna open this up in subline text so I'm going to file open folder test repos right there awesome and now I'm just gonna make a new fold make a new file server so file new file let's just name this readme MD and let's save that inside of test repo and let's just make a this is a markdown file let me just do pound hi so that's just like a header I've just made in a markdown file great so I have that now and I've made a change to this repository so let's imagine you know I added my code I'm in the repository I've made a new change the first thing I need to do if I want to commit or kind of like store this change so I want to make that checkpoint is they need to add all of the files that I want to actually commit so this is where we talk about something called a staging area so inside of gets what we have is a staging area this is where we're temporarily adding or removing files that we want to be in our next commit so let's say I added that final write and I believe I called that test or something what I would do if I want to add this to my next commit I'm not committing yet but I want to add it in and it's a temporary area called the staging area as I type get add and then the name of the file which in this case is readme MD so let's do that we see that nothing goes wrong everything happens fine and now if we want to check what we actually just did we type git status now you can see that it says we're on the master branch which is by default just our core branch we don't need to make that or anything it says no commits yet and it says changes to be committed it says we made a new file called readme MD so that is because I added this readme file to the staging area that I typed get status to look at what was happening in the staging area okay so I had a small error there but anyways do we now have this file inside of the staging area so we've added this in and now what this means is that it is ready to be committed so I can go ahead and add more files into here in the staging area and when I'm ready when I've made the changes that I've want I can go ahead and commit now usually you commit once you've made some kind of progress once you have something that's kind of working or maybe you're like in the middle of something and you want to store it at that point that's when you make a commit you're not really doing it like every 510 minutes you might do it like every few files you change or every like you know kind of milestone you hit when you're programming if you want to put it that way but anyways once we have that staged what you can do is type git commit M which stands for message and then inside of quotation marks you put what's known as the commit message now the commit message to be something that's under fifty characters long and accurately describes what you changed in this commit so in this case what I did was I added readme dot MD that's what I did in this commit I made it a new I made a new breed me file so I'm gonna type git commit M added readme MD now look what happens it says master root commit this is actually the commit ID it says Rini thought md1 file changed one insertions and create mode something readme MD so now we have just committed that file and we've made a change now if I actually type git status to look at our staging area we see on branch master nothing to commit working tree is clean and that is as easy as it is to make a change to a git repository you add your files you make a commit and there you go you've now stored that and you've saved that commit now what we can do is look at some other ways to add files and to make commits so let me go here now and once actually make a change to this file so let me just add another one that says hello let me save that file it's important that I save it and let's go back here and now let's type git status and now when I type git status we can see changes not staged for commit so this is telling me what I've made the changes that I made that have not yet been staged that I haven't added and it says okay we modified readme MD and then it says okay use git add file to update what will be committed use git checkout to discard changes in the working directory so we don't want to do that what we actually want to do is we want you add this file we want to stage it and we want to make another commit so what I can do is I can type git add in the name of that file or what I can do is actually type git add period and what this stands for is add all files so add everything that I've in the repository that's what this stands for just add it to the commit so when you do dot that literally means just add everything so I'm gonna do get add dot that's gonna automatically add this file now i can type git status and i can see that it says boom this is green we've put this it's changes ready to be committed and now we can go ahead and do another commit so get commit a.m. and we'll say sorry not an as she's gonna be m made changes you know this is not very descriptive usually you want to be more descriptive but that's okay we're just gonna say made changes and now boom we have our new commit made changes one file change three insertions one deletion awesome next thing I'm going to show you is branches so let's say that at this point in time what I want to do is actually want to make a new branch and I want to start working on something and not modifying my master branch keep in mind all of this is happening locally so I have my master branch of code we're just going to imagine that this is for one user just ourself because this is a local repository and I really don't want to mess up the master branch I don't want to make any changes on there I want to make them on another branch and then maybe later on I'll merge that with the master branch well what I can do is make a new branch so I can say git checkout B I believe is actually the command and then the name of the new branch that I actually want to check out so git checkout is how you changed between branches when you do B I believe that stands for make a new branch and now you can put the name of your branch so what I'm gonna do here is just call this branch new so get checkout beet knew what this did now is to switch to a new branch new so now what I've done is I've gone from my master branch and I've branched off so I've copied everything in my master branch onto this branch new and now any changes I make on my new branch are not gonna happen on the master branch so let's actually split these screens and let's look at this so let's go here and say new branch insider readme MD and let's now on our new branch new make a new commit so let's say get aa dot let's add those changes let's say git commit M and let's make this first commit on new branch boom let's make that commit and now let's change back to the master branch and see if the master branch changed because remember I just made these changes on the new branch so to change branches what you do is you type git checkout and then the name of the branch so if I want to go to the master branch I type master since I'm already on the new branch I can't change to it right but let's do this get checkout master and now look at this did you see the file it automatically removed that change because I had made it on the other branch so now we have two branches one branch which is a head of the master branch because it has new changes and the master branch which has our original changes right so let's actually add a new file here let's just do this test dot py and let's just say like imports hi game or something like that okay now let's make a commit so let's go get Ad dot so let's add all these files let's type git status we have our new file test stop hi let's do git commit M added test dot PI boom inserted that awesome now let's change over to our new branch so let's say git checkouts new now I'm on this new branch and give us a second you notice that inside of this folder so let's get rid of that we have the change that we made previously on that branch and we don't have the new file that was on the master branch so let's say that what I actually want to do is I want to update this branch with what's on the master branch so a change happened on the master branch which is a new file was created and I actually want to get that change and bring that to my new branch how do I actually go ahead and do that well when we're working in this kind of system what I can do is actually merge the master branch with my branch so I can actually type git merge and then type master and what this will do is take all of the changes from the master branch and merge them with my branch so let's do this git merge master merge made by the recursive strategy and now look we're on our new branch here and we have this test file we have our readme file that still has this change here and now we're looking pretty similar to the master branch except we have this line of code now let's change branches again let's say git checkout master and watch you're gonna see that this new branch on line five here will disappear and there you go it's gone so we have these two files now but that line is gone this is kind of the power of git and that is how the two branches work you check out make a new one with the be in the git checkout command and then you can make commits you can change and you can merge these things together now that hopefully you have a basic understanding of some git commands let's look at setting up a remote repository and get all of this working now in the cloud rather than just on our local machine so what I'm gonna do is go over to github and I'm gonna make a new repository so you need to make an account signing on github I'm going to assume you guys can figure that out now I'm gonna go to the plus sign and I'm gonna click new repository so let's do this and what I'm just trying to set up here is a remote repository something that other people can look at that's not local on my machine I'm gonna call this one a test repository I'm gonna call this test underscore because test is already taken I'm gonna make this a public repository I'm not gonna give any description and I'm not going to initialize this with a readme file you can if you want but for this step I would recommend you don't because I'm gonna show you how we can link our local repository with this remote repository and push what we currently have up so let's go ahead and click create new repository let's give it a chance here and here it goes it says quick setup if you've done this kind of thing before we haven't so what we're actually gonna do is follow the commands that are right here essentially what this is saying is we made a new repository but we haven't initialized it yet so we haven't actually set anything up what we need to do is we need to actually push some changes to this repository first to have it actually be set up remotely so what it's saying to do here is essentially what we've already done it says make a new repository on our machine add a new file make a commit and then we need to follow these two steps so what I'm gonna do is copy this line of code you guys are need to gonna need to copy this as well so git remote add origin and then this line right here so make sure you copy this and at least make sure you have this URL to your remote repository because you're gonna need that so let's go to our command line now let's actually put this on the side and let's type in that line by just rightclicking so if you copy something and you're in terminal you can right click on your mouse and it should paste it in and then go ahead and hit enter what this has just done is added what's known as a remote now a remote is essentially a URL to another repository so what we've done is we've said hey I want to add this remote repository as kind of a link as something that we know of here in our local repository so that we can actually push changes to it and pull changes from so that's what we've done when we say git remote add origin I said I'm adding a new remote that's called origin that has this URL so now when we use the word origin we'll be referencing this URL that's all we're doing we're literally mapping the word origin to this URL when we type git remote app you can add as many remotes as you want some people will commonly call this also like upstream so you can have an Origin which is typically your remote repository because you can work on more than one remote repository and then maybe like the company's remote repository will be your upstream repository or something like that anyways so we have that let me just clear the screen here and now I'm going to show you how we push changes to this repository so it shows us here that the command is get push you origin master so the first thing I want to do is make sure that I'm on the right branch so I want to check out usually you wouldn't have more branches before you do this but I want to check out to the master branch so get check out master see we're already on the master branch but it's important we're there and then what we're gonna type is git push you forage in master what this is saying is let's push all of our commits to the origin remote repository and let's push them to the branch master so we're picking where and what branch we want to push these two because we can push to another branch as well which I'll show you in a second you says save these settings what that means is that next time we do this all we have to type is git push and it will automatically remember that it was origin and master that we pushed you so let's hit enter and let's see what happens here enumerated objects counting objects and boom there we go branch master set up on track remote branch master from origin so now if I go ahead and refresh this here let's have a look and says readme dot MD test up high and you can see that we look at a readme and we have these changes now on github so if you had any problems pushing there I probably know why I think I approach this at the beginning of the video but I kind of forgot so I'm gonna bring it in here what we need to do before we can actually work with the remote repository and the reason it worked for me is because I've already done this is set up a username and an email so don't worry if that push didn't work just follow along with what I'm about to show you this may not work either this gets a little bit tricky because you do need to authenticate yourself locally on your machine before you can just push and pull from any remote repository right so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna start by saying git config global user dot name and let me make this fullscreen actually so you guys can't see it and what I'm gonna do is put in quotation marks the name that I want to be represented by in this remote repository so on your local repository it doesn't matter but on the remote repository other people will see this potentially so you want to have some name that identifies you so I'm gonna put Tim as my user dot name so there we go now I've set up my global name so now this is stored on github locally and anytime I make a change to a remote repository I push or I pull or whatever I'm gonna be identified by the name of Tim now the next thing I want to do is use email so I want to say git config global user dot email and in here I'm gonna put the email that I use on github now this should hopefully authenticate you you might not you might have to actually use I might have to it might ask you to sign into github there's a bunch of different things that could happen here I don't remember how you authenticate locally to be able to push to be honest so you might have to look up how to do that there is something called a personal access token which you can use as well if you're on Windows at least but anyways let's put in our email so I am just gonna put a random email because I'm already authenticated so this is fine and I'm gonna put Tim at gmail.com actually I'm not gonna save that cuz I have another email that I don't want to share with you but anyways just put your email and hit enter and once you've done that you will have configured your name and your email on git so now you can try to push again and see if that works it may ask you for your password for github it might ask you to login if that doesn't happen unfortunately you're probably gonna have to go to the internet and figure out how to authenticate but let's say that now you guys are authenticated and you were able to push to this remote repository if you were able to do that what we need to do is move on to the next step which is understanding how to pull from the remote repository so I'm in my repository now I've pushed my changes up and I'm actually gonna make a change on this remote repository so let's go here and let me actually go to the edit button and I'm just gonna make a change that's hopefully gonna simulate what someone else might change on a remote repository so let's just move it so that the readme only has hello now and you can see that I can commit my changes right from github I'll just say updated readme commit changes all right so I've committed that now let's go back to test and we see that we've made a change and that just happened now let's go back to our command line and now let's figure out how we can actually get this change from the remote repository well the way to do that is to use what's known as a pull so I'm gonna say git pull origin master what I'm stating is what I want to pull so what I want to do where I want to pull from and what branch I want to take in this case I want to pull the from the origin which is the remote that we set up and I want to pull the master branch so let's go and hit enter and it says mm and boom go ahead and we have those changes so that happened everything worked and now if I go back to my sub line text you can see that Hello is the most recent change because that's what we modify now let's do this let's make a change here I'm gonna add hi and I'm gonna actually go ahead to this repository here and I'm gonna make a change on here as well I'm gonna put hello and I'm going to delete actually let's see here I'm gonna add hi I'm gonna add hi again on line four I'm trying to find a way that I can make this conflict so let's do this okay so I'm gonna commit this change here on this repository and now what I'm gonna do is we're gonna add my change here so I'm going to say get add cuz I made a change I say get commit M change and now what I want to do is want to pull from this remote repository actually what I want to do is push to this remote repository so I've made some changes here I want to push them up to this repository but notice and oops let's go back here that I made a change to this remote repository that I don't currently have on my local machine so I change this just to be high and I don't have that on this local machine so watch what happens when I try to push this to the remote repository so get push and you see that says failed to push some refs too and then that origin updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have so what what I need to do and what this is saying to me is hey there's changes on the remote repository that you don't have yet you need to pull those down before I'm gonna let you push your changes up that's what it's saying so if you get a message like this what you need to do is just get pull first so I'm gonna say git pull origin master and now look what it said and said ok boom we're gonna go ahead and we are going to pull all of these changes down now look what it says here automatic merge failed fix conflicts and then commit the result so what this is telling me is that hey we pulled some changes down but when we pulled those changes we had a conflict in readme dot MD the reason we had a conflict is because we changed two of the same lines and git doesn't know what to keep so on this remote repository I change the same line that I changed on this repository and this local machine right so now if we actually go ahead and look in here we can see that this is showing me there's a merge conflict so when you go ahead and you actually do a like you try to pull it down and there's a merge so we can't automatically sorry there's a conflict it can't automatically merge the code what you need to do is manually tell git what this code should look like so here what this is showing you is that hey there was a merge and there's merge conflict you need to fix this so what you have to do is delete all these arrows delete all this stuff and just make this file look how you want it to actually look so I'm gonna change it to look like this I'm gonna save it and I'm gonna resolve this merge conflict it can't automatically merge it so I need to manually come in and make the fixes which I've done and now what I will do is I will go ahead and I will actually commit this change so git commit M change okay so I realize that what I've forgotten to do is just add the new change that I wanted to make so pretty much what happens is when you have a merge conflict what you need to do is fix the file so resolve the conflict you need to add those changes and then you need to commit those changes and then you should be good so we're gonna say gits ah dots we're gonna say get commit em change boom we made the change that's known as our merge commit so we committed the merge conflict that we fixed and now I can go ahead and say get push so if I do this now you can see that I'm totally fine to push up to the remote repository because I pulled I got the most recent changes I fix the merge conflict and then I pushed back up to the remote repository and I made the change that I wanted to make that is kind of what happens and actually happens quite often is you get a merge conflict and hopefully you have some kind of software tool in this case I have sub line text that was able to help me a little bit in fixing that but all you have to do is go into the file that had the conflict sometimes will be multiple files fix the conflict add that file back in commit the change and then you can push again and pull again and everything should be working and functioning now the last thing I'll show you is pushing another branch and then after that I think we've pretty much covered everything we need to do so I'm gonna say git checkout and we're gonna go to the new branch and now what I'm gonna do is just push this branch up to the remote repository so I'm literally just gonna say git push and now I'm going to say origin for where I want to push it to and new so I need to specify that I want to push this here as the branch new to the new remote repository so I'm gonna go ahead and do that and now we will push this branch up to the remote repository so if we come here you can see that it says hey you've pushed a new branch called new and it says do you want to compare and make a pull request why it's saying this is because it knows that what we commonly use branches for is actually merging them with the master branch once they're ready and once they're good so let me refresh this here you notice it says two branches if I click we can see the new branch updated 17 minutes ago and let's click on it and go new pull request now it says you can't automatically merge because there's conflicting changes well let me go here and make this a girafft pull request so I'm just gonna submit it here just do this just to show you something and I'm gonna go to files change and you can see what it's showing me here this is what I added and this is what I removed from the previous file so that is how this works and this is kind of the basis of merging things into master is you make what's known as a pull request by having a new branch and then you compare that to the master branch and you merge them kind of squash them together so with that I think I've covered pretty much everything I can for github fundamentals I do apologize if this video is slightly confusing I'm trying my best here to explain everything sometimes it's hard to think back to the point where I've never used github before cuz I've been using it for a very long time but hopefully that at least gave you a good enough introduction that you kind of understand what's happening in github now maybe some of the commands you need to go look up again but now you have like a good foundation you kind of understand what a commit is what pushing is what pulling is what a merge conflict is how to make new branches all of the stuff that I cover so anyways if you guys enjoyed this video please do leave a like subscribe to the channel and of course I will see you in another YouTube video
