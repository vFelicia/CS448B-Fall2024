00:00 - so here's where we'll talk about where
00:01 - chat gbt is kind of lacking and why we
00:04 - still do need programmers in the world
00:06 - now I think that's obvious but the
00:08 - reality is if you're working on a large
00:09 - application that has hundreds maybe even
00:11 - thousands of files all kinds of
00:13 - different systems different Integrations
00:15 - deployments all of this stuff going on
00:17 - chat GPT at the current point in time is
00:19 - not capable of ingesting all of that
00:21 - data building context around the project
00:23 - and then putting something into practice
00:26 - you need to give it very specific
00:27 - instructions just like you would give
00:29 - like a more low level employee that
00:31 - doesn't fully understand the system so
00:33 - in my situation I can't rely on chat gbt
00:36 - to write a majority of the code for the
00:37 - code base because I would have to give
00:39 - it so much information for it to be able
00:41 - to do that and at that point it's just
00:42 - faster for me to write it myself
