00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:13 - gonna be showing you how i spend my
00:14 - money by breaking down one month of
00:16 - expenses and transactions now this is
00:19 - going to be both business and personal
00:20 - expenses and i have them broken down
00:22 - into each individual category so you'll
00:24 - get a really good idea of how i actually
00:26 - spend all of my money now one thing to
00:28 - note here is that i'm not going to tell
00:30 - you what my income is if you want to
00:31 - know what my income is you can leave a
00:33 - comment and if you guess it within two
00:35 - thousand dollars i'll actually pin your
00:36 - comment so that'll be my challenge to
00:38 - you if you guess how much money i make
00:40 - yearly personally and in the business i
00:42 - will pin the comment but i'm not going
00:43 - to tell you what that is anyways i've
00:45 - spent almost fifteen thousand dollars in
00:48 - one single month i think it's pretty
00:49 - interesting to see how i've spent this
00:51 - money in anyways we now need to go to
00:53 - the sponsor of the video so i can recoup
00:55 - some of these expenses so it looks like
00:57 - no one wanted to sponsor this video so
00:59 - instead i'm gonna tell you about
01:01 - programming expert now programming
01:04 - expert is a brand new course that was
01:06 - just released by myself and the algo
01:08 - expert team it is the best place to
01:10 - learn how to code and covers everything
01:12 - from programming fundamentals to
01:14 - advanced programming and software
01:16 - engineering tools there's over 250
01:18 - practice questions on the platform which
01:21 - means not only are you going to learn
01:22 - from the best videos out there in terms
01:24 - of teaching you how to code but you are
01:26 - also going to have a ton of practice and
01:28 - even practical projects and assessments
01:31 - to go through to make sure you really
01:32 - understand everything that you've
01:34 - learned you can check out programming
01:36 - expert from the link in the description
01:38 - or go to programming expert dot io slash
01:41 - tim and use the discount code tim for a
01:43 - discount on the platform check it out
01:46 - and now let's get into the video alright
01:48 - so let me start by giving a bit of
01:49 - context here and talking about how i
01:51 - make money in a business sense and in a
01:53 - personal sense as well so you understand
01:56 - where some of these expenses are coming
01:57 - from so i am self-employed i actually
01:59 - have a corporation this corporation is
02:01 - tech with tim inc and this takes all of
02:03 - my revenue so any of the revenue i make
02:05 - from youtube from sponsorships from
02:07 - brand deals from working at algo expert
02:10 - from commissionsonprogrammingexpert.io
02:12 - make sure you check that out from the
02:13 - link in the description by the way all
02:15 - of that goes straight to the company and
02:17 - then in the company i deduct all of my
02:19 - business expenses i pay myself a salary
02:22 - out of that company and then i have to
02:24 - pay tax at the end of the year but the
02:25 - tax rate in a corporation in ontario
02:28 - which is where i live is relatively
02:30 - small it's about 12.8 percent
02:32 - anyways the reason i'm telling you this
02:34 - is because from the company i pay myself
02:36 - a salary but the amount that i pay
02:38 - myself is up to me i can decide month by
02:40 - month how much i want to pay myself and
02:42 - i keep this number as small as i
02:44 - possibly can and pretty much to exactly
02:46 - what i spend every month personally so
02:48 - that i'm paying the least amount
02:49 - personal income tax i possibly can now
02:52 - this is not tax fraud this is completely
02:54 - legal everyone does this especially if
02:55 - they own a company but in canada the
02:58 - personal tax rate is extremely high the
03:00 - top marginal rate is 53 and a half
03:03 - percent which means if you make over two
03:04 - hundred fifty thousand dollars a year
03:06 - canadian you pay fifty three and a half
03:08 - percent of every dollar earned above
03:10 - that amount to the canadian government
03:12 - so if you were to say make half a
03:13 - million dollars a year in canada you'd
03:15 - end up paying about 240 000 of that to
03:18 - the canadian government anyways this is
03:20 - the reason why i keep how much i pay
03:22 - myself to a minimum so that i never get
03:24 - into these very top uh tax rates
03:26 - personally and so i'm paying the least
03:28 - amount that i possibly can in personal
03:30 - tax hopefully that makes a bit of sense
03:32 - but that's kind of the idea now all of
03:34 - the rest of the cash that i'm not paying
03:36 - myself sits in a corporation i actually
03:38 - transfer to a secondary company called a
03:40 - holding company and then gets invested
03:42 - in there in real estate stocks whatever
03:44 - and it just sits in there it grows and
03:46 - if i ever need it i pay it to myself and
03:47 - then i have to pay the penalty which is
03:49 - the personal income tax so hopefully
03:51 - that gives you a bit of an idea but
03:53 - that's kind of the structure that i have
03:54 - set up
03:55 - anyways let's go to the spreadsheet now
03:57 - and let me show you how much money i
03:59 - have spent now i've broken this into
04:01 - business and personal expense now
04:03 - business expenses are money that i'm
04:04 - paying out of the corporation and
04:06 - personal expenses are money that i'm
04:08 - paying out of my personal bank account
04:10 - so really out of the salary that i would
04:11 - have paid myself so let's continue here
04:13 - i'm now on this spreadsheet i just got a
04:16 - template from the internet that let me
04:18 - kind of put in some transactions and
04:19 - have this auto generated so it'll look a
04:21 - bit weird because i'm not using all of
04:23 - the columns but you can see that i've
04:25 - spent about 15 thousand
04:28 - two hundred three hundred dollars in the
04:29 - month of november twenty twenty one now
04:32 - five thousand four hundred of that is
04:34 - from the company and about ninety eight
04:35 - hundred of that is personal now i
04:37 - usually don't spend that much money
04:39 - personally uh this month was kind of a
04:41 - special month and well i'll start going
04:42 - through some of the transactions and you
04:44 - can see
04:45 - anyways uh if we're looking at the
04:46 - expenses here they're all categorized so
04:48 - i have dining out groceries gasoline fun
04:51 - money uh toiletries and supplies
04:53 - electric bill cell phone bill home
04:55 - property tax homeowner insurance a bunch
04:57 - of stuff you can see investments home
04:59 - maintenance giveaways editing service
05:01 - whatever and of course i'm not going to
05:03 - be showing you any like corporate
05:05 - investments or anything other than just
05:07 - expenses okay so this is kind of the
05:09 - general dashboard i mean i'll leave this
05:11 - up so you guys can look at it for a
05:13 - second pause the video if you want to
05:14 - have a look now we will go to
05:17 - transactions and i'll start walking you
05:18 - through each individual transaction that
05:20 - i have and they'll probably learn a lot
05:22 - about my life to be honest as i walk
05:24 - through this all right so first
05:25 - transaction 53 bucks this is life
05:28 - insurance this is just term life
05:29 - insurance that i have for myself that i
05:31 - pay for in the company okay pretty
05:33 - straightforward then we have a cell
05:35 - phone bill cell phone bills in canada
05:37 - are stupid high this is for unlimited
05:39 - data and everything but still 116
05:41 - dollars ridiculous i could literally buy
05:44 - another phone after paying a year's
05:45 - worth of cell phone premiums uh anyways
05:48 - continuing we have 661 dollars for
05:51 - insurance again so i have business
05:53 - insurance which covers all kinds of
05:54 - stuff even like malware ransomware it
05:57 - covers if i get sued it covers
05:59 - intellectual property theft all of that
06:00 - kind of stuff so that's pretty important
06:02 - to pay for so i pay 661 dollars for that
06:05 - per month
06:06 - then i have my editing service this is
06:08 - the number one expense i have in my
06:10 - company it is twenty eight hundred
06:11 - dollars a month and that's to get all of
06:13 - my videos edited now my editors actually
06:16 - edit all of my videos they do the
06:17 - thumbnails they write the descriptions
06:19 - they add the tags and they upload them
06:21 - to youtube so this in my opinion is a
06:23 - pretty good deal and i really couldn't
06:24 - live without these guys they saved me a
06:26 - ton of time and edit up to five videos a
06:28 - week so for twenty eight hundred bucks
06:30 - canadian i'm not complaining at all okay
06:32 - continuing we have 11.29 for spotify so
06:35 - i pay for spotify in the business
06:37 - because i can write that off uh pretty
06:39 - straightforward i then have an adobe
06:41 - creative cloud subscription for 44 a
06:44 - month that is so i can use things like
06:46 - after effects or premiere pro or
06:48 - whatever illustrator photoshop all that
06:50 - kind of stuff
06:51 - okay continuing 38 bucks a month for
06:53 - website security so for techwithtim.net
06:56 - i have this security on it just to make
06:58 - sure you guys don't spam it or ddos it
07:00 - or something
07:01 - not it doesn't really matter even if you
07:03 - were to do that but i have this website
07:05 - security i've been paying for for like
07:06 - three years so i just leave the
07:07 - subscription
07:08 - continuing i have fifty dollars and
07:10 - forty cents for a cloud campaign social
07:12 - media scheduling subscription now i
07:14 - recently cancelled this subscription but
07:16 - when i was posting all of those reels
07:18 - and all of those like shorts videos i
07:21 - had this tool that was scheduling them
07:23 - for me so i didn't have to manually post
07:25 - them okay continuing
07:27 - 84.74 cents for the internet bill so
07:29 - that is my home internet i work out of
07:31 - my house so i'm able to write off the
07:33 - internet so that's 85 bucks a month i
07:35 - then have 50 for camera monitoring so i
07:37 - have cameras on my house i'm able to
07:39 - write those off in the business as well
07:41 - because they're like protecting the
07:42 - office or protecting the workspace it's
07:44 - just 15 bucks a month to have like a
07:46 - cloud storage for them i have a
07:48 - quickbooks subscription which is 45
07:50 - dollars a month i have a domain renewal
07:52 - that i had to do specifically this month
07:54 - for this was 19 bucks and then i
07:57 - actually bought a graphics card
07:58 - specifically a 30-70 for about 1500 that
08:01 - i'm going to be giving away to one of
08:03 - you because a comment i left on one of
08:04 - my other videos got a thousand likes so
08:07 - there you go if you guys read the
08:08 - comments then you might have a chance to
08:09 - win a graphics card now usually in my
08:12 - business i do have more expenses this
08:14 - month i was kind of fortunate to not
08:15 - have a lot typically i have to pay a
08:17 - bookkeeper probably about 300 or 400
08:19 - bucks sometimes i have legal fees or
08:22 - accounting fees depending on what i'm
08:23 - doing and if i'm setting up some other
08:25 - type of stuff
08:26 - and yeah and then of course obviously i
08:28 - have a ton of investments i'm not
08:29 - including those in expenses because i
08:31 - can't really show you all of those
08:33 - numbers
08:34 - yeah that is the business last thing i
08:36 - will note is that i also have to pay for
08:37 - a bunch of servers i have servers
08:39 - running my website i have servers
08:41 - running a bunch of
08:43 - other things that i'm doing that i can't
08:44 - necessarily talk about and so that's
08:46 - probably about 100 to 150 bucks a month
08:48 - i guess i just forgot to include it in
08:50 - here okay so let's continue now to
08:51 - personal now this is a bit more
08:53 - interesting and this is where a bulk of
08:55 - the expenses are so we start with home
08:57 - home owner insurance so i actually own a
08:59 - house so i have to pay for home
09:01 - insurance every single month now i paid
09:03 - this in combination with my car
09:05 - insurance so this number might be a
09:06 - little bit off but it's about 180 bucks
09:08 - a month for home insurance i then have
09:10 - car insurance car insurance in canada is
09:12 - mandatory and it's super freaking
09:14 - expensive my insurance is over three
09:16 - thousand dollars a year just to own a
09:18 - car which is stupid in my opinion but
09:20 - that's how much it cost so i pay about
09:22 - 320 a month just to be able to drive a
09:24 - car okay so continuing i have my largest
09:26 - personal expense which is debt repayment
09:28 - now i do this every month 2500
09:31 - now this debt is a line of credit so
09:33 - when i bought my house in january i was
09:36 - a little bit short on cash for the down
09:38 - payment and i didn't want to wait to buy
09:40 - the house on like a later date because
09:42 - the market was just exploding and i knew
09:44 - that it would make sense to just take
09:45 - out a line of credit cover whatever the
09:47 - remaining down payment was and be able
09:49 - to do that so anyways i'm paying this
09:51 - off at twenty five hundred dollars a
09:52 - month this will be done very soon and
09:55 - some of you may be saying well why don't
09:56 - you just pay it all off at once i could
09:58 - do that if i wanted to but that would
09:59 - mean i would have to pay myself a ton of
10:01 - money personally which then means i
10:03 - would have to pay a ton of money and tax
10:05 - the personal government so it's much
10:06 - better for me to pay the i think five
10:08 - percent annual interest on this line of
10:10 - credit than it is to pay myself all the
10:12 - money to paid off immediately because
10:13 - that would be just a ton of money going
10:15 - to tax and the line of credit is
10:17 - relatively small so it's not like it's a
10:19 - ton of uh what do you call it uh
10:21 - interest okay
10:23 - continuing i have a mortgage payment so
10:24 - as i said i have a house i'm a homeowner
10:26 - so i have to pay for a mortgage this is
10:28 - about 1800 a month there you go pretty
10:31 - straightforward
10:32 - i have my home property tax now i
10:34 - actually paid this semi-annually so i
10:36 - don't know exactly what it is per month
10:38 - but it's about 3 800 a year in property
10:41 - taxes so about 310 a month all right so
10:43 - next i have a cleaning lady now this is
10:45 - a hundred bucks every two weeks i have
10:47 - her come she does an amazing job and
10:49 - saves me a ton of time cleaning the
10:51 - place so definitely worth it then i have
10:53 - investments so i know i said i wasn't
10:55 - going to include investments but this is
10:56 - kind of a one-off one and this is
10:58 - personal so i'll put it in personal just
10:59 - not in business and so i paid 984
11:02 - canadian on crypto.com i forget exactly
11:05 - what i bought but i think i bought some
11:07 - cardano or some cro coin or whatever and
11:10 - this is just kind of me messing around
11:11 - with personal investments i have a
11:13 - cryptocurrency portfolio that i hold
11:15 - personally if you guys want a video on
11:17 - that then let me know and i'd be happy
11:19 - to make that
11:20 - okay continuing i have a car payment so
11:22 - this is 318 dollars bi-weekly i got a
11:26 - car at the beginning of the year
11:27 - obviously when i had a house i needed a
11:29 - car well i guess not obviously but where
11:31 - i live is fairly far north in ontario
11:33 - and so i can't really get around with
11:34 - public transit anyways 318 bucks every
11:37 - two weeks i then have another investment
11:39 - so i have a thousand dollars that i put
11:41 - into my tax free savings account every
11:43 - month
11:44 - now eventually this account will get
11:45 - maxed and then i will just put this into
11:47 - an open savings account but if you're
11:49 - unfamiliar with tft fsa this is like a
11:52 - roth ira if you're in the u.s i might be
11:54 - mixing up the comparisons but
11:56 - essentially any money that i make in
11:57 - this account is not taxed so that's
12:00 - great obviously i want to max that out
12:01 - as much as i can but it does have a
12:03 - limit
12:04 - then continuing we have groceries so i
12:06 - actually get a meal plan delivered every
12:08 - week this is like kind of the
12:10 - pre-prepared food
12:12 - or not necessarily pre-prepared but it
12:13 - gives you the instructions it gives you
12:15 - all the ingredients in a bag and then
12:16 - you just go and execute the instructions
12:18 - and while you have a meal so these are
12:20 - awesome and i actually am eating way
12:22 - healthier now that i'm getting these
12:24 - because i'm cooking stuff at home rather
12:26 - than eating out all the time or ordering
12:27 - a bunch of like kind of shitty
12:29 - university type food that i used to eat
12:31 - before so i just logged two of these
12:33 - here i think i have four of these a
12:35 - month or i would have four of these a
12:36 - month because i do this four times a
12:38 - month i might have forgot to add them
12:39 - all here but anyways continue okay next
12:41 - i have my electricity bill now part of
12:43 - this is actually a corporate write-off
12:45 - but i just put it in here because i do
12:47 - pay it personally until the end of the
12:48 - year and then i reimburse myself now
12:50 - this is quite expensive but i have a
12:52 - mining rig that runs in my basement that
12:55 - is making up a good amount of this cost
12:57 - so anyways there you go 220 bucks okay
12:59 - so now we're at 204 dollars for fun
13:02 - money now this says gambling and this is
13:04 - because i actually went to a casino and
13:05 - i ended up winning like 600 or 700
13:08 - on my initial like 200 deposit so i'm
13:12 - gonna call that a win and a great
13:13 - investment now i do not condone or
13:15 - support gambling i've only been one time
13:17 - and i won so we'll see if i end up going
13:19 - back yeah that was fun money for the
13:21 - month 204
13:22 - okay continuing my other car payment
13:24 - that i've already talked about then i
13:26 - have insurance so i have life and
13:27 - critical illness insurance that i pay
13:29 - for personally so i have some in my
13:31 - business i pay for some of it personally
13:32 - as well and yeah this is pretty
13:34 - important to have especially when you
13:36 - have recurring expenses
13:38 - okay continuing
13:40 - i bought an electric toothbrush this is
13:42 - random for 225 dollars actually did this
13:44 - i guess yesterday from when i was
13:46 - filming this video a pretty expensive
13:48 - toothbrush but one of my friend's dads
13:50 - is a dentist and recommended it so i was
13:52 - like okay i'm gonna get that one
13:54 - uh continuing i have some groceries so
13:56 - just random miscellaneous food costs
13:58 - here i don't know why they're all split
14:00 - up i must have gone to a few different
14:01 - places but spent i don't know like 160
14:04 - bucks on groceries and i need to buy
14:07 - some extra stuff other than the meal
14:08 - plans because the meal plans don't have
14:09 - like snacks and lunches and all the
14:11 - other things that you need okay then we
14:13 - had gasoline for 98 bucks now it is so
14:16 - expensive to fill up my tank now it cost
14:18 - me almost 110 dollars to fill up my gas
14:21 - tank and i think it's like a 70 liter
14:23 - tank so that's why i labeled it crazy
14:25 - expensive gas
14:26 - continuing i have home maintenance so i
14:28 - actually had to go buy a uh what do you
14:31 - even call this a rake and i had to buy
14:33 - leaf bags and i had to buy a few other
14:35 - things for like
14:36 - kind of lawn maintenance at canadian
14:39 - tire and so that was 91 i did that the
14:41 - other day
14:42 - then i have dining out so i went to tim
14:44 - hortons i took my data for dinner which
14:46 - was 71 dollars and then that covers
14:49 - those two
14:50 - okay then 20 bucks on amazon i have no
14:53 - idea what i ordered but i ordered
14:54 - something for 20 bucks then i got a
14:56 - haircut for 21
14:58 - toiletries and supplies so i actually
15:00 - had to go to petsmart and buy my cat
15:02 - litter this is probably the wrong
15:03 - category but i don't know it's
15:05 - toiletries for her so i just put it in
15:07 - that category so 48 bucks
15:09 - dining out i bought something at tim
15:11 - hortons and then food delivery so i
15:13 - ordered to skip the dishes two nights in
15:14 - a row
15:16 - then subscriptions i have an amazon
15:18 - prime subscription for five bucks
15:20 - uh home maintenance so i have a water
15:22 - heater in my basement most of you if you
15:24 - own a house probably have this as well
15:26 - where it's a rented water heater so i
15:27 - have to pay like 12 bucks or something a

16:14 - a day um which is a lot this is a lot of
16:17 - personal expenses i usually don't spend

16:20 - that's just what this month was okay so
16:22 - now let's go to the category reports or
16:25 - actually do no that's not where i want
16:28 - to go i want to go to spending reports
16:29 - and i will show you kind of the
16:30 - breakdown of all of the categories
16:33 - so we can see dining out 98 bucks

16:54 - home insurance 179. uh just insurance in
16:57 - general
16:58 - is 860
17:00 - which means i spend almost a thousand
17:01 - dollars a month just on insurance but if
17:03 - you ever need it then you're happy that
17:05 - you have it car payment yeah about 640
17:08 - bucks a month
17:09 - car insurance 320 dollars again stupid
17:12 - expensive for the car insurance
17:14 - subscriptions 150
17:16 - home maintenance 104 bucks investments
17:19 - almost two grand personally so you can
17:21 - include that in the expenses uh
17:23 - giveaways almost fifteen hundred dollars
17:25 - so one of you will be getting this gpu
17:27 - and now it's how you can enter that in
17:28 - the coming days it has to arrive at my
17:30 - house first
17:31 - then i have an editing service which is
17:33 - about twenty eight hundred dollars a
17:34 - month definitely my largest expense
17:37 - mortgage payment about eighteen hundred
17:38 - dollars cleaning lady 200 bucks a month
17:41 - accounting quickbooks 45 bucks usually
17:44 - that would be a bit larger if i have to
17:45 - pay my bookkeeper to go in and do
17:46 - anything then i have debt repayment 2500
17:49 - a month that hopefully will be done soon
17:51 - or not hopefully that will be done soon
17:53 - then other 41 bucks amazon about 60
17:56 - bucks gifts 135 and food delivery 75
18:00 - bucks
18:01 - perfect now i can go to category
18:03 - reports and you can look at the final
18:05 - numbers right here if you look at just
18:06 - uh november it will tell you what the
18:08 - actual amounts are but yeah that pretty
18:10 - much breaks down everything in fact let
18:12 - me go back to the dashboard this is a
18:14 - better look at all right so i was kind
18:15 - of just reading through this sheet here
18:16 - i just made a quick cut and i was
18:18 - looking at areas and trying to figure
18:19 - out if i could really reduce my spending
18:21 - and to be honest any place that i can
18:23 - actually reduce spending isn't really
18:25 - going to have an impact on these numbers
18:27 - because what's carrying these numbers is
18:28 - things like the mortgage payment and the
18:30 - mortgage payment most of that is going
18:32 - to the principle of the loan and so
18:34 - that's actually building equity in the
18:35 - house so that's not even really
18:36 - necessarily a bad expense then we have
18:39 - things like the debt repayment right now
18:41 - i have to do that that's what actually
18:43 - allowed me to buy this house so that'll
18:44 - be done soon
18:46 - then what else do i have this large the
18:47 - giveaways this is a one-time thing i'm
18:49 - probably not going to do that next month
18:51 - then i have editing service 2800 bucks
18:53 - investments 2 grand i guess i could
18:55 - reduce that but this isn't really money
18:57 - loss this is invested in the market and
18:59 - yeah a lot of these other expenses are
19:00 - kind of just small random things that
19:02 - are conveniences to me and that i'm
19:03 - probably not going to end up cutting out
19:05 - all right so with that said i think i'm
19:06 - going to end the video here now if you
19:08 - guys want to see more content like this
19:10 - on the channel then definitely let me
19:12 - know i would be open to doing a video
19:13 - about different investments about my
19:15 - crypto portfolio maybe about my income
19:17 - although i'm not super comfortable
19:19 - sharing that online and anyways yeah
19:21 - this was a kind of a unique video and i
19:23 - hope you guys found some value from it
19:24 - so with that said i will end here

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm gonna be showing you how i spend my money by breaking down one month of expenses and transactions now this is going to be both business and personal expenses and i have them broken down into each individual category so you'll get a really good idea of how i actually spend all of my money now one thing to note here is that i'm not going to tell you what my income is if you want to know what my income is you can leave a comment and if you guess it within two thousand dollars i'll actually pin your comment so that'll be my challenge to you if you guess how much money i make yearly personally and in the business i will pin the comment but i'm not going to tell you what that is anyways i've spent almost fifteen thousand dollars in one single month i think it's pretty interesting to see how i've spent this money in anyways we now need to go to the sponsor of the video so i can recoup some of these expenses so it looks like no one wanted to sponsor this video so instead i'm gonna tell you about programming expert now programming expert is a brand new course that was just released by myself and the algo expert team it is the best place to learn how to code and covers everything from programming fundamentals to advanced programming and software engineering tools there's over 250 practice questions on the platform which means not only are you going to learn from the best videos out there in terms of teaching you how to code but you are also going to have a ton of practice and even practical projects and assessments to go through to make sure you really understand everything that you've learned you can check out programming expert from the link in the description or go to programming expert dot io slash tim and use the discount code tim for a discount on the platform check it out and now let's get into the video alright so let me start by giving a bit of context here and talking about how i make money in a business sense and in a personal sense as well so you understand where some of these expenses are coming from so i am selfemployed i actually have a corporation this corporation is tech with tim inc and this takes all of my revenue so any of the revenue i make from youtube from sponsorships from brand deals from working at algo expert from commissionsonprogrammingexpert.io make sure you check that out from the link in the description by the way all of that goes straight to the company and then in the company i deduct all of my business expenses i pay myself a salary out of that company and then i have to pay tax at the end of the year but the tax rate in a corporation in ontario which is where i live is relatively small it's about 12.8 percent anyways the reason i'm telling you this is because from the company i pay myself a salary but the amount that i pay myself is up to me i can decide month by month how much i want to pay myself and i keep this number as small as i possibly can and pretty much to exactly what i spend every month personally so that i'm paying the least amount personal income tax i possibly can now this is not tax fraud this is completely legal everyone does this especially if they own a company but in canada the personal tax rate is extremely high the top marginal rate is 53 and a half percent which means if you make over two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year canadian you pay fifty three and a half percent of every dollar earned above that amount to the canadian government so if you were to say make half a million dollars a year in canada you'd end up paying about 240 000 of that to the canadian government anyways this is the reason why i keep how much i pay myself to a minimum so that i never get into these very top uh tax rates personally and so i'm paying the least amount that i possibly can in personal tax hopefully that makes a bit of sense but that's kind of the idea now all of the rest of the cash that i'm not paying myself sits in a corporation i actually transfer to a secondary company called a holding company and then gets invested in there in real estate stocks whatever and it just sits in there it grows and if i ever need it i pay it to myself and then i have to pay the penalty which is the personal income tax so hopefully that gives you a bit of an idea but that's kind of the structure that i have set up anyways let's go to the spreadsheet now and let me show you how much money i have spent now i've broken this into business and personal expense now business expenses are money that i'm paying out of the corporation and personal expenses are money that i'm paying out of my personal bank account so really out of the salary that i would have paid myself so let's continue here i'm now on this spreadsheet i just got a template from the internet that let me kind of put in some transactions and have this auto generated so it'll look a bit weird because i'm not using all of the columns but you can see that i've spent about 15 thousand two hundred three hundred dollars in the month of november twenty twenty one now five thousand four hundred of that is from the company and about ninety eight hundred of that is personal now i usually don't spend that much money personally uh this month was kind of a special month and well i'll start going through some of the transactions and you can see anyways uh if we're looking at the expenses here they're all categorized so i have dining out groceries gasoline fun money uh toiletries and supplies electric bill cell phone bill home property tax homeowner insurance a bunch of stuff you can see investments home maintenance giveaways editing service whatever and of course i'm not going to be showing you any like corporate investments or anything other than just expenses okay so this is kind of the general dashboard i mean i'll leave this up so you guys can look at it for a second pause the video if you want to have a look now we will go to transactions and i'll start walking you through each individual transaction that i have and they'll probably learn a lot about my life to be honest as i walk through this all right so first transaction 53 bucks this is life insurance this is just term life insurance that i have for myself that i pay for in the company okay pretty straightforward then we have a cell phone bill cell phone bills in canada are stupid high this is for unlimited data and everything but still 116 dollars ridiculous i could literally buy another phone after paying a year's worth of cell phone premiums uh anyways continuing we have 661 dollars for insurance again so i have business insurance which covers all kinds of stuff even like malware ransomware it covers if i get sued it covers intellectual property theft all of that kind of stuff so that's pretty important to pay for so i pay 661 dollars for that per month then i have my editing service this is the number one expense i have in my company it is twenty eight hundred dollars a month and that's to get all of my videos edited now my editors actually edit all of my videos they do the thumbnails they write the descriptions they add the tags and they upload them to youtube so this in my opinion is a pretty good deal and i really couldn't live without these guys they saved me a ton of time and edit up to five videos a week so for twenty eight hundred bucks canadian i'm not complaining at all okay continuing we have 11.29 for spotify so i pay for spotify in the business because i can write that off uh pretty straightforward i then have an adobe creative cloud subscription for 44 a month that is so i can use things like after effects or premiere pro or whatever illustrator photoshop all that kind of stuff okay continuing 38 bucks a month for website security so for techwithtim.net i have this security on it just to make sure you guys don't spam it or ddos it or something not it doesn't really matter even if you were to do that but i have this website security i've been paying for for like three years so i just leave the subscription continuing i have fifty dollars and forty cents for a cloud campaign social media scheduling subscription now i recently cancelled this subscription but when i was posting all of those reels and all of those like shorts videos i had this tool that was scheduling them for me so i didn't have to manually post them okay continuing 84.74 cents for the internet bill so that is my home internet i work out of my house so i'm able to write off the internet so that's 85 bucks a month i then have 50 for camera monitoring so i have cameras on my house i'm able to write those off in the business as well because they're like protecting the office or protecting the workspace it's just 15 bucks a month to have like a cloud storage for them i have a quickbooks subscription which is 45 dollars a month i have a domain renewal that i had to do specifically this month for this was 19 bucks and then i actually bought a graphics card specifically a 3070 for about 1500 that i'm going to be giving away to one of you because a comment i left on one of my other videos got a thousand likes so there you go if you guys read the comments then you might have a chance to win a graphics card now usually in my business i do have more expenses this month i was kind of fortunate to not have a lot typically i have to pay a bookkeeper probably about 300 or 400 bucks sometimes i have legal fees or accounting fees depending on what i'm doing and if i'm setting up some other type of stuff and yeah and then of course obviously i have a ton of investments i'm not including those in expenses because i can't really show you all of those numbers yeah that is the business last thing i will note is that i also have to pay for a bunch of servers i have servers running my website i have servers running a bunch of other things that i'm doing that i can't necessarily talk about and so that's probably about 100 to 150 bucks a month i guess i just forgot to include it in here okay so let's continue now to personal now this is a bit more interesting and this is where a bulk of the expenses are so we start with home home owner insurance so i actually own a house so i have to pay for home insurance every single month now i paid this in combination with my car insurance so this number might be a little bit off but it's about 180 bucks a month for home insurance i then have car insurance car insurance in canada is mandatory and it's super freaking expensive my insurance is over three thousand dollars a year just to own a car which is stupid in my opinion but that's how much it cost so i pay about 320 a month just to be able to drive a car okay so continuing i have my largest personal expense which is debt repayment now i do this every month 2500 now this debt is a line of credit so when i bought my house in january i was a little bit short on cash for the down payment and i didn't want to wait to buy the house on like a later date because the market was just exploding and i knew that it would make sense to just take out a line of credit cover whatever the remaining down payment was and be able to do that so anyways i'm paying this off at twenty five hundred dollars a month this will be done very soon and some of you may be saying well why don't you just pay it all off at once i could do that if i wanted to but that would mean i would have to pay myself a ton of money personally which then means i would have to pay a ton of money and tax the personal government so it's much better for me to pay the i think five percent annual interest on this line of credit than it is to pay myself all the money to paid off immediately because that would be just a ton of money going to tax and the line of credit is relatively small so it's not like it's a ton of uh what do you call it uh interest okay continuing i have a mortgage payment so as i said i have a house i'm a homeowner so i have to pay for a mortgage this is about 1800 a month there you go pretty straightforward i have my home property tax now i actually paid this semiannually so i don't know exactly what it is per month but it's about 3 800 a year in property taxes so about 310 a month all right so next i have a cleaning lady now this is a hundred bucks every two weeks i have her come she does an amazing job and saves me a ton of time cleaning the place so definitely worth it then i have investments so i know i said i wasn't going to include investments but this is kind of a oneoff one and this is personal so i'll put it in personal just not in business and so i paid 984 canadian on crypto.com i forget exactly what i bought but i think i bought some cardano or some cro coin or whatever and this is just kind of me messing around with personal investments i have a cryptocurrency portfolio that i hold personally if you guys want a video on that then let me know and i'd be happy to make that okay continuing i have a car payment so this is 318 dollars biweekly i got a car at the beginning of the year obviously when i had a house i needed a car well i guess not obviously but where i live is fairly far north in ontario and so i can't really get around with public transit anyways 318 bucks every two weeks i then have another investment so i have a thousand dollars that i put into my tax free savings account every month now eventually this account will get maxed and then i will just put this into an open savings account but if you're unfamiliar with tft fsa this is like a roth ira if you're in the u.s i might be mixing up the comparisons but essentially any money that i make in this account is not taxed so that's great obviously i want to max that out as much as i can but it does have a limit then continuing we have groceries so i actually get a meal plan delivered every week this is like kind of the preprepared food or not necessarily preprepared but it gives you the instructions it gives you all the ingredients in a bag and then you just go and execute the instructions and while you have a meal so these are awesome and i actually am eating way healthier now that i'm getting these because i'm cooking stuff at home rather than eating out all the time or ordering a bunch of like kind of shitty university type food that i used to eat before so i just logged two of these here i think i have four of these a month or i would have four of these a month because i do this four times a month i might have forgot to add them all here but anyways continue okay next i have my electricity bill now part of this is actually a corporate writeoff but i just put it in here because i do pay it personally until the end of the year and then i reimburse myself now this is quite expensive but i have a mining rig that runs in my basement that is making up a good amount of this cost so anyways there you go 220 bucks okay so now we're at 204 dollars for fun money now this says gambling and this is because i actually went to a casino and i ended up winning like 600 or 700 on my initial like 200 deposit so i'm gonna call that a win and a great investment now i do not condone or support gambling i've only been one time and i won so we'll see if i end up going back yeah that was fun money for the month 204 okay continuing my other car payment that i've already talked about then i have insurance so i have life and critical illness insurance that i pay for personally so i have some in my business i pay for some of it personally as well and yeah this is pretty important to have especially when you have recurring expenses okay continuing i bought an electric toothbrush this is random for 225 dollars actually did this i guess yesterday from when i was filming this video a pretty expensive toothbrush but one of my friend's dads is a dentist and recommended it so i was like okay i'm gonna get that one uh continuing i have some groceries so just random miscellaneous food costs here i don't know why they're all split up i must have gone to a few different places but spent i don't know like 160 bucks on groceries and i need to buy some extra stuff other than the meal plans because the meal plans don't have like snacks and lunches and all the other things that you need okay then we had gasoline for 98 bucks now it is so expensive to fill up my tank now it cost me almost 110 dollars to fill up my gas tank and i think it's like a 70 liter tank so that's why i labeled it crazy expensive gas continuing i have home maintenance so i actually had to go buy a uh what do you even call this a rake and i had to buy leaf bags and i had to buy a few other things for like kind of lawn maintenance at canadian tire and so that was 91 i did that the other day then i have dining out so i went to tim hortons i took my data for dinner which was 71 dollars and then that covers those two okay then 20 bucks on amazon i have no idea what i ordered but i ordered something for 20 bucks then i got a haircut for 21 toiletries and supplies so i actually had to go to petsmart and buy my cat litter this is probably the wrong category but i don't know it's toiletries for her so i just put it in that category so 48 bucks dining out i bought something at tim hortons and then food delivery so i ordered to skip the dishes two nights in a row then subscriptions i have an amazon prime subscription for five bucks uh home maintenance so i have a water heater in my basement most of you if you own a house probably have this as well where it's a rented water heater so i have to pay like 12 bucks or something a month for the rental of the water heater anyways that's what it is another food delivery for 25 bucks dining out for 7.28 at mcdonald's nice and then i have more groceries now this was actually a combination of food and a coffee grinder so i recently started making my own coffee as opposed to doing the keurig thing it's like getting the beans grinding them up so i had to buy some stuff for that so a coffee grinder whatever and then i bought some food okay then we have gifts so i actually bought my dad a birthday gift i got him a bunch of wine which was 135 then i ordered something else on amazon and then i have my other cleaning lady expense and that wraps up the personal expenses okay so you can see quite a few transactions i think i had at least one a day um which is a lot this is a lot of personal expenses i usually don't spend this much money personally but i guess that's just what this month was okay so now let's go to the category reports or actually do no that's not where i want to go i want to go to spending reports and i will show you kind of the breakdown of all of the categories so we can see dining out 98 bucks groceries 425 gasoline 98 bucks usually that's a bit higher i haven't been driving uh very much recently fun money 200 toiletry supplies 274 electric bill 220 internet bill 85 cell phone bill 1 116 home property tax 310 home insurance 179. uh just insurance in general is 860 which means i spend almost a thousand dollars a month just on insurance but if you ever need it then you're happy that you have it car payment yeah about 640 bucks a month car insurance 320 dollars again stupid expensive for the car insurance subscriptions 150 home maintenance 104 bucks investments almost two grand personally so you can include that in the expenses uh giveaways almost fifteen hundred dollars so one of you will be getting this gpu and now it's how you can enter that in the coming days it has to arrive at my house first then i have an editing service which is about twenty eight hundred dollars a month definitely my largest expense mortgage payment about eighteen hundred dollars cleaning lady 200 bucks a month accounting quickbooks 45 bucks usually that would be a bit larger if i have to pay my bookkeeper to go in and do anything then i have debt repayment 2500 a month that hopefully will be done soon or not hopefully that will be done soon then other 41 bucks amazon about 60 bucks gifts 135 and food delivery 75 bucks perfect now i can go to category reports and you can look at the final numbers right here if you look at just uh november it will tell you what the actual amounts are but yeah that pretty much breaks down everything in fact let me go back to the dashboard this is a better look at all right so i was kind of just reading through this sheet here i just made a quick cut and i was looking at areas and trying to figure out if i could really reduce my spending and to be honest any place that i can actually reduce spending isn't really going to have an impact on these numbers because what's carrying these numbers is things like the mortgage payment and the mortgage payment most of that is going to the principle of the loan and so that's actually building equity in the house so that's not even really necessarily a bad expense then we have things like the debt repayment right now i have to do that that's what actually allowed me to buy this house so that'll be done soon then what else do i have this large the giveaways this is a onetime thing i'm probably not going to do that next month then i have editing service 2800 bucks investments 2 grand i guess i could reduce that but this isn't really money loss this is invested in the market and yeah a lot of these other expenses are kind of just small random things that are conveniences to me and that i'm probably not going to end up cutting out all right so with that said i think i'm going to end the video here now if you guys want to see more content like this on the channel then definitely let me know i would be open to doing a video about different investments about my crypto portfolio maybe about my income although i'm not super comfortable sharing that online and anyways yeah this was a kind of a unique video and i hope you guys found some value from it so with that said i will end here hopefully you guys enjoyed if you did make sure you like subscribe to the channel check out
