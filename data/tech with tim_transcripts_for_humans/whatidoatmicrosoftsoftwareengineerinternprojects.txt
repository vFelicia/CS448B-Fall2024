00:02 - [Music]
00:06 - hello everyone and welcome back to
00:09 - another YouTube video so in today's
00:10 - video what I'm gonna do is talk to you
00:12 - but when I actually work on at Microsoft
00:14 - as a software engineer in turn now I'm
00:17 - excited about this video and I think
00:18 - this is really cool because I can
00:20 - actually give you guys some really good
00:21 - insight into what it's like to work as a
00:23 - software engineer at a big tech company
00:25 - and what you actually do on a day to day
00:27 - basis and the reason I'm able to do that
00:29 - and I'm actually gonna be able to show
00:31 - you all of the code that I've written so
00:32 - far is because this is an open-source
00:35 - project so I'm actually on the BS code
00:38 - Python extension team working on data
00:41 - science related features so vs code is a
00:43 - very popular code editor it looks like
00:46 - this I'm sure you guys have seen it
00:47 - before if you're into programming at all
00:49 - and it is one of the most popular code
00:51 - editors in the world if not the most
00:53 - popular one within it there's a bunch of
00:55 - things called extension so actually I
00:57 - should leave this up if I come here and
00:59 - I go to the extensions pane which is on
01:01 - the side here you can see all of the
01:03 - extensions I have enabled one of which
01:05 - is the Python extension so this right
01:07 - here if you've installed this you may
01:09 - potentially be seeing changes that I've
01:11 - actually made to this extension so the
01:14 - extension is essentially a way to
01:15 - support extra features just other things
01:18 - in vs code related normally to specific
01:21 - programming languages you can see here
01:23 - there's like a react extension there's
01:25 - all these different kind of extensions
01:27 - some of them are produced by Microsoft
01:28 - and some of them are third-party
01:30 - extensions but one of the reasons this
01:32 - is able to be open source is because you
01:34 - know it's not really a huge deal it just
01:35 - is the Python extension for vs code so
01:38 - within that there's a bunch of different
01:40 - areas there's the core extension team
01:42 - there's the language server team which
01:44 - is responsible for doing all the
01:46 - intellisense and all of your code
01:47 - completions and then there's the data
01:49 - science team which I'm on and the data
01:51 - science team is responsible for making
01:53 - data science features that helped out a
01:55 - scientist right so people that are
01:57 - working in machine learning and AI
01:58 - they're working with Jupiter notebooks
02:01 - and in fact I'm going to show you some
02:03 - of the features I'm working on in a
02:04 - second that are very heavily related to
02:06 - job Jupiter notebooks excuse me on that
02:09 - one but what I wanted to show you though
02:10 - is kind of how it works in terms of how
02:13 - do I
02:13 - actually push code how do I figure out
02:15 - what to work on how do we prioritize
02:17 - issues I think that's a cool thing to
02:19 - show so I wanted to show you that we use
02:21 - github for all of this
02:23 - so github is a really powerful tool I
02:25 - knew it was powerful but not until I
02:27 - started working at Microsoft which owns
02:29 - github by the way I realized how
02:31 - powerful it really is and how many
02:33 - things you can do with it so first of
02:35 - all this is the repository so this is
02:37 - the entire code base for the Python
02:39 - extension for Visual Studio code I'll
02:42 - put this in the description and you guys
02:43 - can go and look at this all you want you
02:45 - can mess with it you can actually
02:46 - contribute code and make a pull request
02:48 - if you wanted to you can file issues if
02:51 - you notice things are wrong and in fact
02:52 - one of the ways that we actually figure
02:54 - out what to work on and what needs to be
02:56 - changed for future releases is by
02:58 - looking at this issues tab so a lot of
03:00 - the issues that are here will actually
03:02 - be posted by external contributors so
03:04 - those are people that are not a part of
03:06 - the Microsoft organization they come
03:08 - here and say hey I had an issue in vs
03:10 - code with the Python extension
03:12 - I need this fixed and they file an issue
03:14 - so let me just click on one here and
03:15 - just see what this says failed to
03:18 - activate Jupiter or create empty
03:19 - notebook so you can see that this goes
03:21 - through a whole whack of wow I didn't
03:23 - realize that was gonna be that long but
03:25 - just an issue that happened when this
03:27 - person was using our extension so you
03:29 - can see this is labeled data science
03:31 - type bug and it might be a part of a
03:33 - specific group or it might be organized
03:36 - in a certain way and that's kind of the
03:38 - way that we figure out what's wrong and
03:40 - what we need to work on and what new
03:41 - features people want if there's a issue
03:43 - that's come up a lot of times there a
03:45 - lot of people are up voting it then
03:47 - that's probably what we'll work on for
03:48 - the next release of vs code again I'm
03:51 - really just kind of a beginner here this
03:52 - is my basic understanding and the senior
03:54 - guys could definitely tell you more than
03:56 - I could but I think it's cool to
03:57 - understand that you can actually have a
03:59 - direct impact on what I potentially
04:01 - decide to work on and then the pull
04:03 - request tab is the next one I wanted to
04:05 - show you so this is actually how you go
04:07 - about making a change to this code so
04:10 - when you want to make a change what you
04:11 - do is you submit a pull request a pull
04:14 - request describes what you change it
04:15 - shows like why you changed it and what
04:18 - parts of the code you actually modified
04:20 - and then one of the senior developers on
04:22 - this team was write access to the
04:24 - repository will come look at
04:26 - do a review of it and then if it's a
04:28 - little good they'll give you a checkmark
04:29 - if it passes all our automated tests
04:32 - you'll get a check and then you can
04:33 - actually merge this right into the code
04:35 - base so you yourself can actually make a
04:38 - change to the vs code python extension
04:40 - assuming it's something that we want and
04:42 - you've done it properly so let me go
04:44 - here now to actually one of the changes
04:46 - that I've made to show you what I mean
04:48 - by a pull request so this was my I don't
04:51 - wanna say my first pull request maybe
04:52 - make my second or my third one and this
04:54 - was to save the variable Explorer height
04:56 - persistently that's not gonna mean much
04:58 - to you guys but there is a variable
05:00 - Explorer within vs code it was a not
05:02 - resizable before which meant it stayed
05:05 - as kind of a static window and it was
05:06 - really annoying because it was quite
05:08 - large so one of the first things I
05:09 - worked on was actually making that
05:11 - resizable and now making it so that it
05:14 - saves the height persistently so that
05:16 - when you come back into vias coder you
05:18 - open a file where you've resized that
05:19 - pane it remembers where you resized it
05:22 - so that you don't have to keep resizing
05:24 - it and keeps resetting so you can see I
05:26 - do a little description for what I
05:27 - changed I give my checks for the things
05:29 - that are appropriate and then you can
05:30 - look at all of the commits that I made
05:32 - so these are commit messages from github
05:34 - on my local machine I added a label
05:37 - called skip news some people who
05:39 - reviewed it requested some changes
05:41 - wanted me to modify something I made
05:43 - those changes so address the comments
05:44 - and then I got approved had two
05:46 - approvals here and then all the way down
05:49 - here I passed the code quality test I
05:51 - passed a bunch of other automated tests
05:54 - which I think we can see here other than
05:55 - one PR validation but that's not a big
05:57 - deal that's not important test and then
06:00 - I go went ahead and merged this into the
06:03 - master branch which means now this
06:04 - change is final and that everyone can
06:06 - see it that has the most recent version
06:08 - of this vs code Python extension so I
06:11 - think that's pretty cool that's how I
06:12 - changed it one cool thing to show you
06:14 - here is that if you go to checks or is
06:17 - it checks now sorry not checks check
06:19 - shows you all the automated tests that
06:21 - they have set up to make sure that
06:22 - nothing breaks when you make a change
06:23 - but if you go to files changed you can
06:25 - actually see all of the code that I
06:27 - wrote it's all highlighted in green and
06:29 - then anything that I deleted would be in
06:30 - red so like that or anything that I
06:32 - potentially moved around so anyways
06:34 - that's enough for this I want to
06:36 - actually show you what I work on on a
06:38 - day-to-day in terms of the
06:39 - code that I've been writing for the past
06:41 - week or two and I think that's pretty
06:43 - cool so let's go here
06:45 - and you can see that I've actually have
06:47 - open the Python vs code repository it's
06:50 - not a hundred percent up to date because
06:51 - I haven't merged the most recent changes
06:53 - or pulled the most recent changes but I
06:55 - have a few files open here one of which
06:57 - is export manager I'm currently working
06:59 - on this file and start writing this one
07:01 - from scratch and this is to actually
07:03 - export a Jupiter notebook to a PDF to
07:06 - HTML or to a Python script so we want to
07:10 - have that kind of functionality so
07:12 - that's a project that I've started it
07:13 - and then I'm gonna be tackling for this
07:15 - next few weeks anyways let me actually
07:18 - show you how we debug and kind of work
07:20 - in vs code to work on vs code because
07:24 - it's funny right I'm working on a vs
07:25 - code extension and I'm using vs code as
07:27 - my development environment so you can
07:30 - see that this is another instance of vs
07:32 - code that I have open here and it says
07:34 - extension development host what that
07:36 - means is this is kind of my debugging
07:38 - version of vs code this is one that I've
07:41 - built so there's a bunch of tasks
07:43 - running in the background here on vs
07:44 - code if I go to terminal they're
07:47 - automatically compiling all of my
07:49 - changes you can see eleven errors in
07:50 - this one that's great and serving them
07:53 - to this new vs code window so that I can
07:55 - actually test out anything that I've
07:57 - changed so the first feature that I
07:59 - worked on and this was kind of my like
08:00 - getting into the code base who's getting
08:02 - used to things was resizing this pane so
08:04 - make this resizable which by the way was
08:06 - a lot harder than it looks and then make
08:08 - it simple when you reopen it it stays
08:10 - the same size and if I save this file
08:12 - and reopen the file it saves the height
08:14 - that we have the variable Explorer at so
08:17 - that's the first change and the next
08:18 - thing I'm working at is this export as
08:20 - features so if you go on vs code right
08:23 - now and you click on this button that
08:25 - won't show up this is something that's
08:26 - just in my current code base right here
08:28 - and you can see a Python script HTML PDF
08:31 - and these are going to be the options
08:33 - that you have when you want to export
08:34 - something so let me make a change here
08:36 - and actually save this file so let's
08:38 - just save this as tester on my desktop
08:41 - let's make a change like that let's save
08:44 - and actually let's make another change
08:46 - so notice how it's unchanged I'm gonna
08:48 - go here and go HTML and then we get a
08:50 - little pop up down here
08:52 - please save this file before exporting
08:54 - save save and don't show again or cancel
08:57 - so that's something that I've implements
08:58 - as well as you know checking all this
09:00 - saving stuff so I'll hit save boom and
09:03 - now it's gonna ask me where I want to
09:04 - save my HTML and I can choose where I
09:06 - want it to go and then I haven't
09:08 - finished most of that feature yet but
09:09 - that's something that I'm working on so
09:11 - that is pretty much what I work on at
09:13 - Microsoft and on a day-to-day I could go
09:15 - in and show you way more but I wanted to
09:17 - keep this video kind of short and just
09:19 - give you guys a little insight into what
09:21 - I'm actually doing and see kind of how
09:23 - cool it actually is because I think it's
09:25 - really interesting that you guys can go
09:26 - and view all of the changes that I'm
09:28 - actually making that I can show you all
09:30 - of this stuff and that you actually get
09:32 - an idea that as an intern I'm writing
09:34 - real code and I'm working on a product
09:36 - and features that you guys are actually
09:38 - gonna be able to use and that you know
09:40 - millions of other people may be able to
09:42 - use in the future as well so without
09:44 - being said that has been this video I
09:46 - hope you guys enjoyed if you did make
09:48 - sure leave a like subscribe and I will
09:50 - see you all again in another YouTube
09:51 - video

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome back to another YouTube video so in today's video what I'm gonna do is talk to you but when I actually work on at Microsoft as a software engineer in turn now I'm excited about this video and I think this is really cool because I can actually give you guys some really good insight into what it's like to work as a software engineer at a big tech company and what you actually do on a day to day basis and the reason I'm able to do that and I'm actually gonna be able to show you all of the code that I've written so far is because this is an opensource project so I'm actually on the BS code Python extension team working on data science related features so vs code is a very popular code editor it looks like this I'm sure you guys have seen it before if you're into programming at all and it is one of the most popular code editors in the world if not the most popular one within it there's a bunch of things called extension so actually I should leave this up if I come here and I go to the extensions pane which is on the side here you can see all of the extensions I have enabled one of which is the Python extension so this right here if you've installed this you may potentially be seeing changes that I've actually made to this extension so the extension is essentially a way to support extra features just other things in vs code related normally to
