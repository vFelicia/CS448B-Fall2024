00:07 - are coming on the tech with Tim YouTube
00:08 - channel some new things that I've
00:09 - launched and just what's going on with
00:11 - me this last year has been a really long
00:13 - journey I've done so much I feel like in
00:16 - 12 months and I figured today we'll take
00:18 - a little step back summarize some of
00:19 - that and talk about what's to come for
00:21 - the future so the first thing that I
00:23 - want to do is say thank you to all of
00:24 - you guys genuinely thank you to every

00:28 - video right now thank you thank you for
00:30 - liking the videos subscribing commenting
00:32 - just any support you give me really
00:34 - means the world and it's the reason that
00:36 - I'm able to do all of these things and
00:38 - I'm able to sit here in this chair and
00:40 - talk to you guys on the internet on this
00:42 - YouTube platform over a year ago I was
00:44 - at less than 20 or 30,000 subscribers
00:46 - and I just cannot tell you how
00:48 - unbelievable it feels to sit here have
00:50 - so much support and an amazing community
00:51 - that really does support me in anything
00:53 - that I do so with that being said let's
00:56 - talk about are the new exciting things
00:57 - that I'm working on and what's common
00:59 - with the tech with Tim YouTube channel
01:00 - and what you can expect so I guess the
01:02 - first exciting piece of news to share
01:04 - with you guys is the launch of my new
01:05 - podcast called time out with Tim now you
01:08 - probably understand that why I have this
01:10 - microphone this big boom arm and this
01:12 - audio quality it's because I've recently
01:13 - started the podcast time out with Tim
01:15 - which is about taking a timeout pausing
01:18 - relaxing and listening into my
01:20 - perspective on some different things as
01:22 - well as having some other guests on so
01:24 - what I'm gonna be doing with this
01:25 - podcast is posting full video versions
01:27 - of it on a second youtube channel called
01:29 - time out with Tim I would really
01:31 - appreciate it if you guys go over that
01:32 - YouTube channel and subscribe to it
01:34 - there will be a card in this video and a
01:36 - link in the description but what I'm
01:38 - gonna be doing here is just having
01:39 - guests on talking about attack talking
01:41 - about programming pretty much anything
01:42 - that I can't fit into a shorter 10 or 15
01:45 - minute video on this main channel I'm
01:47 - gonna be talking about on the podcast
01:49 - now it's a great opportunity for me to
01:50 - answer some of your questions talk to
01:52 - you guys about things that maybe aren't
01:54 - super tak in programming niche because
01:55 - that's what this main YouTube channel is
01:57 - about and talk about finance talk about
02:00 - investing talk about work ethic
02:01 - lifestyle the things that are really
02:03 - important that I think I have some
02:05 - valuable insight on but that I wouldn't
02:07 - really feel comfortable making like a 10
02:08 - or 15 minute short video on this YouTube
02:11 - channel about so if you guys have any
02:12 - interest in that please
02:13 - do you go subscribe to that channel time
02:15 - out with Tim again this will be
02:16 - available on Spotify Apple music pretty
02:19 - much any platform you can think of it'll
02:21 - be available in audio format and I'll be
02:23 - taking some interesting clips from those
02:24 - podcasts and sharing them on my social
02:26 - media so if you just want the shortened
02:28 - version you know follow my Twitter
02:29 - follow my Instagram Instagram I believe
02:31 - its tech underscore with underscore Tim
02:33 - and the Twitter is tech with Tim with
02:36 - two M's so I'll just be sharing it on
02:37 - that LinkedIn as well you guys can
02:39 - follow me there but I'm really excited
02:40 - about this podcast I have a few really
02:42 - interesting guests lined up I have an
02:43 - episode going live I believe today if
02:46 - you're watching this video and it's just
02:47 - I think it's gonna be a great time and
02:49 - that is something that I'm really
02:50 - focusing on for this year is getting
02:52 - that podcast growing growing that
02:54 - podcast and just making it super
02:55 - valuable and super interesting to listen
02:57 - to so the next piece of exciting news I
02:59 - have for you is something called channel
03:01 - memberships so very recently I added a
03:03 - feature called channel memberships to
03:05 - the tech with Tim YouTube channel now
03:06 - essentially what this is is you'll see a
03:08 - little button it says join and if you
03:10 - click on that you'll have more access
03:11 - and you can watch my little promo video
03:13 - and read through what that actually
03:15 - means but the idea behind this is that
03:17 - if you'd like to you can support me on a
03:19 - monthly basis by paying a small
03:21 - subscription fee and gain access to
03:22 - exclusive content perks and benefits
03:25 - that non-members won't have now I want
03:28 - to make this clear anything if you're
03:30 - not a member right now and you don't
03:31 - plan on being a member nothing is gonna
03:32 - change for you there's nothing you won't
03:34 - see there's nothing you're gonna miss
03:35 - out on but the benefit of being a member
03:37 - is you'll get to shape and kind of
03:39 - change and choose the direction the tech
03:41 - with same YouTube channel goes in now
03:43 - what I mean by that is members people
03:45 - are supporting me are people that in my
03:47 - opinion are above and beyond
03:49 - they're like the superfans in my opinion
03:51 - so I want to make sure that I'm giving
03:52 - them value and posting videos that they
03:54 - want to see so I'm gonna have weekly
03:56 - maybe bi-weekly they'll depend on how
03:59 - many videos I'm doing at one time pulls
04:01 - on the community tab for only members
04:03 - where they'll be able to vote on what
04:05 - videos that I want to that they want to
04:07 - see next what series I should be working
04:08 - on and just anything that I'm thinking
04:10 - of doing if I have some random video
04:12 - ideas I'll post them on there and you
04:14 - guys can say hey yeah that's awesome I
04:15 - want to see that or no don't do that I
04:17 - wouldn't watch it and this feedback is
04:19 - really gonna help me pick what videos
04:21 - I'm doing what I'm working on next and
04:23 - making sure that I'm providing the most
04:24 - value possible to all of you
04:26 - especially the members now as a member
04:29 - you're also gonna have access to a
04:30 - custom emoji your little badge beside
04:32 - your name now that's gonna tell me and
04:34 - everyone else in the comment section
04:36 - that hey you're a member and to me what
04:38 - that means is I should try my best to
04:40 - answer your comment I should try my best
04:41 - to make sure I'm responding to you
04:42 - because again you're someone who's
04:44 - paying money each month to support me
04:46 - and that to me is invaluable so that's
04:48 - the idea behind this member-only concept
04:51 - don't worry nothing's changing there's
04:53 - nothing explicitly exclusive to members
04:55 - other than those poles and the community
04:57 - posts that I've talked about and if you
04:58 - decide to be a higher-up member so one
05:00 - of the higher tiers because what I just
05:02 - described applies to all members
05:03 - then you'll gain access to a discord
05:05 - role as well as early access to the
05:08 - release of my new videos so what that
05:10 - means is let's say I have a video that I
05:11 - have on YouTube ready to go live and
05:14 - it's sitting there for two or three days
05:15 - before it's actually posted to all of
05:17 - you if you remember you'll be able to
05:19 - see that immediately as soon as I upload
05:21 - that video to YouTube so this could mean
05:23 - you get to see a video 12 or 13 hours
05:25 - before I go live or this means you could
05:27 - get to see an entire series you know two
05:29 - or three weeks before the final episode
05:31 - is actually uploaded so take that into
05:33 - consideration if you do want to become a
05:35 - member I don't want to force any of you
05:36 - to do this there's nothing I'm gonna
05:38 - hold out and only give to members other
05:40 - than again the ability to kind of choose
05:41 - the videos that I'm gonna be posting on
05:43 - the channel and I really you know just
05:45 - say thank you in advance to anyone that
05:46 - decides to do that because it really
05:48 - means the world to me and to see people
05:49 - purchasing that which some people
05:51 - already have really shows me that hey
05:53 - you guys appreciate my content you
05:54 - appreciate what I'm doing and you know
05:56 - you've even decided to pay you know one
05:58 - or two dollars a month just to say an
05:59 - extra little thank you so those are the
06:01 - two big things that I need to announce
06:02 - what I'm gonna do now is talk to you a
06:04 - bit about me how my situation has
06:06 - changed a little bit due to kovat 19 and
06:08 - what my plans are for the summer just so
06:10 - you guys are aware so as you know I'm 19
06:13 - full-time university student I'm just
06:15 - about to finish so I'm in Canada about
06:17 - the GTA Area and all the schools here
06:19 - actually closed what that means is we've
06:21 - been doing remote University so no
06:23 - in-person classes so I actually moved
06:24 - back to my parents house now which is
06:26 - why I have this nice beautiful setup
06:28 - compared to my university room from
06:30 - before and I'm about to finish school so
06:32 - I've got three or four days left I'm
06:34 - gonna finish all my exams and then I'm
06:35 - gonna have about a three or four week
06:37 - period before I start at Microsoft as a
06:39 - remote
06:40 - for engineering intern now I'm really
06:42 - excited about this a lot of you been
06:43 - asking me are you still gonna be posting
06:44 - videos or you're still gonna be doing
06:45 - stuff yes guys of course I'm gonna be
06:47 - posting videos tech with Tim he's kind
06:49 - of my priority you know I don't
06:51 - shouldn't really say that I guess but
06:53 - it's what I'm always gonna be working on
06:55 - no matter what I'm doing I'm always
06:56 - gonna have some social media presence
06:58 - and posting things online so don't worry
07:00 - about that if anything Microsoft is
07:01 - gonna give me more content more advice
07:03 - more tips that I can share with you guys
07:05 - now other than that what I'm doing for
07:07 - the rest of the summer is just you know
07:08 - doing that doing the YouTube channel
07:10 - doing the podcast and anything else that
07:12 - comes up so if you guys have ideas for
07:14 - what you want to see on this channel
07:15 - maybe something different maybe like I
07:17 - do 20 or 30 videos where I work on a big
07:19 - project something like that let me know
07:22 - in the comments down below I'm open to
07:23 - all different kinds of things I think
07:24 - we've struck a pretty good balance

07:28 - to face advice videos but let me know
07:30 - what do you guys prefer something like
07:31 - this a video where it's more informal
07:33 - I'm kind of just talking you guys but
