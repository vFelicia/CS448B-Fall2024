00:00 - so the first and number one reason I
00:02 - recommend people learn how to code is
00:04 - that it teaches them how to think and it
00:05 - teaches them how to problem solve when
00:07 - you're programming you are going to
00:09 - encounter hundreds of problems probably
00:11 - every day and you need to be able to
00:13 - break those problems down and that is
00:15 - one of the reasons I personally really
00:17 - like coding because it forces me to
00:19 - think I cannot think of many other
00:21 - situations where I use my brain power as
00:23 - much as when I'm sitting in front of the
00:24 - computer and programming building a
00:26 - mental model of what's going on in this
00:28 - programming language and thinking about
00:30 - the tools that you have and how you can
00:32 - apply them to certain problems is such
00:34 - an important skill and you master that
00:36 - when you get good at programming
