00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome back another
00:10 - slack python bot tutorial
00:12 - so in today's video this one's going to
00:14 - be a lot shorter than the previous ones
00:16 - or
00:16 - fingers crossed we'll see how many
00:17 - mistakes i make what we're going to be
00:18 - doing is handling reactions so
00:20 - essentially when someone reacts to a
00:22 - message how can we handle that and then
00:24 - how can we update that welcome message
00:25 - that we sent
00:26 - previously so let's go ahead and do that
00:28 - the first thing we need to do is go over
00:30 - to
00:31 - our console here so our slack you know
00:33 - api whatever
00:34 - and just add the reactions read
00:37 - permission
00:38 - to our bot scope now i think i showed
00:40 - you how to do this in the last video
00:41 - we added the i am right and the reaction
00:44 - read just make sure you add that in here
00:46 - you may have to reinstall the app again
00:47 - once you add that all right so now that
00:49 - we have that
00:50 - what we're going to do is set up a very
00:51 - similar thing to what we did previously
00:53 - with this message
00:54 - so we're going to say at slack
00:56 - underscore event underscore adapter dot
00:58 - on now you can guess what this one is
01:00 - going to be
01:01 - i'm going to trick to you it's going to
01:02 - be reaction underscore added
01:04 - so this means that we added a reaction
01:07 - now we also need to go back sorry i
01:09 - forgot about this
01:10 - to the slack api and we need to now
01:12 - subscribe to that specific event which i
01:14 - think i actually already did but
01:16 - i'll show you how we change that so
01:18 - let's go subscribe to bot events
01:20 - and yes i already added that but you
01:21 - guys can just say add bot user event
01:23 - and then add reaction added like that
01:26 - we could also add reaction removed if we
01:28 - wanted to i'm not going to do that right
01:30 - now
01:31 - we'll just add reaction at it okay so
01:34 - let's go
01:36 - back now and let's go inside of here
01:38 - let's say define
01:40 - reaction you can call this whatever you
01:42 - want inside of here we're going to take
01:44 - a payload
01:45 - and we're literally just going to copy
01:46 - the first few things we have up here so
01:48 - the event the channel id
01:49 - and the user id all right so event
01:53 - channel id and user id now that we have
01:56 - these things
01:56 - what we're going to do is we're going to
01:58 - say if channel under
02:00 - score id not in
02:03 - and you can guess what this is going to
02:05 - be but it's going to be welcome messages
02:07 - we're going to return so just make sure
02:09 - that when we add this reaction we're
02:11 - actually uh
02:12 - checking to see if it is not if the
02:14 - reaction
02:15 - that we added was in the channel that
02:17 - wasn't where the welcome message was
02:19 - sent then we're not going to actually
02:20 - update the welcome message right and
02:22 - this actually reminds me
02:23 - the payload that's sent here is a little
02:25 - bit different than what was sent
02:26 - previously inside of onmessage so what
02:29 - we're going to have to do inside of here
02:31 - is just changes a tiny bit so rather
02:33 - than having channel id
02:34 - event.getch it seems a little bit weird
02:37 - but we're going to say event.get and
02:39 - inside of here we're going to say item
02:41 - comma empty dictionary and then dot get
02:44 - channel now the reason for this is just
02:46 - because again this payload that's sent
02:48 - back
02:48 - looks a little bit different than the
02:50 - one that's up here so this is just how
02:52 - we can handle that
02:53 - if you want to have a look at the
02:54 - payload you can just print it out and
02:55 - you'll see why i'm doing this but
02:57 - event.getitem the item is the item that
02:59 - we added the reaction on right
03:01 - and then we're getting the channel that
03:02 - that item was in so that's the only
03:04 - major change here but that still is
03:05 - equal to channel id
03:07 - then after this we're going to say
03:09 - welcome
03:10 - equals welcome underscore messages
03:14 - channel and then inside of here we're
03:16 - going to go user underscore id
03:18 - now we might need to change this
03:19 - actually but we'll look at it for right
03:21 - now
03:22 - and sorry this isn't channel my bad we
03:23 - do need to change this to channel id
03:25 - okay so now that we have the welcome
03:27 - message what we're going to do is we're
03:28 - going to say welcome
03:29 - dot completed equals true
03:32 - uh come on completed equals through give
03:34 - me the auto-completion there
03:36 - because once we reacted to the message
03:38 - well now our task is complete right
03:40 - and that will update the message
03:42 - automatically inside of the class if you
03:44 - have a look here
03:45 - where we have the check mark right that
03:46 - will change it now so it actually is a
03:48 - check mark and it's not
03:49 - the white large square all right anyways
03:51 - moving on
03:52 - what we'll do now is we will resend or
03:54 - update this message so to do that we're
03:56 - going to say
03:57 - message equals welcome dot
04:00 - and then get message like that
04:03 - this will give us the updated message
04:05 - that now has the check mark instead of
04:06 - that box
04:07 - what we will do after that is we'll say
04:09 - updated underscore
04:10 - message equals client dot chat
04:13 - underscore
04:14 - update and i don't think it's update
04:16 - message i think it's just update
04:17 - and then inside of here we're gonna go
04:19 - asterix asterix and
04:20 - message all right and then finally we
04:23 - will go
04:24 - welcome dot timestamp equals
04:27 - and we'll change that to be updated
04:29 - message
04:30 - ts all right so let's have a quick look
04:33 - here
04:34 - let's go to slack and oops not there
04:38 - let's go into our channel
04:39 - let's go into test let's send start
04:43 - and let's see if we get the thing
04:46 - popping
04:46 - up what is going on what's wrong well it
04:49 - would help if i ran
04:50 - the server i guess it crashed for some
04:52 - reason okay let's run the server
04:54 - let's go back to slack let's type start
04:57 - we see that we get this dm okay great
05:00 - now let's react to this message
05:01 - so let's give it a reaction boom and
05:04 - give it a second
05:05 - and something went wrong what ran wrong
05:07 - let's see here come on
05:09 - it's not working okay so i just messed
05:12 - around with this for a second and i
05:13 - realized what the problem is here
05:15 - so i've just been printing out and
05:17 - having a look at what the user id is and
05:19 - what the channel id is
05:20 - now the problem here is that what we are
05:23 - actually
05:24 - getting when we get the channel id is
05:26 - different from them
05:27 - what we've stored inside of these
05:29 - welcome messages right
05:30 - so again the reason for that is because
05:32 - what we stored inside the welcome
05:33 - message was simply this f string right
05:35 - which is the
05:36 - at and then the user id now that is
05:38 - different
05:39 - than the channel id now technically they
05:42 - represent the same thing and they'll
05:43 - point us to the same location which is
05:45 - the user's direct message inbox
05:47 - but since they are different i cannot
05:49 - simply check if the channel id
05:51 - is inside of welcome messages so what i
05:54 - can do here is kind of a hacky solution
05:56 - where i do a try catch
05:57 - so i can try to send this message and if
05:59 - it doesn't work just catch it and
06:01 - like cleanly return that would
06:03 - potentially work
06:04 - i also can just check if the at user id
06:07 - is inside of welcome messages
06:09 - so what i could do instead is do
06:10 - something like this if the f string of
06:13 - at and then user id
06:16 - is inside of welcome messages then we
06:19 - can go ahead and do that so let's see if
06:20 - this works first of all because i'm not
06:22 - actually 100 confident that's going to
06:23 - work
06:24 - just based on what's being returned to
06:26 - us here but let's try this
06:28 - so let's go and go do test let's type
06:32 - start
06:33 - let's see the dm come in and let's react
06:35 - to this message i just need to move this
06:37 - more on the screen so reaction
06:40 - let's add that and let's see if this
06:41 - changes no that does not change and
06:43 - let's have a look here
06:44 - what are we getting the problem here we
06:46 - get key error this
06:48 - uh so essentially what is this saying
06:51 - okay so i see the problem here i changed
06:53 - this but i didn't change this which is a
06:55 - big problem so let me just copy this
06:56 - string right here
06:58 - and just paste that inside of here and
06:59 - now this should work so this actually
07:01 - did work that's why it actually gave me
07:02 - that error because we advanced past the
07:04 - return
07:05 - statement so it did find that this user
07:07 - uh like the at
07:09 - user was stored inside of the uh
07:12 - what are we calling here welcome
07:13 - messages so now we can reference it from
07:15 - there
07:16 - and we should be good to go i will go
07:18 - over this after but i just want to make
07:19 - sure this is working before i mislead
07:21 - anyone anymore
07:22 - so let's go start all right let's go
07:24 - back here
07:26 - and let's give a reaction to this
07:28 - message and
07:30 - give it a second and of course it's not
07:32 - working all right so the error i just
07:34 - got there was telling me that the
07:36 - channel id
07:36 - was not found so i'm trying to send back
07:39 - into f at
07:40 - user id and this is not working for some
07:43 - reason
07:44 - there's something wrong with this slack
07:45 - api you know i hate to always blame the
07:48 - api but there's definitely something
07:49 - wrong here with this referencing
07:51 - so what i'm going to have to do is kind
07:52 - of implement some kind of hacky solution
07:54 - to fix this
07:55 - now what i'm going to do is just say
07:57 - welcome dot channel
07:59 - equals and i'm going to make this equal
08:01 - to the channel id
08:02 - before i get the new message what this
08:04 - will do is
08:05 - change the channel for a welcome message
08:07 - to be equal to the actual channel that
08:09 - this dm was sent
08:10 - in that's an id rather than this like at
08:13 - tag that we used before
08:14 - that should hopefully prevent the error
08:16 - that we had previously
08:18 - where we tried again to use this at user
08:20 - id to send the
08:22 - direct message or update the direct
08:24 - message again i don't know why that's
08:26 - not working
08:26 - but this should fix it now a lot of you
08:28 - might be asking well if we do that
08:30 - then we get to this point won't this
08:32 - always skip
08:33 - because we would have changed the
08:34 - channel to not be the at user id
08:36 - now it's equal to channel id well you're
08:39 - correct in that situation but it doesn't
08:40 - matter because we've already reacted and
08:42 - edited the message
08:43 - so it shouldn't matter if we skip over
08:45 - this in fact it's almost better to just
08:47 - not have that key in the welcome message
08:50 - anymore
08:51 - so that we continue to skip over it
08:53 - hopefully that's making sense i really
08:55 - apologize if i'm confusing you guys but
08:57 - there's not really much i can do when
08:58 - this just
08:59 - isn't working let's go to test let's go
09:02 - to start let's type that in
09:05 - hopefully we get our dm well it would be
09:07 - helpful if i ran the server
09:08 - of course i'm just running into all
09:10 - kinds of bugs today
09:12 - so let's go back let's type start see
09:15 - our dm come in
09:16 - now let's react to this message so go
09:18 - react add the cool smiley face
09:21 - give it a second and finally we get to
09:23 - the white check mark
09:25 - popping up so that was definitely very
09:27 - frustrating again i don't know why that
09:28 - was happening but now you can see we
09:29 - edited this message and the time stamp
09:30 - of the message would have been updated
09:32 - in fact
09:33 - if i try to re-react to it you'll notice
09:35 - that nothing's going to happen the time
09:36 - stamp won't change
09:37 - just because again what would happen
09:39 - here is we're going to skip over this
09:41 - because we'll hit this block but no
09:43 - longer will the f user id be stored
09:46 - inside
09:46 - of welcome messages so we won't bother
09:48 - doing the rest of this
09:50 - anyways that has been it for handling
09:52 - reactions now there's more that you can
09:53 - do here but this is how you set up the
09:55 - event
09:55 - and this is how we can modify a message
09:57 - again apologize about the confusion this
10:00 - stuff happens i am human just like all
10:02 - of you
10:02 - and let me know what you guys want to
10:03 - see for the next videos i do not yet
10:05 - have them all planned out
10:06 - as always if you enjoyed make sure to
10:08 - leave a like subscribe to the channel
10:10 - and i will see you in another youtube
10:14 - [Music]
10:16 - video
10:20 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back another slack python bot tutorial so in today's video this one's going to be a lot shorter than the previous ones or fingers crossed we'll see how many mistakes i make what we're going to be doing is handling reactions so essentially when someone reacts to a message how can we handle that and then how can we update that welcome message that we sent previously so let's go ahead and do that the first thing we need to do is go over to our console here so our slack you know api whatever and just add the reactions read permission to our bot scope now i think i showed you how to do this in the last video we added the i am right and the reaction read just make sure you add that in here you may have to reinstall the app again once you add that all right so now that we have that what we're going to do is set up a very similar thing to what we did previously with this message so we're going to say at slack underscore event underscore adapter dot on now you can guess what this one is going to be i'm going to trick to you it's going to be reaction underscore added so this means that we added a reaction now we also need to go back sorry i forgot about this to the slack api and we need to now subscribe to that specific event which i think i actually already did but i'll show you how we change that so let's go subscribe to bot events and yes i already added that but you guys can just say add bot user event and then add reaction added like that we could also add reaction removed if we wanted to i'm not going to do that right now we'll just add reaction at it okay so let's go back now and let's go inside of here let's say define reaction you can call this whatever you want inside of here we're going to take a payload and we're literally just going to copy the first few things we have up here so the event the channel id and the user id all right so event channel id and user id now that we have these things what we're going to do is we're going to say if channel under score id not in and you can guess what this is going to be but it's going to be welcome messages we're going to return so just make sure that when we add this reaction we're actually uh checking to see if it is not if the reaction that we added was in the channel that wasn't where the welcome message was sent then we're not going to actually update the welcome message right and this actually reminds me the payload that's sent here is a little bit different than what was sent previously inside of onmessage so what we're going to have to do inside of here is just changes a tiny bit so rather than having channel id event.getch it seems a little bit weird but we're going to say event.get and inside of here we're going to say item comma empty dictionary and then dot get channel now the reason for this is just because again this payload that's sent back looks a little bit different than the one that's up here so this is just how we can handle that if you want to have a look at the payload you can just print it out and you'll see why i'm doing this but event.getitem the item is the item that we added the reaction on right and then we're getting the channel that that item was in so that's the only major change here but that still is equal to channel id then after this we're going to say welcome equals welcome underscore messages channel and then inside of here we're going to go user underscore id now we might need to change this actually but we'll look at it for right now and sorry this isn't channel my bad we do need to change this to channel id okay so now that we have the welcome message what we're going to do is we're going to say welcome dot completed equals true uh come on completed equals through give me the autocompletion there because once we reacted to the message well now our task is complete right and that will update the message automatically inside of the class if you have a look here where we have the check mark right that will change it now so it actually is a check mark and it's not the white large square all right anyways moving on what we'll do now is we will resend or update this message so to do that we're going to say message equals welcome dot and then get message like that this will give us the updated message that now has the check mark instead of that box what we will do after that is we'll say updated underscore message equals client dot chat underscore update and i don't think it's update message i think it's just update and then inside of here we're gonna go asterix asterix and message all right and then finally we will go welcome dot timestamp equals and we'll change that to be updated message ts all right so let's have a quick look here let's go to slack and oops not there let's go into our channel let's go into test let's send start and let's see if we get the thing popping up what is going on what's wrong well it would help if i ran the server i guess it crashed for
