00:03 - foreign
00:08 - I'll share with you the skills that you
00:11 - need to have to become a back-end python
00:13 - developer I'm taking these skills from
00:15 - my knowledge as well as doing some
00:16 - research and looking at some recent job
00:18 - postings relating to python positions so
00:21 - that said let's get into the video after
00:23 - a quick word from our sponsor before we
00:26 - get started I need to thank lenode for
00:27 - sponsoring this video I've been using
00:30 - and working with lenode for nearly three
00:32 - years now and they've consistently been
00:33 - my go-to choice for hosting my
00:35 - applications and servers in fact right
00:38 - now I'm using the node to host the
00:39 - official Tech with Tim Discord bot a
00:41 - website multiple of my domains and a
00:43 - kubernetes cluster now lenode was just
00:46 - recently acquired by Akamai and as a
00:48 - part of this acquisition they're going
00:49 - to be adding more than a dozen new data
00:51 - centers around the world in the next
00:53 - year lenode makes it super easy to spin
00:55 - up servers with their one-click app
00:56 - Marketplace and have tons of written
00:58 - guides and YouTube videos on their
01:00 - channel to help you get started now if
01:02 - you're having any issues you can reach
01:03 - out to the 24 7 support team and
01:06 - actually talk with a real human being
01:08 - now the node's pricing is simple with no
01:10 - hidden fees and full transparency and
01:12 - you can test out the node services for
01:14 - free by using the link in the
01:15 - description and claiming in a hundred
01:17 - dollar sixty day credit for any new
01:19 - accounts it's been an absolute pleasure
01:21 - to work with lenode over the past few
01:23 - years and one last thank you to them for
01:25 - sponsoring this video alright so let's
01:27 - go ahead and dive in now I quickly want
01:29 - to mention if you haven't already heard
01:31 - I just released a brand new course it's
01:32 - called blockchain expert if you're
01:34 - looking to get into web 3 learn about
01:36 - blockchain Technology's solidity web3
01:39 - fundamentals Etc then check it out from
01:41 - the link in the description I know you
01:42 - guys will find some value but that said
01:44 - though let's get into the skills
01:48 - now obviously you can land a python
01:50 - developer position without having
01:52 - everything on this list but I think if
01:54 - you want it to be considered for kind of
01:56 - a like let's say mid-level or maybe even
01:58 - a higher level position you would need
02:00 - to have everything here that said I'm
02:02 - sure you could join as kind of a junior
02:03 - python developer or a junior back-end
02:05 - developer and work your way up and learn
02:07 - some of the missing skills if you didn't
02:09 - have all of so the first thing you're
02:10 - going to have to have here pretty
02:12 - obvious is python skills you need to
02:14 - understand python fundamentals I don't
02:16 - think you need to be an expert in Python
02:18 - you don't have to know everything about
02:19 - like generators uh iterators uh meta
02:23 - classes all of that kind of advanced
02:24 - syntax but I would know for Loops
02:27 - functions classes objects and a lot of
02:29 - the common and core syntax and
02:32 - functionality that you'd use on an
02:33 - everyday basis
02:37 - okay so moving on to the second skill
02:39 - you would need to have to become a
02:40 - back-end python developer this may seem
02:42 - a little counter-intuitive but this is
02:44 - some basic front-end skills now whenever
02:47 - you're working on the back end you're
02:48 - still going to be touching aspects of
02:49 - the front end even if you're not writing
02:51 - front end code you might have to
02:52 - understand it digest it kind of look at
02:54 - it and read it and for that reason you
02:57 - should understand some basic HTML basic
02:59 - CSS you should understand maybe a little
03:01 - bit of JavaScript again you don't need
03:03 - to be an expert or a master in this but
03:05 - you need to have some fluency and the
03:07 - ability to at least read some of that
03:09 - code so I would spend a bit of time
03:11 - maybe a week or two kind of looking into
03:13 - some of those skills learning how to
03:14 - build some basic front ends maybe you
03:16 - want to dabble in something like react
03:17 - view angular some other popular
03:19 - Frameworks that's up to you but I would
03:22 - know some basic front-end skills
03:26 - now beyond that knowledge the next thing
03:28 - that you would need to know to become a
03:30 - back-end python developer is some basic
03:32 - networking skills now I think you could
03:35 - probably get away without having this
03:36 - but I would highly recommend spending a
03:38 - few days learning about basic networking
03:41 - so learning about HTTP what is that
03:43 - protocol how does that work how do you
03:45 - serve data over the web learning about
03:48 - IP addresses learning about say
03:50 - firewalls learning about vpns and just
03:53 - again kind of fundamental things related
03:55 - to networking maybe you want to learn
03:57 - why localhost works the way it does
03:59 - about different ports about you know
04:01 - kind of standard ports you'd have for a
04:03 - website versus ports for other services
04:05 - again just some fundamental knowledge in
04:07 - this area I think will go a long way so
04:09 - I would learn about basic Networks
04:13 - now moving beyond networking the next
04:15 - thing I would learn is related to Linux
04:17 - and also I'll clarify here I wouldn't
04:19 - learn these necessarily in any
04:20 - particular order I think the order I
04:22 - have is actually decent but just
04:23 - throwing it out there you can kind of
04:24 - learn this in any order so let me take
04:26 - that back the next thing just something
04:28 - I would learn would be Linux now you
04:31 - want to learn about how to operate in a
04:33 - Linux environment so what different
04:35 - Linux users are Linux permissions Linux
04:37 - commands how do you copy paste move
04:39 - files around you want to be comfortable
04:41 - working on just strictly the command
04:43 - line and not relying on a graphical user
04:45 - interface now I actually have an entire
04:47 - Linux tutorial series that's designed
04:49 - specifically for programmers looking to
04:52 - kind of learn this basic knowledge so
04:54 - I'll link that in the description in
04:55 - case you're curious it is completely
04:57 - free
04:58 - right
04:59 - so next after learning Linux I would
05:02 - start learning Django and flask which
05:04 - are web Frameworks that utilize now
05:06 - these are great to learn regardless if
05:08 - you want to be a python backend
05:09 - developer but I think if you want to be
05:10 - a backend developer you're going to have
05:12 - to be competent with these Frameworks
05:13 - and learn more than just the basics you
05:16 - want to learn kind of the intermediate
05:17 - and advanced topics within this and be
05:19 - very comfortable writing code in Django
05:21 - and flask now flask is the more basic of
05:25 - these two Frameworks so I would start by
05:26 - learning that understand how to create a
05:29 - website with it how to create an API
05:30 - with it how to do security
05:31 - authentication logging in logging out
05:34 - you may even want to look at websockets
05:36 - using flask that could be a cool project
05:38 - next though you want to get into Django
05:40 - now Django is a lot more complicated it
05:42 - has many more tools and features but
05:44 - it's used by large companies like
05:45 - Instagram Spotify Mozilla National
05:48 - Geographic and a bunch of other ones as
05:51 - well so just learning Django will open
05:53 - you up to a lot of job opportunities but
05:55 - again you want to be learning about
05:56 - authentication page routing how to do
05:58 - apis more Advanced features Django
06:01 - extensions databases specifically
06:04 - databases and learning the kind of
06:05 - database model within Django that's a
06:08 - bit complicated but something you
06:09 - definitely need to learn if you want to
06:11 - be a back-end python developer
06:14 - now Beyond Django the next thing that I
06:17 - would start looking into is API design
06:19 - and just apis in general learning about
06:21 - kind of how those work the different
06:23 - routes you can set up crud apis more
06:25 - complex apis and specifically related to
06:29 - kind of permissions and authentications
06:30 - around that personally I always find
06:32 - that the most complicated stuff is doing
06:34 - authentication specifically token
06:36 - authentication or other aspects of
06:38 - authentication where you have a refresh
06:39 - token an expiry date you have maybe
06:41 - username password authentication there's
06:43 - a lot of different ways to do this and
06:45 - it's going to change depending on the
06:46 - framework that you're using so I would
06:48 - be really really comfortable creating
06:50 - apis designing apis working with
06:52 - Frameworks like Django and flask maybe
06:54 - even fast API and just be comfortable
06:56 - doing this almost know how to do it kind
06:58 - of off the top of your head to spin up a
07:00 - quick API add some authorization or
07:02 - authentication understand what JWT
07:04 - tokens are and all the other stuff that
07:06 - you're going to be using frequently if
07:08 - you're a back-end developer now beyond
07:10 - that I would also look at stuff like
07:11 - rate limiting how you host your apis how
07:13 - you make make sure your apis are secure
07:15 - and not being hit by too many people
07:17 - there's all kinds of stuff to look at in
07:19 - this and I'm no expert in this field but
07:21 - those are some of the things I would
07:23 - start really kind of researching if I
07:25 - was thinking about becoming a more
07:26 - full-time python back-end development
07:30 - so next we move on to probably my least
07:33 - favorite topic but this is databases now
07:36 - the reality is if you want to be a
07:37 - back-end developer of any kind you have
07:39 - to understand databases this is a very
07:42 - very important part of your job and you
07:44 - need to know how to create databases
07:45 - delete them migrate them do maintenance
07:47 - on them add new tables add relationships
07:50 - do database design how to host databases
07:53 - how to protect and secure your databases
07:55 - there is so much stuff relating to data
07:57 - how to back up your databases how to
07:59 - part put part of your database in
08:00 - another database and access it from
08:02 - somewhere else there is so much stuff
08:04 - related to this and that's going to come
08:06 - with learning SQL now there's a lot of
08:07 - companies now that are using nosql
08:09 - databases for example my startup
08:11 - velocity uses a nosql database which is
08:14 - Firebase however
08:16 - um you know it's probably a good idea to
08:17 - understand SQL and I myself took I think
08:20 - two SQL courses in University sorry for
08:22 - the cut there you can see my cap behind
08:24 - me was about to be stopping my recording
08:26 - so I had to step in there and fix that
08:27 - but as I was saying you need to learn
08:29 - SQL you need to understand how to
08:31 - structure databases create them query
08:33 - them run SQL commands and I would also
08:35 - be familiar with nosql databases and
08:38 - understand a little bit about how to
08:39 - structure your data in a nosql database
08:41 - because that's different than working
08:42 - with a SQL database with a nosql
08:45 - database you're fairly Limited in terms
08:47 - of query operations due to the limited
08:49 - structure that's imposed so the way you
08:51 - structure your data is much different
08:53 - and you end up having a lot of redundant
08:55 - data that's actually kind of part of the
08:57 - design process of working with a nosql
08:59 - database anyways look into that you're
09:02 - going to have to understand SQL I would
09:04 - kind of focus there and then maybe just
09:05 - learn a bit about nosql to kind of have
09:07 - some experience with that in case a job
09:09 - required
09:11 - so last thing on my list here is
09:13 - something that really should be its own
09:15 - job and with a lot of companies it is
09:17 - however if you're working maybe for a
09:18 - smaller company or I don't know some
09:20 - companies just require this you have to
09:22 - have devops skills now this really means
09:25 - your experience working with the cloud
09:26 - you understand how to deploy how to host
09:29 - specific things how to go in there and
09:31 - maybe change something do some
09:32 - maintenance uh you should have
09:34 - experience working in a cloud
09:35 - environment like AWS Azure Google Cloud
09:38 - whatever it is this company uses usually
09:41 - they require some experience in that
09:43 - specific environment now again I really
09:45 - feel like this is its own job there is
09:48 - so much stuff to learn related to devops
09:50 - and I mean this could be a whole video
09:51 - on its own how to be a devops engineer
09:53 - which I'm not even really qualified to
09:54 - talk about the reality is that a lot of
09:57 - companies are requiring this right so I
09:58 - think having a little bit of experience
10:00 - with this being able to not look like
10:01 - you don't have any experience is
10:03 - probably what you're going for in this
10:05 - category so yeah learn a little bit of
10:07 - devops now I will lastly mention you
10:10 - also of course want to learn Git Version
10:11 - Control GitHub I think that goes without
10:12 - saying so I didn't really mention it too
10:14 - explicitly but I would definitely learn
10:16 - that and that's pretty much a
10:18 - requirement for any programming job so
10:20 - that's it guys I'm going to start
10:21 - wrapping it up here make sure to check
10:23 - out blockchain expert from the link in
10:24 - the description if you're interested in
10:26 - web3 or blockchain Technologies and you
10:28 - want to become a blockchain engineer
10:30 - with that said I will see you in another
10:31 - YouTube video
10:33 - [Music]
10:38 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

foreign I'll share with you the skills that you need to have to become a backend python developer I'm taking these skills from my knowledge as well as doing some research and looking at some recent job postings relating to python positions so that said let's get into the video after a quick word from our sponsor before we get started I need to thank lenode for sponsoring this video I've been using and working with lenode for nearly three years now and they've consistently been my goto choice for hosting my applications and servers in fact right now I'm using the node to host the official Tech with Tim Discord bot a website multiple of my domains and a kubernetes cluster now lenode was just recently acquired by Akamai and as a part of this acquisition they're going to be adding more than a dozen new data centers around the world in the next year lenode makes it super easy to spin up servers with their oneclick app Marketplace and have tons of written guides and YouTube videos on their channel to help you get started now if you're having any issues you can reach out to the 24 7 support team and actually talk with a real human being now the node's pricing is simple with no hidden fees and full transparency and you can test out the node services for free by using the link in the description and claiming in a hundred dollar sixty day credit for any new accounts it's been an absolute pleasure to work with lenode over the past few years and one last thank you to them for sponsoring this video alright so let's go ahead and dive in now I quickly want to mention if you haven't already heard I just released a brand new course it's called blockchain expert if you're looking to get into web 3 learn about blockchain Technology's solidity web3 fundamentals Etc then check it out from the link in the description I know you guys will find some value but that said though let's get into the skills now obviously you can land a python developer position without having everything on this list but I think if you want it to be considered for kind of a like let's say midlevel or maybe even a higher level position you would need to have everything here that said I'm
