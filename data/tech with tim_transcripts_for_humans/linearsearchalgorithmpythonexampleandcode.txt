00:06 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:09 - YouTube video so today I'm going to be
00:11 - starting a new series on my channel and
00:13 - this is gonna be an algorithm series so
00:15 - pretty much in this series I'm gonna go
00:17 - through a series of different algorithms
00:19 - that could be searching algorithms
00:21 - sorting algorithms path finding
00:23 - algorithms you name it and I'm gonna be
00:25 - telling you the complexity of the
00:26 - algorithm and then showing you a an
00:29 - example of it in Python so today I
00:31 - already have this example typed up and
00:33 - we're just gonna be doing the most
00:35 - simple one that I could think of at
00:36 - least today which is the linear search
00:38 - algorithm now what this algorithm does
00:40 - is exactly how its named it pretty much
00:42 - looks through a list
00:44 - Lenard linearly and tries to find an
00:48 - element in it and that if it finds that
00:49 - element it will return the index of that
00:51 - element so I'll show you it working here
00:54 - before I go into how exactly it works
00:56 - and you can see so we've looked for the
00:59 - element 43 in a random list of integers
01:02 - I've created here and we can see we get
01:04 - the index 22 I go to about 22 we should
01:07 - be able to find 43 let's see here
01:15 - three right here and that is at the 22nd
01:18 - index that looks about right so we know
01:19 - that the program is indeed working now
01:22 - the complexity of this algorithm which
01:25 - pretty much means the efficiency of it
01:27 - is simply n so we have the Big O
01:31 - notation of N and that means that in the
01:33 - worst case scenario of this algorithm it
01:36 - will take n meaning the amount of
01:38 - elements in the list time to find that
01:40 - element or that many comparisons for
01:43 - example so I'll give you an example here
01:46 - if I make a list like this and I go 1 4
01:50 - 3 5 6 doesn't really matter what numbers
01:53 - I'm putting here I'm just putting some
01:54 - rounded numbers and say for example we
01:56 - are looking for the element 2 5 we want
01:59 - to know what index element 5 is that
02:00 - obviously it's right here now the way
02:02 - that this algorithm works is it has to
02:04 - look through each element in list so it
02:07 - starts at the beginning and moves to the
02:08 - end without skipping any algorithm so
02:10 - chain any item sorry without swapping
02:13 - any items without removing any items it
02:15 - just looks at every single item so we
02:17 - look at one it's not one it's not four
02:19 - it's not three here we go
02:20 - and we're at five now we return the
02:23 - third indices like that
02:26 - thing with this algorithm is though and
02:28 - the reason has the conflicts D of n is
02:30 - say for example we are looking for the
02:31 - element two well the element two
02:33 - obviously is at the very end of the list
02:35 - we can see that here but the program
02:37 - doesn't know that he has to look through
02:38 - every single element in the list until
02:41 - eventually we find the element two now
02:44 - this is the worst case scenario for this
02:45 - algorithm and in that the last element
02:49 - is the one that we're looking for as it
02:52 - has to look through every single element
02:53 - first now this actually works in the
02:56 - reverse order though what if the element
02:58 - we're looking for is one well we only
03:01 - have to look through one element before
03:03 - we find that element because it's right
03:05 - there so that's obviously gonna be
03:07 - extremely fast and if we get that we're
03:10 - extremely lucky now in most cases for
03:12 - this algorithm the item you're looking
03:14 - for will be near the middle of the list
03:16 - where in that case it's gonna take well
03:19 - half the time so n divided by two
03:21 - I hope that makes sense for how this how
03:23 - this works
03:24 - so let's look in our function here you
03:26 - can ignore this it's just creates a
03:27 - random list and this is it this is the
03:30 - whole algorithm yes I know there's other
03:32 - ways to write this algorithm but this is
03:34 - just the way that I chose just using a
03:36 - simple for loop so pretty much we have a
03:38 - list and we have an element we're gonna
03:41 - look through every element in the list
03:42 - like this and if the elements in the
03:46 - list is equal to the element that we're
03:47 - looking for we're just going to return
03:48 - that into C like that now say we get
03:51 - through the entire list and that element
03:53 - is not in the list then we've just
03:56 - returned negative one now the advantages
03:58 - of this algorithm the first one
04:00 - obviously is it's extremely simple very
04:02 - easy to use only takes up well four or
04:05 - five lines like this the second
04:08 - advantage of it it's good for small data
04:09 - sets so say if you only have like ten
04:11 - elements 20 elements you're trying to
04:13 - find something it's perfectly fine to
04:15 - use this just keep it simple and it also
04:18 - you don't have to have a sorted list so
04:21 - in the next algorithm that I'm going to
04:22 - be showing which is gonna be the binary
04:24 - sort algorithm which is a lot faster
04:26 - than this one for large data sets you
04:28 - already have to have the list sorted
04:30 - before you can do that so that's going
04:32 - to take up some time obviously as you
04:33 - have to have to sort the list so this
04:35 - one is gonna be good to use if you have
04:36 - small lists and yeah so I'll show it
04:39 - show you it working again
04:40 - here click enter we get negative one and
04:43 - that's because 43 wasn't in this list
04:46 - again run it again yeah 1343 should be
04:50 - at that 13 embassy which is right here
04:53 - so obviously we know that this works
04:55 - it's extremely simple so if you guys
04:57 - enjoyed this video and it helped you out
04:58 - please leave me a like and subscribe and
05:01 - if you have any ideas for future videos
05:04 - doesn't even have to be different
05:05 - algorithms just leave a comment down
05:06 - below I'll be sure to respond to you and
05:08 - hopefully make a video on that
