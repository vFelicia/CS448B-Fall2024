00:00 - so project one is kind of the
00:01 - traditional project that I like to
00:03 - recommend to everyone when you're just
00:04 - starting out and this is a bank account
00:06 - that's really critical to understand as
00:09 - you become a blockchain developer how to
00:11 - send and receive ethereum in a safe way
00:13 - to a Smart contract how to maintain user
00:16 - balances and if you wanted to get crazy
00:18 - you could do stuff like having an
00:20 - interest rate on funds that were sent
00:22 - into the bank account right so if you're
00:23 - holding funds in the bank account you
00:25 - get a very small interest rate like you
00:27 - would in a normal bank so that would be
00:28 - my goal for this first project create a
00:30 - bank account contract test it deploy it
00:33 - write a basic front-end to interact with
00:35 - it and now you've learned how to send
00:36 - and receive ethereum properly
