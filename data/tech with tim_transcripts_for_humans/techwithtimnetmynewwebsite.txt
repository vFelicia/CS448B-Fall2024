00:00 - hey guys and welcome to a very special
00:02 - video so I've actually been waiting to
00:05 - record this video for probably about a
00:06 - month or two and it's finally here and
00:10 - I'm really excited about it and I want
00:12 - to officially release and tell you guys
00:14 - about my website tech with Tim net so
00:18 - right now if you guys are not gonna
00:19 - watch through the whole video which I'm
00:21 - just gonna explain and go through the
00:22 - website please do me a favor and just
00:24 - click on the website link just go
00:26 - through click on a few pages it takes
00:28 - you literally like five seconds and
00:30 - actually helps me out a ton so if you
00:32 - guys aren't going to go through the
00:33 - video at least do me that favor and just
00:35 - click on the link in the description
00:36 - because that really does help me out and
00:38 - it costs you guys absolutely nothing so
00:41 - anyways I want to talk about my website
00:43 - tech with Tim net so I've been working
00:45 - on this website for probably about the
00:46 - past two months just writing tutorials
00:48 - getting everything set up doing a lot of
00:51 - coding and stuff like that and reason
00:53 - it's taking me so long is because I've
00:54 - pretty much had to write text-based
00:57 - tutorials for almost every video that I
00:59 - have on my channel but I'm glad I did it
01:01 - and I'm really excited to show this to
01:03 - you guys so make sure you watch through
01:04 - the videos I'm gonna explain like how
01:06 - this website benefits you so I think the
01:08 - most important thing is probably this
01:11 - this forum page okay so this is the home
01:13 - page you guys can read through that I'm
01:15 - not gonna bore you with that but I'll go
01:17 - to the forum page here and this is what
01:19 - I think is really exciting and you guys
01:21 - should be excited about because on here
01:23 - I've just started a forum that has
01:25 - topics for all of my major kind of
01:27 - tutorial series so any of you guys are
01:30 - subscriber so probably at some point had
01:32 - some issues coding or some problems
01:34 - where you required help and a lot of you
01:36 - guys have been asking me for help on
01:37 - discord and I love that and I try to
01:39 - help you guys out as much as I can but
01:41 - I'm getting to the point now where I
01:42 - can't help everyone in one day I just
01:45 - simply don't have enough time with what
01:47 - I'm doing and the amount of questions I
01:48 - get so what I've done is I've started
01:50 - this forum that is gonna allow you guys
01:52 - to kind of help each other and that I
01:55 - can kind of prioritize questions on this
01:57 - forum so essentially from now on if you
02:00 - guys have questions I would recommend
02:01 - you to hop over to this forum page I'm
02:03 - gonna leave the link in like every video
02:05 - description and just post a question in
02:08 - this forum because I get email notified
02:10 - whenever you guys do that and I can help
02:12 - you out and answer
02:13 - here in that way other people that have
02:15 - similar questions can see the thread and
02:17 - they can look at that for the answer as
02:20 - well and essentially if you guys ask me
02:21 - questions on videos that's fine but what
02:23 - I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna copy your
02:24 - question
02:25 - paint making a new topic in the forum
02:27 - and then answer it and then I'll just
02:29 - leave the link like underneath your like
02:31 - as a reply to your comment so you guys
02:33 - can have a look at it but it will be on
02:34 - this forum page okay so this is really
02:37 - exciting please guys don't hesitate to
02:39 - make threads ask questions it's this is
02:42 - an awesome thing I have a ton of
02:43 - different topics and there's general
02:45 - topics as well you can just ask like any
02:46 - kind of question about Python okay and I
02:49 - already know that I have a ton of people
02:51 - on my channel that love to help you guys
02:52 - out I already see them on in the
02:54 - descriptions like commenting back to
02:56 - people that's awesome so I would
02:57 - encourage you guys to answer topics on
02:59 - the threads and yeah and the next really
03:02 - exciting page is this tutorials page so
03:05 - essentially this has all of the major
03:07 - tutorials on my channel in text-based
03:11 - version as well as the video so
03:13 - essentially you guys can pick a topic so
03:14 - this is like Python programming
03:16 - tutorials this is game development
03:18 - module walkthroughs machine learning
03:20 - which is coming out soon and if you want
03:22 - to know the exact date you can go follow
03:24 - my Twitter right here because I have it
03:25 - posted on there Java programming
03:28 - tutorials those aren't done yet for the
03:29 - text base but they will be done soon so
03:32 - let's just say for example we go to
03:33 - Python programming tutorials you can see
03:36 - the four main topics I have on this o
03:38 - classes and objects tic-tac-toe game
03:40 - intermediate beginner let's say we go to
03:42 - beginner it gives you and this is the
03:45 - same for all of my tutorials it's gonna
03:47 - give you an overview of the series what
03:49 - you're gonna learn and then some
03:50 - prerequisites in case there's something
03:52 - you should know before starting the
03:53 - series once you're ready you can
03:55 - obviously click get started and on the
03:57 - right side you can see all of the
03:59 - different topics that are in this series
04:00 - and you can see that we have the video
04:02 - that's already up on YouTube and then
04:04 - there's a whole text-based version of it
04:06 - pretty much exactly what I talked about
04:07 - in the video obviously it's not as
04:09 - extensive but it's kind of a quick
04:11 - summary and it goes through and has all
04:13 - of the code that I use in my videos so
04:15 - let's actually just do an example here
04:17 - because I think this might benefit some
04:19 - of you more so if I go to pygame
04:20 - and I go to like Tetris tutorial and
04:23 - let's just skip to tutorial 4 okay
04:26 - you guys can see that I have all of the
04:27 - code that I use kind of briefly
04:29 - explained and then if you go all the way
04:31 - down to the bottom I have like the full
04:33 - code which I would usually post on paste
04:35 - bin or github and this is really awesome
04:38 - because paceman sometimes has bugs and
04:41 - people say that they can't like copy the
04:43 - code properly so this way you guys can
04:45 - just copy and paste it with no issues
04:46 - and it's really easy and it's all in one
04:48 - place on tech with Tim net to find
04:51 - obviously I have a support and donate
04:53 - page so some of you guys have already
04:54 - donated to me and that's amazing thank
04:56 - you guys so much but if you guys do
04:58 - benefit from the content you know I
05:00 - don't make a lot of money off this so I
05:01 - really appreciate it if anything that
05:04 - you could possibly donate unive it's
05:05 - just a dollar a dollar month dollar one
05:07 - time really does show me a lot of
05:09 - support the amount doesn't really matter
05:11 - just the fact that you guys are showing
05:14 - that you're supporting the content is
05:15 - what really matters to me so I have a
05:16 - PayPal donation and a patreon link if
05:19 - you want to support me on a monthly
05:20 - basis again like these are all the
05:23 - different tutorials and these are just
05:25 - the main like series on my channels I'm
05:28 - probably not gonna do like individual
05:30 - videos on here because it's kind of hard
05:32 - to organize them I might just post all
05:34 - the code so that you guys can go come to
05:35 - the website to get the code but yeah so
05:38 - I'm really excited about this website I
05:40 - think this is gonna be awesome for both
05:42 - of us it's an ongoing project it's by
05:44 - its note by no means done I have a ton
05:46 - of work to do on it but I'm now at the
05:48 - point where I feel comfortable releasing
05:49 - it to you guys so if you see any bugs or
05:52 - an errors broken links please don't
05:54 - hesitate to let me know let me know on
05:56 - Twitter discord just a comment on a
05:57 - video because obviously I want to fix it
06:00 - and make it as good as possible but full
06:02 - disclosure I have not proof read most of
06:04 - these things that I've written because
06:05 - I've just been focused on getting them
06:07 - out so you see like spelling errors and
06:08 - grammatical errors I know they can be
06:10 - annoying to read through but please just
06:12 - bear with me I still have a lot of work
06:14 - to do on this website and you guys are
06:15 - gonna see kind of the growth and and how
06:17 - big this is gonna get so this is really
06:19 - the next step for tech with Tim from now
06:22 - on any big series or videos that have
06:25 - more than like one video like a part two
06:27 - a part three I'm gonna be posting on
06:29 - this website and yeah so this is amazing
06:32 - please guys do me a favor just check out
06:34 - the website even if you don't want to go
06:35 - through any of the tutorials and you may
06:37 - even find that there's some stuff on
06:38 - here you didn't know
06:39 - I had on my channel like the game
06:41 - development stuff a lot of people don't
06:42 - know that I have all these different
06:44 - tutorials and like regular Python
06:47 - programming a lot of people don't know
06:48 - that I have intermediate Python
06:49 - programming writer classes and objects
06:51 - tutorial so please do me a favor go
06:54 - check out the website it would mean a
06:55 - ton to me and I guess only the last page
06:58 - that shows this community page but I'm

07:42 - these it's password-protected so you're
