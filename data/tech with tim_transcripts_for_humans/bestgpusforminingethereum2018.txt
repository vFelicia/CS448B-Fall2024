00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another youtube
00:03 - video in today's video i'm gonna be
00:04 - talking about mining and the best
00:06 - graphics cards to use for mining
00:08 - aetherium so aetherium you can see right
00:11 - here we've got a price of 310 u.s.
00:14 - dollars and this hasn't been the highest
00:17 - price aetherium is hot it's been if I go
00:19 - to the one-year mark here we can look at
00:21 - the graph and we've seen it skyrocketed
00:23 - up to almost 400 at some points and now
00:25 - we're just balancing out at about 300 so
00:28 - aetherium is definitely still here in
00:30 - the market place and there's a lot of
00:31 - people mining it and selling it so it's
00:32 - a great time to get in and start mining
00:35 - so that being said I'm just gonna be
00:38 - reviewing the performance versus the
00:41 - cost of some of the graphics cards on
00:43 - the market where the best graphics cards
00:45 - in my opinion on the market so let's get
00:47 - started right away just talking about
00:49 - the gtx 1070 so I've got this Amazon
00:52 - link up right here and you can see
00:55 - immediately the price well the stock
00:57 - price is six hundred ten dollars
00:58 - Canadian but right now it's on sale for
01:01 - five hundred sixty four dollars so the
01:03 - hash rate on this gtx 1070 is about
01:07 - twenty-seven mega hashes stalk again
01:10 - this really depends on what model of
01:13 - card you get some of them you're gonna
01:15 - get lower you're gonna get twenty four
01:16 - twenty five some of them you're gonna
01:18 - get much higher you might even get to
01:20 - twenty nine and this is again just the
01:21 - stalk so if you were to overclock this
01:25 - card you could get a lot more
01:26 - performance out of it
01:28 - so personally I do recommend this card
01:30 - as it is a pretty hefty price but not
01:33 - compared to the the next cards that
01:35 - we're going to talk about so for example
01:36 - the 1080 Ti and this one will definitely
01:39 - get the job done and it is overclockable
01:41 - obviously as all graphics cards are and
01:43 - you can get about twenty seven mega hash
01:45 - stock so you can probably get it up to
01:47 - about thirty buy overclocking alright so
01:50 - let's get down to the next one now so
01:52 - now we're going to talk about the gtx
01:54 - ten atti
01:55 - so immediately we can see a huge price
01:58 - difference here almost double the price
01:59 - so again right now it's on sale but
02:02 - usually it costs eleven hundred dollars
02:04 - now the question here is is it worth it
02:07 - so the stock make a hash per second on
02:12 - this card is
02:13 - actually about 30 to make a hash per
02:15 - second again obviously depends on what
02:18 - company you're getting it from and if
02:21 - you get lucky with the card some card
02:23 - some different companies can just range
02:25 - by mega hashes just by the way that
02:27 - they're built in the quality so you're
02:29 - gonna get about thirty to stock again
02:32 - overclocking you can probably bump this
02:33 - up to about thirty seven I've seen some
02:36 - people getting thirty eight out of it
02:37 - which is pretty amazing so is it worth
02:40 - your money well yes or no so it's an
02:43 - extra $500 $600 and you're only getting
02:48 - about at max ten mega hash per second
02:52 - more and that's if you overclock it
02:53 - versus the gtx 1070 so i'll let you be
02:56 - the judge of that but personally I
02:58 - wouldn't get these cards remaining as
03:00 - they have a huge capital startup cost
03:02 - and especially if you're not a huge
03:04 - miner and you're only gonna have two or
03:05 - three cards in your rig this one is kind
03:08 - of too expensive and it does draw a ton
03:11 - of electricity too especially this model
03:13 - with the three fans so I would probably
03:15 - go with a ten seventy in this case okay
03:18 - so now that we've gone through the top
03:20 - two Nvidia cards let's go over to AMD so
03:23 - we're gonna start talking about the 480
03:25 - so the RX 480 is not as good as the
03:28 - other cards I've talked about but for
03:30 - the price it gets the job done so a
03:33 - stock mega hash for this card is about
03:35 - between 22 and 24 mega hash per second
03:38 - now with these AMD cards you can
03:40 - actually modify the BIOS to get a lot
03:43 - more performance out of these cards and
03:44 - again you can obviously overclock them
03:46 - and get them up to about maybe 28 29
03:48 - mega hash per second so personally I own
03:50 - one of these cards and it hashes for me
03:52 - at stock at about 23 mega hash per
03:55 - second and with overclocking I can bump
03:57 - it up to about 27 and again this one is
04:00 - used for 375 they're very hard to come
04:03 - by right now you can't really find too
04:05 - many new ones for a decent price
04:08 - I'd say new for this card is maybe
04:10 - around $500 if you can find it but you
04:13 - can also pick up a bunch of them on eBay
04:14 - and Newegg as well they have some Rx for
04:17 - eighties as well so now let's move on to
04:19 - the rx 5 II okay so as this is a model
04:23 - higher than the RX 480
04:25 - you would assume it is a lot better
04:27 - well as it does get better mega hashes
04:30 - so it gets between 25 and 26 mega hash
04:32 - per second on stock there is an issue
04:34 - with this card that has been noticed so
04:36 - when you're mining aetherium there's
04:39 - something called the e posh so right now
04:41 - I believe we're on about 144 143 but as
04:45 - time goes on this card has continually
04:48 - gone down in performance so back in one
04:50 - at the 130 posh this card was getting
04:54 - about 30 mega hash per second and
04:55 - currently it's getting about 25 to 26 on
04:59 - stock so that's something to look at
05:01 - with this card when you're mining with
05:04 - it as time goes on the performance is
05:05 - gonna get worse now if we look at the
05:08 - price here it's cheaper than all of the
05:10 - other cards so is it worth it to get
05:13 - this card well if you're just starting
05:16 - up mining this isn't a bad card to get
05:18 - and you if you find out that you want to
05:21 - get better cards later on you could
05:22 - always sell this one and invest into a
05:24 - newer card maybe a 1070 or an Rx for 80
05:28 - even though this one does hash more as
05:30 - time goes on again like I've said the
05:32 - performance is going to go down okay so
05:35 - now it's time for me to kind of rank
05:37 - which ones I think are the best in which
05:39 - one I would personally recommend so like
05:42 - I said before I have an Rx for 80 that's
05:44 - just because I got a really good deal on
05:45 - it
05:46 - buying it used but personally I would
05:49 - probably recommend the 1070 and this is
05:52 - just because of the performance pretty
05:56 - much and because of the cost so like I
05:58 - said we gets talked about 27 when you're
06:01 - overclocking you can probably get up to
06:03 - 30 even higher than that and right now
06:05 - in Canadian dollars the price is 564
06:09 - dollars which is pretty expensive but
06:11 - compared to the 1080 is a much more
06:14 - reasonable price so getting a rig with
06:16 - six of these cards or five of these
06:18 - cards you can be making quite a bit of
06:21 - money per month and per year and
06:22 - definitely making you return back on
06:24 - this card
06:25 - whereas we go to the 1080 here we're
06:28 - only getting about three or four maybe
06:30 - even five making a hash per second more
06:32 - but for an extra four hundred five
06:34 - hundred dollars and in my opinion that's
06:36 - not really worth it especially if you're
06:38 - just starting out mine
06:40 - because you're putting a ton of capital
06:41 - up and we don't really know exactly
06:43 - where the markets gonna go with
06:44 - aetherium and if this card is gonna be
06:47 - able to sustain this super high mega
06:49 - hash as The Epoch go on so there you
06:52 - have it I've shaved kind of a quick
06:53 - review here of the top four cards
06:55 - remaining so we can go through it one
06:56 - more time we have the 580 D 480 the GTX
07:01 - 1080 Ti and then the gtx 1070 and this
07:05 - is the one that i would recommend if
07:07 - you're looking to purchase any of these
07:08 - cards i do have the link to all of these
07:11 - down in the description go ahead and
07:13 - click on that to load up Amazon and
07:15 - other than that have a nice night if you
07:17 - liked the video please like and

hey guys welcome back to another youtube video in today's video i'm gonna be talking about mining and the best graphics cards to use for mining aetherium so aetherium you can see right here we've got a price of 310 u.s. dollars and this hasn't been the highest price aetherium is hot it's been if I go to the oneyear mark here we can look at the graph and we've seen it skyrocketed up to almost 400 at some points and now we're just balancing out at about 300 so aetherium is definitely still here in the market place and there's a lot of people mining it and selling it so it's a great time to get in and start mining so that being said I'm just gonna be reviewing the performance versus the cost of some of the graphics cards on the market where the best graphics cards in my opinion on the market so let's get started right away just talking about the gtx 1070 so I've got this Amazon link up right here and you can see immediately the price well the stock price is six hundred ten dollars Canadian but right now it's on sale for five hundred sixty four dollars so the hash rate on this gtx 1070 is about twentyseven mega hashes stalk again this really depends on what model of card you get some of them you're gonna get lower you're gonna get twenty four twenty five some of them you're gonna get much higher you might even get to twenty nine and this is again just the stalk so if you were to overclock this card you could get a lot more performance out of it so personally I do recommend this card as it is a pretty hefty price but not compared to the the next cards that we're going to
