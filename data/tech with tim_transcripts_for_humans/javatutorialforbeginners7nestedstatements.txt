00:00 - in this video we are gonna be kind of
00:02 - taking a step back and just going
00:04 - through everything that we've already
00:05 - learned summarizing that putting that
00:07 - into a program to make sure that you
00:09 - guys really understand all of that and
00:11 - we're also gonna be talking about nested
00:13 - statements so how you can kind of add
00:14 - things within other things like so if
00:17 - statements within other if statements
00:19 - variables and the way I'm gonna do this
00:21 - is just by creating a simple program and
00:22 - what its gonna do is it's gonna ask the
00:24 - user to input their age and then based
00:26 - on that age we're gonna do certain
00:28 - things with that we're gonna tell them
00:29 - like I don't know a good example is like
00:30 - on a roller coaster like if you're 13 or
00:33 - older you can ride otherwise you can so
00:34 - we're gonna do something like that okay
00:35 - so I'm gonna keep these scanners up here
00:38 - that I have because we want to get the
00:39 - users age but I'm first before I set up
00:42 - the scanner is I'm just gonna print a
00:43 - line to the screen here so I'm just
00:45 - gonna say system dot out dot print
00:48 - instead of println and in this case I
00:51 - will just say input your age
00:54 - simply okay so this way it should if I'm
00:57 - doing this correctly make it so that we
01:00 - just get the age right after this line
01:01 - okay you'll see when we do that in a
01:03 - second anyways what I'm gonna do now is
01:05 - I'm just gonna kind of start typing and
01:06 - we'll go through how this works out so
01:08 - I'm gonna say if and we're actually just
01:10 - gonna convert this to an int first I
01:12 - think string to an int yeah so using
01:15 - that parse into that I was talking about
01:16 - so say int age is equal to s dot R
01:21 - integer I always forgot how to do this
01:24 - integer dot parse int and then in here
01:28 - we need to type s so we're gonna convert
01:30 - whatever they type into an integer in
01:32 - this case so we're going to assume that
01:34 - they type in an integer so we'll say if
01:36 - age is greater than or equal to 13 then
01:42 - we will simply print system dot out dot
01:46 - print Ln you can write okay exclamation
01:53 - point now if they're not older than 13
01:55 - that must mean that they are less than
01:58 - 13 or younger than 13 so in this case we
02:00 - will simply print that they cannot write
02:02 - system two out the print Ln and you
02:08 - cannot write exclamation point okay
02:11 - pretty basic program we kind of gone
02:13 - all this work so let's test it out input
02:16 - your age five you cannot ride okay
02:19 - let's try this now input your age do you
02:21 - 43 you can ride awesome okay so
02:24 - everything is working fine for right now
02:26 - now what I'm gonna do is I am going to
02:29 - add a else--if here and I'm gonna change
02:30 - kind of the problem that we're looking
02:32 - at so I'm gonna say now I want to
02:34 - classify the person based on their age
02:37 - is either an adult a teenager or just
02:40 - like younger than a teenager okay I
02:41 - don't know what do you call those
02:42 - whatever younger than teenager is okay
02:45 - so if we are greater than or equal to 18
02:46 - I want to print you are an adult okay
02:50 - now otherwise so if they are not greater
02:54 - than 18 we want to check if they are
02:55 - less than 18 so or if they're actually
02:58 - well we'll do it in a in a cool way
03:00 - that's gonna make sense here in a second
03:01 - so else if age is not greater than or
03:04 - equal to 18 we know it's less than 18 so
03:07 - all we actually have to check is if they
03:09 - are older than 13 right or greater or
03:12 - older than or equal to 13 because that's
03:14 - what a teenager would be okay
03:15 - and the reason we don't have to check if
03:18 - they are what do you call it younger is
03:21 - or if they're older is because we
03:24 - already know that they're gonna be
03:25 - younger than 18 so know we're there int
03:28 - within that range sorry what should that
03:29 - explanation but that's okay so system
03:31 - dot out dot println and in this case
03:35 - we'll just say you are a teenager okay
03:39 - like that and then in this last case
03:41 - well we know they're not older than or
03:43 - equal to 18 we know they're not older
03:45 - than or equal to 13 that meaning they
03:46 - must be less than which is you are not a
03:48 - teenager or an adult okay like that so
03:55 - let's test our program out make sure
03:57 - everything is working so if we input an
03:59 - age of 14 we get you are a teenager
04:01 - awesome okay let's try it again we input
04:04 - an age of 19 get you're an adult and if
04:07 - we input an age of zero yet you are not
04:11 - a teenager we're an adult now I want to
04:14 - show you what happens if I input like a
04:16 - negative number like what if I do like
04:18 - negative 98 you are not a teenager or an
04:21 - adult because right we have this else
04:23 - statement and that's not greater than or
04:24 - equal to 13 it's not greater than or
04:26 - equal to 18 so
04:27 - we got you're not a teenager or an adult
04:29 - okay now that is pretty straightforward
04:32 - what I'm going to show you now is how we
04:36 - can ask like another question or how we
04:38 - can check something else so what I'm
04:40 - gonna do here is I want to say if
04:41 - they're 18 and only if they're 18 I want
04:45 - to ask them a question what should the
04:48 - question be I want to ask them what
04:49 - their favorite food is okay so I'm
04:51 - simply gonna do now exactly what I've
04:54 - done up here except just throw it inside
04:56 - of this if statement so if this happens
04:58 - we're gonna do this and this is gonna
04:59 - show you nesting okay so I'm gonna say
05:01 - SC or we'll say string I screen just do
05:04 - ins because we're gonna assume there are
05:05 - string I guess cuz any food yeah we'll
05:08 - say string food is equal to SC dot next
05:12 - line like this okay and what I'm gonna
05:16 - do is I'm going to print up here again
05:17 - what we're looking for so just copy this
05:19 - save me a second and in this case I'll
05:21 - say input your fav food okay now what I
05:26 - want to do is I want to check what their
05:28 - favorite food is so I want to say if
05:29 - their favorite food is pizza I'll say
05:31 - mine too otherwise I'll say that's not
05:34 - my favorite food or something like that
05:35 - okay we'll say if and we have our
05:38 - conditioning here we'll say if food dot
05:41 - equals and in this case we'll simply
05:45 - type pizza all right then we will system
05:50 - dot out dot print Ln and we'll say mine
05:56 - Wow inside of the coats hopefully say
06:01 - mine too and then otherwise so the else
06:04 - what we'll do is we'll simply type
06:07 - system dot out dot println and in this
06:12 - case we'll say not mine okay so this is
06:16 - showing you now it looks a bit more
06:17 - complicated but that we can actually put
06:19 - if statements and else statements we can
06:20 - do things with inside of the if
06:22 - statement and I'll show you that this
06:24 - works so if I type I'm nineteen it's
06:27 - gonna say input your fav food okay my
06:29 - favorite food let's try pizza
06:31 - it says mine too awesome that's working
06:33 - now if I type something else so I type
06:35 - like four
06:36 - it just tells me I'm not a teenager
06:37 - adult because we don't have anything
06:39 - else happening
06:40 - inside of this if statement or this else
06:41 - over here okay now that's really cool
06:44 - and that allows us to do some neat
06:45 - things and you can continually nest this
06:48 - is called nesting putting a statement
06:49 - inside of another statement you can
06:52 - continually do that as much as you want
06:53 - so I just want to show that to you
06:55 - because a lot of people think that
06:57 - that's not possible or they don't
06:58 - understand that you're able to do that
06:59 - because they haven't been shown that
07:00 - right so again if I want to ask another
07:03 - question I could do that inside of here
07:04 - and I could just keep going but anyways
07:07 - I think that that probably gives you
07:09 - guys a good explanation of how that
07:11 - works and shows you got I don't need to
07:13 - go any further so with that being said
07:14 - I'm gonna end the video here in the next
07:17 - video we're gonna be getting into
07:18 - looping which is some more advanced
07:20 - stuff some cooler stuff and we're
07:21 - continually moving through and we're to
07:23 - be getting more advanced now getting out
07:24 - to kind of the more basic stuff of Java
07:26 - that being said if you guys enjoyed the
07:28 - video please make sure you leave a like

07:30 - next one

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we are gonna be kind of taking a step back and just going through everything that we've already learned summarizing that putting that into a program to make sure that you guys really understand all of that and we're also gonna be talking about nested statements so how you can kind of add things within other things like so if statements within other if statements variables and the way I'm gonna do this is just by creating a simple program and what its gonna do is it's gonna ask the user to input their age and then based on that age we're gonna do certain things with that we're gonna tell them like I don't know a good example is like on a roller coaster like if you're 13 or older you can ride otherwise you can so we're gonna do something like that okay so I'm gonna keep these scanners up here that I have because we want to get the users age but I'm first before I set up the scanner is I'm just gonna print a line to the screen here so I'm just gonna say system dot out dot print instead of println and in this case I will just say input your age simply okay so this way it should if I'm doing this correctly make it so that we just get the age right after this line okay you'll see when we do that in a second anyways what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna kind of start typing and we'll go through how this works out so I'm gonna say if and we're actually just gonna convert this to an int first I think string to an int yeah so using that parse into that I was talking about so say int age is equal to s dot R integer I always forgot how to do this integer dot

than or equal to 13 then we will simply print system dot out dot print Ln you can write okay exclamation point now if they're not older than 13 that must mean that they are less than 13 or younger than 13 so in this case we will simply print that they cannot write system two out the print Ln and you cannot write exclamation point okay pretty basic program we kind of gone all this work so let's test it out input your age five you cannot ride okay let's try this now input your age do you 43 you can ride awesome okay so everything is working fine for right now now what I'm gonna do is I am going to add a elseif here and I'm gonna change kind of the problem that we're looking at so I'm gonna say now I want to classify the person based on their age is either an adult a teenager or just like younger than a teenager okay I don't know what do you call those whatever younger than teenager is okay so if we are greater than or equal to 18 I want to print you are an adult okay now otherwise so if they are not greater than 18 we want to check if they are less than 18 so or if they're actually well we'll do it in a in a cool way that's gonna make sense here in a second so else if

teenager would be okay and the reason we don't have to check if they are what do you call it younger is or if they're older is because we already know that they're gonna be younger than 18 so know we're there int within that range sorry what should that explanation but that's okay so system dot out dot println and in this case we'll just say you are a teenager okay like that and then in this last case well we know they're not older than or equal to 18 we know they're not older than or equal to 13 that meaning they must be less than which is you are not a teenager or an adult okay like that so let's test our program out make sure everything is working so if we input an age of 14 we get you are a teenager awesome okay let's try it again we input an age of 19 get you're an adult and if we input an age of zero yet you are not a teenager we're an adult now I want to show you what happens if I input like a negative number like what if I do like negative 98 you are not a teenager or an adult because right we have this else statement and that's not greater than or equal to 13 it's not greater than or equal to 18 so we got you're not a teenager or an adult okay now that is pretty straightforward what I'm going to show you now is how we can ask like another question or how we can check something else so what I'm gonna do here is I want to say if they're 18 and only if they're

of this if statement so if this happens we're gonna do this and this is gonna show you nesting okay so I'm gonna say SC or we'll say string I screen just do ins because we're gonna assume there are string I guess cuz any food yeah we'll say string food is equal to SC dot next line like this okay and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to print up here again what we're looking for so just copy this save me a second and in this case I'll say input your fav food okay now what I want to do is I want to check what their favorite food is so I want to say if their favorite food is pizza I'll say mine too otherwise I'll say that's not my favorite food or something like that okay we'll say if and we have our conditioning here we'll say if food dot equals and in this case we'll simply type pizza all right then we will system dot out dot print Ln and we'll say mine Wow inside of the coats hopefully say mine too and then otherwise so the else what we'll do is we'll simply type system dot out dot println and in this case we'll say not mine okay so this is showing you now it looks a bit more complicated but that we can actually put if statements and else statements we can do things with inside of the if statement and I'll show you that this works so if I type I'm nineteen it's gonna say input your fav food okay my favorite food let's try pizza it says mine too awesome that's working now if I type something else so I type like four it just tells me I'm not a teenager adult because we don't have anything else happening inside of this if statement or this else over here okay now that's
