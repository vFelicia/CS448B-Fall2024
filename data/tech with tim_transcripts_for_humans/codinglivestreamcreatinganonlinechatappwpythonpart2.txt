With timestamps:

00:02 - all right I believe we are live now I'm
00:06 - just gonna wait one second to make sure
00:08 - everything's working here oh I forgot to
00:09 - get the music going okay we got to get
00:11 - the music going so we're gonna be one
00:12 - second here guys
00:14 - but essentially what I'm we doing this
00:15 - stream while I kind of just look to set
00:17 - things up here quickly is we are going
00:20 - to be continuing from the last one
00:22 - although I won't lie I've done a
00:23 - significant amount of work on this
00:25 - project off camera I had a lot of time
00:27 - yesterday coming in between classes on
00:29 - my laptop or I couldn't stream but I
00:30 - want to work on it so I'll be you
00:32 - starting off refreshing you guys with
00:33 - what I've got here I've actually got
00:35 - this chat working and I've kind of
00:36 - changed frameworks a little bit so it'll
00:38 - be a bit of a refresher on what we've
00:40 - done but if you guys didn't catch the
00:41 - lot the last livestream and you want to
00:43 - see kind of from the very beginning then
00:45 - there is the last upload on my channel
00:47 - that you guys can check out give me one
00:49 - second I'm just going to try to get this
00:51 - music working because this is gonna be
00:52 - painful for about an hour
00:54 - streaming if we don't have that and
00:55 - that's also what I wanted to say we are
00:57 - probably gonna be streaming for close to
00:58 - an hour today I don't wanna go for too
01:00 - long I actually have a job interview
01:02 - later today so I figured I'd hop on work
01:05 - on the project a little bit first and
01:06 - then go from there
01:08 - alright so let's get music again you
01:11 - guys gotta let me know if this music is
01:13 - too loud or too quiet I never really can
01:15 - tell based on my broadcasting software
01:17 - so let's see this right Wow $20 from mr.
01:25 - genius appreciate the super chat man you
01:27 - didn't want to ask any questions let's
01:29 - see what the chat saying here hello how
01:30 - are you doing man hello greetings from
01:32 - Greece this is so true is the front end
01:35 - just flossing they're using a framework
01:37 - you have to tell us a result of the
01:39 - interview for sure I'll let you guys
01:41 - know 125 concurrent viewers appreciate
01:43 - you guys hopping in here
01:44 - hello Python rich JavaScript alright so
01:47 - let's get started and kind of discuss
01:48 - what I've done I'll start with a little
01:50 - bit of a demo and then we'll kind of
01:51 - talk about all the backend work that
01:52 - went into and the changes that we did
01:54 - here so you guys don't remember from
01:56 - last time I'll log out here what I was
01:58 - trying to do was essentially have it so
02:01 - that I had a separate server that
02:03 - handled all messaging communication and
02:05 - I had data from this kind of front-end
02:07 - server here being sent to that server
02:09 - and then it handled the message
02:10 - communication sent out it back and I was
02:12 - kind of working but
02:13 - it was pretty glitchy like it was
02:15 - there's a lot of bugs and stuff so I
02:17 - actually changed framers completely and
02:19 - now I'm using flask socket IO which I
02:21 - didn't even know existed but apparently
02:23 - is built into flask so I'll show you
02:25 - guys a little bit here
02:26 - so essentially socket IO dot on event
02:28 - and you can handle custom events right
02:30 - from flask and it does all the
02:32 - connection disconnection for you so you
02:34 - don't have to worry about actually
02:36 - creating the sockets you just have to
02:37 - kind of understand a bit about the
02:39 - communication protocol which is what
02:41 - I've been doing so let's do a demo so
02:44 - you can see I've changed a little bit
02:45 - this page I want to make look a little
02:46 - bit nicer in terms of like signing in
02:48 - creating an account or whatever that's
02:50 - not creating account it's just like
02:51 - picking a name but let's go with test as
02:54 - our name here and when we go we can see
02:56 - I've actually set up a database as well
02:58 - that stores all the previous messages
03:00 - and the time in which they were sent I'm
03:02 - having a slight bug with that which
03:03 - we'll talk about later but this is just
03:05 - a local SQLite three database and now
03:08 - actually I'm on my phone and I'm on the
03:10 - website on my phone because I have this
03:12 - running on my local IP address which you
03:14 - guys can see 192.168.0.1 don't try to
03:18 - connect to it because it won't work
03:19 - unless you're on my network but on my
03:21 - phone I have the website open so I'm
03:23 - just gonna send a message I'm gonna say
03:24 - hello my name is Tim going to click send
03:28 - and you can see that that message
03:30 - actually pops up on here now notice too
03:32 - when I send a message from here I said
03:34 - hello my name it was test oh wow we get
03:40 - a gray bubble instead of this lighter
03:42 - gray level so it actually separates the
03:44 - different people you can see their names
03:45 - are on the right side our name is on the
03:47 - left side and it changes the date format
03:49 - as well based on who's sending the
03:51 - message so pretty interesting let's see
03:53 - what the guys are saying in the chat
03:54 - here you have a Spotify playlist I do
03:56 - not don't your eyes get tired when you
03:58 - code for too much time yeah definitely
04:00 - they do greetings from Bangladesh hello
04:02 - why don't use Django I've been asked
04:04 - that question about a million times
04:06 - louder please it's perfect what would
04:08 - turn up one anything else you guys are
04:12 - saying here no no 173 K subs with 173
04:16 - views that's funny yeah but only 53
04:19 - likes if you guys are here watching
04:20 - right now go please like the stream help
04:22 - significantly
04:24 - hello from India hi from India lots of
04:26 - Indians lo guys okay so let's start
04:30 - getting digging into the code I'll show
04:31 - you guys kind of what I've done and then
04:32 - I'm gonna start working on fixing a few
04:34 - bugs again it's just a shorter stream
04:36 - today I just wanted to hop on I figured
04:37 - I have to do this I might as well stream
04:39 - it anyways so yeah okay so let's look at
04:42 - kind of our architecture of this program
04:44 - now so this is the old message server I
04:46 - split it up into this server file so
04:48 - this is what I was trying to do before
04:49 - is have this client communication all
04:51 - running from this server with like
04:53 - global variables and person objects and
04:56 - it was working but it was just kind of
04:57 - glitchy and then the client was here so
04:59 - you could connect and send messages and
05:01 - I had memory locks and all this
05:02 - complicated stuff so I kind of scrapped
05:04 - that I still kept it just in case but
05:06 - I'm not gonna be using it so instead
05:09 - everything is now inside this website
05:11 - folder so what I have is this main
05:13 - application which is almost the entry
05:15 - point I'll talk about that in a second
05:16 - so the way this works is we import flask
05:19 - i/o we import some things from
05:21 - application which I'll show in a second
05:23 - we create an app using a factory which
05:26 - I'll show you and then we create a
05:27 - socket and then all I have in here is
05:29 - literally just the communication
05:30 - functions for events because I've split
05:32 - everything up into blueprints actually
05:34 - with flask and I'll show you how that
05:36 - works
05:36 - so let's go actually inside application
05:39 - to this init top PI file where things
05:42 - kind of start so this is the create app
05:44 - function you can see here I call create
05:48 - app after importing it from application
05:50 - because this is a package and what ends
05:52 - up happening if I go to or is it an it
05:56 - here is this creates a new flask
05:58 - application based on my environment
06:00 - variables which are in here and then
06:02 - what it does is it imports all the
06:04 - necessary modules and imports a filter
06:06 - which I use in the Jenga templating
06:08 - engine and the database registers the
06:10 - blueprint for the views folder which is
06:12 - here that handles all the routes and
06:14 - then it actually registers a context
06:17 - processor which is used to do a slice
06:19 - operation inside of templates for flask
06:23 - I know this is complicated but it's kind
06:25 - of the easiest way to explain it then it
06:27 - returns this application from the width
06:30 - from the return app so when it returns
06:32 - that that gives us a working application
06:34 - in main so then we can simply socket dot
06:37 - run that app and then run it with
06:39 - whatever the configuration server
06:40 - variable is in our env file now database
06:43 - this just works doesn't sqlite3 database
06:45 - local database is called messages dot DB
06:48 - forgot I don't need to see duck CDW
06:50 - there um and yeah what this does is just
06:53 - you know makes a table closes the
06:55 - connection and creates the table just
06:56 - some basic queries with SQL get all
07:00 - messages we run a query and then we
07:02 - actually have a limit on the query
07:03 - because sometimes you don't want to get
07:05 - unlimited amount of messages from the
07:06 - database you just want say 100 or you
07:08 - just want the most recent 50 or whatever
07:11 - so this queries all of them and then
07:12 - we'll take the most recent messages by
07:15 - doing this and then it returns out in
07:18 - JSON format like that
07:20 - alright so save message what this does
07:23 - is just insert into that table the save
07:25 - message so we're just using date/time
07:27 - objects and then time done now let's see
07:30 - what you guys are saying here how did
07:32 - you connect your PC to your IP address
07:35 - I can't all you do is just run the flask
07:37 - app on your local IP address rather than
07:40 - localhost it's not very hard can I ask
07:43 - why you use regular sockets I'm not
07:46 - using regular sockets I'm using flask IO
07:47 - sockets that's what I was trying to
07:49 - explain I'm also using pycharm okay so
07:51 - this is the views file I'm just gonna go
07:53 - through all of it because I know you
07:54 - guys if you were here in the last one
07:55 - probably want to know what changed so
07:57 - the way that this one works is similar
07:59 - to before essentially I should okay even
08:01 - need Lions global yeah I don't need this
08:06 - oops so let's start cleaning up some
08:09 - code that's also what I'm gonna be doing
08:10 - a bit today is just cleaning some things
08:11 - up making it look a little bit nicer so
08:13 - we can get rid of that now cuz we didn't
08:15 - even need that so I just start by
08:17 - registering this blueprint in view and
08:19 - then I have all my routes so I my login
08:21 - method which has potent guest requests I
08:23 - also implemented this message flashing
08:26 - which you guys saw in the HTML I have
08:28 - log outs I have a home page I have get
08:30 - name which is the used for fetch request
08:32 - from the jQuery get messages which is
08:35 - used for fetch request from the jQuery
08:37 - as well and then remove seconds which
08:38 - just removes the seconds off a date/time
08:40 - string for me filters this is just a
08:43 - slice filter this is a custom I just
08:45 - found this online I just it just does
08:47 - slice for you it so you can use it in
08:49 - Django templates
08:50 - config' these are just grabbing the
08:52 - config variables from the env file and
08:55 - then if we go into static or so into
08:59 - index EAS you can see I've implemented a
09:01 - few async functions here so I have this
09:04 - one up here this essentially just
09:05 - resizes the window that's a chat window
09:08 - to be 90% of the site or 80% of the size
09:11 - of the actual full window this one is
09:14 - just a scrolling implementations of too
09:16 - many messages pop and it'll
09:17 - automatically scroll at the bottom I
09:19 - have a function to load the name to load
09:22 - all the messages I have a function that
09:23 - gets the date now in the proper string
09:26 - format I have the socket connection
09:29 - which is needed for socket IO connection
09:31 - and flask and then this is kind of
09:33 - handling all of the events and sending
09:35 - receiving messages and then we have an
09:39 - onload the onload displays all the old
09:41 - messages on the screen and then add
09:43 - message which simply adds it to the div
09:45 - on the screen so what are you guys
09:48 - seeing here are you storing messages
09:49 - somewhere directly sending it to the
09:50 - client I'm storing messages on in a
09:53 - database but I'm only storing them in a
09:54 - database after they've been sent to all
09:56 - clients that are connected what else you
09:59 - guys saying can these messages be
10:00 - end-to-end encrypted they could I don't
10:02 - encrypt them but I mean they could be
10:04 - can we go through GPT especially crap I
10:07 - don't know what that is encapsulate it
10:10 - will you end up code on github you're
10:12 - actually not really supposed to
10:13 - encapsulate flask applications at least
10:16 - the way that I'm doing them so it
10:18 - doesn't really make sense to put them in
10:19 - classes it just makes it actually more
10:21 - confusing I'm just gonna keep it
10:22 - functional for now we make a tutorial on
10:25 - this potentially will your code be up
10:26 - and github there's a link in the
10:28 - description for the code I still see a
10:29 - hundred 70 people in here and 112 likes
10:32 - which means some of you have not liked
10:33 - the stream yet so please go ahead and do
10:35 - that and yeah okay so let's type some
10:37 - more messages so I trying to show you
10:38 - some more features so if you go like
10:40 - like yes sir oh whoa I don't know why
10:43 - that happened of course we're gonna
10:46 - glitch right on stream when
10:49 - what the heck oh it's cuz I haven't I
10:52 - haven't pulled the thing yet let's see
10:54 - here
10:56 - rebase 5000 W I don't know what that
11:00 - currency is just started learning coding
11:02 - great content thank you for what you're
11:04 - doing love your channel I appreciate the
11:05 - super chat man rebase the current branch
11:08 - on top of incoming changers all files
11:11 - are up to date okay
11:12 - I don't know why that sent multiple
11:14 - times because that's literally never
11:16 - happened before but of course that's
11:18 - gonna happen to me now oh it's cuz okay
11:22 - so I think I'm working on an outdated
11:23 - version right now I'm just gonna get my
11:25 - laptop out and push more recent github
11:27 - changes so one second guys on that front
11:29 - so yeah yesterday I was working on this
11:38 - quite a bit on my laptop but I don't
11:40 - think I remembered to push the changes
11:42 - to github so let's do that now alright
11:48 - sorry that I am just boring you guys
11:50 - right now but this is how it's gonna be
11:52 - okay so get that dot ah yeah there was a
12:08 - lot of change down here that I hadn't
12:09 - pushed yet okay so I was wondering why
12:11 - it was like that so it's like I thought
12:12 - I fixed that so give me what's like I'm
12:14 - just gonna get clone this again once we
12:16 - get back onto this computer turn that
12:19 - off there we go
12:30 - all right yeah so I was trying to do a
12:33 - thing where it said like you left the
12:34 - server you joined the server but it
12:35 - wasn't really working so yeah that was
12:37 - kind of why this one had it and then
12:40 - like this new version doesn't that I'm
12:41 - going to show you anyways you'll see yes
12:43 - so inspect by the way whoever told me
12:45 - this where you can empty the cache by
12:47 - left-clicking on this is like a genius
12:49 - thank you so much that saved me a
12:51 - significant amount of time so let's I
12:53 - can actually be able to rebase because I
12:55 - already have changes in here that aren't
12:56 - committed so we're just gonna have to
12:58 - actually get the link again which means
13:01 - I have to go to github alright one
13:03 - second just need to clone this
13:12 - repository guys give me one second oh
13:15 - what's happened to my music Oh still
13:20 - here okay get stash yeah I know you guys
13:30 - are saying get stash but like I've tried
13:31 - to use it it just as like glitchy I just
13:33 - rather use this okay does this work
13:40 - chat web app alright oh no it's only
13:44 - Linux okay let's do that
13:47 - delete okay so now we should have the
13:52 - most recent version so I'll be able to
13:54 - show you guys that's a pycharm sorry
13:57 - about the delay I really thought that
13:59 - app did that just use links I would but
14:01 - my recording software does not work on
14:03 - Linux or it doesn't work but I just have
14:08 - like all these settings in Windows and I
14:10 - don't really care to import over right
14:11 - now um okay close that alright there's
14:17 - something else I wanted to do okay so
14:18 - this needs to be refreshed let's go
14:21 - inspect and then I wanted to remove
14:24 - something from views
14:28 - ah this one okay nice all right so let's
14:35 - run the web server think we should be
14:38 - okay here awesome yep that's what we're
14:39 - looking for let's just go here inspect
14:44 - why can't why is this inspection not
14:46 - working inspect okay well that's great
14:52 - okay there we go login all right so name
14:56 - let's go with Tim submit you're
15:00 - successfully logged in as Tim let's go
15:02 - test what's up my name is Tim and this
15:09 - it's just testing I want to add some
15:12 - more messages so you guys see I also
15:14 - need to add a thing so that it doesn't
15:16 - let you send a blank message so notice
15:17 - this it actually lets you scroll it
15:20 - Scrolls down automatically when a new
15:21 - message comes in so I'm gonna go on my
15:23 - phone again just clear the cache here
15:25 - and show you guys that someone 9 - lets
15:28 - go yeh sense you can see it
15:32 - automatically Scrolls down which i think
15:33 - is kind of cool and if you guys think of
15:35 - any other features you think I should
15:36 - add to this let me know but like for
15:38 - example I log out and I log back in as
15:40 - like Joey then it shows all the messages
15:43 - again but now my name changes so the
15:45 - only thing that's kind of conflicting is
15:46 - if floods like two people on the server
15:48 - that the same name then it gets a little
15:50 - bit like okay it just shows you the same
15:52 - thing
15:54 - so yeah that's like the only issue I
15:56 - don't really know how to fix that though
15:57 - because I mean I have to save all the
15:58 - names of the people and then check that
15:59 - you don't already have the same name
16:01 - which I don't really want to do right
16:02 - now but anyways okay let's hear you guys
16:04 - are saying Tim you brought it up man
16:07 - you're helping tons of people appreciate
16:09 - that
16:10 - if you press ctrl f5 that resets cache
16:12 - as well okay use the what's everyone
16:17 - saying okay I don't know sometimes you
16:22 - guys have conversations in here and I
16:23 - have no idea what you're talking to them
16:24 - alright so what I want to do now oh yes
16:28 - there is a glitch where sometimes these
16:31 - messages when they display from the
16:33 - database don't work properly like they
16:35 - display in the wrong order so let's log
16:38 - in as Billy
16:40 - and we'll see and I think it's fine
16:44 - right now but sometimes this sort
16:46 - doesn't work properly on these messages
16:48 - and it shows them to me and like a
16:49 - different order at least that's
16:51 - something I've noticed so I want to see
16:53 - if there's any way I could fix that I
16:54 - also want to see it you guys think
16:55 - there's any other features that should
16:56 - be added to this website I mean I'm kind
16:59 - of thinking that like I want something
17:00 - that looks a little bit nicer but I
17:01 - don't really know
17:02 - okay who's drunk okay if you guys are
17:05 - sending D then I'm just gonna be banning
17:08 - you in the chat so okay so I guess our
17:10 - first person is gonna be getting banned
17:11 - here um remove actually you can go in a
17:16 - timeout
17:17 - like that you can go in a timeout - who
17:22 - wants to be a moderator and ban everyone
17:24 - okay put user in timeouts let's see put
17:30 - user in timeouts ah there we go
17:34 - okay that's much better nice clean chat
17:37 - okay um so login logout chat I'm
17:40 - wondering like what else I could do I'm
17:43 - almost thinking like do chat history
17:46 - like maybe I'll add a page right now
17:47 - that says chat history and what it will
17:49 - do is you like when you logged in as a
17:51 - certain specific name it'll show you all
17:53 - the messages in your chat history so
17:55 - actually maybe let's let's go and
17:56 - implement that that doesn't seem like
17:57 - it's gonna take too long and that could
17:58 - be some new work to be doing on this
18:00 - stream because this was coming in just
18:01 - be like a bug fixing stream but that's
18:04 - fine um what's the problem about the
18:06 - name on the site the problem is just
18:07 - that's not secure because it's on my
18:08 - local IP address are using flask on the
18:11 - back and looks like material thing yeah
18:13 - I'm using flask on the back end okay so
18:15 - let's make a new view actually for that
18:18 - and we're gonna meet need a new database
18:20 - method that will query by name so I'm
18:23 - actually gonna say define get messages
18:27 - by name self name alright so returns
18:37 - it's gets wise where's my capital gets a
18:44 - list of messages by username I suppose
18:49 - we'll have a limit on this as well -
18:51 - just in case those message
18:53 - in case there's too many so we'll set
18:56 - the limit at 100 by default but they can
18:57 - change that if they want say / am not
19:00 - SAS string return actually this is gonna
19:02 - be a list of dicks so what I'm gonna do
19:06 - here is Lily just copy this query and
19:10 - this results yep and we'll do that here
19:12 - okay so we're gonna say query F select
19:16 - from where name equals question mark and
19:23 - I think what I have to do here is put
19:26 - inside of these parentheses B name which
19:29 - is that although I'm just gonna look it
19:31 - up because I kind of forget how I query
19:34 - like that so I'm just gonna say sqlite3
19:38 - query by column python okay cuz I think
19:45 - there's something I got to do with like
19:46 - a question mark for the query select
19:48 - star where ya priority okay so it's in
19:51 - execute comma okay sweet so I was right
19:54 - okay so now we'll just say for our and
19:59 - results and someone's gonna tell me how
20:02 - to fix the stem PyCharm Auto completing
20:05 - like it just ruins my time trying type
20:08 - here so let's take this let's literally
20:10 - take the same thing so it results and
20:15 - then results equals I understand this a
20:22 - little bit redundant I'm almost thinking
20:24 - there's a better way to do this although
20:27 - this is reversing yeah cuz it's gonna do
20:29 - the same thing okay actually no I'm just
20:32 - gonna make it get all messages I'm gonna
20:34 - make it one function we could say get
20:37 - messages my name is one sure but it'll
20:38 - just end up calling this interior
20:40 - function
20:41 - hmm cuz I don't want to rewrite this if
20:44 - I don't have to so let's do this
20:46 - so query 1 SF select from where name
21:00 - equals question mark okay so we'll just
21:03 - say limit name equals blanks actually
21:11 - the name equals none and I will say if
21:12 - not none because we'll just do the same
21:14 - thing okay so let's do this we'll say if
21:18 - not name then query this Alice query
21:30 - equals select from so the only thing is
21:32 - I don't want it to be like you have to
21:33 - do a limit and you have to do a name so
21:35 - I'll make another function that will
21:36 - call this properly in here let's do that
21:39 - name content time reverse limit yep that
21:41 - seems to work for me get Beth's messages
21:43 - by name okay so what this will do is
21:45 - simply just call this so it'll say self
21:48 - get all messages return that with the
21:53 - limit comma name and then we should
21:57 - actually be good on that not idea so
21:59 - what is this saying here what's the
22:00 - issue okay let's see what you guys are
22:02 - saying the chat what's your favorite IDE
22:04 - IDE like PyCharm or vs code maybe hello
22:07 - Tim what do you saying find out Tim's
22:12 - actually getting a job opportunity for
22:13 - disk or anything leading online chat
22:15 - company that's not actually true I'll
22:18 - tell you guys later on but I'm leaving
22:20 - it a secret for now until I go through
22:22 - the interviews okay so come on still
22:25 - that's fine
22:27 - okay so get all messages get messages by
22:31 - name I think that should work
22:34 - where name equals question mark ah
22:36 - that's what I need yes
22:40 - so that query nun named comma okay so
22:47 - now what I'm gonna do is make a new
22:48 - route so say that's you route slosh
22:56 - history maybe yeah so this way you could
23:00 - see the history of any user so this
23:01 - obviously is not meant to be like a
23:02 - secured chat site it's just meant to
23:04 - like kind of show the fact and the
23:06 - communication like more just to show off
23:09 - to be honest than anything so define
23:11 - history I guess we'll have a refresh on
23:12 - the history page so what history will
23:14 - need to do is render a template and it
23:17 - will need to send to that template all
23:18 - of the data both the messages umm-hmm
23:22 - see a better way to do this so get
23:25 - messages okay remove seconds I will need
23:30 - to do that so now I'm thinking I want a
23:35 - utility function just to save me but
23:37 - it's I'm here define remove seconds from
23:42 - messages okay let's say this is promise
23:48 - geez okay
23:51 - removes the seconds from all messages to
23:57 - be less return list so what this will do
24:03 - is say messages message message message
24:05 - yeah okay
24:09 - souls that return messages this now can
24:17 - just be messages equals remove message
24:23 - of seconds your messages MSG's and then
24:26 - return messages JSON five masters okay
24:30 - nice
24:30 - so now we'll make our other routes here
24:32 - so that's you dodge route are already
24:38 - which already make one at the top I did
24:41 - so actually we'll move this to the
24:42 - bottom so I feel like it makes sense to
24:44 - be there okay so here define history at
24:50 - few dot routes will say define hiss
24:55 - sorry this will need a name for sure and
25:00 - we'll call literally the exact same
25:02 - thing here
25:03 - well I should say get underscore history
25:06 - and get underscore history here just on
25:10 - the fly messages except DB duck gets
25:12 - messages by name and then we won't pass
25:17 - the message limit we'll just pass the
25:19 - name which means we'll get a hundred
25:21 - messages at most and then remove setting
25:25 - for messages return JSON five looks good
25:28 - to me okay so this is actually gonna be
25:30 - the route yeah so just say to turn
25:35 - Graham name string return all messages
25:41 - by name of user okay and then we'll add
25:49 - another route here at few routes history
25:58 - like that define history okay this will
26:06 - need a name for sure so in here I'm just
26:10 - I'm kind of thinking like if you go to
26:12 - the slash history page maybe what we'll
26:13 - do is just yeah cuz they could just
26:17 - refresh the page if they wanted to see
26:18 - the new history is just actually call
26:20 - this so get so will get the history by
26:23 - calling this function I think I can call
26:26 - this even if it's not returning yeah cuz
26:29 - it should just give me JSON response and
26:30 - messages then I could pass that JSON
26:32 - response and messages through to a
26:35 - template and the template could just
26:36 - display them in kind of like a chat
26:37 - window yeah so let's try that for now so
26:40 - that means we'll make it need to make a
26:42 - new template so let's go new HTML file
26:47 - this Tory dot HTML okay add we don't
26:54 - need that let's go to index and just
26:57 - copy some of this stuff okay message
27:04 - history and then say percent percent
27:12 - o'clock content I'm trying to debate how
27:15 - I want to display this if I want to put
27:17 - it in like a table I want to like just
27:20 - show them in like a list like I don't
27:22 - really know see what you guys are saying
27:25 - have you enabled the font no I don't
27:28 - know what that is
27:29 - um you guys chatting about I des
27:32 - another reminder if you guys are in the
27:34 - chat right now please do go and like it
27:37 - doesn't take very long I mean I'm gonna
27:38 - be streaming for like an hour I feel
27:40 - like that's like a word the trade off
27:42 - you guys like the chat and I stream for
27:44 - you so anyways okay anything else we
27:47 - need to clean up your message limit
27:49 - okay so history name okay so let's say
27:55 - messages let's say JSON message is
28:00 - equals get
28:03 - messages I think I can call that um
28:06 - forget history but I don't know if it I
28:10 - don't even let me call that just because
28:11 - it has a decorator of it so you say get
28:13 - history and we'll give it the name of
28:16 - session ass that's what I need to do
28:20 - session name key so if not name key if
28:27 - you say if name P no it's in session
28:31 - then return a redirect of the URL for
28:36 - home and I actually want to flash on the
28:40 - home page please login it's not even
28:46 - home sorry this should actually been
28:47 - logging and it should actually be you
28:52 - don't log in so I'm actually gonna flash
28:54 - on that page please log in before
28:56 - viewing message history like that okay
29:04 - redirect otherwise we'll get the JSON
29:07 - messages and then we'll say return
29:10 - around your templates and this will be
29:13 - history HTML nice we just say data
29:19 - equals JSON message is or will actually
29:22 - say kiss Tory okay so that should be
29:28 - good for that let's go to the slash
29:30 - history page let's go blog content let's
29:32 - just do a for loop and less it out for
29:34 - now just to make sure that this is gonna
29:36 - work before you go too far so we'll
29:38 - start by just saying ya know for MSG in
29:44 - what I call this history yeah so this is
29:49 - JSON so let's start our and for I want
29:55 - to remember what it even has as the
29:56 - indexes here so let's go to database
30:00 - name message time come on display all
30:03 - that I've already done that in index
30:05 - quite a bit so I fit in that Jason let's
30:10 - see here documents where do I add
30:21 - messages I've had this in here somewhere
30:28 - then cévennes events add message here's
30:33 - where it is okay so up here we make divs
30:36 - if type of message does not equal
30:39 - undefined bar glow as a wiggle and bar
30:42 - content that's what I wanted okay so we
30:46 - actually just want the one that's dark
30:48 - right darker here okay
30:55 - so I need to put this in a specific div
30:58 - that's what I remember that makes us
31:01 - look like kind of nice and styled and
31:03 - like shows all the messages so let's go
31:05 - history we're gonna copy that in here
31:07 - for now we'll deal with this in a second
31:09 - and then what I want to do I should I
31:13 - can remove all these quotation marks I
31:15 - don't even know why we need that so I
31:25 - don't even think I need these plus signs
31:26 - actually okay then this should go inside
31:33 - a larger div that's okay no no help stop
31:44 - don't want you to do that oh it should
31:46 - be it's a div for message you're like
31:54 - that and then here instead of that would
31:57 - say msg the name okay msg message p
32:19 - what's wrong with this that looks fine
32:21 - okay so I think that should be okay I
32:23 - need to add something to this div I
32:25 - forget what it was in here div class not
32:30 - that one which is here it is okay
32:36 - class overflow I think I had something
32:40 - to do with that but this should be fine
32:42 - for now okay and I think that's alright
32:47 - see what you guys are saying please
32:49 - don't use var and J s letting const are
32:51 - much better about whatever it's fine
32:53 - front end with template block file div
32:56 - or something so what to use Python for
32:59 - Python handles the entire back end this
33:01 - is just like this is the front end stuff
33:02 - I'm doing right now I need to find where
33:06 - this window was here it was okay so
33:10 - let's inspect now the web server is down
33:18 - invalid syntax that's good I saved it at
33:21 - that point okay so we have history on
33:22 - HTML we have used out HTML get name get
33:27 - messages utilities there's something I
33:29 - need to add inside the base template
33:32 - which I believe is just another thing in
33:34 - the navbar exactly okay so another
33:37 - navbar I actually want to do this oh
33:42 - that's interesting
33:44 - chat okay so let's do this have our item
33:49 - link why can't i okay you know what
33:52 - that's fine slash history history okay
34:03 - it's around the web server okay let's go
34:07 - here no not that one
34:11 - I'm ever gonna be remember which one
34:13 - this is k empty cache whoa
34:18 - see so I don't want this I don't want
34:21 - this message Billy just left the server
34:23 - popping up so I'm gonna need to fix that
34:26 - unless it's literally like that I need
34:28 - to clear the history or something okay
34:30 - so history history missing one required
34:32 - potential arguments name
34:35 - why did my Siri just go off okay so we
34:37 - need to fix that so if you go to history
34:40 - so history doesn't actually need to take
34:42 - name and that's in views okay now there
34:53 - was something going on in my front end
34:55 - here that I need to fix
34:58 - so sending messages let's see here if
35:05 - connect equals true cuz I don't want
35:08 - what is the same response object is not
35:14 - iterable for message in history
35:22 - hmm okay ah wait response object history
35:30 - equals because I almost want to do it
35:32 - like this so I know this is literally
35:47 - gonna do the same thing but I think that
35:49 - should hopefully work let's see what you
35:53 - guys are saying is it offline installer'
35:55 - online it's not an installer it's just
35:57 - like a website you're coding website
36:02 - with Python yep so there's something
36:06 - going on though when it leaves that I
36:08 - don't want the index you can just
36:11 - connect ah that's why because I don't
36:16 - want it to say they left the server so
36:18 - we'll get rid of that for now and then
36:21 - here spawns object is not interval or
36:27 - message in history see it's not saying
36:30 - its response so why am I getting that
36:33 - though that shouldn't be the issue
36:44 - message in history I want to see what
36:49 - history is though so JSON message Eagles
36:51 - get history okay let's just print JSON
36:54 - message I think I have an idea why it's
36:56 - saying that but we'll have an idea here
36:59 - in a minute okay so we got an error here
37:04 - I response bytes 200 okay so that
37:10 - because it's returning JSON fly from get
37:12 - messages from get history you know so
37:15 - let's not JSON Phi okay fresh
37:25 - haha this in history tab so this is all
37:31 - the messages that were saved in the
37:32 - server with an okay so we're gonna have
37:36 - to delete those from here because we're
37:40 - not we're no longer going to save those
37:42 - kind of messages um get history remove
37:45 - seconds
37:47 - okay so face use history HTML class and
37:53 - this needs to be msg it's time okay so
38:02 - that should work
38:07 - no you need to use get body on JSON five
38:12 - all right I mean I think I'm fine using
38:15 - flask yes I am using flask okay let's go
38:21 - login actually history okay so when I
38:24 - click history oh it's because I'm logged
38:26 - in but I felt thought I cleared this
38:29 - okay so let's restart the web server
38:31 - actually so I don't know where I'm
38:36 - logged case of logout history please
38:39 - login for viewing message oh my good
38:41 - why's my Siri keep going off Jesus
38:43 - okay so I need to change something here
38:45 - quickly use where is flash here
39:00 - yeah when we go history history history
39:04 - okay
39:06 - history dot HTML flash zero all right
39:13 - okay so now we go in there and we start
39:16 - typing some messages so let's go Tim
39:19 - submit let's go test message okay
39:27 - another one
39:29 - Kevin login from my phone now and just
39:32 - clear the cache first and see if this
39:35 - works
39:35 - give me one second guys I really should
39:40 - just do this on another computer to be
39:41 - honest you know what yeah let's just use
39:43 - my Mac do you have community version of
39:46 - pie chart I've community
39:47 - I prefer Drive it's a Python same I
39:50 - would agree now you your work on
39:53 - localhost no it's not this isn't
39:55 - localhost right now this is um this is
39:58 - working on my like local area network
40:00 - right so so out to 168 0.1 to 1 colon
40:11 - 5,000
40:13 - ok let's say ok Joey is logging in
40:17 - successfully logged in as Joey Joey just
40:20 - left the server ok so this is what I
40:22 - don't want what's showing right now Joey
40:24 - just left the server so I think there's
40:26 - something that I need to hate to handle
40:28 - with the leaving of the server so get
40:32 - history get message get name slash
40:37 - history slash home go
40:41 - man handle my event if name and data
40:44 - okay so from here I'm sending a message
40:48 - when someone leaves that I don't want to
40:52 - add add message msg okay
41:08 - where is just left the server this is
41:17 - what I don't want to do disconnect I
41:21 - don't care about if they leave the
41:23 - server so let's get rid of that for now
41:25 - leave it in as like commented out though
41:28 - slash slash okay
41:31 - now let's just check the history on here
41:35 - so let's go history and there we go okay
41:39 - so it shows messages this I think should
41:41 - be longer on the the history page so
41:44 - when you click history it just refreshes
41:45 - it obviously I'm go to chat you got your
41:48 - main message there history
41:49 - login history chat log now I'm almost
41:54 - thinking in this bar here what I want to
41:56 - do is put like their name if they're
41:58 - logged in or say like logged in as just
42:00 - so like they see it in the bar or say
42:03 - like logged out maybe so like some kind
42:04 - of status logout you were logged out if
42:08 - you had a history please log in before
42:10 - viewing message history okay so let's go
42:13 - Joey all right Joey just left the server
42:16 - that's gonna be in message history Joey
42:18 - just left the server okay nice so that's
42:20 - working
42:21 - I'm thinking maybe now like some headers
42:23 - for these so like you know start
42:25 - chatting or like view message history or
42:28 - like you know something like that let's
42:30 - see what you guys are saying means
42:33 - coding language yeah you guys have any
42:37 - ideas for what you think I should add to
42:39 - this do let me know please okay so I
42:43 - need to fix this leaving the server kind
42:46 - of thing though first okay so let's try
42:49 - to do that
42:53 - - so I have another laptop beside me
42:56 - which is gonna be my handy tester here
42:58 - as we go through this specs empty cache
43:02 - and hard reload shut up history
43:08 - like okay so does it say in chat now
43:14 - Joey left sir okay so I do need to clear
43:18 - this though so if what you guys might
43:21 - not know is when I delete this database
43:23 - what happens is if it gets too late
43:25 - it'll just automatic automatic Li create
43:26 - a new one so I can keep doing that okay
43:29 - so I removed who don't want remove all
43:35 - that it so save that let's refresh okay
43:41 - remove login when logged in remove
43:44 - logout we're not logged in oh good idea
43:49 - so it'll just check if there's a name in
43:51 - the session if there is a key I like
43:54 - that I actually like that a lot because
43:55 - then that's like kind of intuitive but
43:57 - it doesn't necessarily tell you and
43:58 - although I kind of want to say like your
44:00 - name in the top right so I'm gonna do
44:03 - that in the base template so let's now
44:06 - that means that we have to pass every
44:11 - time the session name oh no we can just
44:15 - fetch request it and display it if
44:17 - they're logged in in the bar okay so
44:20 - we'll do it from JavaScript but I need
44:23 - to make something in the bars another
44:24 - linked if then there's their way I can
44:27 - hide yeah I can hide things in
44:30 - JavaScript from the thing okay so let's
44:32 - do that then so window dot onload and
44:38 - here it'll populate it add messages
44:48 - okay I could just write it base mmm
44:53 - this needs to be in the base template
44:56 - sure I think I want to do this just hide
44:59 - it if they don't have a name I'll fetch
45:01 - request to get name if they don't have a
45:03 - name then just okay so we could do that
45:06 - I'd say so you're saying that's name
45:10 - equal weights get name I'm pretty sure
45:17 - get name just returns blank are not
45:21 - getting named load name okay say load
45:25 - name
45:26 - so if name does not equal blank then
45:35 - what we'll do is just add it into the
45:37 - bar or we'll just hide one of the things
45:39 - so to hide which can look up my other
45:42 - computer or actually it let's just go
45:44 - yeah hide HTML tag JavaScript style dot
45:58 - display is that a thing which is there a
46:01 - better way to do that
46:03 - how'd you toggle between hiding and
46:05 - showing an element Oh
46:07 - jQuery hide I kind of like this one
46:09 - buttoned up click function P hide I
46:13 - think I can use that
46:18 - okay so we'll do that now I need to go
46:20 - to history or base and just get some IDs
46:24 - for these tags so say log in log out ID
46:28 - equals log in ID equals log X okay so
46:42 - here star plug in dot hides all same
46:54 - thing but this means I should have to
46:57 - show it again
46:58 - slash next by default it should be okay
47:01 - so log out log in log out okay see if
47:06 - that works
47:09 - yeah okay so currently I'm logged in so
47:12 - just as log out history chat log out now
47:14 - we get the login page okay nice so
47:18 - actually maybe I shouldn't even show
47:20 - anything I should just show login like I
47:22 - know it's fun they can try to click it
47:25 - and it won't work so log in log out okay
47:26 - so I like that log in Tim submit
47:30 - successfully logged in as Tim log out so
47:34 - I'm thinking beside like this thing I
47:36 - just want to show their name like in the
47:37 - top right hand corner of the bar I don't
47:41 - know if that's really necessary let's
47:43 - see what you guys stay in the chat here
47:46 - agreed what development environments
47:55 - okay anyways that'sthat's fun
47:58 - alright so jQuery hide that works pretty
48:00 - well to be honest now I'm thinking maybe
48:03 - some like descriptive text like this so
48:06 - I want to change how this login page
48:09 - looks cuz like look at this light like
48:11 - it looks pretty ugly what I'm picturing
48:13 - is like a big huge text box that says
48:16 - like name and then like linear almost
48:19 - like enter your name name submit button
48:21 - I don't know let's see login
48:25 - page HTML template let's see how I can
48:29 - steal something see like this is kind of
48:33 - what I want but it's just a username and
48:35 - then yeah so like that like something
48:37 - like that is nice let's see can I like
48:41 - just steal download I want to just view
48:49 - HTML this gonna give me like a wordpress
48:54 - theme oh wow it's like that okay all
48:57 - right so let's steal this and then just
49:00 - modify it message animate toggle opacity
49:03 - slow okay so we'll modify that we'll
49:09 - leave the background how we have it okay
49:13 - so let's just go to index space
49:26 - okay so it's a message block lock
49:29 - content posts okay so I need to modify
49:31 - that so this works on so this has type
49:37 - text' ID static name - don't need
49:53 - password login form text placeholder
50:04 - username okay yeah its input name it's
50:13 - fine so I'll leave the placeholders
50:18 - username but yeah just that form
50:43 - [Music]
50:47 - okay some changes here some it's from
50:57 - inline sack name - I'll have to change
51:00 - the styling a little bit on it but
51:02 - should be okay like that okay
51:08 - I could have messed that up pretty badly
51:09 - but we'll see and then let's go take the
51:11 - styling oh my god okay well we'll just
51:19 - do this in line then block title can I
51:24 - like literally just add style I think I
51:26 - can style slash style
51:37 - [Music]
51:41 - type equals text slash CSS okay so it's
51:49 - just a madness of a file but that's okay
51:51 - so this should actually work hopefully
51:52 - div class form I don't think I had like
51:56 - a different ID on the other form um I'm
52:00 - gonna look on get nice yeah it should be
52:03 - okay just say for login form
52:07 - I'm sure my member found a name on that
52:09 - I want to look at the github for a
52:11 - second and that I think I need that dog
52:14 - message I looked up for my animate
52:16 - height toggle opacity toggle although I
52:24 - don't think I even have anything called
52:26 - message yeah no I don't think that
52:27 - matters okay so submit button primary
52:29 - let's see what you guys are saying sent
52:34 - block is JavaScript code now it's not
52:35 - JavaScript code
53:01 - I'm just gonna look at my other
53:02 - JavaScript for a second I know this is
53:04 - like the worst way to do it but it's
53:05 - just um just goes static Jay yes or not
53:12 - jazz what am i doing application
53:15 - templates login see if I had any
53:20 - specific name here no okay so let's run
53:31 - that
53:36 - whoa Oh God
53:42 - okay we'll fix it over I honestly don't
53:53 - really mind the like obviously this box
53:57 - behind it is like pretty broken but I
53:59 - don't really mind the green although I
54:01 - don't really want to keep it green but
54:02 - that's just gonna be some styling now
54:04 - okay so login contain our info and I'm
54:12 - gonna have one of those Tanner in
54:15 - postman I don't I want to lose either
54:17 - continue I fo standard out info h1 don't
54:21 - have one of those either okay
54:22 - Tanner info no container before I
54:25 - believe that container such a relative
54:30 - for message a I don't have any a tags
54:33 - okay so it's form do we have any even
54:39 - message tags we're stealing no so we
54:41 - don't need that she registered for one
54:44 - we do know much but in hover but an
54:49 - active form input form login page okay
54:58 - so let's go back now fresh okay so I
55:03 - still have this container in the back
55:04 - though and I going to assume that's
55:06 - because in the base template I have div
55:09 - container for block content so I'm just
55:12 - going to remove this actually and we'll
55:15 - implement it in the base templates or in
55:18 - the child templates as we please
55:19 - so in login not not in login in like all
55:24 - of them except login will have div
55:26 - container
55:29 - / div in the index / div okay and then
55:44 - was there any other ones no that should
55:46 - be it okay so let's look at this there
55:53 - we go okay so that's nicer immediately I
55:57 - mean I like this a little bit better
55:58 - so just say Tim submit successfully
56:02 - logged in as Tim okay nice
56:04 - so logout I like actually I'm kind of
56:07 - liking this like green button theme to
56:09 - be honest with you yeah okay I'm almost
56:16 - just happy leaving that kind of the way
56:17 - it is right now as a login button I want
56:20 - to see how it looks on my phone actually
56:21 - on mobile and then we'll go from there
56:24 - so let's go what do you guys think Tim
56:28 - you have have you read the book head
56:29 - first Java
56:30 - no I have not
56:35 - okay let's go login oh it looks pretty
56:38 - nice on the phone - oh and it even
56:39 - focuses in when you click on it okay I
56:42 - just want to change this to say name as
56:44 - placeholder because the username
56:46 - lowercase is kind of messing with me but
56:48 - other than that that's fine so let's go
56:52 - shit's wrong one login say name ok
57:01 - actually we'll say your name cuz why not
57:04 - so I like that green so now the idea is
57:07 - like do I accent some other pages with a
57:10 - little bit of green do a bit more
57:11 - styling your name yeah I like that
57:15 - better submit on the history page I want
57:21 - to say okay so Joey left the server
57:27 - that's a 1041 so I'm still getting this
57:30 - damn message leave thing I don't know
57:32 - why though I genuinely don't know why
57:34 - not I completely remove that from my
57:36 - JavaScript make sure that's saved I
57:46 - think it's just like a mess up like with
57:49 - the cache these views
58:03 - let's see what people are saying here
58:05 - okay hey Tim funny thing is I actually
58:14 - just looked at the same article
58:15 - yesterday but ran to an error and didn't
58:17 - have time to study it out I'll have to
58:18 - come watch you later and see how you did
58:20 - Tim have you read black hat pie no send
58:24 - button green as well
58:26 - yeah good idea let's do that let's make
58:28 - it green so whatever I've done for the
58:30 - button forum button hugger forum button
58:38 - even form input I'm gonna say I want to
58:42 - see what happens if I just move these
58:48 - into uh base leave them and the other
58:57 - one for now but let's just see how this
59:01 - looks
59:10 - oh that literally didn't oh it's because
59:14 - these have bootstrap classes on them so
59:16 - I think I need to remove the bootstrap
59:17 - class or at least just change this
59:19 - although what do you guys think like I
59:22 - kind of like the way it is with the gray
59:24 - although that yeah just the send button
59:25 - being green maybe would be a bit better
59:27 - so I don't need to necessarily add all
59:28 - of this for an input dot form button ah
59:35 - - so what does this have color font size
59:41 - transition cursor so hey that's okay so
59:48 - let's go to you index let's add some
59:55 - style tags here so style
59:59 - I'm gonna go ID son bun okay so let's do
60:06 - pound send BTN steal that background and
60:19 - then just remove this class okay send
60:27 - button login grunt outline
60:37 - actually yeah the only I don't want is
60:39 - padding okay let's see how that looks
60:53 - and then get rid of that out of the
60:56 - index actually or out of base I do want
61:02 - that button:hover though okay so let's
61:04 - get rid of that login not login index
61:14 - okay let's see this okay home empty
61:31 - cache every start send ah see I don't
61:35 - know if I'm a fan of that though like
61:37 - how seeds will square rounding off a
61:40 - button I need to be a little bit bigger
61:42 - than that to maybe we will pad it
61:45 - actually border could I do like five
61:47 - here does that what is that gonna do cuz
61:51 - I'm definitely not a fan of that button
61:52 - I might just steal a bootstrap button
61:55 - and actually make it and just make it
61:57 - green so let's just do that boot strap
62:00 - button green like this one see like a
62:08 - button like that is nice see button
62:10 - success just steal that and then put
62:16 - that in here this is my least favorite
62:18 - part of making websites trying to style
62:21 - it just take so long for it we'll leave
62:23 - that WebKit transition with color okay
62:34 - okay that looks much better in my
62:36 - opinion this scent it's obviously a
62:38 - little bit different than the login
62:41 - button see I'm almost considering making
62:43 - this one yeah I want to make this one
62:46 - that class see if that will override too
62:49 - much or not if I make it button success
62:51 - in the other one so let's go login type
62:56 - button button button primary see how
63:01 - guessing really this and then just
63:06 - change the color shape we'll leave color
63:11 - change the background change the font
63:13 - family okay
63:16 - let's see ah okay that looks much better
63:22 - nice okay so I like that a lot better
63:25 - now history please log in before viewing
63:28 - message history okay nice see what
63:31 - everyone's saying here um let's agree
63:35 - that Tim is smart his mind works on
63:36 - different level I don't know if I
63:38 - necessarily agree with that although I
63:40 - would say different yeah for sure it's
63:42 - flask yes I've been watching the stream
63:44 - from the start hi Tim it's my first time
63:46 - watching you live I wish good luck and
63:48 - bye bye guys I'm only really gonna go
63:49 - for another like 10 15 minutes just
63:51 - because um what do you call it
63:54 - I actually have to go to a job interview
63:56 - chemist and so would you actually
63:57 - release the sappers more kind of a
63:58 - project for YouTube definitely more of a
63:59 - project for YouTube like I would
64:01 - consider releasing an app but I just
64:03 - don't know how to code them secure
64:04 - enough that it really is like the scales
64:06 - to like hundreds of thousands of people
64:08 - and I'm not assuming that that many
64:09 - people would actually go on it but I
64:11 - know if I release this on YouTube like I
64:12 - could probably get a few thousand people
64:14 - to actually go on a website and join it
64:16 - and yeah I don't know if that is you
64:19 - know maybe the best idea
64:20 - okay I'm liking this then looks a lot
64:21 - cleaner now I like this green the accent
64:25 - this history page needs to have
64:27 - something fixed though with with this
64:29 - bar because it's like and you said at
64:30 - least show like no message history or
64:32 - something because right now it's kind of
64:34 - boring you need to delete this database
64:36 - again
64:40 - okay
64:41 - so let's go to history and then get
64:48 - scroll height 500 J us this messages
65:00 - don't see us as height messages messages
65:04 - messages so in history ah because it
65:10 - doesn't have that messages div because
65:15 - I'm just showing them here so I need a
65:17 - div that just has messages okay so div
65:25 - div id equals messages okay let's just
65:34 - see what I had an index class
65:36 - overflow:auto oh I just forgot the ID
65:41 - and the other one yeah I think what am i
65:48 - doing putting another div inside one all
65:49 - I need is really just div like this okay
65:55 - so that should work let's go aha
66:00 - beautiful okay so now I'm thinking a
66:02 - little heading at the top like it nice
66:04 - let's actually just go bootstrap
66:05 - headings for a second
66:17 - any ones I can get that are like I don't
66:30 - even anything crazy I don't really want
66:32 - typography just looking for like
66:34 - customized headings fancy headed with
66:41 - phase faded secondary text can just do
66:48 - with like an H for bootstrap heading
66:51 - although I do I kind of want it to be
66:55 - like centered and let's see you know
67:00 - what let's just go with this for now see
67:03 - how this looks for message history okay
67:20 - so let's go here so I don't want to
67:26 - inside that actually though yeah see so
67:39 - that's not what I want it centered okay
67:42 - so Center heading HTML I think I can
67:47 - just do like text-align:center or
67:48 - something
67:50 - yeah line Center very nice
67:58 - although is that gonna put it in the
68:00 - middle of the screen let's see ah you
68:10 - message history okay I mean I feel like
68:12 - that doesn't look that good though or
68:13 - like there's any way I could pad it and
68:16 - make it a little bit bigger
68:17 - okay so let's go h3 style padding : 10
68:28 - pixels ah that looks a lot better okay
68:33 - you message history I almost want like a
68:35 - nice little underline let's see I think
68:37 - they have underline here I'm not
68:42 - necessarily underlined but like line
68:48 - components buttons button group
68:55 - dropdowns form input group list group
68:58 - bar page nation
69:00 - what is pagination oh okay progress
69:04 - tooltips oh that's kind of cool
69:11 - what's actually neat okay so what you
69:14 - guys are saying so guys for everyone
69:19 - asking me now is ask me what language
69:20 - I'm using I'm using like four different
69:22 - languages right or four three I think
69:24 - it's three I don't I'm using HTML CSS
69:27 - JavaScript and Python Python is majority
69:30 - the back end javascript is majority the
69:32 - front end HTML is just displaying stuff
69:34 - and yeah that's pretty much what it is
69:36 - okay I want colors display I spelt like
69:45 - a line like I've seen it before spacing
69:51 - text
69:58 - okay let's just look for this mm strap
70:04 - line okay give me a line horizontal
70:08 - divider if you want to divide it with
70:23 - text in the middle let's see what this
70:28 - does
70:37 - just curious so I'll go like this the
70:42 - message history
70:43 - oh that give me a play yeah for sure
70:59 - that could definitely be it okay div
71:03 - stick what I had here
71:16 - what do you guys think like a nice
71:18 - a-line like that like I feel like that
71:20 - looks kind of kind of cool or I could
71:22 - put a line like underneath it just seems
71:25 - like cuz the padding is like kind of
71:27 - messing it up almost if you like let's
71:29 - see if I get rid of the padding we put
71:32 - the padding like on the road Dave
71:34 - instead although that's just gonna apply
71:43 - to everything inside of it now um okay
71:48 - let's just see this padding Cadieux
71:56 - there's a way to do like padding top is
71:58 - it like that cuz I just really wanted
72:00 - off the top oh yeah there we go view
72:04 - message history let's see more spacing
72:12 - between the text and the header
72:15 - okay you can do let's see what
72:18 - everyone's saying here let's see okay I
72:29 - actually think this looks kind of nice I
72:30 - mean like maybe it's not perfect but
72:33 - like it's kind of nice it's good chat
72:35 - I almost want to do the same thing here
72:37 - with the chat and say like start
72:39 - chatting or something like because now
72:41 - it seems like it could be consistent
72:43 - which means I almost want to put this
72:45 - well I'm just gonna copy then the other
72:46 - one it's fun detainer start chatting
72:57 - okay
72:58 - which means index touch yes this is
73:00 - gonna go down to be 72 minus 250 okay
73:22 - there we go so I like that start
73:24 - chatting history view message history I
73:29 - don't know why it's yeah it's always
73:32 - staying so I don't to fix that in the
73:34 - bar too okay so let's go to base now I'm
73:39 - var toggler okay no bar not active do
73:48 - you guys know how to make it so it
73:49 - changes which one's active based on what
73:52 - ones click done um don't know if that's
73:54 - a thing or if it should automatically do
73:55 - that maybe chat history logout history
74:00 - okay okay um nice yeah
74:05 - and then we have a little login button
74:07 - click Submit
74:10 - okay so let's do some dislike last
74:12 - minute testing and then I'm probably
74:13 - gonna call it the end of the stream
74:15 - actually I don't really know how long
74:16 - I've been going for think like started
74:18 - at 9:45 can hour and 15 months maybe
74:21 - okay so let's just login as someone's
74:24 - name in here a v ---b let's login as u v
74:30 - ---b okay successfully logged in as a
74:32 - beep close that let's go what is up send
74:39 - okay so now here to clear this cache
74:52 - sorry then just on my laptop right now
74:54 - just to test this so let's go and we'll
74:57 - login as Tim on this one submit okay so
75:02 - now I'll just start chatting over here
75:05 - nothing much how about you send okay so
75:11 - there we go and then we'll just say same
75:17 - old you know okay so now if we go to
75:21 - history ah okay so history is messing up
75:25 - what is up same old you know what is up
75:27 - nothing much we meet same up
75:30 - so that's sending it twice okay so view
75:34 - message history since it's a pending in
75:36 - there every time I add it it should just
75:38 - refresh okay so I think I know what to
75:40 - do okay so let's go to history message
75:50 - unless those messages are being saved
75:52 - twice potentially though I don't think
75:55 - they are is if they're being saved twice
75:57 - I mean if i refresh this see log out
76:03 - okay so I'm just checking something on
76:05 - my laptop
76:08 - okay so the history tab kind of broke
76:11 - there for a second
76:12 - because I really just like history
76:15 - should just show me oh because maybe it
76:18 - has the same name so that's why ah okay
76:21 - so ID cuz message is in the history tab
76:26 - which means the Java scripts actually
76:27 - updating this when it shouldn't be ID
76:30 - equals messages one I'm just gonna do
76:33 - that because when I go to JavaScript so
76:38 - now unless I can just make this can I
76:41 - make this a class in here and effect a
76:42 - class yeah let's make class messages so
76:48 - instead of history plus equals MSG's
77:02 - okay that if we go to next go to next
77:07 - touch yes Josh honest yes and then we
77:14 - need to go to base not base index and
77:17 - give because this is an overflow:auto
77:21 - class can I add more than one class C
77:24 - more than one class HTML yes
77:32 - do you just oh you just throw the right
77:34 - class C yep right after it okay so how
77:38 - does Jess okay so let's see if that is
77:40 - gonna work ah there we go okay so that's
77:45 - exactly what I figured so history okay
77:47 - so chats boom sweet so that's working
77:50 - okay um yeah and in fact so the chat one
77:55 - should be this big the history one
77:58 - should be a little bit bigger actually
77:59 - so maybe I'll just change it based on ID
78:01 - so this one is the history ID message
78:11 - history
78:13 - you know it's fine for now okay let's
78:15 - see what you guys are saying so I'm just
78:17 - gonna read through the chat because I am
78:18 - actually about to hop off here I'm gonna
78:20 - do a commit here to get hub say fixed
78:26 - some styling errors commit and push push
78:35 - that there let's read through the chat
78:37 - answer some questions before I head off
78:39 - kind of a Q&A time here if you guys have
78:40 - anything you want to ask one looks nice
78:45 - then thank you much there's a flash
78:49 - tutorial yes there is this iOS and
78:52 - Android apps use HTML um I guess you
78:54 - could I mean depends really wait a sec
78:56 - well did I just see my name yes if he
78:58 - put you in there what's the background
79:00 - music one of my roommates actually make
79:02 - some cool beats you guys can check out
79:03 - his soundcloud in the description he
79:05 - made makes me all these songs cuz its
79:07 - copyright free so yeah I'm just
79:09 - designing custom emojis for a discord
79:11 - bought to command right now while
79:12 - watching hello there I just joined
79:14 - what's up please tell socket function
79:16 - hello I love programming in Python I
79:19 - wish I was better any tips for
79:21 - improvement keep practicing don't give
79:23 - up on it why not use vs code I don't
79:25 - know I just I like pie chart makes sense
79:26 - for what I'm doing all the vs code
79:28 - probably would be better for this hi Tim
79:29 - music is great awesome thank you how'd
79:31 - you get into coding so early there
79:33 - family history not really I actually
79:35 - just have always been like interested in
79:36 - how things worked and I one day just
79:38 - looked up like coding and kind of fell
79:40 - in love with it and started going on my
79:41 - journey being becoming a programmer Tim
79:45 - how do you make money with coding start
79:46 - a YouTube channel get a job I don't know
79:48 - there's lots of ways to make money with
79:49 - coding in fact it's one of the
79:50 - highest-paying kind of careers to make a
79:53 - website you can make startup you could
79:55 - do freelance you could tutor people you
79:57 - literally could start a YouTube channel
79:58 - I mean you guys are aware this makes me
80:00 - money by the way Tim thanks for your
80:02 - videos watch your Python project video
80:03 - today and made Tic Tac Toe with computer
80:05 - moves thanks no problem missed the
80:07 - beginning is the block complete pretty
80:08 - much so annoying I turned in at the end
80:11 - sorry guys I wish I would have gone for
80:12 - longer and I'll probably will continue
80:14 - doing more live streams because they're
80:15 - just so easy to get up and do like an
80:16 - hour and a half or two hour one and then
80:19 - you know we will in about a week and a
80:21 - half I'll end up doing one that's
80:22 - probably like you know 12 hours like
80:24 - we've done before recently how to
80:26 - software
80:26 -  and c-sharp what books do you
80:28 - recommend reading
80:30 - I don't read any programming books so I
80:32 - couldn't give you anything for that
80:33 - thanks to your content no problem K last
80:36 - chance here guys I'm gonna give it like
80:37 - two three minutes I'm gonna hop off you
80:39 - have anything more you want to ask this
80:40 - is the opportunity to do so we would
80:43 - love more live streams awesome yeah if
80:44 - you guys like one a live stream leave a
80:46 - like on this one right now let me know
80:48 - that's how I kind of know what you guys
80:49 - want let's look at the analytics on this
80:52 - live stream we take a second it's
80:54 - already six thousand people have played
80:55 - back this stream that's pretty
80:57 - impressive how are using sockets for web
81:00 - it's flask IO sockets I mean I know how
81:03 - old you are I'm 19
81:04 - I like the live streams nice that's good
81:06 - to know bro you looking so good thank
81:11 - you
81:12 - what's the best way to learn programming
81:13 - um by doing it I mean like that's kind
81:17 - of a hard question to answer that's like
81:18 - what's the best way to learn math well
81:19 - you got to do math to learn math right
81:21 - I don't know watch youtube videos tech
81:23 - with tim youtube channel but then
81:25 - actually on your own time don't just
81:26 - fall along the toriel's actually start
81:28 - programming things and exploring and
81:29 - working on projects we do some we could
81:33 - do some a series of making some smoked
81:35 - cool projects and live streams yeah be
81:37 - nice to do that I could I've been
81:38 - thinking about doing like the one hour
81:40 - pie game competition where I have like
81:42 - one hour just make the best game and pie
81:44 - game that I can make cuz I'd be a speed
81:46 - coding for an hour which would be kind
81:49 - of cool were you born in 2000 I was
81:51 - where'd you learn all these just a lot
81:53 - practice man you have any recommendation
81:55 - for starting learning machine learning
81:57 - watch my course on machine learning it's
81:59 - pretty beginner friendly I have like a
82:00 - big six hour one that combines a bunch
82:02 - of stuff that's pretty good is there way
82:04 - where I can run flasks in debug mode
82:06 - from the run button and pycharm no no
82:08 - you just have to like set debug mode in
82:11 - the thing
82:12 - it's a weird I'm studying it's what is
82:14 - this physiology I think that's how you
82:17 - say I'm listening to this at the same
82:18 - time no that's pretty normal I feel like
82:20 - this is interesting like regardless of
82:21 - what faculty are in our program do you
82:24 - learn different types of algorithms sure
82:26 - how long you've been coding like six
82:28 - seven years will you ever make a yuna me
82:30 - course I will never make eight you
82:31 - actually I don't wanna say that
82:32 - definitively but chancellor I will not
82:34 - make it you to me course I might make a
82:35 - course on some other platform there's
82:37 - not a fan of udemy can you tell me
82:39 - developers easy
82:40 - nope I can't tell you that do you have
82:42 - kind of platform probably where I could
82:44 - inquire in case I'm stuck when I'm doing
82:46 - my Python projects unfortunately I get a
82:49 - ridiculous amount of emails so if you
82:51 - email me a question I I'm just gonna be
82:53 - blunt I'm not gonna answer you I mean
82:55 - you can follow me on Twitter Instagram
82:56 - and I might be able to respond to you
82:58 - but discord is probably the best place
83:00 - if you guys joined my discord servers
83:01 - link in the description we have a bunch
83:03 - of staff Aviv's here he's in the chat
83:05 - he's one of our staff members or he was
83:06 - at least um and they're always open to
83:08 - be helping you and there's like like
83:09 - there's four thousand five thousand
83:11 - people in the discord server that are
83:12 - just kind of helping out so that's kind
83:14 - of the community for attack with Tim um
83:16 - could you please create standalone
83:18 - server on Raspberry Pi for website yeah
83:20 - I mean I've literally done that already
83:22 - all I need to do now is just put on my
83:23 - Raspberry Pi standalone server there you
83:25 - go right it's just that's another piece
83:27 - of hardware if you make a server on
83:28 - anything you can make one on a Raspberry
83:29 - Pi wrap up today's topics please and
83:32 - thank you
83:34 - I mean I've kind of already gone through
83:35 - it so I'm not gonna do that completely
83:37 - the coding yeah pretty much
83:38 - how'd you learn programming how did you
83:40 - learn so much you guys asked me how I
83:42 - learned so much just a lot of hard work
83:43 - a lot of learning I mean like wake up
83:46 - every morning learn something new that's
83:47 - genuinely like a philosophy of mine
83:50 - there's not a day I go where I'm not
83:52 - learning something new so that's kind of
83:53 - the thing you know there's not really
83:54 - any days off
83:56 - I think Tim blocked me because I don't
83:58 - see my messages live well I can see them
84:00 - DK Gupta PHP is much easier and you can
84:03 - create route app in less than one hour
84:04 - yeah I'm sure you could make one but I
84:06 - don't like PHP so um yeah okay you know
84:09 - what guys this has been a wonderful
84:11 - shorter livestream if you guys enjoyed
84:12 - these shorter kind of live streams I'd
84:14 - definitely be open to doing them more
84:16 - often more frequently so let me let me
84:18 - know in the chat with that being said
84:20 - like the stream before you guys head off
84:22 - hope you all enjoyed I'm gonna end it
84:24 - today and I will see you guys another
84:25 - live stream or another YouTube video

Cleaned transcript:

all right I believe we are live now I'm just gonna wait one second to make sure everything's working here oh I forgot to get the music going okay we got to get the music going so we're gonna be one second here guys but essentially what I'm we doing this stream while I kind of just look to set things up here quickly is we are going to be continuing from the last one although I won't lie I've done a significant amount of work on this project off camera I had a lot of time yesterday coming in between classes on my laptop or I couldn't stream but I want to work on it so I'll be you starting off refreshing you guys with what I've got here I've actually got this chat working and I've kind of changed frameworks a little bit so it'll be a bit of a refresher on what we've done but if you guys didn't catch the lot the last livestream and you want to see kind of from the very beginning then there is the last upload on my channel that you guys can check out give me one second I'm just going to try to get this music working because this is gonna be painful for about an hour streaming if we don't have that and that's also what I wanted to say we are probably gonna be streaming for close to an hour today I don't wanna go for too long I actually have a job interview later today so I figured I'd hop on work on the project a little bit first and then go from there alright so let's get music again you guys gotta let me know if this music is too loud or too quiet I never really can tell based on my broadcasting software so let's see this right Wow $20 from mr. genius appreciate the super chat man you didn't want to ask any questions let's see what the chat saying here hello how are you doing man hello greetings from Greece this is so true is the front end just flossing they're using a framework you have to tell us a result of the interview for sure I'll let you guys know 125 concurrent viewers appreciate you guys hopping in here hello Python rich JavaScript alright so let's get started and kind of discuss what I've done I'll start with a little bit of a demo and then we'll kind of talk about all the backend work that went into and the changes that we did here so you guys don't remember from last time I'll log out here what I was trying to do was essentially have it so that I had a separate server that handled all messaging communication and I had data from this kind of frontend server here being sent to that server and then it handled the message communication sent out it back and I was kind of working but it was pretty glitchy like it was there's a lot of bugs and stuff so I actually changed framers completely and now I'm using flask socket IO which I didn't even know existed but apparently is built into flask so I'll show you guys a little bit here so essentially socket IO dot on event and you can handle custom events right from flask and it does all the connection disconnection for you so you don't have to worry about actually creating the sockets you just have to kind of understand a bit about the communication protocol which is what I've been doing so let's do a demo so you can see I've changed a little bit this page I want to make look a little bit nicer in terms of like signing in creating an account or whatever that's not creating account it's just like picking a name but let's go with test as our name here and when we go we can see I've actually set up a database as well that stores all the previous messages and the time in which they were sent I'm having a slight bug with that which we'll talk about later but this is just a local SQLite three database and now actually I'm on my phone and I'm on the website on my phone because I have this running on my local IP address which you guys can see 192.168.0.1 don't try to connect to it because it won't work unless you're on my network but on my phone I have the website open so I'm just gonna send a message I'm gonna say hello my name is Tim going to click send and you can see that that message actually pops up on here now notice too when I send a message from here I said hello my name it was test oh wow we get a gray bubble instead of this lighter gray level so it actually separates the different people you can see their names are on the right side our name is on the left side and it changes the date format as well based on who's sending the message so pretty interesting let's see what the guys are saying in the chat here you have a Spotify playlist I do not don't your eyes get tired when you code for too much time yeah definitely they do greetings from Bangladesh hello why don't use Django I've been asked that question about a million times louder please it's perfect what would turn up one anything else you guys are saying here no no 173 K subs with 173 views that's funny yeah but only 53 likes if you guys are here watching right now go please like the stream help significantly hello from India hi from India lots of Indians lo guys okay so let's start getting digging into the code I'll show you guys kind of what I've done and then I'm gonna start working on fixing a few bugs again it's just a shorter stream today I just wanted to hop on I figured I have to do this I might as well stream it anyways so yeah okay so let's look at kind of our architecture of this program now so this is the old message server I split it up into this server file so this is what I was trying to do before is have this client communication all running from this server with like global variables and person objects and it was working but it was just kind of glitchy and then the client was here so you could connect and send messages and I had memory locks and all this complicated stuff so I kind of scrapped that I still kept it just in case but I'm not gonna be using it so instead everything is now inside this website folder so what I have is this main application which is almost the entry point I'll talk about that in a second so the way this works is we import flask i/o we import some things from application which I'll show in a second we create an app using a factory which I'll show you and then we create a socket and then all I have in here is literally just the communication functions for events because I've split everything up into blueprints actually with flask and I'll show you how that works so let's go actually inside application to this init top PI file where things kind of start so this is the create app function you can see here I call create app after importing it from application because this is a package and what ends up happening if I go to or is it an it here is this creates a new flask application based on my environment variables which are in here and then what it does is it imports all the necessary modules and imports a filter which I use in the Jenga templating engine and the database registers the blueprint for the views folder which is here that handles all the routes and then it actually registers a context processor which is used to do a slice operation inside of templates for flask I know this is complicated but it's kind of the easiest way to explain it then it returns this application from the width from the return app so when it returns that that gives us a working application in main so then we can simply socket dot run that app and then run it with whatever the configuration server variable is in our env file now database this just works doesn't sqlite3 database local database is called messages dot DB forgot I don't need to see duck CDW there um and yeah what this does is just you know makes a table closes the connection and creates the table just some basic queries with SQL get all messages we run a query and then we actually have a limit on the query because sometimes you don't want to get unlimited amount of messages from the database you just want say 100 or you just want the most recent 50 or whatever so this queries all of them and then we'll take the most recent messages by doing this and then it returns out in JSON format like that alright so save message what this does is just insert into that table the save message so we're just using date/time objects and then time done now let's see what you guys are saying here how did you connect your PC to your IP address I can't all you do is just run the flask app on your local IP address rather than localhost it's not very hard can I ask why you use regular sockets I'm not using regular sockets I'm using flask IO sockets that's what I was trying to explain I'm also using pycharm okay so this is the views file I'm just gonna go through all of it because I know you guys if you were here in the last one probably want to know what changed so the way that this one works is similar to before essentially I should okay even need Lions global yeah I don't need this oops so let's start cleaning up some code that's also what I'm gonna be doing a bit today is just cleaning some things up making it look a little bit nicer so we can get rid of that now cuz we didn't even need that so I just start by registering this blueprint in view and then I have all my routes so I my login method which has potent guest requests I also implemented this message flashing which you guys saw in the HTML I have log outs I have a home page I have get name which is the used for fetch request from the jQuery get messages which is used for fetch request from the jQuery as well and then remove seconds which just removes the seconds off a date/time string for me filters this is just a slice filter this is a custom I just found this online I just it just does slice for you it so you can use it in Django templates config' these are just grabbing the config variables from the env file and then if we go into static or so into index EAS you can see I've implemented a few async functions here so I have this one up here this essentially just resizes the window that's a chat window to be 90% of the site or 80% of the size of the actual full window this one is just a scrolling implementations of too many messages pop and it'll automatically scroll at the bottom I have a function to load the name to load all the messages I have a function that gets the date now in the proper string format I have the socket connection which is needed for socket IO connection and flask and then this is kind of handling all of the events and sending receiving messages and then we have an onload the onload displays all the old messages on the screen and then add message which simply adds it to the div on the screen so what are you guys seeing here are you storing messages somewhere directly sending it to the client I'm storing messages on in a database but I'm only storing them in a database after they've been sent to all clients that are connected what else you guys saying can these messages be endtoend encrypted they could I don't encrypt them but I mean they could be can we go through GPT especially crap I don't know what that is encapsulate it will you end up code on github you're actually not really supposed to encapsulate flask applications at least the way that I'm doing them so it doesn't really make sense to put them in classes it just makes it actually more confusing I'm just gonna keep it functional for now we make a tutorial on this potentially will your code be up and github there's a link in the description for the code I still see a hundred 70 people in here and 112 likes which means some of you have not liked the stream yet so please go ahead and do that and yeah okay so let's type some more messages so I trying to show you some more features so if you go like like yes sir oh whoa I don't know why that happened of course we're gonna glitch right on stream when what the heck oh it's cuz I haven't I haven't pulled the thing yet let's see here rebase 5000 W I don't know what that currency is just started learning coding great content thank you for what you're doing love your channel I appreciate the super chat man rebase the current branch on top of incoming changers all files are up to date okay I don't know why that sent multiple times because that's literally never happened before but of course that's gonna happen to me now oh it's cuz okay so I think I'm working on an outdated version right now I'm just gonna get my laptop out and push more recent github changes so one second guys on that front so yeah yesterday I was working on this quite a bit on my laptop but I don't think I remembered to push the changes to github so let's do that now alright sorry that I am just boring you guys right now but this is how it's gonna be okay so get that dot ah yeah there was a lot of change down here that I hadn't pushed yet okay so I was wondering why it was like that so it's like I thought I fixed that so give me what's like I'm just gonna get clone this again once we get back onto this computer turn that off there we go all right yeah so I was trying to do a thing where it said like you left the server you joined the server but it wasn't really working so yeah that was kind of why this one had it and then like this new version doesn't that I'm going to show you anyways you'll see yes so inspect by the way whoever told me this where you can empty the cache by leftclicking on this is like a genius thank you so much that saved me a significant amount of time so let's I can actually be able to rebase because I already have changes in here that aren't committed so we're just gonna have to actually get the link again which means I have to go to github alright one second just need to clone this repository guys give me one second oh what's happened to my music Oh still here okay get stash yeah I know you guys are saying get stash but like I've tried to use it it just as like glitchy I just rather use this okay does this work chat web app alright oh no it's only Linux okay let's do that delete okay so now we should have the most recent version so I'll be able to show you guys that's a pycharm sorry about the delay I really thought that app did that just use links I would but my recording software does not work on Linux or it doesn't work but I just have like all these settings in Windows and I don't really care to import over right now um okay close that alright there's something else I wanted to do okay so this needs to be refreshed let's go inspect and then I wanted to remove something from views ah this one okay nice all right so let's run the web server think we should be okay here awesome yep that's what we're looking for let's just go here inspect why can't why is this inspection not working inspect okay well that's great okay there we go login all right so name let's go with Tim submit you're successfully logged in as Tim let's go test what's up my name is Tim and this it's just testing I want to add some more messages so you guys see I also need to add a thing so that it doesn't let you send a blank message so notice this it actually lets you scroll it Scrolls down automatically when a new message comes in so I'm gonna go on my phone again just clear the cache here and show you guys that someone 9 lets go yeh sense you can see it automatically Scrolls down which i think is kind of cool and if you guys think of any other features you think I should add to this let me know but like for example I log out and I log back in as like Joey then it shows all the messages again but now my name changes so the only thing that's kind of conflicting is if floods like two people on the server that the same name then it gets a little bit like okay it just shows you the same thing so yeah that's like the only issue I don't really know how to fix that though because I mean I have to save all the names of the people and then check that you don't already have the same name which I don't really want to do right now but anyways okay let's hear you guys are saying Tim you brought it up man you're helping tons of people appreciate that if you press ctrl f5 that resets cache as well okay use the what's everyone saying okay I don't know sometimes you guys have conversations in here and I have no idea what you're talking to them alright so what I want to do now oh yes there is a glitch where sometimes these messages when they display from the database don't work properly like they display in the wrong order so let's log in as Billy and we'll see and I think it's fine right now but sometimes this sort doesn't work properly on these messages and it shows them to me and like a different order at least that's something I've noticed so I want to see if there's any way I could fix that I also want to see it you guys think there's any other features that should be added to this website I mean I'm kind of thinking that like I want something that looks a little bit nicer but I don't really know okay who's drunk okay if you guys are sending D then I'm just gonna be banning you in the chat so okay so I guess our first person is gonna be getting banned here um remove actually you can go in a timeout like that you can go in a timeout who wants to be a moderator and ban everyone okay put user in timeouts let's see put user in timeouts ah there we go okay that's much better nice clean chat okay um so login logout chat I'm wondering like what else I could do I'm almost thinking like do chat history like maybe I'll add a page right now that says chat history and what it will do is you like when you logged in as a certain specific name it'll show you all the messages in your chat history so actually maybe let's let's go and implement that that doesn't seem like it's gonna take too long and that could be some new work to be doing on this stream because this was coming in just be like a bug fixing stream but that's fine um what's the problem about the name on the site the problem is just that's not secure because it's on my local IP address are using flask on the back and looks like material thing yeah I'm using flask on the back end okay so let's make a new view actually for that and we're gonna meet need a new database method that will query by name so I'm actually gonna say define get messages by name self name alright so returns it's gets wise where's my capital gets a list of messages by username I suppose we'll have a limit on this as well just in case those message in case there's too many so we'll set the limit at 100 by default but they can change that if they want say / am not SAS string return actually this is gonna be a list of dicks so what I'm gonna do here is Lily just copy this query and this results yep and we'll do that here okay so we're gonna say query F select from where name equals question mark and I think what I have to do here is put inside of these parentheses B name which is that although I'm just gonna look it up because I kind of forget how I query like that so I'm just gonna say sqlite3 query by column python okay cuz I think there's something I got to do with like a question mark for the query select star where ya priority okay so it's in execute comma okay sweet so I was right okay so now we'll just say for our and results and someone's gonna tell me how to fix the stem PyCharm Auto completing like it just ruins my time trying type here so let's take this let's literally take the same thing so it results and then results equals I understand this a little bit redundant I'm almost thinking there's a better way to do this although this is reversing yeah cuz it's gonna do the same thing okay actually no I'm just gonna make it get all messages I'm gonna make it one function we could say get messages my name is one sure but it'll just end up calling this interior function hmm cuz I don't want to rewrite this if I don't have to so let's do this so query 1 SF select from where name equals question mark okay so we'll just say limit name equals blanks actually the name equals none and I will say if not none because we'll just do the same thing okay so let's do this we'll say if not name then query this Alice query equals select from so the only thing is I don't want it to be like you have to do a limit and you have to do a name so I'll make another function that will call this properly in here let's do that name content time reverse limit yep that seems to work for me get Beth's messages by name okay so what this will do is simply just call this so it'll say self get all messages return that with the limit comma name and then we should actually be good on that not idea so what is this saying here what's the issue okay let's see what you guys are saying the chat what's your favorite IDE IDE like PyCharm or vs code maybe hello Tim what do you saying find out Tim's actually getting a job opportunity for disk or anything leading online chat company that's not actually true I'll tell you guys later on but I'm leaving it a secret for now until I go through the interviews okay so come on still that's fine okay so get all messages get messages by name I think that should work where name equals question mark ah that's what I need yes so that query nun named comma okay so now what I'm gonna do is make a new route so say that's you route slosh history maybe yeah so this way you could see the history of any user so this obviously is not meant to be like a secured chat site it's just meant to like kind of show the fact and the communication like more just to show off to be honest than anything so define history I guess we'll have a refresh on the history page so what history will need to do is render a template and it will need to send to that template all of the data both the messages ummhmm see a better way to do this so get messages okay remove seconds I will need to do that so now I'm thinking I want a utility function just to save me but it's I'm here define remove seconds from messages okay let's say this is promise geez okay removes the seconds from all messages to be less return list so what this will do is say messages message message message yeah okay souls that return messages this now can just be messages equals remove message of seconds your messages MSG's and then return messages JSON five masters okay nice so now we'll make our other routes here so that's you dodge route are already which already make one at the top I did so actually we'll move this to the bottom so I feel like it makes sense to be there okay so here define history at few dot routes will say define hiss sorry this will need a name for sure and we'll call literally the exact same thing here well I should say get underscore history and get underscore history here just on the fly messages except DB duck gets messages by name and then we won't pass the message limit we'll just pass the name which means we'll get a hundred messages at most and then remove setting for messages return JSON five looks good to me okay so this is actually gonna be the route yeah so just say to turn Graham name string return all messages by name of user okay and then we'll add another route here at few routes history like that define history okay this will need a name for sure so in here I'm just I'm kind of thinking like if you go to the slash history page maybe what we'll do is just yeah cuz they could just refresh the page if they wanted to see the new history is just actually call this so get so will get the history by calling this function I think I can call this even if it's not returning yeah cuz it should just give me JSON response and messages then I could pass that JSON response and messages through to a template and the template could just display them in kind of like a chat window yeah so let's try that for now so that means we'll make it need to make a new template so let's go new HTML file this Tory dot HTML okay add we don't need that let's go to index and just copy some of this stuff okay message history and then say percent percent o'clock content I'm trying to debate how I want to display this if I want to put it in like a table I want to like just show them in like a list like I don't really know see what you guys are saying have you enabled the font no I don't know what that is um you guys chatting about I des another reminder if you guys are in the chat right now please do go and like it doesn't take very long I mean I'm gonna be streaming for like an hour I feel like that's like a word the trade off you guys like the chat and I stream for you so anyways okay anything else we need to clean up your message limit okay so history name okay so let's say messages let's say JSON message is equals get messages I think I can call that um forget history but I don't know if it I don't even let me call that just because it has a decorator of it so you say get history and we'll give it the name of session ass that's what I need to do session name key so if not name key if you say if name P no it's in session then return a redirect of the URL for home and I actually want to flash on the home page please login it's not even home sorry this should actually been logging and it should actually be you don't log in so I'm actually gonna flash on that page please log in before viewing message history like that okay redirect otherwise we'll get the JSON messages and then we'll say return around your templates and this will be history HTML nice we just say data equals JSON message is or will actually say kiss Tory okay so that should be good for that let's go to the slash history page let's go blog content let's just do a for loop and less it out for now just to make sure that this is gonna work before you go too far so we'll start by just saying ya know for MSG in what I call this history yeah so this is JSON so let's start our and for I want to remember what it even has as the indexes here so let's go to database name message time come on display all that I've already done that in index quite a bit so I fit in that Jason let's see here documents where do I add messages I've had this in here somewhere then cévennes events add message here's where it is okay so up here we make divs if type of message does not equal undefined bar glow as a wiggle and bar content that's what I wanted okay so we actually just want the one that's dark right darker here okay so I need to put this in a specific div that's what I remember that makes us look like kind of nice and styled and like shows all the messages so let's go history we're gonna copy that in here for now we'll deal with this in a second and then what I want to do I should I can remove all these quotation marks I don't even know why we need that so I don't even think I need these plus signs actually okay then this should go inside a larger div that's okay no no help stop don't want you to do that oh it should be it's a div for message you're like that and then here instead of that would say msg the name okay msg message p what's wrong with this that looks fine okay so I think that should be okay I need to add something to this div I forget what it was in here div class not that one which is here it is okay class overflow I think I had something to do with that but this should be fine for now okay and I think that's alright see what you guys are saying please don't use var and J s letting const are much better about whatever it's fine front end with template block file div or something so what to use Python for Python handles the entire back end this is just like this is the front end stuff I'm doing right now I need to find where this window was here it was okay so let's inspect now the web server is down invalid syntax that's good I saved it at that point okay so we have history on HTML we have used out HTML get name get messages utilities there's something I need to add inside the base template which I believe is just another thing in the navbar exactly okay so another navbar I actually want to do this oh that's interesting chat okay so let's do this have our item link why can't i okay you know what that's fine slash history history okay it's around the web server okay let's go here no not that one I'm ever gonna be remember which one this is k empty cache whoa see so I don't want this I don't want this message Billy just left the server popping up so I'm gonna need to fix that unless it's literally like that I need to clear the history or something okay so history history missing one required potential arguments name why did my Siri just go off okay so we need to fix that so if you go to history so history doesn't actually need to take name and that's in views okay now there was something going on in my front end here that I need to fix so sending messages let's see here if connect equals true cuz I don't want what is the same response object is not iterable for message in history hmm okay ah wait response object history equals because I almost want to do it like this so I know this is literally gonna do the same thing but I think that should hopefully work let's see what you guys are saying is it offline installer' online it's not an installer it's just like a website you're coding website with Python yep so there's something going on though when it leaves that I don't want the index you can just connect ah that's why because I don't want it to say they left the server so we'll get rid of that for now and then here spawns object is not interval or message in history see it's not saying its response so why am I getting that though that shouldn't be the issue message in history I want to see what history is though so JSON message Eagles get history okay let's just print JSON message I think I have an idea why it's saying that but we'll have an idea here in a minute okay so we got an error here I response bytes 200 okay so that because it's returning JSON fly from get messages from get history you know so let's not JSON Phi okay fresh haha this in history tab so this is all the messages that were saved in the server with an okay so we're gonna have to delete those from here because we're not we're no longer going to save those kind of messages um get history remove seconds okay so face use history HTML class and this needs to be msg it's time okay so that should work no you need to use get body on JSON five all right I mean I think I'm fine using flask yes I am using flask okay let's go login actually history okay so when I click history oh it's because I'm logged in but I felt thought I cleared this okay so let's restart the web server actually so I don't know where I'm logged case of logout history please login for viewing message oh my good why's my Siri keep going off Jesus okay so I need to change something here quickly use where is flash here yeah when we go history history history okay history dot HTML flash zero all right okay so now we go in there and we start typing some messages so let's go Tim submit let's go test message okay another one Kevin login from my phone now and just clear the cache first and see if this works give me one second guys I really should just do this on another computer to be honest you know what yeah let's just use my Mac do you have community version of pie chart I've community I prefer Drive it's a Python same I would agree now you your work on localhost no it's not this isn't localhost right now this is um this is working on my like local area network right so so out to 168 0.1 to 1 colon 5,000 ok let's say ok Joey is logging in successfully logged in as Joey Joey just left the server ok so this is what I don't want what's showing right now Joey just left the server so I think there's something that I need to hate to handle with the leaving of the server so get history get message get name slash history slash home go man handle my event if name and data okay so from here I'm sending a message when someone leaves that I don't want to add add message msg okay where is just left the server this is what I don't want to do disconnect I don't care about if they leave the server so let's get rid of that for now leave it in as like commented out though slash slash okay now let's just check the history on here so let's go history and there we go okay so it shows messages this I think should be longer on the the history page so when you click history it just refreshes it obviously I'm go to chat you got your main message there history login history chat log now I'm almost thinking in this bar here what I want to do is put like their name if they're logged in or say like logged in as just so like they see it in the bar or say like logged out maybe so like some kind of status logout you were logged out if you had a history please log in before viewing message history okay so let's go Joey all right Joey just left the server that's gonna be in message history Joey just left the server okay nice so that's working I'm thinking maybe now like some headers for these so like you know start chatting or like view message history or like you know something like that let's see what you guys are saying means coding language yeah you guys have any ideas for what you think I should add to this do let me know please okay so I need to fix this leaving the server kind of thing though first okay so let's try to do that so I have another laptop beside me which is gonna be my handy tester here as we go through this specs empty cache and hard reload shut up history like okay so does it say in chat now Joey left sir okay so I do need to clear this though so if what you guys might not know is when I delete this database what happens is if it gets too late it'll just automatic automatic Li create a new one so I can keep doing that okay so I removed who don't want remove all that it so save that let's refresh okay remove login when logged in remove logout we're not logged in oh good idea so it'll just check if there's a name in the session if there is a key I like that I actually like that a lot because then that's like kind of intuitive but it doesn't necessarily tell you and although I kind of want to say like your name in the top right so I'm gonna do that in the base template so let's now that means that we have to pass every time the session name oh no we can just fetch request it and display it if they're logged in in the bar okay so we'll do it from JavaScript but I need to make something in the bars another linked if then there's their way I can hide yeah I can hide things in JavaScript from the thing okay so let's do that then so window dot onload and here it'll populate it add messages okay I could just write it base mmm this needs to be in the base template sure I think I want to do this just hide it if they don't have a name I'll fetch request to get name if they don't have a name then just okay so we could do that I'd say so you're saying that's name equal weights get name I'm pretty sure get name just returns blank are not getting named load name okay say load name so if name does not equal blank then what we'll do is just add it into the bar or we'll just hide one of the things so to hide which can look up my other computer or actually it let's just go yeah hide HTML tag JavaScript style dot display is that a thing which is there a better way to do that how'd you toggle between hiding and showing an element Oh jQuery hide I kind of like this one buttoned up click function P hide I think I can use that okay so we'll do that now I need to go to history or base and just get some IDs for these tags so say log in log out ID equals log in ID equals log X okay so here star plug in dot hides all same thing but this means I should have to show it again slash next by default it should be okay so log out log in log out okay see if that works yeah okay so currently I'm logged in so just as log out history chat log out now we get the login page okay nice so actually maybe I shouldn't even show anything I should just show login like I know it's fun they can try to click it and it won't work so log in log out okay so I like that log in Tim submit successfully logged in as Tim log out so I'm thinking beside like this thing I just want to show their name like in the top right hand corner of the bar I don't know if that's really necessary let's see what you guys stay in the chat here agreed what development environments okay anyways that'sthat's fun alright so jQuery hide that works pretty well to be honest now I'm thinking maybe some like descriptive text like this so I want to change how this login page looks cuz like look at this light like it looks pretty ugly what I'm picturing is like a big huge text box that says like name and then like linear almost like enter your name name submit button I don't know let's see login page HTML template let's see how I can steal something see like this is kind of what I want but it's just a username and then yeah so like that like something like that is nice let's see can I like just steal download I want to just view HTML this gonna give me like a wordpress theme oh wow it's like that okay all right so let's steal this and then just modify it message animate toggle opacity slow okay so we'll modify that we'll leave the background how we have it okay so let's just go to index space okay so it's a message block lock content posts okay so I need to modify that so this works on so this has type text' ID static name don't need password login form text placeholder username okay yeah its input name it's fine so I'll leave the placeholders username but yeah just that form okay some changes here some it's from inline sack name I'll have to change the styling a little bit on it but should be okay like that okay I could have messed that up pretty badly but we'll see and then let's go take the styling oh my god okay well we'll just do this in line then block title can I like literally just add style I think I can style slash style type equals text slash CSS okay so it's just a madness of a file but that's okay so this should actually work hopefully div class form I don't think I had like a different ID on the other form um I'm gonna look on get nice yeah it should be okay just say for login form I'm sure my member found a name on that I want to look at the github for a second and that I think I need that dog message I looked up for my animate height toggle opacity toggle although I don't think I even have anything called message yeah no I don't think that matters okay so submit button primary let's see what you guys are saying sent block is JavaScript code now it's not JavaScript code I'm just gonna look at my other JavaScript for a second I know this is like the worst way to do it but it's just um just goes static Jay yes or not jazz what am i doing application templates login see if I had any specific name here no okay so let's run that whoa Oh God okay we'll fix it over I honestly don't really mind the like obviously this box behind it is like pretty broken but I don't really mind the green although I don't really want to keep it green but that's just gonna be some styling now okay so login contain our info and I'm gonna have one of those Tanner in postman I don't I want to lose either continue I fo standard out info h1 don't have one of those either okay Tanner info no container before I believe that container such a relative for message a I don't have any a tags okay so it's form do we have any even message tags we're stealing no so we don't need that she registered for one we do know much but in hover but an active form input form login page okay so let's go back now fresh okay so I still have this container in the back though and I going to assume that's because in the base template I have div container for block content so I'm just going to remove this actually and we'll implement it in the base templates or in the child templates as we please so in login not not in login in like all of them except login will have div container / div in the index / div okay and then was there any other ones no that should be it okay so let's look at this there we go okay so that's nicer immediately I mean I like this a little bit better so just say Tim submit successfully logged in as Tim okay nice so logout I like actually I'm kind of liking this like green button theme to be honest with you yeah okay I'm almost just happy leaving that kind of the way it is right now as a login button I want to see how it looks on my phone actually on mobile and then we'll go from there so let's go what do you guys think Tim you have have you read the book head first Java no I have not okay let's go login oh it looks pretty nice on the phone oh and it even focuses in when you click on it okay I just want to change this to say name as placeholder because the username lowercase is kind of messing with me but other than that that's fine so let's go shit's wrong one login say name ok actually we'll say your name cuz why not so I like that green so now the idea is like do I accent some other pages with a little bit of green do a bit more styling your name yeah I like that better submit on the history page I want to say okay so Joey left the server that's a 1041 so I'm still getting this damn message leave thing I don't know why though I genuinely don't know why not I completely remove that from my JavaScript make sure that's saved I think it's just like a mess up like with the cache these views let's see what people are saying here okay hey Tim funny thing is I actually just looked at the same article yesterday but ran to an error and didn't have time to study it out I'll have to come watch you later and see how you did Tim have you read black hat pie no send button green as well yeah good idea let's do that let's make it green so whatever I've done for the button forum button hugger forum button even form input I'm gonna say I want to see what happens if I just move these into uh base leave them and the other one for now but let's just see how this looks oh that literally didn't oh it's because these have bootstrap classes on them so I think I need to remove the bootstrap class or at least just change this although what do you guys think like I kind of like the way it is with the gray although that yeah just the send button being green maybe would be a bit better so I don't need to necessarily add all of this for an input dot form button ah so what does this have color font size transition cursor so hey that's okay so let's go to you index let's add some style tags here so style I'm gonna go ID son bun okay so let's do pound send BTN steal that background and then just remove this class okay send button login grunt outline actually yeah the only I don't want is padding okay let's see how that looks and then get rid of that out of the index actually or out of base I do want that buttonhover though okay so let's get rid of that login not login index okay let's see this okay home empty cache every start send ah see I don't know if I'm a fan of that though like how seeds will square rounding off a button I need to be a little bit bigger than that to maybe we will pad it actually border could I do like five here does that what is that gonna do cuz I'm definitely not a fan of that button I might just steal a bootstrap button and actually make it and just make it green so let's just do that boot strap button green like this one see like a button like that is nice see button success just steal that and then put that in here this is my least favorite part of making websites trying to style it just take so long for it we'll leave that WebKit transition with color okay okay that looks much better in my opinion this scent it's obviously a little bit different than the login button see I'm almost considering making this one yeah I want to make this one that class see if that will override too much or not if I make it button success in the other one so let's go login type button button button primary see how guessing really this and then just change the color shape we'll leave color change the background change the font family okay let's see ah okay that looks much better nice okay so I like that a lot better now history please log in before viewing message history okay nice see what everyone's saying here um let's agree that Tim is smart his mind works on different level I don't know if I necessarily agree with that although I would say different yeah for sure it's flask yes I've been watching the stream from the start hi Tim it's my first time watching you live I wish good luck and bye bye guys I'm only really gonna go for another like 10 15 minutes just because um what do you call it I actually have to go to a job interview chemist and so would you actually release the sappers more kind of a project for YouTube definitely more of a project for YouTube like I would consider releasing an app but I just don't know how to code them secure enough that it really is like the scales to like hundreds of thousands of people and I'm not assuming that that many people would actually go on it but I know if I release this on YouTube like I could probably get a few thousand people to actually go on a website and join it and yeah I don't know if that is you know maybe the best idea okay I'm liking this then looks a lot cleaner now I like this green the accent this history page needs to have something fixed though with with this bar because it's like and you said at least show like no message history or something because right now it's kind of boring you need to delete this database again okay so let's go to history and then get scroll height 500 J us this messages don't see us as height messages messages messages so in history ah because it doesn't have that messages div because I'm just showing them here so I need a div that just has messages okay so div div id equals messages okay let's just see what I had an index class overflowauto oh I just forgot the ID and the other one yeah I think what am i doing putting another div inside one all I need is really just div like this okay so that should work let's go aha beautiful okay so now I'm thinking a little heading at the top like it nice let's actually just go bootstrap headings for a second any ones I can get that are like I don't even anything crazy I don't really want typography just looking for like customized headings fancy headed with phase faded secondary text can just do with like an H for bootstrap heading although I do I kind of want it to be like centered and let's see you know what let's just go with this for now see how this looks for message history okay so let's go here so I don't want to inside that actually though yeah see so that's not what I want it centered okay so Center heading HTML I think I can just do like textaligncenter or something yeah line Center very nice although is that gonna put it in the middle of the screen let's see ah you message history okay I mean I feel like that doesn't look that good though or like there's any way I could pad it and make it a little bit bigger okay so let's go h3 style padding 10 pixels ah that looks a lot better okay you message history I almost want like a nice little underline let's see I think they have underline here I'm not necessarily underlined but like line components buttons button group dropdowns form input group list group bar page nation what is pagination oh okay progress tooltips oh that's kind of cool what's actually neat okay so what you guys are saying so guys for everyone asking me now is ask me what language I'm using I'm using like four different languages right or four three I think it's three I don't I'm using HTML CSS JavaScript and Python Python is majority the back end javascript is majority the front end HTML is just displaying stuff and yeah that's pretty much what it is okay I want colors display I spelt like a line like I've seen it before spacing text okay let's just look for this mm strap line okay give me a line horizontal divider if you want to divide it with text in the middle let's see what this does just curious so I'll go like this the message history oh that give me a play yeah for sure that could definitely be it okay div stick what I had here what do you guys think like a nice aline like that like I feel like that looks kind of kind of cool or I could put a line like underneath it just seems like cuz the padding is like kind of messing it up almost if you like let's see if I get rid of the padding we put the padding like on the road Dave instead although that's just gonna apply to everything inside of it now um okay let's just see this padding Cadieux there's a way to do like padding top is it like that cuz I just really wanted off the top oh yeah there we go view message history let's see more spacing between the text and the header okay you can do let's see what everyone's saying here let's see okay I actually think this looks kind of nice I mean like maybe it's not perfect but like it's kind of nice it's good chat I almost want to do the same thing here with the chat and say like start chatting or something like because now it seems like it could be consistent which means I almost want to put this well I'm just gonna copy then the other one it's fun detainer start chatting okay which means index touch yes this is gonna go down to be 72 minus 250 okay there we go so I like that start chatting history view message history I don't know why it's yeah it's always staying so I don't to fix that in the bar too okay so let's go to base now I'm var toggler okay no bar not active do you guys know how to make it so it changes which one's active based on what ones click done um don't know if that's a thing or if it should automatically do that maybe chat history logout history okay okay um nice yeah and then we have a little login button click Submit okay so let's do some dislike last minute testing and then I'm probably gonna call it the end of the stream actually I don't really know how long I've been going for think like started at 945 can hour and 15 months maybe okay so let's just login as someone's name in here a v b let's login as u v b okay successfully logged in as a beep close that let's go what is up send okay so now here to clear this cache sorry then just on my laptop right now just to test this so let's go and we'll login as Tim on this one submit okay so now I'll just start chatting over here nothing much how about you send okay so there we go and then we'll just say same old you know okay so now if we go to history ah okay so history is messing up what is up same old you know what is up nothing much we meet same up so that's sending it twice okay so view message history since it's a pending in there every time I add it it should just refresh okay so I think I know what to do okay so let's go to history message unless those messages are being saved twice potentially though I don't think they are is if they're being saved twice I mean if i refresh this see log out okay so I'm just checking something on my laptop okay so the history tab kind of broke there for a second because I really just like history should just show me oh because maybe it has the same name so that's why ah okay so ID cuz message is in the history tab which means the Java scripts actually updating this when it shouldn't be ID equals messages one I'm just gonna do that because when I go to JavaScript so now unless I can just make this can I make this a class in here and effect a class yeah let's make class messages so instead of history plus equals MSG's okay that if we go to next go to next touch yes Josh honest yes and then we need to go to base not base index and give because this is an overflowauto class can I add more than one class C more than one class HTML yes do you just oh you just throw the right class C yep right after it okay so how does Jess okay so let's see if that is gonna work ah there we go okay so that's exactly what I figured so history okay so chats boom sweet so that's working okay um yeah and in fact so the chat one should be this big the history one should be a little bit bigger actually so maybe I'll just change it based on ID so this one is the history ID message history you know it's fine for now okay let's see what you guys are saying so I'm just gonna read through the chat because I am actually about to hop off here I'm gonna do a commit here to get hub say fixed some styling errors commit and push push that there let's read through the chat answer some questions before I head off kind of a Q&A time here if you guys have anything you want to ask one looks nice then thank you much there's a flash tutorial yes there is this iOS and Android apps use HTML um I guess you could I mean depends really wait a sec well did I just see my name yes if he put you in there what's the background music one of my roommates actually make some cool beats you guys can check out his soundcloud in the description he made makes me all these songs cuz its copyright free so yeah I'm just designing custom emojis for a discord bought to command right now while watching hello there I just joined what's up please tell socket function hello I love programming in Python I wish I was better any tips for improvement keep practicing don't give up on it why not use vs code I don't know I just I like pie chart makes sense for what I'm doing all the vs code probably would be better for this hi Tim music is great awesome thank you how'd you get into coding so early there family history not really I actually just have always been like interested in how things worked and I one day just looked up like coding and kind of fell in love with it and started going on my journey being becoming a programmer Tim how do you make money with coding start a YouTube channel get a job I don't know there's lots of ways to make money with coding in fact it's one of the highestpaying kind of careers to make a website you can make startup you could do freelance you could tutor people you literally could start a YouTube channel I mean you guys are aware this makes me money by the way Tim thanks for your videos watch your Python project video today and made Tic Tac Toe with computer moves thanks no problem missed the beginning is the block complete pretty much so annoying I turned in at the end sorry guys I wish I would have gone for longer and I'll probably will continue doing more live streams because they're just so easy to get up and do like an hour and a half or two hour one and then you know we will in about a week and a half I'll end up doing one that's probably like you know 12 hours like we've done before recently how to software and csharp what books do you recommend reading I don't read any programming books so I couldn't give you anything for that thanks to your content no problem K last chance here guys I'm gonna give it like two three minutes I'm gonna hop off you have anything more you want to ask this is the opportunity to do so we would love more live streams awesome yeah if you guys like one a live stream leave a like on this one right now let me know that's how I kind of know what you guys want let's look at the analytics on this live stream we take a second it's already six thousand people have played back this stream that's pretty impressive how are using sockets for web it's flask IO sockets I mean I know how old you are I'm 19 I like the live streams nice that's good to know bro you looking so good thank you what's the best way to learn programming um by doing it I mean like that's kind of a hard question to answer that's like what's the best way to learn math well you got to do math to learn math right I don't know watch youtube videos tech with tim youtube channel but then actually on your own time don't just fall along the toriel's actually start programming things and exploring and working on projects we do some we could do some a series of making some smoked cool projects and live streams yeah be nice to do that I could I've been thinking about doing like the one hour pie game competition where I have like one hour just make the best game and pie game that I can make cuz I'd be a speed coding for an hour which would be kind of cool were you born in 2000 I was where'd you learn all these just a lot practice man you have any recommendation for starting learning machine learning watch my course on machine learning it's pretty beginner friendly I have like a big six hour one that combines a bunch of stuff that's pretty good is there way where I can run flasks in debug mode from the run button and pycharm no no you just have to like set debug mode in the thing it's a weird I'm studying it's what is this physiology I think that's how you say I'm listening to this at the same time no that's pretty normal I feel like this is interesting like regardless of what faculty are in our program do you learn different types of algorithms sure how long you've been coding like six seven years will you ever make a yuna me course I will never make eight you actually I don't wanna say that definitively but chancellor I will not make it you to me course I might make a course on some other platform there's not a fan of udemy can you tell me developers easy nope I can't tell you that do you have kind of platform probably where I could inquire in case I'm stuck when I'm doing my Python projects unfortunately I get a ridiculous amount of emails so if you email me a question I I'm just gonna be blunt I'm not gonna answer you I mean you can follow me on Twitter Instagram and I might be able to respond to you but discord is probably the best place if you guys joined my discord servers link in the description we have a bunch of staff Aviv's here he's in the chat he's one of our staff members or he was at least um and they're always open to be helping you and there's like like there's four thousand five thousand people in the discord server that are just kind of helping out so that's kind of the community for attack with Tim um could you please create standalone server on Raspberry Pi for website yeah I mean I've literally done that already all I need to do now is just put on my Raspberry Pi standalone server there you go right it's just that's another piece of hardware if you make a server on anything you can make one on a Raspberry Pi wrap up today's topics please and thank you I mean I've kind of already gone through it so I'm not gonna do that completely the coding yeah pretty much how'd you learn programming how did you learn so much you guys asked me how I learned so much just a lot of hard work a lot of learning I mean like wake up every morning learn something new that's genuinely like a philosophy of mine there's not a day I go where I'm not learning something new so that's kind of the thing you know there's not really any days off I think Tim blocked me because I don't see my messages live well I can see them DK Gupta PHP is much easier and you can create route app in less than one hour yeah I'm sure you could make one but I don't like PHP so um yeah okay you know what guys this has been a wonderful shorter livestream if you guys enjoyed these shorter kind of live streams I'd definitely be open to doing them more often more frequently so let me let me know in the chat with that being said like the stream before you guys head off hope you all enjoyed I'm gonna end it today and I will see you guys another live stream or another YouTube video
