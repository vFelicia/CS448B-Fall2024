00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another youtube
00:02 - video in today's video I'm going to be
00:04 - talking about something called a
00:05 - disposable email service now these are
00:08 - extremely useful and I use them all the
00:11 - time pretty much what a disposable email
00:13 - is is it's a temporary email that will
00:16 - automatically delete itself after a
00:18 - certain period of time meaning that when
00:21 - you don't want to receive spam or you
00:23 - don't want to give out your real email
00:25 - to an account or maybe when you're
00:26 - signing up for something you can use
00:27 - this email that is temporary but will
00:31 - still work and in this case you may say
00:34 - well why don't I just use at no mail
00:36 - well there's a reason for that and
00:37 - that's because if you use a no mail and
00:39 - then that website or account that you're
00:42 - signing up for says okay well we've sent
00:44 - you an email to this account you need to
00:45 - verify it by clicking on a link how are
00:48 - you able to do that with the no mail in
00:51 - this email we can actually check all the
00:53 - emails that have been sent to this so
00:56 - that we can verify our account without
00:57 - actually giving our real email now this
01:00 - may not be great if you're using an
01:01 - account that you're going to be using on
01:03 - a daily basis or a lot or has personal
01:06 - information on it but if you just want
01:08 - to sign up for something for like a few
01:09 - minutes or you want to access a website
01:11 - but you need to put your email in then
01:13 - this is a really good way to do it
01:15 - okay so let's uh let's do an example
01:17 - here so let's say we want to make an
01:20 - Instagram account like this okay so we
01:23 - want to create a new Instagram account
01:25 - but we're only going to be on Instagram
01:26 - for like five or ten minutes we just
01:28 - want a way to get on it we don't need to
01:30 - use this account again so I don't want
01:33 - to give it my real email because I don't
01:34 - want to receive any emails from it I
01:36 - just don't want to use my real email so
01:39 - instead I'm going to put in a fake email
01:40 - so in this case I'm just going to do 10
01:42 - 3 4 5 6 at mail and nature.com now I've
01:49 - never initiated an email like this I've
01:51 - never created an email email that has
01:53 - mail nater column on it I've simply just
01:55 - made this up on the spot and you can do
01:57 - the same if you want to test this out my
01:59 - full name I'm just going to put some
02:02 - random letters like that and then same
02:04 - thing that'll be my username because I
02:07 - don't really care it I'm just trying to
02:08 - get on Instagram for a few minutes and
02:10 - then the password I'll just do a bunch
02:12 - of random letter
02:13 - got okay so we have to remember this
02:15 - email so I'm just going to copy and
02:16 - paste it and then we'll click signup
02:19 - okay well something went wrong but let's
02:22 - just show you what would have happened
02:25 - here okay so we did Tim three four five
02:27 - six now usually what Instagram will do
02:29 - is it'll send you an email to this
02:32 - account right and it'll say well you
02:34 - need to click on a link to verify your
02:36 - account so let's say it did that and
02:38 - let's say I used the more general email
02:40 - let's say we you just Tim Kim at mail
02:43 - Nader calm okay and we click go and we
02:47 - see a ton of different emails pop up and
02:49 - some some from three minutes ago six
02:52 - minutes ago right about an hour ago
02:54 - and then after two hours it actually
02:56 - deletes the email so that's why it is
02:59 - temporary right okay so let's say this
03:02 - was the email that we received no reply
03:03 - here okay so we'll click on this and
03:05 - then what would happened is there would
03:08 - be a link here and we would click on
03:09 - that and we would be able to verify our
03:11 - account um so yeah that's how that works
03:16 - now the email that I used was Tim three
03:18 - four five six now this one probably
03:20 - doesn't exist right now because no one's
03:22 - used this name but we'll see so Tim
03:24 - three four five six there's currently
03:26 - nothing in this inbox right so if
03:29 - Instagram had sent us that email it
03:31 - would have gone into this inbox that we
03:33 - would have been able to search here and
03:34 - we've been able to click on the link and
03:36 - activate our account without using our
03:38 - real email now the only thing to note
03:41 - about this service here called mail
03:42 - Nader com this is the link up top is
03:45 - that it is public right it says right
03:47 - here free public email meaning I can
03:49 - check any Inbox
03:51 - in the world if I just search like maybe
03:53 - hello that's probably going to be in
03:55 - inbox for that and if I looked through
03:57 - the emails carefully enough I'd probably
03:59 - find some information on some people
04:01 - that have signed up for accounts right
04:04 - because when you sign up for an account
04:05 - it may send you an email that has that
04:07 - information in it so if you're ever
04:09 - creating an account that you know you're
04:10 - going to be using for a variety of
04:13 - things or you're going to be using
04:14 - multiple times or that you have personal
04:17 - information or maybe you're storing
04:18 - money on it
04:19 - you're not going to want to use this
04:20 - email service this is just really if you
04:22 - want to prevent receiving spam emails or
04:25 - you want to
04:26 - line up for something today and then
04:27 - you're probably never going to use it
04:29 - again so yeah that's how the disposable
04:32 - email works whenever you are signing up
04:35 - for an account and you want to use one
04:36 - of these disposable emails all you have
04:38 - to do is simply type in the name of the
04:40 - email that you want and then at mail
04:42 - Nader comm once it's sent the email to
04:44 - that you simply go to this inbox right
04:47 - here and you type the name so say you
04:49 - did Tim three four five like this and
04:51 - then you click go and it'll pop up the
04:53 - inbox and show you the email that was
04:56 - sent so yeah that is disposable email I
05:00 - hope this was useful information to you
05:02 - and that you can use it in the future if
05:04 - you liked the video please like and
05:06 - subscribe and I will see you again in
05:08 - another one
