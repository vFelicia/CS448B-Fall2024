00:00 - hey guys so in this video I'm gonna be
00:02 - trying to show you how to fix the pie
00:04 - charm import error now I say trying to
00:07 - because there's tons of different
00:08 - reasons why this might be breaking but
00:10 - I'm gonna be showing you the most common
00:12 - reasons in this video so please please
00:15 - please be patient and actually launch
00:17 - through the entirety of this video I
00:19 - guarantee if you're here you've probably
00:21 - been searching the internet for multiple
00:22 - hours and all you have to do is actually
00:24 - sit down stay focused for 10 minutes or
00:26 - ever long this video is gonna be and I
00:28 - promise I'm gonna try my best to show
00:30 - you all the different reasons why this
00:31 - might not be working so please don't
00:34 - skip through this just sit and watch and
00:36 - if I don't show your common error it's
00:38 - probably coming later in the video
00:40 - all right so let's go ahead and get
00:42 - started so you've opened up height ram
00:45 - you've tried to run your program and you
00:46 - get module not found can't import module
00:49 - whatever it is import there what we're
00:51 - gonna do now is go through how to fix
00:55 - this so the first thing we're gonna do
00:56 - is open up our command prompt and make
00:58 - sure that we've actually installed this
01:00 - module so we'll quickly just to test
01:02 - that this module is actually installed
01:03 - what we're gonna do is type pip install
01:06 - and then the name of the module so in
01:08 - this case I'm trying to import pygame
01:10 - and maybe that's the one that I'm
01:11 - getting an error with so I'm gonna do
01:13 - pip install pygame and see if that is
01:16 - installed or not if it says requirement
01:18 - already satisfied you've installed it
01:19 - but we want to do one other thing as
01:21 - well to make sure that we've installed
01:23 - this in the correct Python version which
01:25 - is type pip 3 install and then the name
01:29 - of the module as well now if one of
01:31 - these commands fails don't stress out
01:33 - about it but just try both pip and pip 3
01:35 - and now try to import your module again
01:38 - and this might have fixed the problem
01:39 - for you now I'm assuming you guys have
01:41 - probably already tried this and this
01:43 - hasn't worked now what this means is you
01:46 - have more than one Python version on
01:48 - your machine and when you're typing pip
01:50 - you're not installing it into the Python
01:52 - version that you're using in pycharm so
01:54 - I'm going to show you how we can fix
01:56 - that now just quickly if pip did not
01:59 - work for you and this command did not
02:00 - work what you need to do is click on the
02:03 - card that I'm gonna leave in the top
02:04 - right hand corner which is gonna say how
02:06 - to install pagi
02:07 - now I know this is not probably like
02:10 - you're like well PI X on the module I
02:11 - want it
02:12 - tells you how to fix this pip command so
02:14 - go through that and then come back to
02:16 - this video if it's still not working
02:17 - alright so now what we're gonna do is
02:20 - figure out what's going on here and how
02:22 - many versions of Python we have why this
02:24 - isn't working in PyCharm now keep in
02:26 - mind when I say different versions I'm
02:28 - also talking about virtual environments
02:30 - so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
02:31 - to our programs tab on windows and again
02:34 - this is kind of a windows-based tutorial
02:36 - what we're gonna do is scroll down and
02:38 - we're going to look for Python so if I
02:42 - can go find P and here it is so I see
02:45 - that right now I have one version of
02:47 - Python and it says python 3.7 now if you
02:50 - have more than one version this is an
02:52 - immediate red flag that first of all you
02:54 - probably don't need all those versions
02:56 - so go ahead and under stall uninstall
02:58 - the ones you don't need but that means
02:59 - you're probably using the wrong one
03:01 - inside of pycharm so just keep in mind
03:04 - what ones you have there and what is the
03:06 - most recent version of the version you
03:08 - want to be using because that's gonna be
03:09 - important for the rest of this tutorial
03:10 - now if you have anaconda and ideally
03:13 - those count as different versions
03:15 - alright and if you have just different
03:17 - versions of ideally again different
03:19 - versions alright okay so now what we're
03:21 - gonna do is figure out what version of
03:23 - python we actually installed these
03:25 - packages into now when you install
03:27 - python what ends up happening is you add
03:30 - some commands to your path which allows
03:32 - you to type well python in this console
03:35 - so what you're gonna do is go ahead and
03:36 - type python and see what version comes
03:39 - up now if you get a version that starts
03:42 - with a 2 what you're gonna do is you're
03:44 - gonna type quit to get out of this
03:45 - console and try typing python 3 okay if
03:49 - python 3 doesn't work that's fine that
03:51 - means you only have python to install
03:53 - but if python 3 does work that means you
03:56 - have a version of python 2 as well as a
03:58 - version of python 3 so we're gonna go
04:00 - ahead and type python and keep track of
04:03 - what version this is so in this case -
04:05 - three point seven point two and this is
04:08 - this means when you type PIPP or you
04:10 - type pip3 what's happening is you're
04:12 - installing those packages into python
04:14 - version whatever it is that you saw in
04:16 - this case three point seven point two
04:18 - and that's the version of python that we
04:20 - want to be using from inside of hydra so
04:24 - now time to go to pi try
04:26 - and pick this version of Python so what
04:28 - we're gonna do and there's different
04:30 - ways to do this is try first of all
04:33 - modifying our configurations which is on
04:35 - how I'm assuming you're running this if
04:37 - you're not don't worry I'm showing
04:38 - another method in a second we're gonna
04:40 - go to edit configurations and we're
04:42 - gonna select our Python interpreter here
04:44 - now if you see a bunch of different
04:46 - interpreters and you realize right away
04:48 - that you're not using that version that
04:50 - you saw from the terminal go ahead and
04:52 - select the correct version so in this
04:54 - case I need to be using Python 3.7 so
04:56 - I'm gonna select Python 3.7 but if for
04:59 - some reason you don't have any
05:01 - interpreters there or you don't see the
05:03 - version hold tight for one second and
05:04 - I'm gonna show you how we can get to it
05:06 - so I'm gonna select that now but if we
05:09 - don't see that what we're gonna do is go
05:10 - to file settings and then go to project
05:14 - and then project interpreter now you may
05:18 - see a list of interpreters here might
05:20 - say it's 3.6 3.7 whatever it is again if
05:23 - you see them here select the correct
05:25 - version so in this case python 3.7 go
05:28 - ahead hit apply you should be good to go
05:30 - to run your code you might have to
05:31 - change the configuration option to be
05:34 - that interpreter as well now if you
05:36 - don't see these here what you're gonna
05:38 - do is go to this gear icon and click on
05:41 - at and now we're gonna add this Python
05:43 - interpreter to our project and here's
05:45 - where we go into a few little side
05:47 - branches because this will be a little
05:49 - bit different depending on what versions
05:50 - you have and if you're using anaconda or
05:53 - not so if you're using a regular Python
05:56 - virtual environment by just typing
05:58 - virtual env or what that's how you've
06:00 - set it up you're gonna go to existing
06:01 - environment and you're gonna select that
06:03 - environment on your computer it's gonna
06:05 - be dependent on where you saved it so
06:07 - you're gonna have to find that and
06:08 - select that environment and select the
06:10 - Python interpreter now if you're using a
06:12 - condon vironment what we're gonna do is
06:15 - go to the existing environment we're
06:17 - going to click on these three dots if
06:19 - you don't see the environment you're
06:21 - using already which you probably won't
06:22 - and we're gonna find the conda
06:24 - environment that we're using so i'm
06:27 - gonna go to c drive here i'm gonna go to
06:30 - users and tomate and this is just my
06:33 - user this will be where your default
06:35 - anaconda is installed because that's
06:37 - where what we're looking for
06:38 - right now I'm gonna scroll down until I
06:40 - find anaconda three and what I'm gonna
06:43 - do now is go into env s now inside of
06:47 - here you should see a list of the
06:49 - virtual environments that you have if
06:50 - you have any and what we're gonna do now
06:53 - is we're going to select the virtual
06:55 - environment that we wish to use so I
06:57 - assume you guys know how to use virtual
06:59 - environments if you've installed the
07:00 - stuff into them so select the correct
07:02 - one we're gonna go down and we're going
07:04 - to select Python W Exe so let's say
07:07 - chatbots so what I want to use I'm gonna
07:09 - go into chat bot I'm gonna select select
07:11 - Python W exe and then click OK now if
07:15 - you're using anaconda but you did not
07:17 - create a virtual environment so all
07:20 - you're doing is you have one version of
07:21 - Python
07:22 - it's called Conda it's called anaconda
07:24 - what you've probably done when you
07:26 - installed your packages and it is
07:28 - installed it into what's known as the
07:29 - base directory now the base directory
07:31 - can be found or the interpreter for that
07:34 - if you open up this anaconda folder you
07:36 - scroll down and you select Python W Exe
07:39 - so don't go in OT n BS folder just
07:41 - select Python W Exe so if that's what
07:44 - you've done go ahead select okay and
07:46 - then you should again be ready to go PI
07:49 - trem might take a second to reboot and
07:51 - get ready to use that all right now last
07:53 - step if you're not using virtual
07:55 - environments you're not using anaconda
07:57 - what you're gonna do now is select
07:59 - what's known as the system interpreter
08:02 - so here again click this to see if your
08:05 - python version shows up 3.7 3.6 whatever
08:08 - it is that you need if it doesn't click
08:10 - on these three dots go to c drive and
08:12 - find the python version that you're
08:16 - using now this is gonna determine this
08:18 - is gonna be determined on where you
08:19 - saved your python version i don't know
08:22 - the default install location but it's
08:23 - really easy to look up you could
08:25 - probably just google python default
08:27 - install location go there and again
08:29 - select python Exe and if there is one a
08:33 - python w exe then that will set the
08:36 - interpreter for your project and you'll
08:39 - be able to use that version of python
08:41 - from PyCharm so once we've done that
08:43 - we've selected our correct version if
08:45 - this is still not working
08:47 - I don't know what to tell you guys
08:48 - because these are the most common errors
08:50 - that I
08:51 - there's probably something actually
08:52 - wrong with the module or package that
08:55 - you're using if none of this has fixed
08:57 - it for you so just quickly last kind of
09:01 - steps here in case this again is still
09:03 - not working you've gone through you've
09:04 - selected your Python interpreter and
09:06 - you've configured it in here inside of
09:09 - this configuration tab you've selected
09:10 - the correct one and then you've tried to
09:12 - run your program and it still doesn't
09:14 - work
09:14 - I'd recommend first off restarting your
09:16 - computer and from there you're gonna
09:19 - have to consult stack overflow and see
09:21 - what else you can do because these are
09:23 - the most common errors on why you get
09:25 - that PyCharm import error so again
09:28 - please don't freak out freak out on me
09:29 - if this doesn't work for you guys I've
09:31 - been trying my best to help people out I
09:33 - get tons of comments every day so
09:35 - hopefully this can help even a few of
09:36 - you just figure out that pycharm import
09:38 - error and if it did please make sure you
09:40 - leave a like and subscribe to the
09:41 - channel it really does mean a lot and
09:43 - help me out that being said I will see
09:45 - you guys in another video

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys so in this video I'm gonna be trying to show you how to fix the pie charm import error now I say trying to because there's tons of different reasons why this might be breaking but I'm gonna be showing you the most common reasons in this video so please please please be patient and actually launch through the entirety of this video I guarantee if you're here you've probably been searching the internet for multiple hours and all you have to do is actually sit down stay focused for 10 minutes or ever long this video is gonna be and I promise I'm gonna try my best to show you all the different reasons why this might not be working so please don't skip through this just sit and watch and if I don't show your common error it's probably coming later in the video all right so let's go ahead and get started so you've opened up height ram you've tried to run your program and you get module not found can't import module whatever it is import there what we're gonna do now is go through

the correct Python version which is type pip 3 install and then the name of the module as well now if one of these commands fails don't stress out about it but just try both pip and pip 3 and now try to import your module again and this might have fixed the problem for you now I'm assuming you guys have probably already tried this and this hasn't worked now what this means is you have more than one Python version on your machine and when you're typing pip you're not installing it into the Python version that you're using in pycharm so I'm going to show you how we can fix that now just quickly if pip did not work for you and this command did not work what you need to do is click on the card that I'm gonna leave in the top right hand corner which is gonna say how to install pagi now I know this is not probably like you're like well PI X on the module I want it tells you how to fix this pip command so go through that and then come back to this video if it's still not working alright so now what we're gonna do is figure out what's going on here and how many versions of Python we have why this isn't working in PyCharm now keep in mind when I say different versions I'm also talking about virtual environments so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to our programs tab on windows and again this is kind of a windowsbased tutorial what we're gonna do is scroll down and
