00:00 - anyone who might have been confused okay
00:02 - so now for drawing it's a little bit
00:05 - harder just because of what I mentioned
00:06 - as well is the fact that we need to
00:08 - figure out the distance between each x
00:11 - value in each Y value so when we're
00:12 - drawing something in PI game it draws in
00:14 - the top left hand corner of the object
00:16 - so if we draw a cube we're drawing that
00:18 - in the top left so we need to figure out
00:21 - what that x and y values going to be for
00:22 - each cube when we're drawing to the
00:24 - screen so I'm just gonna call this gap
00:27 - here that is gonna be our distance
00:29 - anyway the same thing self W myself
00:33 - thought rose and we're gonna change W
00:36 - and Rose down in our program later but
00:38 - week actually just type it in now like
00:40 - this with 500 and 200 just so we have
00:42 - that set okay so self dot W answer /
00:45 - self dot rose again that's the same
00:47 - thing we did when we were drunk the grid
00:49 - to figure out the distance between our x
00:51 - and y values okay we're gonna say I is
00:53 - equal to self thought pause it's gonna
00:56 - save us a bit of typing in our function
00:58 - here or in our method or just say J duck
01:00 - self dot pause one so we're just saying
01:04 - I which stands for row J stands for
01:06 - column like a classic like convention
01:09 - for it so that we don't have to keep
01:11 - typing pause zero plus one when we move
01:13 - okay so the next one next thing you need
01:15 - to do is now draw rectangle you're gonna
01:16 - say pygame dot draw dot rect like this
01:20 - and then we need a surface we need to
01:23 - color so self uh color and then we need
01:25 - a rect and here is a little bit of math
01:27 - I'm just gonna type it I'll go through
01:29 - exactly what it goes J else by by
01:33 - disciplines one just supposed to just
01:38 - supposed to okay so the reason I have
01:40 - these little plus ones and these minus
01:42 - 2's here is just so you can still see
01:44 - the grid when we draw the rectangle um
01:46 - because if we were to draw with exactly
01:49 - the dimensions of this distance then
01:53 - what would end up happening is we'd
01:54 - cover the white lines of the grid and it
01:56 - just looks kind of weird if you can't
01:57 - see the white lines so that's why I have
01:59 - plus one added here and - - just so
02:02 - we're drawn inside of the circle or
02:05 - inside of the square a little bit and
02:06 - you'll see that in a second so what I'm
02:07 - simply doing is I'm multiplying my eye
02:09 - value which is going to be my current
02:11 - like row
02:12 - Collin by the distance that we need to
02:14 - get to the next one and then same thing
02:15 - for Jay and then this will add ones -
02:18 - twos is just to make sure that we stay
02:19 - inside so a quick example if you don't
02:22 - understand is say we're in a position
02:23 - zero zero so RI is zero and our jesu
02:26 - we're gonna say I multiplied by distance
02:29 - let's say distance is like 40 okay so
02:31 - zero multiplied by 4000 multiplied by 40
02:34 - 0 so our position is zero zero and
02:37 - that's correct because if we're drawing
02:39 - in the top left hand corner here and
02:40 - we're in position zero zero then that's
02:42 - where we to draw again if you go
02:43 - something like 0 10 and you are and you
02:46 - move down I guess so 10 you moving wide
02:49 - down I'm gonna say 0 - distance 0 and
02:52 - you're gonna say 10 x distance let's say
02:54 - it's 40 then we move to that correct
02:56 - position down the screen so this is
02:59 - rectangle X Y width height okay make
03:01 - sense now the next thing we need to do
03:03 - is need to draw the eyes now you can
03:05 - skip this part if you want I'm just
03:06 - gonna copy it in because it's a little
03:07 - bit of math to make it them like
03:09 - perfectly aligned on the square but yeah
03:12 - so we said if eyes and we're saying our
03:14 - center is equal to distance modulus 2
03:17 - because that's gonna be the center
03:18 - obviously or much sort of saying / -
03:21 - it's gonna be the middle of our cube and
03:23 - we're saying the radius that's how big
03:25 - the eye radius is gonna be and then we
03:27 - go through a little bit of math here so
03:29 - circle middle is gonna be high x
03:31 - distance plus center - radius and then
03:35 - we're finding out the X and this is just
03:37 - like a random exit I'm setting by just
03:39 - putting it 8 pixels up like every time
03:41 - because I don't want to calculate the X
03:43 - I don't feel like doing that and I'm
03:45 - drawing two circles based on circle
03:47 - middle one circle middle - and then the
03:49 - radius and a color of black or color of
03:52 - white actually sir or no that's black
03:54 - I'm confused alright anyways with all of
03:58 - that being said and done and you guys
04:01 - probably pretty confused right now let's
04:02 - just run and see if anything's actually
04:04 - happening and you can see we have a cube
04:07 - in the middle of the screen yay
04:09 - so that's all we've done with all this
04:10 - coding uh-huh so far is drawing a cube
04:13 - so actually not quite because we still
04:16 - all we have to do now simply to start
04:19 - having that cube move and seeing our key
04:20 - presses work is just do a little bit in
04:22 - the main loop so let's move down to the
04:23 - no and have a look here what we need to
04:27 - do okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm
04:29 - simply just gonna call a stop move which
04:32 - is our snake object every time this main
04:34 - loop runs and what this will allow us to
04:36 - do is I want to call us before I read
04:39 - your window is it's gonna go up to that
04:41 - method and snake it's gonna check every
04:43 - time that we run the loop if a key has
04:45 - been pressed if it has we're gonna move
04:46 - accordingly and remember that in this
04:48 - move loop here it moves all of the
04:51 - objects for us so it moves all those
04:52 - cube objects and then we're just drawing
04:55 - the grid we're drawing everything in
04:56 - this redraw function so it'll just
04:58 - display that and update that to the
04:59 - screen so let's see here and we got air
05:02 - to put object is not callable
05:03 - self-taught pause ero put something
05:05 - there next all right one second guys oh
05:09 - it's because I used cook okay so
05:14 - apparently I am an idiot and I forgot to
05:17 - add an equal sign here so the issue was
05:19 - simply that this looked something like
05:21 - this then I changed it to square
05:23 - brackets when all I needed to do was put
05:25 - an equal sign like this and now we
05:27 - should be up and working so to reiterate
05:29 - the line here that the issue is that you
05:32 - guys probably saw this when I coded it
05:33 - to be honest is in move in cube it's
05:37 - near the top of the program all you have
05:39 - to do is change this add an equal sign
05:41 - between this like the bracket and the
05:44 - pulse so now that we run it we can see
05:46 - that we have a moving object and that we
05:49 - can move up down left right etc so on
05:52 - and so forth like that
05:54 - okay so play around with that for a
05:56 - second and now we'll get into adding
05:59 - cubes and we're actually almost done we
06:01 - just need to add feet that add cube
06:03 - function message box a little bit in the
06:05 - main loop and that will be finished okay
06:07 - so what we're gonna do now is that's all
06:10 - great we're moving around but we need to
06:12 - add stuff to our cube right like we need
06:13 - to progress the game so to do this we
06:16 - are going to generate what I want to
06:18 - call a random snack that we're gonna
06:19 - place on the screen that our snake can't
06:22 - eat so the way that we do this I'm just
06:25 - gonna say positions equals item dot body
06:29 - and this item it shouldn't be items
06:32 - should be item it's just gonna be a
06:34 - snake object I don't know why I'm
06:36 - calling an item but
06:37 - that's what I'm calling it and we're
06:39 - simply just gonna set like a new list
06:40 - equal to on that list so on okay
06:44 - it's now we're going to say well tree
06:47 - capital T we're gonna do x equals random
06:52 - dot R and range if you have an imported
06:55 - random yet make sure you do that and y
06:57 - equals random dot R and range rows and
07:02 - rows again should be global so let's
07:06 - make sure that this works global rows
07:10 - like that and after this we're going to
07:13 - say if I don't know how I just type that
07:16 - but the length of and I'm doing
07:19 - something fancy here and I'll explain
07:20 - what this does in a second okay so I
07:39 - know I just typed this stuff that
07:41 - probably makes absolutely no sense you
07:42 - guys if you haven't been using Python
07:44 - for a little bit but pretty much what
07:45 - this is gonna do is we're gonna get a
07:47 - list of a filtered list and we're gonna
07:52 - see if any of the positions are the same
07:56 - as like the current position of the
07:59 - snake pretty well so what we're doing is
08:01 - we're saying that we want to make sure
08:03 - that we're not gonna put a snack on top
08:06 - of the snake because if we have a really
08:08 - long snake the chance of that happens
08:09 - actually somewhat high and I didn't do
08:11 - this when I first coated the game so
08:12 - what happened is when you have your
08:13 - snake moving around the screen all of a
08:15 - sudden the snack would pop up but it's
08:16 - like on the tail of the snake which you
08:19 - don't want so what this is doing and
08:21 - just type it out you don't really have
08:22 - to understand it is we're saying this
08:25 - this means a function I said and we're
08:27 - just checking if this Z position is
08:30 - equal to X Y so if it's equal to X Y
08:34 - which is the position we just generated
08:36 - here by getting two random numbers so x
08:38 - and y then we're gonna have to do this
08:41 - again so we say continue
08:44 - and else we break like that and then I'm
08:51 - just got simply gonna return in the
08:53 - tupple or a to go where you want to call
08:55 - it XY okay so this is confusing but um
08:58 - you can do this in like a much longer
09:00 - way with the for loop where you pretty
09:02 - much loop through every position in this
09:04 - list you check it against X&Y you see if
09:08 - it's the same if it's the same then do
09:10 - this loop again otherwise you break any
09:12 - return XY that's all we're doing in
09:13 - there to generate a random snack and
09:16 - messagebox gonna leave that and in here
09:18 - now what we're good okay so now that
09:20 - I've created this this random snack
09:23 - function what I need to do is I need to
09:25 - use it so I'm just gonna create a new
09:26 - object and you're gonna call this snack
09:28 - and it's gonna be equal to another cube
09:30 - right because we want to have the same
09:32 - functionality we want to draw it
09:33 - possibly move it around right so we're
09:36 - just gonna create a new cube object
09:37 - we're gonna give it a position of a
09:38 - random snack which is gonna be something
09:39 - like this random snack and then random
09:44 - snack I believe oh it takes a row and an
09:46 - item so what we're going to do is we're
09:47 - going to give it row or rows and we'll
09:51 - just give it our item which is gonna be
09:52 - s and then after that what else do we
09:55 - need for cube

Cleaned transcript:

anyone who might have been confused okay so now for drawing it's a little bit harder just because of what I mentioned as well is the fact that we need to figure out the distance between each x value in each Y value so when we're drawing something in PI game it draws in the top left hand corner of the object so if we draw a cube we're drawing that in the top left so we need to figure out what that x and y values going to be for each cube when we're drawing to the screen so I'm just gonna call this gap here that is gonna be our distance anyway the same thing self W myself thought rose and we're gonna change W and Rose down in our program later but week actually just type it in now like this with 500 and 200 just so we have that set okay so self dot W answer / self dot rose again that's the same thing we did when we were drunk the grid to figure out the distance between our x and y values okay we're gonna say I is equal to self thought pause it's gonna save us a bit of typing in our function here or in our method or just say J duck self dot pause one so we're just saying I which stands for row J stands for column like a classic like convention for it so that we don't have to keep typing pause zero plus one when we move okay so the next one next thing you need to do is now draw rectangle you're gonna say pygame dot draw dot rect like this and then we need a surface we need to color so self uh color and then we need a rect and here is a little bit of math I'm just gonna type it I'll go through exactly what it goes J else by by disciplines one just supposed to just supposed to okay so the reason I have these little plus ones and these minus 2's here is just so you can still see the grid when we draw the rectangle um because if we were to draw with exactly the dimensions of this distance then what would end up happening is we'd cover the white lines of the grid and it just looks kind of weird if you can't see the white lines so that's why I have plus one added here and just so we're drawn inside of the circle or inside of the square a little bit and you'll see that in a second so what I'm simply doing is I'm multiplying my eye value which is going to be my current like row Collin by the distance that we need to get to the next one and then same thing for Jay and then this will add ones twos is just to make sure that we stay inside so a quick example if you don't understand is say we're in a position zero zero so RI is zero and our jesu we're gonna say I multiplied by distance let's say distance is like 40 okay so zero multiplied by 4000 multiplied by 40 0 so our position is zero zero and that's correct because if we're drawing in the top left hand corner here and we're in position zero zero then that's where we to draw again if you go something like 0 10 and you are and you move down I guess so 10 you moving wide down I'm gonna say 0 distance 0 and you're gonna say 10 x distance let's say it's 40 then we move to that correct position down the screen so this is rectangle X Y width height okay make sense now the next thing we need to do is need to draw the eyes now you can skip this part if you want I'm just gonna copy it in because it's a little bit of math to make it them like perfectly aligned on the square but yeah so we said if eyes and we're saying our center is equal to distance modulus 2 because that's gonna be the center obviously or much sort of saying / it's gonna be the middle of our cube and we're saying the radius that's how big the eye radius is gonna be and then we go through a little bit of math here so circle middle is gonna be high x distance plus center radius and then we're finding out the X and this is just like a random exit I'm setting by just putting it 8 pixels up like every time because I don't want to calculate the X I don't feel like doing that and I'm drawing two circles based on circle middle one circle middle and then the radius and a color of black or color of white actually sir or no that's black I'm confused alright anyways with all of that being said and done and you guys probably pretty confused right now let's just run and see if anything's actually happening and you can see we have a cube in the middle of the screen yay so that's all we've done with all this coding uhhuh so far is drawing a cube so actually not quite because we still all we have to do now simply to start
