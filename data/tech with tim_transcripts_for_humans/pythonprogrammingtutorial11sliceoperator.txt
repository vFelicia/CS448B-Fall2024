00:00 - hey guys welcome back to the eleventh
00:02 - video in my Python programming series in
00:05 - today's video we're going to be talking
00:06 - about the slice operator which is a cool
00:09 - thing that we can use on lists and
00:12 - strings in Python so if you remember in
00:14 - the previous video if we wanted to
00:16 - access an element in our list we did
00:18 - fruits so the name of our list here
00:20 - which I've already got defined as apples
00:22 - pear and strawberry and then we would do
00:24 - the items so for example fruits one we
00:27 - can print that to the screen just to
00:29 - remind us what this did and we got pear
00:34 - just like that because that is the
00:35 - second item but to reference that we
00:38 - have to use one because in computers we
00:39 - start at zero right okay yeah and I just
00:43 - want to mention I didn't don't think I
00:45 - did this in the list video that you can
00:46 - actually do this on strings as well so
00:48 - say I wanted to access the e there I
00:50 - would just do text one and we get the e
00:53 - because that is the second item in this
00:56 - string or character maybe I wanted to do
00:59 - the eleventh one then that will give us
01:02 - another e because that 11 is right here
01:04 - at the end of like so yeah now what is
01:08 - the slice operator look like so pretty
01:09 - much the slice operator is these two
01:11 - square brackets but inside of them where
01:14 - you're going to put two colons just like
01:16 - this now these colons
01:18 - in between them we type some words or
01:21 - we're going to put some numbers in this
01:23 - case I'm just going to show you with
01:24 - words so we have start stop and step
01:27 - that's what goes where these colons are
01:30 - now if I remove this colon that means I
01:33 - just have a start and a stop and then if
01:35 - I remove this colon I just have a start
01:37 - and that's how we reference what element
01:39 - we want to we want to print out right if
01:42 - we had just put a number there so we'll
01:43 - add the colon back in in this now we're
01:45 - going to use numbers so the start stop
01:46 - and step works exactly the same way as
01:49 - the range function so you may remember
01:51 - when I did a for loop we did for X in
01:53 - range and then inside of the range we
01:56 - did some numbers like this so we would
01:58 - start at one stop at two and step by
02:00 - three like that right so it works the
02:03 - exact same way except in this case we're
02:04 - going to be using it on lists and on
02:08 - strings right without these numbers the
02:10 - range like this okay so let's just do an
02:13 - exam
02:14 - so let's start at zero and let's n at
02:18 - this Oh so the O is one two three four
02:21 - five but if I want to actually include
02:24 - the oh I have to put five because
02:26 - remember five would be this space here
02:28 - and if we stop on let's say four here
02:31 - you'll see what's going to happen it's
02:34 - not going to print out the O because
02:36 - when we stop we do not include that
02:38 - number remember from the range function
02:40 - so if we want to have vo will stop at
02:41 - five just like that hello okay yeah now
02:47 - if we wanted to start just from the
02:49 - beginning say we didn't know all we have
02:51 - to do is just put nothing there and it's
02:53 - going to default start from the
02:54 - beginning so it'll give us the same
02:56 - thing and then if we wanted to start
02:58 - from somewhere so say we want to start
03:00 - at two and we just want to go all the
03:02 - way to the end now we say we don't know
03:04 - how long our strings we don't want to
03:06 - count all of these things and say oh
03:08 - well let's stop at 17 or whatever number
03:10 - it may be by just leaving this blank
03:13 - it'll actually default to stop at the
03:15 - end of the string and you'll see that so
03:17 - we get
03:18 - LLO I like Python right it stopped at
03:21 - the end of the string automatically okay
03:24 - so now let's talk about the step feature
03:27 - so if we want to start at the beginning
03:29 - and we want to stop at the end we'll
03:31 - just put nothing in between these two
03:33 - colons because it's going to default
03:35 - from the beginning and default to the
03:37 - end but now we want to skip every other
03:38 - letter that means we're going to put a
03:41 - two here for the step so that way we're
03:43 - going to get h lde oh then we're going
03:47 - to skip the space here we're going to
03:48 - get I skip the space get L and so on so
03:51 - I'll show you and you see we get that a
03:54 - bunch of gibberish like this maybe want
03:57 - to go every third letter that means we
03:58 - would step by three like this and there
04:02 - we go we get a few less letters and same
04:04 - thing we could do four or five and
04:07 - continually going now say we want to
04:08 - start at the third letter R the fourth
04:12 - because we're typing three here so L we
04:14 - want to stop at the end and we want to
04:15 - step by three then you can see what's
04:18 - going to happen there so we get L I I TN
04:22 - right so a bunch of gibberish okay now
04:25 - this works again same thing for fruits I
04:27 - just
04:27 - don't have as many items in the foods
04:28 - list so that's why I was showing you
04:30 - with text but if I put the colon in here
04:33 - and we put another : let's say we start
04:35 - let's start at 1 so that means our going
04:38 - to start up hair and let's just go to
04:39 - the end and we'll print that out and
04:42 - again we get pear and strawberries so we
04:44 - didn't include the apples because we
04:46 - started up pear right so yeah that's
04:49 - pretty much how these slice operator
04:51 - works now there is one other cool thing
04:53 - we can do with the slice operator and
04:55 - it's called the insert function or the
04:57 - insert kind of thing with the slice
04:59 - operator so if you remember we have when
05:01 - we wanted to add something to a list we
05:05 - use dot append right so I showed you
05:07 - that in my list video we did troupes dot
05:09 - append and then maybe want to add
05:11 - blueberries like this I know that's
05:14 - spelt incorrectly but there we go we'll
05:16 - fix that quickly blueberries okay and
05:19 - then we can print out fruits once again
05:22 - just to see what it looks like so if you
05:24 - remember this just adds it to the end of
05:26 - the list but say we don't want to add
05:28 - blueberries to the end of the list we
05:30 - want to add it in between pairs we want
05:31 - to add it in between apples and pear we
05:34 - want to add it at the beginning we want
05:36 - to add it somewhere else right how would
05:38 - we do that
05:38 - well we can use the slice operator to do
05:41 - that so instead of using the dot append
05:43 - we'll use a slice operator sort of like
05:45 - this and this time we're going to put
05:47 - one colon and then type the indicee
05:50 - where we want to insert it so if we want
05:52 - to insert it at the beginning we're just
05:53 - going to type 0 and then 0 like this we
05:56 - do need to do them on both sides and
05:58 - then an equal sign and we'll set it
05:59 - equal to what every one in this case
06:00 - we'll just put B for simplicity and
06:02 - you'll see we get B at the beginning of
06:05 - our list now say we want it in between
06:07 - apples and pear well in that case we put
06:11 - 1 and we put 1 again like this and we
06:15 - get apples comma B comma pair comma
06:17 - strawberries just like that now if we
06:20 - want to add it to the end we would have
06:22 - to find out what number that is we do 3
06:24 - 3 I believe that should work we'll see
06:28 - ya so that I added to the end for us and
06:32 - then if we want to insert it in between
06:34 - pear and strawberry we would do to 2
06:36 - like that and there we go we get in
06:39 - between there so that's how the insert
06:40 - work
06:41 - so the slice operator I hope you learned
06:44 - how to use a slice operator today we
06:46 - will be using it a little later in some
06:48 - other videos and doing some more complex
06:49 - things with it if you liked the video
06:52 - please like and subscribe and I will see
06:55 - you again in the next one

hey guys welcome back to the eleventh video in my Python programming series in today's video we're going to be talking about the slice operator which is a cool thing that we can use on lists and strings in Python so if you remember in the previous video if we wanted to access an element in our list we did fruits so the name of our list here which I've already got defined as apples pear and strawberry and then we would do the items so for example fruits one we can print that to the screen just to remind us what this did and we got pear just like that because that is the second item but to reference that we have to use one because in computers we start at zero right okay yeah and I just want to mention I didn't don't think I did this in the list video that you can actually do this on strings as well so say I wanted to access the e there I would just do text one and we get the e because that is the second item in this string or character maybe I wanted to do the eleventh one then that will give us another e because that 11 is right here at the end of like so yeah now what is the slice operator look like so pretty much the slice operator is these two square brackets but inside of them where you're going to put two colons just like this now these colons in between them we type some words or we're going to put some numbers in this case I'm just going to show you with words so we have start stop and step that's what goes where these colons are now if I remove this colon that means I just have a start and a stop and then if I remove this colon I just have a start and that's how we reference what element we want to we want to print out right if we had just put a number there so we'll add the colon back in in this now we're going to use numbers so the start stop and step works exactly the same way as the range function so you may remember when I did a for loop we did for X in range and then inside of the range we did some numbers like this so we would start at one stop at two and step by three like that right so it works the exact same way except in this case we're going to be using it on lists and on strings right without these numbers the range like this okay so let's just do an exam so let's start at zero and let's n at this Oh so the O is one two three four five but if I want to actually include the oh I have to put five because remember five would be this space here and if we stop on let's say four here you'll see what's going to happen it's not going to print out the O because when we stop we do not include that number remember from the range function so if we want to have vo will stop at five just like that hello okay yeah now if we wanted to start just from the beginning say we didn't know all we have to do is just put nothing there and it's going to default start from the beginning so it'll give us the same thing and then if we wanted to start from somewhere so say we want to start at two and we just want to go all the way to the end now we say we don't know how long our strings we don't want to count all of these things and say oh well let's stop at 17 or whatever number it may be by just leaving this blank it'll actually default to stop at the end of the string and you'll see that so we get LLO I like Python right it stopped at the end of the string automatically okay so now let's talk about the step feature so if we want to start at the beginning and we want to stop at the end we'll just put nothing in between these two colons because it's going to default from the beginning and default to the end but now we want to skip every other letter that means we're going to put a two here for the step so that way we're going to get h lde oh then we're going to skip the space here we're going to get I skip the space get L and so on so I'll show you and you see we get that a bunch of gibberish like this maybe want to go every third letter that means we would step by three like this and there we go we get a few less letters and same thing we could do four or five and continually going now say we want to start at the third letter R the fourth because we're typing three here so L we want to stop at the end and we want to step by three then you can see what's going to happen there so we get L I I TN right so a bunch of gibberish okay now this works again same thing for fruits I just don't have as many items in the foods list so that's why I was showing you with text but if I put the colon in here and we put another let's say we start let's start at 1 so that means our going to start up hair and let's just go to the end and we'll print that out and again we get pear and strawberries so we didn't include the apples because we started up pear right so yeah that's pretty much how these slice operator works now there is one other cool thing we can do with the slice operator and it's called the insert function or the insert kind of thing with the slice operator so if you remember we have when we wanted to

don't want to add blueberries to the end of the list we want to add it in between pairs we want to add it in between apples and pear we want to add it at the beginning we want to add it somewhere else right how would we do that well we can use the slice operator to do that so instead of using the dot append we'll use a slice operator sort of like this and this time we're going to put one colon and

case we put 1 and we put 1 again like this and we get apples comma B comma pair comma strawberries just like that now if we want to add it to the end we would have to find out what number that is we do 3 3 I believe that should work we'll see ya so that I added to the end for us and then if we want to insert it in between pear and strawberry we would do to 2 like that and there we go we get in between there so that's how the insert work so the slice operator I hope you learned how to use a slice operator today we will be using it a little later in some other videos and doing some more complex things with it if you liked the video please like and subscribe and I will see you again in the next one
