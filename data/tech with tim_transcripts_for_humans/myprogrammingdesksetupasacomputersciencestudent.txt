00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:02 - this video i'm going to be showcasing my
00:04 - pc
00:04 - slash programming setup now chances are
00:07 - if it's not your first time on this
00:09 - channel that you've seen this setup
00:10 - before
00:11 - in fact you can see it behind me right
00:13 - now you can see the rgb in the pc you
00:15 - can see the monitor
00:16 - and all of that stuff but i've never
00:18 - done a video where i've actually gone
00:20 - through and showed you exactly what i've
00:21 - used
00:22 - talked about why and potentially made
00:24 - some recommendations if you guys are
00:25 - looking to upgrade your setup
00:27 - so with that said i'll quickly mention
00:29 - that i have an absolutely
00:30 - ridiculously overkill setup here you do
00:33 - not need anything even remotely close to
00:35 - what i have to start programming
00:37 - so please don't feel discouraged if you
00:39 - don't have this stuff don't feel like
00:40 - you need to get any of it this is just
00:42 - me
00:42 - showing you what i use and well i'll
00:44 - tell you if i would recommend some
00:46 - specific items
00:47 - or why i've actually purchased them so
00:49 - let's go ahead and get started and i
00:50 - will talk to you about my pc
00:52 - programming setup
01:02 - so i'll start by just giving you a
01:04 - general overview of this setup kind of
01:05 - showing you what it looks like
01:07 - and talking to you a bit about what i
01:08 - actually use this setup for
01:10 - so first of all the space that i'm
01:12 - located in which is pretty important is
01:14 - in the basement of my parents house
01:16 - now i have a really large room the room
01:18 - that i'm in actually used to be a
01:20 - theater room i have a projector up there
01:22 - and there's like a big flat screen kind
01:23 - of projector screen on the other side
01:26 - we actually renovated and modified this
01:28 - room specifically for me
01:29 - so i was really fortunate that my dad's
01:31 - actually quite handy he built like a big
01:33 - massive door
01:35 - and then there's this big massive l desk
01:37 - that we built specifically for this room
01:39 - so that kind of starts the setup off but
01:41 - what i use this space
01:42 - for is the following so i am a
01:44 - programmer i am
01:46 - a student and i am also a content
01:48 - creator so a lot of the equipment that i
01:50 - have here especially a lot of the
01:51 - expensive equipment
01:52 - is actually primarily used for content
01:54 - creation right so my lights my camera my
01:56 - microphones all of that kind of stuff
01:58 - and then i just kind of tie that
02:00 - together with my programming setup
02:02 - quote-unquote
02:03 - so i have my monitors my keyboard my
02:05 - mouse my computer
02:07 - my lights all that kind of stuff which
02:08 - is specific really for the programming
02:11 - aspect
02:11 - so i'll try to distinguish between those
02:13 - things in this video but just keep that
02:15 - in mind that a lot of the equipment that
02:16 - i have here
02:17 - is simply because i am a content creator
02:20 - and will i need that kind of stuff to be
02:21 - able to make videos that look like this
02:24 - so the order in which i discuss these
02:26 - items has no significant importance so
02:28 - you don't need to read into that
02:29 - but the first items that i'm going to
02:30 - talk about here are my monitors
02:32 - now i will start by saying that i highly
02:34 - recommend anyone that's programming has
02:37 - at least
02:37 - two monitors or one very large screen
02:40 - like an ultra wide monitor
02:41 - i cannot stress how much of a difference
02:44 - this makes
02:45 - being able to have your code on one
02:46 - screen and then have stack overflow or
02:48 - spotify or whatever
02:50 - else it is on the other screen is super
02:52 - important and well i honestly don't know
02:53 - what i would do without a dual monitor
02:55 - setup
02:56 - now that said what i have here is
02:57 - actually kind of a combination of both
02:59 - the things i recommended
03:00 - so what i have here is a 27 inch q
03:03 - monitor with an 144hz refresh rate and a
03:06 - 2k resolution
03:07 - and this here is the lg 34 inch ultra
03:10 - wide monitor
03:11 - now i need to tell you about this
03:12 - monitor because this thing is amazing
03:14 - it's actually
03:15 - game changing and honestly i think i
03:17 - could suffice by just using the lg
03:20 - monitor
03:20 - because it's massive and well for
03:22 - programming it's so nice to be able to
03:24 - have
03:24 - three separate windows vertically on one
03:26 - display
03:27 - now lg was actually kind enough to
03:29 - sponsor this video and send me over this
03:31 - monitor for free
03:32 - so like i said it is a 34 inch ultra
03:34 - wide monitor that has a 1340 by 1440p
03:37 - resolution this gives it a 21x9 aspect
03:40 - ratio and makes the same height as my 27
03:42 - inch monitor
03:43 - this monitor is pretty much designed for
03:45 - programmers and comes with some great
03:46 - software that allows you to split the
03:48 - screen
03:48 - into multiple unique layouts it is game
03:51 - changing to be able to view multiple
03:52 - sized windows side by side
03:54 - and especially great for using an ide or
03:56 - navigating large code files
03:58 - it has definitely increased my
03:59 - productivity and if you want to get an
04:00 - idea of what it can do for you
04:02 - then head over to lg's ultrawide
04:04 - festival website where you can customize
04:05 - your own ultra wide monitor
04:07 - by customizing your own monitor you'll
04:09 - be entered for a chance to win one or
04:11 - get a 50
04:12 - amazon gift card now lg also has a sense
04:14 - of humor which you can find in their
04:16 - campaign video which is a pretty funny
04:18 - skit of a developer not being able to
04:20 - find his
04:20 - error because while his screen was not
04:23 - large enough so anyways another big
04:24 - thank you to lg
04:26 - you can check them in this monitor out
04:27 - from the link in the description and now
04:29 - let's get into the rest of my
04:30 - programming setup
04:32 - so now i'm going to talk about my
04:33 - computers now notice that is plural i do
04:36 - actually have multiple machines that i
04:37 - use
04:38 - some for development some not so much
04:40 - for development but i will go through
04:42 - them so the first computer i have is my
04:43 - laptop this is a 16-inch macbook pro
04:46 - i got this last year this is the i guess
04:49 - 2019 version
04:50 - i don't actually know if they have a
04:51 - newer version and it's the base model it
04:53 - is a six
04:54 - core i7 16 gigabytes of ram and i used
04:57 - to use this for programming when i was
04:59 - in school
05:00 - i actually do like uh programming on
05:02 - macs and this is a great computer
05:03 - because the 16 inch display is really
05:05 - nice
05:05 - and i actually don't mind the keyboard
05:07 - at all so really a great computer i
05:09 - definitely recommend it if you have the
05:10 - budget for it
05:11 - but recently since i've been back at
05:13 - home this computer really
05:15 - all it's been doing is actually just
05:16 - running my audio so i have logic pro on
05:18 - it and that records all the audio for my
05:21 - videos
05:21 - and apply some filters and all of that
05:23 - kind of stuff now i do have this setup
05:25 - with a docking station so if i want i
05:27 - can turn this whole monitor and pc setup
05:30 - into like the mac setup so i can run off
05:32 - of this computer
05:33 - and i have a keyboard mouse switch which
05:36 - means i just press a button and my
05:37 - keyboard and mouse will switch between
05:38 - the mac
05:39 - and the windows computer so obviously
05:41 - that leads me to my windows machine
05:42 - which is my big powerful workstation
05:45 - which i use like
05:46 - 90 percent of the time i really just
05:48 - like working on desktop computers that's
05:50 - just my preference and this thing you'll
05:52 - understand why i want to work on it
05:53 - it is a ryzen 9 3900x processor that's a
05:57 - 12 core processor in there
05:58 - i have an rtx titan or a titan rtx
06:01 - whatever you call it
06:02 - nvidia actually sent that to me i was
06:04 - not crazy enough to buy that graphics
06:06 - card don't worry
06:07 - and it has 64 gigabytes of ram and then
06:09 - there's two
06:10 - m.2 two terabyte ssds one of them
06:13 - is booting into windows and then i have
06:15 - another ssd so a third ssd that's one
06:18 - terabyte
06:19 - that runs my dual boot into ubuntu so
06:21 - usually i do my programming on windows
06:23 - some people might cringe at that but
06:25 - when i'm making videos and stuff a lot
06:27 - of times like most of you guys are using
06:28 - windows
06:29 - so i try to mirror that by having my
06:31 - main computer being on windows
06:32 - but sometimes if i'm doing some more
06:34 - specific things i will boot into the
06:36 - ubuntu os
06:37 - and honestly i don't have a crazy
06:38 - preference over the operating systems i
06:40 - know how to use them all
06:42 - and i'll just you know use which ones i
06:44 - would need to for
06:45 - specific tasks now i do have a third
06:47 - computer this is more of just a server
06:49 - build
06:49 - so this is i won't talk about it too
06:51 - much but it's like a 10 terabyte server
06:52 - just sitting kind of in the corner of my
06:54 - room
06:55 - and that's what i use for storing all of
06:56 - my video files all of my audio files
06:59 - editing files and just
07:00 - all that kind of stuff that i don't want
07:02 - clogging up my main machine
07:04 - so those are my main computers you can
07:05 - now probably imagine why i prefer to use
07:07 - the desktop machine
07:08 - and now let's move on and now moving on
07:11 - to the keyboard
07:12 - so obviously your keyboard is going to
07:13 - be one of the most important items in a
07:15 - programming setup
07:16 - and well i can give you my
07:18 - recommendations for which ones i like
07:19 - but this really comes down to preference
07:21 - everyone prefers different types of
07:23 - switches different amounts of travel
07:25 - and well you're just gonna have to kind
07:26 - of research and mess around with some
07:27 - different keyboards until you figure out
07:29 - which one you like
07:30 - now personally i've used many different
07:32 - keyboards over the years right now i
07:33 - actually have about six
07:34 - keyboards in this room and my favorite
07:37 - types of switches i do really prefer
07:39 - mechanical keyboards
07:40 - are cherry mx brown and cherry mx blue
07:43 - now the cherry mx brown is something
07:44 - that has a little bit of a less audible
07:46 - click to it
07:47 - i believe it is a lighter amount of
07:49 - pressure that you need to apply to it
07:51 - and then the cherry mx blue has more
07:52 - pressure and it's that nice like kind of
07:54 - clicky
07:54 - sound the keyboard that i'm actually
07:56 - using right now is the das
07:58 - keyboard 4c tkl now i really do like
08:01 - this keyboard it is different than some
08:03 - of the other ones that i've used there's
08:04 - no rgb on it and it also is a shorter
08:06 - size keyboard
08:07 - so it doesn't have that numb pad on the
08:09 - end and honestly i never use the numpad
08:12 - i actually
08:12 - can't think of a situation where i've
08:14 - ever had to use the numpad
08:16 - so that's nice to have it a little bit
08:17 - shorter but it's not one of those
08:18 - keyboards that's like all mushed
08:19 - together
08:20 - and has the arrow keys mixed in with all
08:21 - the other keys because i really do like
08:23 - to have the arrow keys kind of separated
08:25 - from the other part of the keyboard
08:27 - so that when i'm navigating a code file
08:28 - it's really easy to move around
08:30 - this one also has two usb ports on the
08:32 - side it's cherry mx brown switches and
08:34 - it has a soft
08:35 - tactile typing experience so that's what
08:38 - i've been using for right now would
08:39 - highly recommend
08:40 - and in fact das keyboard was actually
08:42 - nice enough to send over two of these
08:44 - keyboards
08:45 - one that i'm using and one that i can
08:46 - give away to you guys so if you want to
08:48 - be entered to win
08:49 - a das keyboard for ctkl i will handle
08:52 - the shipping i will send it to you
08:53 - wherever you are
08:54 - in the world then go ahead and join my
08:56 - discord server there will be a link for
08:58 - that in the description
08:59 - and there'll be a channel somewhere in
09:00 - there that says giveaway you just have
09:02 - to follow some basic instructions you
09:04 - will be entered and then
09:05 - whoever wins well i will send you the
09:07 - key so now i'll move on to the mouse
09:09 - the mouse that i'm using right now is
09:11 - actually the logitech mx
09:13 - master i think that's the exact model of
09:16 - it i am going to link all this stuff in
09:17 - the description so you can check there
09:18 - if i made a mistake
09:19 - but this mouse is amazing this has a ton
09:22 - of different buttons it has this really
09:23 - cool button like where my thumb is
09:25 - it has the forward button the backwards
09:27 - button it has a vertical scroll as well
09:29 - as a horizontal scroll
09:30 - and the coolest thing about this mouse
09:33 - is the scroll wheel
09:34 - so it has a setting so there's this
09:35 - little button where i can toggle the
09:37 - speed of the scroll wheel and i can make
09:39 - it do
09:39 - infinite scrolling and what that means
09:40 - is i can like flick the scroll wheel
09:43 - and it will never stop it will just keep
09:44 - well it will but it will take a really
09:46 - long time to stop it'll just keep
09:47 - spinning
09:48 - super fast and this is amazing for
09:50 - programming because if i'm in a really
09:52 - large file and i want to quickly get
09:53 - down to the bottom of it all i have to
09:55 - do is just flick the mouse scroll wheel
09:57 - and it will automatically realize that
09:59 - i'm trying to scroll really fast
10:00 - and just boom start going all the way
10:02 - down to the bottom of the file
10:04 - seriously a game changer this is an
10:05 - expensive mouse but it feels
10:07 - great in my hand i'm not sponsored by
10:09 - them or anything like that but i just
10:11 - highly recommend it and seriously like
10:13 - one of the cheaper items in my setup
10:15 - that makes a massive difference for
10:17 - my efficiency when i'm navigating and
10:19 - working through different codes
10:21 - so now i'll quickly discuss my chair so
10:23 - obviously you can see the chair that i'm
10:24 - sitting in right now
10:25 - i really like the chairs that have a
10:27 - super high back i like something that i
10:29 - can lean
10:29 - all the way back in this has a tilt as
10:32 - well as a recline feature which is
10:34 - really nice
10:34 - obviously i can adjust the armrests i
10:36 - can move them to the side i can move
10:38 - them up and down
10:39 - it has the lumbar support cushion it has
10:41 - the neck cushion
10:43 - and this is just a great chair it's also
10:44 - on wheels which is really nice
10:46 - now i wouldn't necessarily recommend
10:48 - this chair just because this
10:49 - is kind of you know like a gaming like
10:51 - racing chair kind of thing
10:53 - and i had got it just because people had
10:55 - recommended that i buy something like
10:56 - this but looking back i probably would
10:58 - have rather
10:58 - get something that's more of an
11:00 - ergonomic chair i think this one is
11:02 - pretty comfortable but from what i've
11:03 - seen it's not the best for your back
11:05 - now i'm young enough that that's
11:07 - probably fine but i am considering
11:09 - getting a nicer chair that has like kind
11:10 - of a more
11:11 - curvature and like ergonomic structure
11:13 - to it so i won't necessarily recommend
11:15 - this chair i'll just say that this is
11:16 - what i'm currently using and it's fine
11:18 - it's a high quality chair but there
11:20 - definitely is some better options out
11:21 - there
11:22 - so now i'll talk about some of the more
11:23 - random and kind of quirky things in my
11:26 - setup and why i have those
11:27 - so first of all i have a really nice mat
11:30 - on the ground that i always put my feet
11:31 - on
11:32 - this is actually a bath mat funny enough
11:34 - but it's just super comfortable i've
11:35 - used it for a long time and it's just
11:37 - great i just love having something
11:38 - that's kind of like warm and fuzzy
11:40 - on the ground when i'm programming just
11:42 - makes it much nicer to be there
11:44 - i also have a little fan that i have on
11:46 - my desk i mean it's kind of a given why
11:48 - i would have that
11:49 - i have a speaker this is a beats pill
11:51 - that's just what i use for my audio
11:53 - i also have air pods i use those just so
11:55 - i'm on like a conference call or if i'm
11:57 - you know like in some kind of google
11:58 - meet or zoom call or something like that
12:00 - of course i have my microphone this is a
12:02 - really high-end microphone this is a
12:04 - rode nt1
12:06 - it actually is an xlr input microphone
12:08 - and what that means is i need a usb
12:10 - audio interface to be able to get this
12:11 - to work
12:12 - so without getting into too much detail
12:14 - that little red box you see there is a
12:16 - scarlet
12:16 - 4i4 i believe that's what it's called
12:19 - and that's what i use to actually take
12:21 - my audio from the xlr input and
12:23 - get it into a usb signal so that i can
12:25 - put it into my computer
12:26 - now what i'm actually doing is i'm
12:28 - running all my audio into my mac
12:29 - and then my mac is outputting the audio
12:31 - back to the scarlet so it's filtering it
12:33 - and having the output go through that
12:35 - and then from the scarlet i have an
12:36 - output jack and that output jack is
12:38 - running into my main computer so in
12:40 - theory i could stream my one audio
12:42 - source to both of my computers at the
12:43 - exact same time
12:45 - i could also stream it to other output
12:46 - sources if i wanted to because this
12:48 - specific device has four outputs on the
12:50 - back of it
12:51 - so that's it for the audio interface i
12:53 - also happen to have a ups
12:55 - underneath my desk that is an
12:56 - uninterruptible power supply
12:58 - that's really important because if i'm
13:00 - working on a file if i'm filming a video
13:02 - if i'm doing something like that
13:03 - obviously i don't want a power surge
13:05 - making me lose all of my progress
13:06 - so i have my server and i have all my of
13:09 - my other important hardware devices
13:10 - plugged into that ups
13:12 - and the next two things i'm going to
13:13 - mention are actually the most underrated
13:15 - items in my setup i absolutely love them
13:17 - i will not make a pc
13:19 - programming setup without having these
13:21 - items in it the first is my
13:23 - fidget toys so i have two fidget
13:25 - spinners and i have this like
13:27 - fidget flip thing i have no idea what
13:29 - it's actually called but it's like
13:31 - a square and it like kind of rolls
13:33 - around on the table
13:34 - but i just love having something to
13:36 - fidget with i always find myself
13:37 - reaching for like a pen or a fidget
13:39 - spinner
13:39 - or that little cube thing whatever i'm
13:41 - programming or i'm trying to think about
13:43 - something pretty deeply
13:44 - next i also have e-reading lamps so
13:47 - these are really cool
13:48 - these lamps are specifically designed to
13:50 - be put over top of your monitor
13:52 - so they're anti-glare and they really
13:54 - are just designed to make it easier to
13:56 - view your screen
13:57 - now i won't go into too much detail on
13:58 - this but like i think the science behind
14:00 - it is like you need adequate lighting
14:02 - when you're looking
14:02 - at a computer screen and they just hang
14:05 - right over top of the screen
14:06 - kind of illuminate the desk area which
14:08 - is really nice if i'm like writing notes
14:09 - or something
14:10 - and they just make it kind of easier on
14:12 - your eyes to stare at the screen for a
14:13 - long period of time
14:14 - these lights also have a brightness and
14:17 - temperature adjustment
14:18 - so really cool and just super underrated
14:20 - i would highly recommend them they make
14:22 - an
14:22 - absolutely massive difference finally
14:25 - you can see i have a usb hub sitting on
14:27 - my desk that's just because i ran out of
14:29 - usb ports on my computer
14:31 - and then my mac is sitting on top of
14:33 - this like little
14:34 - fan thing so i don't even really know
14:36 - what to call it i guess it's like a
14:37 - laptop stand and it has fans underneath
14:39 - it that just blow
14:40 - cool air onto my macbook pro so that way
14:43 - the macbook pro fan itself doesn't rev
14:45 - up and be really loud especially when
14:46 - i'm recording videos like this
14:48 - so definitely a super cool purchase that
14:50 - was like 40 bucks and that means that my
14:51 - macbook pro fan
14:52 - just like never spins up and i have a
14:54 - quieter fan underneath it that is
14:56 - handling its actual cooling
14:58 - so with that the last thing i will say
14:59 - is i also have an ipad pro
15:01 - now i just got this and this is honestly
15:03 - like such a cool device i have the apple
15:05 - pencil with it
15:06 - and just for taking notes or doing any
15:08 - kind of like drawings or math or
15:10 - anything like that
15:11 - super awesome i don't think i'm ever
15:13 - really gonna have to use paper again
15:15 - and well that kind of concludes my setup
15:17 - tour
15:18 - of course i have all my studio equipment
15:20 - and lights and stuff i mean that's not
15:21 - really part of the pc
15:23 - programming setup so i'm not gonna go
15:25 - into that in depth
15:26 - but yeah that is what i have that is
15:28 - what i use and i would love to hear your
15:29 - thoughts on it all in the comments down
15:31 - below
15:32 - so that being said if you guys enjoyed
15:33 - make sure you leave a like
15:35 - subscribe to the channel and of course i
15:37 - will see you again in another youtube

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome back so in this video i'm going to be showcasing my pc slash programming setup now chances are if it's not your first time on this channel that you've seen this setup before in fact you can see it behind me right now you can see the rgb in the pc you can see the monitor and all of that stuff but i've never done a video where i've actually gone through and showed you exactly what i've used talked about why and potentially made some recommendations if you guys are looking to upgrade your setup so with that said i'll quickly mention that i have an absolutely ridiculously overkill setup here you do not need anything even remotely close to what i have to start programming so please don't feel discouraged if you don't have this stuff don't feel like you need to get any of it this is just me showing you what i use and well i'll tell you if i would recommend some specific items or why i've actually purchased them so let's go ahead and get started and i will talk to you about my pc programming setup so i'll start by just giving you a general overview of this setup kind of showing you what it looks like and talking to you a bit about what i actually use this setup for so first of all the space that i'm located in which is pretty important is in the basement of my parents house now i have a really large room the room that i'm in actually used to be a theater room i have a projector up there and there's like a big flat screen kind of projector screen on the other side we actually renovated and modified this room specifically for me so i was really fortunate that my dad's actually quite handy he built like a big massive door and then there's this big massive l desk that we built specifically for this room so that kind of starts the setup off but what i use this space for is the following so i am a programmer i am a student and i am also a content creator so a lot of the equipment that i have here especially a lot of the expensive equipment is actually primarily used for content creation right so my lights my camera my microphones all of that kind of stuff and then i just kind of tie that together with my programming setup quoteunquote so i have my monitors my keyboard my mouse my computer my lights all that kind of stuff which is specific really for the programming aspect so i'll try to distinguish between those things in this video but just keep that in mind that a lot of the equipment that i have here is simply because i am a content creator and will i need that kind of stuff to be able to make videos that look like this so the order in which i discuss these items has no significant importance so you don't need to read into that but the first items that i'm going to talk about here are my monitors now i will start by saying that i highly recommend anyone that's programming has at least two monitors or one very large screen like an ultra wide monitor i cannot stress how much of a difference this makes being able to have your code on one screen and then have stack overflow or spotify or whatever else it is on the other screen is super important and well i honestly don't know what i would do without a dual monitor setup now that said what i have here is actually kind of a combination of both the things i recommended so what i have here is a 27 inch q monitor with an 144hz refresh rate and a 2k resolution and this here is the lg 34 inch ultra wide monitor now i need to tell you about this monitor because this thing is amazing it's actually game changing and honestly i think i could suffice by just using the lg monitor because it's massive and well for programming it's so nice to be able to have three separate windows vertically on one display now lg was actually kind enough to sponsor this video and send me over this monitor for free so like i said it is a 34 inch ultra wide monitor that has a 1340 by 1440p resolution this gives it a 21x9 aspect ratio and makes the same height as my 27 inch monitor this monitor is pretty much designed for programmers and comes with some great software that allows you to split the screen into multiple unique layouts it is game changing to be able to view multiple sized windows side by side and especially great for using an ide or navigating large code files it has definitely increased my productivity and if you want to get an idea of what it can do for you then head over to lg's ultrawide festival website where you can customize your own ultra wide monitor by customizing your own monitor you'll be entered for a chance to win one or get a 50 amazon gift card now lg also has a sense of humor which you can find in their campaign video which is a pretty funny skit of a developer not being able to find his error because while his screen was not large enough so anyways another big thank you to lg you can check them in this monitor out from the link in the description and now let's get into the rest of my programming setup so now i'm going to talk about my computers now notice that is plural i do actually have multiple machines that i use some for development some not so much for development but i will go through them so the first computer i have is my laptop this is a 16inch macbook pro i got this last year this is the i guess 2019 version i don't actually know if they have a newer version and it's the base model it is a six core i7 16 gigabytes of ram and i used to use this for programming when i was in school i actually do like uh programming on macs and this is a great computer because the 16 inch display is really nice and i actually don't mind the keyboard at all so really a great computer i definitely recommend it if you have the budget for it but recently since i've been back at home this computer really all it's been doing is actually just running my audio so i have logic pro on it and that records all the audio for my videos and apply some filters and all of that kind of stuff now i do have this setup with a docking station so if i want i can turn this whole monitor and pc setup into like the mac setup so i can run off of this computer and i have a keyboard mouse switch which means i just press a button and my keyboard and mouse will switch between the mac and the windows computer so obviously that leads me to my windows machine which is my big powerful workstation which i use like 90 percent of the time i really just like working on desktop computers that's just my preference and this thing you'll understand why i want to work on it it is a ryzen 9 3900x processor that's a 12 core processor in there i have an rtx titan or a titan rtx whatever you call it nvidia actually sent that to me i was not crazy enough to buy that graphics card don't worry and it has 64 gigabytes of ram and then there's two m.2 two terabyte ssds one of them is booting into windows and then i have another ssd so a third ssd that's one terabyte that runs my dual boot into ubuntu so usually i do my programming on windows some people might cringe at that but when i'm making videos and stuff a lot of times like most of you guys are using windows so i try to mirror that by having my main computer being on windows but sometimes if i'm doing some more specific things i will boot into the ubuntu os and honestly i don't have a crazy preference over the operating systems i know how to use them all and i'll just you know use which ones i would need to for specific tasks now i do have a third computer this is more of just a server build so this is i won't talk about it too much but it's like a 10 terabyte server just sitting kind of in the corner of my room and that's what i use for storing all of my video files all of my audio files editing files and just all that kind of stuff that i don't want clogging up my main machine so those are my main computers you can now probably imagine why i prefer to use the desktop machine and now let's move on and now moving on to the keyboard so obviously your keyboard is going to be one of the most important items in a programming setup and well i can give you my recommendations for which ones i like but this really comes down to preference everyone prefers different types of switches different amounts of travel and well you're just gonna have to kind of research and mess around with some different keyboards until you figure out which one you like now personally i've used many different keyboards over the years right now i actually have about six keyboards in this room and my favorite types of switches i do really prefer mechanical keyboards are cherry mx brown and cherry mx blue now the cherry mx brown is something that has a little bit of a less audible click to it i believe it is a lighter amount of pressure that you need to apply to it and then the cherry mx blue has more pressure and it's that nice like kind of clicky sound the keyboard that i'm actually using right now is the das keyboard 4c tkl now i really do like this keyboard it is different than some of the other ones that i've used there's no rgb on it and it also is a shorter size keyboard so it doesn't have that numb pad on the end and honestly i never use the numpad i actually can't think of a situation where i've ever had to use the numpad so that's nice to have it a little bit shorter but it's not one of those keyboards that's like all mushed together and has the arrow keys mixed in with all the other keys because i really do like to have the arrow keys kind of separated from the other part of the keyboard so that when i'm navigating a code file it's really easy to move around this one also has two usb ports on the side it's cherry mx brown switches and it has a soft tactile typing experience so that's what i've been using for right now would highly recommend and in fact das keyboard was actually nice enough to send over two of these keyboards one that i'm using and one that i can give away to you guys so if you want to be entered to win a das keyboard for ctkl i will handle the shipping i will send it to you wherever you are in the world then go ahead and join my discord server there will be a link for that in the description and there'll be a channel somewhere in there that says giveaway you just have to follow some basic instructions you will be entered and then whoever wins well i will send you the key so now i'll move on to the mouse the mouse that i'm using right now is actually the logitech mx master i think that's the exact model of it i am going to link all this stuff in the description so you can check there if i made a mistake but this mouse is amazing this has a ton of different buttons it has this really cool button like where my thumb is it has the forward button the backwards button it has a vertical scroll as well as a horizontal scroll and the coolest thing about this mouse is the scroll wheel so it has a setting so there's this little button where i can toggle the speed of the scroll wheel and i can make it do infinite scrolling and what that means is i can like flick the scroll wheel and it will never stop it will just keep well it will but it will take a really long time to stop it'll just keep spinning super fast and this is amazing for programming because if i'm in a really large file and i want to quickly get down to the bottom of it all i have to do is just flick the mouse scroll wheel and it will automatically realize that i'm trying to scroll really fast and just boom start going all the way down to the bottom of the file seriously a game changer this is an expensive mouse but it feels great in my hand i'm not sponsored by them or anything like that but i just highly recommend it and seriously like one of the cheaper items in my setup that makes a massive difference for my efficiency when i'm navigating and working through different codes so now i'll quickly discuss my chair so obviously you can see the chair that i'm sitting in right now i really like the chairs that have a super high back i like something that i can lean all the way back in this has a tilt as well as a recline feature which is really nice obviously i can adjust the armrests i can move them to the side i can move them up and down it has the lumbar support cushion it has the neck cushion and this is just a great chair it's also on wheels which is really nice now i wouldn't necessarily recommend this chair just because this is kind of you know like a gaming like racing chair kind of thing and i had got it just because people had recommended that i buy something like this but looking back i probably would have rather get something that's more of an ergonomic chair i think this one is pretty comfortable but from what i've seen it's not the best for your back now i'm young enough that that's probably fine but i am considering getting a nicer chair that has like kind of a more curvature and like ergonomic structure to it so i won't necessarily recommend this chair i'll just say that this is what i'm currently using and it's fine it's a high quality chair but there definitely is some better options out there so now i'll talk about some of the more random and kind of quirky things in my setup and why i have those so first of all i have a really nice mat on the ground that i always put my feet on this is actually a bath mat funny enough but it's just super comfortable i've used it for a long time and it's just great i just love having something that's kind of like warm and fuzzy on the ground when i'm programming just makes it much nicer to be there i also have a little fan that i have on my desk i mean it's kind of a given why i would have that i have a speaker this is a beats pill that's just what i use for my audio i also have air pods i use those just so i'm on like a conference call or if i'm you know like in some kind of google meet or zoom call or something like that of course i have my microphone this is a really highend microphone this is a rode nt1 it actually is an xlr input microphone and what that means is i need a usb audio interface to be able to get this to work so without getting into too much detail that little red box you see there is a scarlet 4i4 i believe that's what it's called and that's what i use to actually take my audio from the xlr input and get it into a usb signal so that i can put it into my computer now what i'm actually doing is i'm running all my audio into my mac and then my mac is outputting the audio back to the scarlet so it's filtering it and having the output go through that and then from the scarlet i have an output jack and that output jack is running into my main computer so in theory i could stream my one audio source to both of my computers at the exact same time i could also stream it to other output sources if i wanted to because this specific device has four outputs on the back of it so that's it for the audio interface i also happen to have a ups underneath my desk that is an uninterruptible power supply that's really important because if i'm working on a file if i'm filming a video if i'm doing something like that obviously i don't want a power surge making me lose all of my progress so i have my server and i have all my of my other important hardware devices plugged into that ups and the next two things i'm going to mention are actually the most underrated items in my setup i absolutely love them i will not make a pc programming setup without having these items in it the first is my fidget toys so i have two fidget spinners and i have this like fidget flip thing i have no idea what it's actually called but it's like a square and it like kind of rolls around on the table but i just love having something to fidget with i always find myself reaching for like a pen or a fidget spinner or that little cube thing whatever i'm programming or i'm trying to think about something pretty deeply next i also have ereading lamps so these are really cool these lamps are specifically designed to be put over top of your monitor so they're antiglare and they really are just designed to make it easier to view your screen now i won't go into too much detail on this but like i think the science behind it is like you need adequate lighting when you're looking at a computer screen and they just hang right over top of the screen kind of illuminate the desk area which is really nice if i'm like writing notes or something and they just make it kind of easier on your eyes to stare at the screen for a long period of time these lights also have a brightness and temperature adjustment so really cool and just super underrated i would highly recommend them they make an absolutely massive difference finally you can see i have a usb hub sitting on my desk that's just because i ran out of usb ports on my computer and then my mac is sitting on top of this like little fan thing so i don't even really know what to call it i guess it's like a laptop stand and it has fans underneath it that just blow cool air onto my macbook pro so that way the macbook pro fan itself doesn't rev up and be really loud especially when i'm recording videos like this so definitely a super cool purchase that was like 40 bucks and that means that my macbook pro fan just like never spins up and i have a quieter fan underneath it that is handling its actual cooling so with that the last thing i will say is i also have an ipad pro now i just got this and this is honestly like such a cool device i have the apple pencil with it and just for taking notes or doing any kind of like drawings or math or anything like that super awesome i don't think i'm ever really gonna have to use paper again and well that kind of concludes my setup tour of course i have all my studio equipment and lights and stuff i mean that's not really part of the pc programming setup so i'm not gonna go into that in depth but yeah that is what i have that is what i use and i would love to hear your thoughts on it all in the comments down below so that being said if you guys enjoyed make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and of course i will see you again in another youtube video
