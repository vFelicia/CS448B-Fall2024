00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video
00:11 - so in today's video i'm going to share
00:13 - with you five tips
00:14 - tricks to become more productive now
00:17 - these are not magic things that you can
00:18 - just go do and all of a sudden be the
00:20 - most productive human being
00:21 - these are just five kind of ideas
00:23 - philosophies that i've come up with over
00:25 - the past few years
00:26 - that have really worked well for me and
00:28 - allowed me to get a lot done
00:30 - in the time that i spend working this
00:32 - video is not at all
00:33 - going to be trying to tell you to work
00:34 - super hard go do you know 14 16 hours
00:37 - days that's not the point of this
00:38 - whatsoever
00:39 - it's how can you maximize what you get
00:41 - done in the time that you're working
00:43 - you guys know yourself you know your own
00:45 - lives you can pick how much time you
00:46 - want to work in a day
00:47 - and hopefully these kind of philosophies
00:49 - ideas tips whatever you want to call
00:51 - them
00:51 - will help you kind of realize what it is
00:53 - you need to do to actually get more done
00:55 - in a day now the reason i'm making this
00:57 - video is because a lot of you guys ask
00:58 - me all of the time
00:59 - tim i see you're a pretty young guy i
01:01 - know you are in school now you're doing
01:03 - youtube you're working for algo expert
01:04 - and other companies
01:05 - how do you get all this stuff done how
01:07 - do you find the motivation
01:08 - how do you actually just you know get
01:10 - all of this work done in one
01:12 - day it seems like a lot and well i'll
01:13 - try to answer that question in this
01:14 - video
01:15 - but the first thing i want to say here
01:17 - is that everyone is different right this
01:19 - stuff is not going to work for everybody
01:20 - this is just
01:21 - what worked for me i probably work a lot
01:24 - longer than most of you guys and there's
01:26 - pros and cons to doing that and so you
01:28 - can't really judge
01:29 - your productivity based on someone else
01:31 - you have to judge it on yourself are you
01:33 - more productive than you were yesterday
01:34 - that's really the only metric you should
01:36 - go
01:36 - be going based off of you can't look at
01:38 - some random person on the internet and
01:40 - be like oh i'm not as productive as them
01:41 - when in reality you have no idea what
01:43 - they do in a day
01:44 - what their schedule or time looks like
01:45 - and what they might be sacrificing to
01:47 - kind of get that productivity
01:48 - anyways sorry for the long intro let's
01:50 - get into the video after a quick word

02:38 - in the description and using the code
02:40 - tech with tim for a discount on
02:41 - the platform alright so let's go ahead
02:43 - and dive in the first
02:45 - tip slash trick i have for you is to
02:47 - have a goal
02:48 - and actually to have multiple goals now
02:51 - this is extremely important and one of
02:53 - the reasons for this
02:54 - is it's very hard to work hard and be
02:57 - productive
02:57 - if you don't know why you're doing that
03:00 - right
03:01 - that's like pretty much anything if
03:02 - someone tells you to do something and it
03:04 - doesn't make sense to you
03:05 - you're much less likely to do it i
03:07 - remember as a kid
03:08 - all the time i would just not do what
03:10 - teachers told me because it wouldn't
03:11 - make sense what they were asking me to
03:13 - do and until someone explained to me
03:15 - why it was i needed to get something
03:16 - done or why i needed to do this
03:18 - then i would actually go ahead and do it
03:20 - now the same thing happens here in just
03:21 - general life when it comes to
03:23 - productivity let's say you're in a
03:25 - computer science major trying to pick
03:26 - something that's probably relatable for
03:27 - some of you
03:28 - and you guys are just lazy unproductive
03:31 - you're like oh i don't like this i don't
03:32 - want to do this
03:33 - one of the main reasons you're probably
03:35 - like that is because you don't actually
03:37 - know why it is you're doing this
03:38 - computer science major
03:40 - you haven't created those goals in your
03:42 - head and when i'm talking about goals
03:44 - i'm saying something like where do you
03:45 - want to be in 30 years
03:47 - where do you want to be in 25 years
03:49 - what's the point of getting a degree
03:50 - what's the point of this education
03:52 - do you know that do you have that reason
03:54 - kind of stored up in your brain are you
03:56 - thinking about that
03:57 - as you go and work towards this goal for
03:59 - a lot of people the answer is no and so
04:01 - you have to have goals to be able to
04:03 - become
04:04 - productive again you can't work on
04:06 - something very hard and be productive
04:08 - you don't know why it is that you're
04:09 - doing that
04:10 - so you either have to come up with the
04:11 - reasons even if they don't make you know
04:14 - the total complete sense but you have to
04:16 - convince yourself that what you're doing
04:18 - is worth it and once you do that then
04:20 - your brain kind of says okay it is worth
04:22 - it for me to stay up an extra hour and
04:24 - work on this
04:25 - it is a good use of my time to you know
04:26 - grind this and study this and get an a
04:28 - and well you have to have goals now i'm
04:30 - just picking a very kind of naive
04:32 - example which is school
04:33 - but let's put this to my youtube channel
04:34 - here the only reason why i've been able
04:36 - to grow this youtube channel is because
04:38 - the goal of mine
04:39 - has been okay i want to achieve
04:40 - financial freedom i want to be the best
04:42 - tech
04:43 - educator on the internet i have these
04:45 - very large goals and every day i analyze
04:47 - what i'm doing and i say am i working
04:49 - towards these goals
04:50 - and you know when i'm super tired and
04:52 - exhausted i wake up in the morning ready
04:53 - to film a video i say why am i filming
04:55 - this video
04:56 - it's because it's helping me achieve
04:58 - this goal if i didn't have these goals
05:00 - you're kind of just meaninglessly doing
05:02 - activities and it's very hard to justify
05:04 - especially when you're tired or
05:05 - demotivated
05:06 - why you should go and continue to do
05:08 - that and of course that's going to lead
05:09 - to a lack of productivity
05:11 - so it's hard to really articulate this
05:13 - but you can even think of this in a very
05:14 - large picture when it comes to
05:15 - organizations
05:17 - most organizations fail because they
05:18 - don't have a clear vision
05:20 - or kind of road map from the top of the
05:22 - organization have you ever been at a
05:24 - company where you're doing something but
05:25 - you don't know
05:26 - why you're doing it it's not leading
05:27 - towards the vision or the mission of the
05:29 - company
05:30 - those companies are usually not great
05:31 - places to work out yeah maybe you'll go
05:33 - in and kind of do your eight hours just
05:35 - to get paid
05:35 - but you're not motivated you're not
05:37 - excited you don't know why it is you're
05:38 - doing a task
05:39 - and you guys could probably relate to
05:41 - this in almost every area of life when
05:42 - someone asks you to do something but
05:44 - doesn't explain to you why
05:45 - and it doesn't make sense to you you're
05:47 - a lot less likely to want to go and do
05:49 - that thing
05:49 - because you don't know why it is that
05:51 - you're doing that and same thing when it
05:52 - comes to getting a degree
05:53 - same thing when it comes to you know
05:54 - staying up an extra hour at night to
05:56 - read
05:56 - whatever it is you have to have a goal
05:58 - and usually a large goal in mind
06:00 - so you can justify those activities so i
06:03 - could talk about this in an entire video
06:05 - just goal setting maybe i'll do that let
06:06 - me know if you guys want to see that i
06:07 - think that might be an interesting video
06:09 - but let's move on to the next point now
06:11 - hopefully you guys got the idea from
06:12 - that
06:12 - all right so the second point i have for
06:14 - you is much more of a mindset thing
06:16 - but this is to help your future self now
06:19 - you're going to notice that all these
06:20 - points and tips whatever are
06:21 - very related to each other and when i
06:23 - say help your future self
06:25 - what i'm talking about is to think of
06:27 - what you're doing as something that
06:28 - you're doing to help yourself
06:30 - in the future now to give you a really
06:32 - simple example let's say you get an
06:34 - assignment okay
06:34 - and this week maybe you're not super
06:36 - busy you have this maybe programming
06:38 - assignment let's say it's going to take
06:39 - you four or five hours to finish
06:41 - you could leave it till the very last
06:42 - minute you could do it the next day
06:44 - whatever but if you adopt the mindset of
06:47 - hey in the future i might not want to do
06:49 - this i might be tired i might want to go
06:51 - hang out with my friends
06:53 - right now i have a few hours why don't i
06:55 - just knock it out so that in the future
06:56 - i'm going to say oh
06:57 - thank god tim already did that
06:58 - assignment now i'm speaking in the third
07:00 - person
07:01 - but you know what i mean and this is a
07:02 - very rewarding thing because what ends
07:04 - up happening when you adopt this mayans
07:06 - and you say you know what i'm going to
07:07 - do this now so i don't have to do in the
07:09 - future
07:09 - so when i'm tired i can just sleep in
07:11 - that extra hour in the morning so i can
07:13 - go hang out with my friends
07:14 - life becomes just a lot more enjoyable
07:16 - you don't have any stress you don't have
07:17 - any deadlines you need to complete
07:19 - because you've helped yourself in the
07:21 - future you've said all right i know i
07:23 - have time now i'm in a state where i can
07:24 - finish this now
07:25 - let's get it done and then in the future
07:27 - i'm going to thank myself when i want to
07:28 - go to that party or i want to go
07:30 - and play video games or whatever because
07:32 - i don't have this kind of looming
07:33 - deadline
07:34 - and the stuff that i need to finish and
07:36 - this relieves stress a lot especially if
07:38 - you apply this to kind of a school
07:39 - scenario
07:40 - if you do all of your assignments
07:42 - immediately when you get them you just
07:43 - get stuff
07:44 - done when you're capable of getting it
07:45 - done and you don't waste time
07:47 - it's just a much better way to kind of
07:50 - go through school and go through life
07:51 - because you're not constantly stressed
07:53 - am i going to finish this am i going to
07:54 - have enough time am i going to have to
07:56 - do a 14 hour night you don't have to
07:57 - deal with that anymore and that's a huge
07:59 - mental load kind of relieved and that's
08:01 - the way that i really navigated school
08:03 - and was able to get all of the stuff
08:05 - that i did done was because i did it
08:07 - very early and i was never like
08:09 - grinding last minute to finish something
08:11 - because i just did it earlier in the
08:12 - week and i never had a deadline that i
08:14 - felt like i needed to hit
08:15 - so this is a very specific example with
08:17 - school but apply this to every single
08:19 - scenario even something like a degree
08:21 - okay it might suck for four years to go
08:23 - through school and you might be
08:24 - miserable and you might be broke but
08:26 - in four years are you going to thank
08:27 - yourself for getting this degree done
08:29 - maybe right you have to answer that
08:30 - question and so that's the way i always
08:32 - think about things
08:33 - i'm putting in a sacrifice now to help
08:34 - myself in the future
08:36 - and in the future i'm going to thank
08:38 - myself for putting in those long hours
08:39 - or working hard or being productive
08:41 - or whatever it may be so really just a
08:43 - mindset thing obviously much easier said
08:45 - than done
08:45 - but that's the way that i look at things
08:47 - and that's one of the ways i'm able to
08:49 - justify
08:50 - getting a lot done kind of in the
08:51 - present moment all right so the next
08:53 - point i have for you is another
08:55 - very important one if you get only one
08:57 - point from this list this is the one
08:58 - that i would recommend
08:59 - really kind of focusing on and this is
09:01 - to measure your productivity with
09:03 - outcome not time now this is so
09:07 - extremely important because time does
09:10 - not
09:10 - state how productive you were in a day
09:12 - what i mean by this is a lot of people
09:14 - think
09:14 - hey i went to class for four hours today
09:16 - or hey i went to my
09:17 - job for eight hours or i worked on this
09:19 - project for six hours
09:21 - and they measure their productivity in
09:22 - terms of hours spent
09:24 - that is not a good way to measure
09:26 - productivity because
09:27 - you can spend and waste hours in pretty
09:29 - much any way right
09:31 - what you should really be doing is
09:32 - looking at okay i spent this much time
09:34 - doing this today
09:35 - what was the outcome of that time what
09:37 - did i actually get done
09:39 - for example i can say i spent five hours
09:41 - working on this youtube video but if i
09:43 - only got done
09:44 - one youtube video in five hours was that
09:47 - productive right that was the outcome of
09:48 - my five hours spent
09:50 - if i had maybe two hours but i finished
09:52 - two videos when was i more productive
09:54 - when i finished two videos right
09:55 - so that's what you need to look at it's
09:56 - not how much time did you spend working
09:58 - in a day it's what did you get done in a
10:00 - day and are you happy with that outcome
10:02 - that's the way you have to look at
10:04 - things because if you look at it in
10:05 - terms of time
10:06 - inevitably you're not going to be the
10:08 - most productive in that time you're
10:09 - going to try to spend
10:10 - extra time doing things like going to uh
10:13 - you know maybe an extra class or like
10:15 - watching videos online or whatever that
10:17 - aren't actually a good use of your time
10:19 - and that are not leading you to be
10:21 - productive
10:21 - now the best real example of this i'd
10:23 - like to give is going to class in school
10:25 - now i'm not here to try to encourage
10:26 - anyone to just skip
10:27 - classes but for me what worked really
10:30 - well in school was going to about
10:32 - 20 of my classes that was actually the
10:34 - amount of class that i went to i
10:36 - probably skipped almost
10:37 - all of second year almost all of third
10:39 - year and only went to like absolutely
10:41 - mandatory classes
10:42 - and the reason for that was not because
10:43 - i just hated the professors and was just
10:45 - a lazy student
10:46 - it was because i knew that my time was
10:48 - better spent and i was more productive
10:51 - on my own on my computer reading the
10:53 - notes reading the textbook and self
10:55 - studying that's the way i learned that's
10:56 - what works best for me and so if i
10:58 - measured my time
10:59 - in terms of how much time i spent on
11:01 - school in a day i wouldn't have realized
11:03 - that because i would have thought
11:04 - spending four hours in lectures was me
11:07 - being productive
11:08 - when in reality i could achieve the same
11:10 - learning outcome
11:11 - in like an hour and a half on my own and
11:14 - so i would say i'm much more productive
11:16 - by
11:16 - staying home right or not going to class
11:18 - reading it myself
11:19 - than i am on going to class even though
11:22 - it's kind of this false sense of oh i
11:23 - spent three or four hours
11:25 - must have meant i had a good productive
11:26 - day right same thing when you go to the
11:28 - gym you can go to the gym for an hour
11:30 - and a half and do the same number of
11:31 - exercises that i do in half an hour
11:33 - who was really more productive if you
11:35 - say well i went to the gym for an hour
11:36 - and a half that means i'm productive
11:38 - that's the wrong way to look at it you
11:39 - have to say how much did i get done
11:41 - in that time that i was there so time is
11:44 - not
11:44 - not important you do have to measure
11:46 - time spent but it's really more focused
11:48 - on the outcome
11:49 - and that's why you see you know all
11:50 - kinds of entrepreneurs and random people
11:52 - saying you know
11:52 - i only work eight hours a week only work
11:54 - seven hours a week well if they can get
11:56 - done in eight hours what you get done in
11:58 - 40 who is being more productive right
12:00 - that's what you really have to think
12:01 - about
12:02 - so anyways that's that point right there
12:03 - now let's move on to the next one
12:05 - all right so point number four
12:06 - something's a little bit more mainstream
12:08 - and obvious but this is to
12:09 - plan far in advance when i say far in
12:12 - advance i'm not talking about years i'm
12:13 - talking about months right
12:15 - understand what weeks in the month or
12:18 - what days of the month
12:19 - you're going to have that are much
12:21 - busier than others because this
12:23 - allows you to balance your time now for
12:25 - me what allows me to be productive
12:27 - is working relatively the same amount of
12:29 - time every single day
12:31 - i do not want to work 12 hours in one
12:33 - day and zero in the next i would much
12:35 - rather work six in each day
12:37 - and have time each day for fun enjoyment
12:39 - whatever right i would much rather do
12:41 - that maybe that's just me
12:42 - but personally i find that a much better
12:44 - way to be productive it
12:45 - i find you're much more productive
12:47 - working you know five six hours a day
12:49 - than trying to do 12
12:50 - even though yes you could probably do
12:52 - 12. and so if you plan
12:53 - far in advance you're able to actually
12:55 - kind of manage your time and what you
12:57 - get done and your productivity
12:59 - based on when you know stuff is going to
13:01 - be really busy and when you're not going
13:02 - to have as much time
13:03 - for example next week i'm going away i'm
13:05 - doing you know a week-long vacation i'm
13:07 - going fishing fun fact
13:08 - so what i've had to do this week is i've
13:10 - had to work a little bit harder but the
13:12 - thing is if i only knew about that this
13:14 - week
13:14 - i would have to grind really really hard
13:16 - to prepare a bunch of videos from when
13:18 - i'm gone
13:18 - but i've known that i'm going to be
13:20 - going away for three months and so
13:22 - over the past three months i've been
13:23 - slowly trying to do you know a little
13:25 - bit extra
13:26 - just to make sure that i didn't have a
13:27 - super heavy week the week before i went
13:30 - away
13:30 - and i could kind of balance my time and
13:32 - i didn't have to do a huge
13:34 - 12-hour grind i didn't have to be
13:35 - miserable and that allowed me to stay
13:37 - productive throughout this entire time
13:39 - so that's like a small example but when
13:41 - it comes to school one thing i always do
13:43 - is at the beginning of the semester i
13:44 - spend you know an hour or two looking
13:46 - through all the syllabuses all the
13:47 - course content
13:48 - and i go and i write every single
13:50 - deadline every single assignment in my
13:52 - calendar
13:53 - so i know when i look at this high level
13:55 - overview oh next week's going to be
13:56 - super busy
13:57 - i better do a little bit of extra work
13:58 - right now to make sure i'm not going to
14:00 - have to grind that week
14:01 - and that just helps me become more
14:03 - productive allows me to not be miserable
14:05 - and you know tapping out of exhaustion
14:07 - at the 14 hour mark studying for a
14:09 - midterm
14:09 - and that's just really a great way to
14:11 - kind of you know balance your time and
14:13 - make sure you're not overworking
14:14 - yourself while staying productive
14:16 - so there's not much more that i can
14:17 - really go through here the whole point
14:19 - at least for me and planning
14:21 - far in advance is that you're prepared
14:23 - for what's coming up and you can do
14:25 - extra work now to make sure you're not
14:26 - going to have a huge workload in the
14:28 - future
14:28 - that you're not going to be able to
14:29 - sustain anyways let's move on to the
14:31 - next point
14:32 - all right so the last point i have for
14:34 - you this one is very important and this
14:36 - is to
14:36 - make sure you are allocating time for
14:39 - fun
14:39 - and protecting that time so in your
14:42 - calendar
14:43 - in your daily schedule in whatever way
14:45 - you want to do it i can't tell you how
14:46 - to do this
14:47 - you need to make sure that you have a
14:49 - set time either every day
14:51 - every week every month whatever it may
14:52 - be to do things that you enjoy
14:54 - to make you happy to increase your
14:56 - mental health and to make sure you're
14:58 - not burning yourself out right
15:00 - one of the big problems with
15:01 - productivity and even videos like this
15:03 - is that it kind of tells people that you
15:05 - have to be miserable
15:06 - and you have to go and grind and work
15:08 - super hard and know you don't have time
15:10 - for this and you can't go and hang out
15:12 - with your friends
15:12 - that's absolutely false through the
15:14 - entire time that i've been doing all of
15:16 - this stuff
15:17 - i've made sure that i can go and spend a
15:19 - weekend hanging out with my friends or i
15:20 - can take a week off at any point in time
15:22 - or i can spend three or four hours at
15:24 - night playing video games because those
15:26 - are things that i enjoy doing and i'm
15:27 - not willing to give those
15:29 - up just to call myself more productive
15:31 - there's actually a ton of
15:32 - research and evidence and books and
15:35 - stuff related to
15:36 - how happiness and fun actually affect
15:38 - the success of someone in their career
15:41 - and you can probably guess what i'm
15:42 - going to say but the happier people are
15:44 - often more
15:45 - successful and so if you're thinking
15:46 - about this in a sheer productivity lens
15:48 - then you have to say okay it actually
15:50 - might be very productive for me to spend
15:52 - two hours tonight just doing nothing
15:55 - just hanging out relaxing
15:56 - you know recharging for the next day and
15:58 - that's the way that i think about it
16:00 - and i have a lot of kind of routines i
16:02 - do daily to make sure i'm getting my fun
16:04 - in for example i don't book any meetings
16:06 - usually unless i really have to
16:08 - before 10 am because in the mornings
16:10 - what i like to do is get up
16:11 - have a coffee watch some youtube videos
16:13 - maybe play some video games i've been
16:15 - playing chess recently that's something
16:16 - i really like doing and i'm not willing
16:18 - to give that up
16:19 - and if i don't do that i find myself
16:22 - craving that activity and that really
16:24 - does actually affect my productivity
16:26 - so even though you might think oh i'm
16:27 - spending an hour two hours having fun
16:29 - and enjoying myself
16:30 - that may actually be leading you to have
16:32 - more productivity
16:34 - and success in whatever you're doing so
16:35 - you have to really have the balance
16:37 - i can't tell you how to do this i just
16:38 - wanted to make sure i included this here
16:40 - because
16:41 - everything else i've said is kind of
16:42 - very you know robust go do this go be
16:44 - productive go work help yourself
16:46 - very disciplined right whereas this is
16:48 - kind of the opposite of that and it's
16:50 - saying you know what sometimes you can
16:51 - step back and sometimes it's fine to
16:52 - sleep the entire day
16:54 - maybe that is actually going to make you
16:55 - more productive and so for myself if i
16:57 - find myself burning out or i find myself
16:59 - not enjoying myself not being happy
17:01 - then what i'll often do is okay you know
17:03 - maybe it's actually worth my time to
17:04 - take a day off here and to just relax
17:06 - maybe i'm going to go hang out with my
17:07 - friends maybe i'm going to go out
17:09 - fishing
17:09 - whatever do something that i enjoy so
17:11 - that the next day i'm kind of in a
17:13 - better mindset and ready to actually
17:14 - work
17:15 - and get stuff done all right so with
17:17 - that said i think i'm going to end the
17:18 - video here
17:19 - hopefully you guys found these helpful

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody and welcome to another youtube video so in today's video i'm going to share with you five tips tricks to become more productive now these are not magic things that you can just go do and all of a sudden be the most productive human being these are just five kind of ideas philosophies that i've come up with over the past few years that have really worked well for me and allowed me to get a lot done in the time that i spend working this video is not at all going to be trying to tell you to work super hard go do you know 14 16 hours days that's not the point of this whatsoever it's how can you maximize what you get done in the time that you're working you guys know yourself you know your own lives you can pick how much time you want to work in a day and hopefully these kind of philosophies ideas tips whatever you want to call them will help you kind of realize what it is you need to do to actually get more done in a day now the reason i'm making this video is because a lot of you guys ask me all of the time tim i see you're a pretty young guy i know you are in school now you're doing youtube you're working for algo expert and other companies how do you get all this stuff done how do you find the motivation how do you actually just you know get all of this work done in one day it seems like a lot and well i'll try to answer that question in this video but the first thing i want to say here is that everyone is different right this stuff is not going to work for everybody this is just what worked for me i probably work a lot longer than most of you guys and there's pros and cons to doing that and so you can't really judge your productivity based on someone else you have to judge it on yourself are you more productive than you were yesterday that's really the only metric you should go be going based off of you can't look at some random person on the internet and be like oh i'm not as productive as them when in reality you have no idea what they do in a day what their schedule or time looks like and what they might be sacrificing to kind of get that productivity anyways sorry for the long intro let's get into the video after a quick word from our sponsor before we get started i need to thank the sponsor of this video which is alco expert algo expert is the best platform to use for preparing for your software engineering coding interviews and

get started using algo expert today by clicking the link in the description and using the code tech with tim for a discount on the platform alright so let's go ahead and dive in the first tip slash trick i have for you is to have a goal and actually to have multiple goals now this is extremely important and one of the reasons for this is it's very hard to work hard and be productive if you don't know why you're doing that right that's like pretty much anything if someone tells you to do something and it doesn't make sense to you you're much less likely to do it i remember as a kid all the time i would just not do what teachers told me because it wouldn't make sense what they were asking me to do and until someone explained to me why it was i needed to get something done or why i needed to do this then i would actually go ahead and do it now the same thing happens here in just general life when it comes to productivity let's say you're in a computer science major trying to pick something that's probably relatable for some of you and you guys are just lazy unproductive you're like oh i don't like this i don't want to do this one of the main reasons you're probably like that is because you don't actually know why it is you're doing this computer science major you haven't created those goals in your head and when i'm talking about goals i'm saying something like where do you want to be in 30 years where do you want to be in 25 years what's the point of getting a degree what's the point of this education do you know that do you have that reason kind of stored up in your brain are you thinking about that as you go and work towards this goal for a lot of people the answer is no and so you have to have goals to be able to become productive again you can't work on something very hard and be productive you don't know why it is that you're doing that so you either have to come up with the reasons even if they don't make you know the total complete sense but you have to convince yourself that what you're doing is worth it and once you do that then your brain kind of says okay it is worth it for me to stay up an extra hour and work on this it is a good use of my time to you know grind this and study this and get an a and well you have to have goals now i'm just picking a very kind of naive example which is school but let's put this to my youtube channel here the only reason why i've been able to grow this youtube channel is because the goal of mine has been okay i want to achieve financial freedom i want to be the best tech educator on the internet i have these very large goals and every day i analyze what i'm doing and i say am i working towards these goals and you know when i'm super tired and exhausted i wake up in the morning ready to film a video i say why am i filming this video it's because it's helping me achieve this goal if i didn't have these goals you're kind of just meaninglessly doing activities and it's very hard to justify especially when you're tired or demotivated why you should go and continue to do that and of course that's going to lead to a lack of productivity so it's hard to really articulate this but you can even think of this in a very large picture when it comes to organizations most organizations fail because they don't have a clear vision or kind of road map from the top of the organization have you ever been at a company where you're doing something but you don't know why you're doing it it's not leading towards the vision or the mission of the company those companies are usually not great places to work out yeah maybe you'll go in and kind of do your eight hours just to get paid but you're not motivated you're not excited you don't know why it is you're doing a task and you guys could probably relate to this in almost every area of life when someone asks you to do something but doesn't explain to you why and it doesn't make sense to you you're a lot less likely to want to go and do that thing because you don't know why it is that you're doing that and same thing when it comes to getting a degree same thing when it comes to you know staying up an extra hour at night to read whatever it is you have to have a goal and usually a large goal in mind so you can justify those activities so i could talk about this in an entire video just goal setting maybe i'll do that let me know if you guys want to see that i think that might be an interesting video but let's move on to the next point now hopefully you guys got the idea from that all right so the second point i have for you is much more of a mindset thing but this is to help your future self now you're going to notice that all these points and tips whatever are very related to each other and when i say help your future self what i'm talking about is to think of what you're doing as something that you're doing to help yourself in the future now to give you a really simple example let's say you get an assignment okay and this week maybe you're not super busy you have this maybe programming assignment let's say it's going to take you four or five hours to finish you could leave it till the very last minute you could do it the next day whatever but if you adopt the mindset of hey in the future i might not want to do this i might be tired i might want to go hang out with my friends right now i have a few hours why don't i just knock it out so that in the future i'm going to say oh thank god tim already did that assignment now i'm speaking in the third person but you know what i mean and this is a very rewarding thing because what ends up happening when you adopt this mayans and you say you know what i'm going to do this now so i don't have to do in the future so when i'm tired i can just sleep in that extra hour in the morning so i can go hang out with my friends life becomes just a lot more enjoyable you don't have any stress you don't have any deadlines you need to complete because you've helped yourself in the future you've said all right i know i have time now i'm in a state where i can finish this now let's get it done and then in the future i'm going to thank myself when i want to go to that party or i want to go and play video games or whatever because i don't have this kind of looming deadline and the stuff that i need to finish and this relieves stress a lot especially if you apply this to kind of a school scenario if you do all of your assignments immediately when you get them you just get stuff done when you're capable of getting it done and you don't waste time it's just a much better way to kind of go through school and go through life because you're not constantly stressed am i going to finish this am i going to have enough time am i going to have to do a 14 hour night you don't have to deal with that anymore and that's a huge mental load kind of relieved and that's the way that i really navigated school and was able to get all of the stuff that i did done was because i did it very early and i was never like grinding last minute to finish something because i just did it earlier in the week and i never had a deadline that i felt like i needed to hit so this is a very specific example with school but apply this to every single scenario even something like a degree okay it might suck for four years to go through school and you might be miserable and you might be broke but in four years are you going to thank yourself for getting this degree done maybe right you have to answer that question and so that's the way i always think about things i'm putting in a sacrifice now to help myself in the future and in the future i'm going to thank myself for putting in those long hours or working hard or being productive or whatever it may be so really just a mindset thing obviously much easier said than done but that's the way that i look at things and that's one of the ways i'm able to justify getting a lot done kind of in the present moment all right so the next point i have for you is another very important one if you get only one point from this list this is the one that i would recommend really kind of focusing on and this is to measure your productivity with outcome not time now this is so extremely important because time does not state how productive you were in a day what i mean by this is a lot of people think hey i went to class for four hours today or hey i went to my job for eight hours or i worked on this project for six hours and they measure their productivity in terms of hours spent that is not a good way to measure productivity because you can spend and waste hours in pretty much any way right what you should really be doing is looking at okay i spent this much time doing this today what was the outcome of that time what did i actually get done for example i can say i spent five hours working on this youtube video but if i only got done one youtube video in five hours was that productive right that was the outcome of my five hours spent if i had maybe two hours but i finished two videos when was i more productive when i finished two videos right so that's what you need to look at it's not how much time did you spend working in a day it's what did you get done in a day and are you happy with that outcome that's the way you have to look at things because if you look at it in terms of time inevitably you're not going to be the most productive in that time you're going to try to spend extra time doing things like going to uh you know maybe an extra class or like watching videos online or whatever that aren't actually a good use of your time and that are not leading you to be productive now the best real example of this i'd like to give is going to class in school now i'm not here to try to encourage anyone to just skip classes but for me what worked really well in school was going to about 20 of my classes that was actually the amount of class that i went to i probably skipped almost all of second year almost all of third year and only went to like absolutely mandatory classes and the reason for that was not because i just hated the professors and was just a lazy student it was because i knew that my time was better spent and i was more productive on my own on my computer reading the notes reading the textbook and self studying that's the way i learned that's what works best for me and so if i measured my time in terms of how much time i spent on school in a day i wouldn't have realized that because i would have thought spending four hours in lectures was me being productive when in reality i could achieve the same learning outcome in like an hour and a half on my own and so i would say i'm much more productive by staying home right or not going to class reading it myself than i am on going to class even though it's kind of this false sense of oh i spent three or four hours must have meant i had a good productive day right same thing when you go to the gym you can go to the gym for an hour and a half and do the same number of exercises that i do in half an hour who was really more productive if you say well i went to the gym for an hour and a half that means i'm productive that's the wrong way to look at it you have to say how much did i get done in that time that i was there so time is not not important you do have to measure time spent but it's really more focused on the outcome and that's why you see you know all kinds of entrepreneurs and random people saying you know i only work eight hours a week only work seven hours a week well if they can get done in eight hours what you get done in 40 who is being more productive right that's what you really have to think about so anyways that's that point right there now let's move on to the next one all right so point number four something's a little bit more mainstream and obvious but this is to plan far in advance when i say far in advance i'm not talking about years i'm talking about months right understand what weeks in the month or what days of the month you're going to have that are much busier than others because this allows you to balance your time now for me what allows me to be productive is working relatively the same amount of time every single day i do not want to work 12 hours in one day and zero in the next i would much rather work six in each day and have time each day for fun enjoyment whatever right i would much rather do that maybe that's just me but personally i find that a much better way to be productive it i find you're much more productive working you know five six hours a day than trying to do 12 even though yes you could probably do 12. and so if you plan far in advance you're able to actually kind of manage your time and what you get done and your productivity based on when you know stuff is going to be really busy and when you're not going to have as much time for example next week i'm going away i'm doing you know a weeklong vacation i'm going fishing fun fact so what i've had to do this week is i've had to work a little bit harder but the thing is if i only knew about that this week i would have to grind really really hard to prepare a bunch of videos from when i'm gone but i've known that i'm going to be going away for three months and so over the past three months i've been slowly trying to do you know a little bit extra just to make sure that i didn't have a super heavy week the week before i went away and i could kind of balance my time and i didn't have to do a huge 12hour grind i didn't have to be miserable and that allowed me to stay productive throughout this entire time so that's like a small example but when it comes to school one thing i always do is at the beginning of the semester i spend you know an hour or two looking through all the syllabuses all the course content and i go and i write every single deadline every single assignment in my calendar so i know when i look at this high level overview oh next week's going to be super busy i better do a little bit of extra work right now to make sure i'm not going to have to grind that week and that just helps me become more productive allows me to not be miserable and you know tapping out of exhaustion at the 14 hour mark studying for a midterm and that's just really a great way to kind of you know balance your time and make sure you're not overworking yourself while staying productive so there's not much more that i can really go through here the whole point at least for me and planning far in advance is that you're prepared for what's coming up and you can do extra work now to make sure you're not going to have a huge workload in the future that you're not going to be able to sustain anyways let's move on to the next point all right so the last point i have for you this one is very important and this is to make sure you are allocating time for fun and protecting that time so in your calendar in your daily schedule in whatever way you want to do it i can't tell you how to do this you need to make sure that you have a set time either every day every week every month whatever it may be to do things that you enjoy to make you happy to increase your mental health and to make sure you're not burning yourself out right one of the big problems with productivity and even videos like this is that it kind of tells people that you have to be miserable and you have to go and grind and work super hard and know you don't have time for this and you can't go and hang out with your friends that's absolutely false through the entire time that i've been doing all of this stuff i've made sure that i can go and spend a weekend hanging out with my friends or i can take a week off at any point in time or i can spend three or four hours at night playing video games because those are things that i enjoy doing and i'm not willing to give those up just to call myself more productive there's actually a ton of research and evidence and books and stuff related to how happiness and fun actually affect the success of someone in their career and you can probably guess what i'm going to say but the happier people are often more successful and so if you're thinking about this in a sheer productivity lens then you have to say okay it actually might be very productive for me to spend two hours tonight just doing nothing just hanging out relaxing you know recharging for the next day and that's the way that i think about it and i have a lot of kind of routines i do daily to make sure i'm getting my fun in for example i don't book any meetings usually unless i really have to before 10 am because in the mornings what i like to do is get up have a coffee watch some youtube videos maybe

really does actually affect my productivity so even though you might think oh i'm spending an hour two hours having fun and enjoying myself that may actually be leading you to have more productivity and success in whatever you're doing so you have to really have the balance i can't tell you how to do this i just wanted to make sure i included this here because everything else i've said is kind of very you know robust go do this go be productive go work help yourself very disciplined right whereas this is kind of the opposite of that and it's saying you know what sometimes you can step back and sometimes it's fine to sleep the entire day maybe that is actually going to make you more productive and so for myself if i find myself burning out or i find myself not enjoying myself not being happy then what i'll often do is okay you know maybe it's actually worth my time to take a day off here and to just relax maybe i'm going to go hang out with my friends maybe i'm going to go out fishing whatever do something that i enjoy so that the next day i'm kind of in a better mindset and ready to actually work and get stuff done all right so with that said i think i'm going to end the video here hopefully you guys found these helpful i'd love to hear your thoughts on them in the comments down below does this stuff work for you do you guys have tips and tricks you want to share with people please do leave them down there regardless i hope you guys enjoyed if you did make sure that like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in the next one
