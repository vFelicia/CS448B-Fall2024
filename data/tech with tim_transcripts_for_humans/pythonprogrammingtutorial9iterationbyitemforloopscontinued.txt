00:00 - hey guys welcome back today we're doing
00:03 - the ninth video in my Python programming
00:06 - series and today we're going to be
00:07 - talking more more about four loops so a
00:10 - more advanced type of four loop in terms
00:12 - of iterating through a list so you may
00:15 - remember a few videos ago we talked
00:17 - about for loops and I mentioned that
00:18 - there are two main type of for loops
00:20 - that we can use and the one that we
00:22 - talked about there was looks like this
00:25 - so we had 4x in range and then we had a
00:28 - range like this and we simply and print
00:32 - it out B numbers like this so we see we
00:35 - got one two ten just like that okay so
00:39 - that was the for loop we talked about
00:40 - there but the one we're going to be
00:42 - doing today is a little bit different so
00:43 - I'll leave this here for an example so
00:45 - the first thing we need to do is we need
00:47 - to make a list because we're actually
00:48 - going to be iterating through every item
00:51 - or every element in the list so again
00:54 - I'm just going to do the same example I
00:55 - use in the other video with fruits and
00:56 - I'm going to make it equal to we're
00:59 - going to have apples pears and
01:04 - strawberries strawberries just like that
01:07 - okay so we have our fruits here and now
01:10 - we're going to get right into the syntax
01:12 - for this new for loop so we're going to
01:14 - do for and then any variable name we'd
01:17 - like so in this case I'm going to use
01:18 - fruit and then we're going to use the
01:20 - keyword in once again and then instead
01:23 - of typing range this time we're going to
01:25 - type the name of the list we want to
01:27 - iterate through so in this case it's
01:29 - going to be called fruits just like that
01:32 - and now we can print out the fruit sorry
01:38 - the fruit just like that so pretty much
01:42 - what is going to happen is we have a
01:44 - list with three items in it we have
01:46 - apples pears and strawberries now we
01:50 - want to print every fruit in that list
01:53 - so we do that by saying for fruit in
01:56 - fruits meaning for every item in fruits
01:59 - and so one two and three items we simply
02:03 - want to print out that fruit so this
02:05 - loop is going to run three times and
02:07 - we're just going to print out every
02:08 - fruit inside of the list just
02:12 - like this and there you go we have
02:14 - apples pears and strawberries just like
02:17 - that so yeah that's pretty much how you
02:21 - can iterate through a list and same
02:23 - thing if I want to add more elements to
02:25 - the list so I 890 just like that again
02:30 - it'll just simply print out all of the
02:32 - items in the list now why might we do
02:36 - this you say well there's a few reasons
02:39 - we may want to iterate by item rather
02:42 - than by indices so the other one the in
02:45 - range is known as iterating by in this
02:48 - year by index well this one is known as
02:50 - iterating by item so there's a few
02:53 - reasons we might want to do this but the
02:54 - first one is if we only want to print
02:56 - something out if it's a certain value so
02:58 - we just want to check through all the
03:00 - items in the list and see if they are
03:01 - certain value and if they are then we're
03:03 - going to print it out we're going to do
03:05 - something specific to that item so in
03:07 - this case I'm going to say if root is
03:09 - equal to for example pairs then I want
03:14 - to print out pairs so we'll just print
03:18 - out fruit but if it's not equal to pairs
03:21 - so anything else then I will print out
03:26 - not pairs like that so this is an
03:30 - example of how we can look through every
03:33 - item in the list and simply check if it
03:36 - is a certain value and then if it is
03:38 - we're going to print it to the screen so
03:39 - let's try this and we say we have not
03:41 - pairs pairs and then followed by a few
03:44 - more not pairs so that's a good way to
03:47 - do it by item otherwise we can still do
03:50 - this using indices it's just a little
03:52 - more complicated not as efficient so we
03:55 - could do 4x in range and then in this
03:59 - case we'll do 0 and 6 because we have to
04:04 - do it 6 times because there's 6 items in
04:06 - the list and then we'll put a colon and
04:09 - then we'll say the same thing so except
04:12 - this time we're gonna say if fruits
04:15 - followed by the square brackets and then
04:17 - X because this is going to be our
04:19 - indicee equals equals pair
04:22 - then we want to print fruit or fruits X
04:28 - oops otherwise we'll print not a pear
04:35 - just like we did in the other loop not a
04:39 - pear
04:39 - okay so we'll run that and we see we get
04:42 - it twice just because I had two for
04:43 - loops there so it does work the exact
04:46 - same way
04:46 - except you can see that this one takes
04:49 - longer to write because we actually have
04:52 - to put the list name followed by the
04:54 - square brackets whereas in this loop all
04:56 - we have to do is simply type in fruit
04:59 - because it's automatically going through
05:01 - the list another reason - we may want to
05:04 - do that is because in this case we had
05:06 - to actually see how many items were in
05:08 - the list by counting and then we had to
05:12 - put that number in whereas here it'll
05:13 - just stop at the end of the list
05:15 - automatically now we could do this so le
05:19 - and this is a new word so I'm just
05:21 - showing this now this means length and
05:24 - then inside we can put something like a
05:26 - string or a list so in this case I'm
05:29 - going to put the length of fruits and
05:31 - that would give us a value of 6 and
05:34 - you'll see if I just get rid of this
05:39 - then it'll work the same way again
05:42 - by using the lengths of fruits okay so
05:46 - that is how to iterate through a list by
05:50 - item I hope you enjoyed if you did

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome back today we're doing the ninth video in my Python programming series and today we're going to be talking more more about four loops so a more advanced type of four loop in terms of iterating through a list so you may remember a few videos ago we talked about for loops and I mentioned that there are two main type of for loops that we can use and the one that we talked about there was looks like this so we had 4x in range and then we had a range like this and we simply and print it out B numbers like this so we see we got one two ten just like that okay so that was the for loop we talked about there but the one we're going to be doing today is a little bit different so I'll leave this here for an example so the first thing we need to do is we need to make a list because we're actually going to be iterating through every item or every element in the list so again I'm just going to do the same example I use in the other video with fruits and I'm going to make it equal to we're going to have apples pears and strawberries strawberries just like that okay so we have our fruits here and now we're going to get right into the syntax for this new for loop so we're going to do for and then any variable name we'd like so in this case I'm going to use fruit and then we're going to use the keyword in once again and then instead of typing range this time we're going to

if we only want to print something out if it's a certain value so we just want to check through all the items in the list and see if they are certain value and if they are then we're going to print it

indicee equals equals pair then we want to print fruit or fruits X oops otherwise we'll print not a pear just like we did in the other loop not a pear okay so we'll run that and we see we get it twice
